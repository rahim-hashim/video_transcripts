# Joe Rogan Experience #1875 - Dave Smith
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5.0s)]
*  But that's good. I think that's what makes you so good at what you do. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=10.0s)]
*  Yeah, the last thing you want to do is be like super confident and wrong. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=15.0s)]
*  Yeah, right, exactly. You want to at least be always questioning. Like always maintaining that possibility. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=20.0s)]
*  I could be wrong about everything. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=26.0s)]
*  When you start, when you go over stuff, like when you talk about libertarian ideas, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=28.0s)]
*  and you look at the way the government is run now, do you run through that thought process? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=33.0s)]
*  Like maybe the only way to do it is the way that we're doing it right now. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=38.0s)]
*  Yeah, I try my best to always do that. I mean, I'm guilty of not doing it, but I try my best to always be like, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=43.0s)]
*  okay, well maybe theoretically they know something I don't know, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=49.0s)]
*  which kind of means like this is the best way to do it, or maybe I'm just wrong and my theoretical model couldn't work, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=54.0s)]
*  and this is the best, but try to give like the toughest arguments against it, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=59.0s)]
*  and then go like, okay, but we still didn't need to kill a million Iraqis. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=64.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like we still didn't need to do this, or we still at least didn't need to, but I try my best. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=67.0s)]
*  It's dangerous because the further into it I get, the more convinced I am that I'm right, and then that's also dangerous, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=74.0s)]
*  because I'm not as insecure about it as I used to be. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=80.0s)]
*  It feels like the only way, like the system is broken. Everyone sort of agrees that. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=82.0s)]
*  And the only way to do it right would be to create a more ethical, moral, logical system [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=89.0s)]
*  that's actually based on constitutional rights and how the government is supposed to be [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=96.0s)]
*  in terms of like the kind of power they're supposed to have versus what they're always constantly trying to acquire. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=102.0s)]
*  But if you did that, how much would you have to blow the system up, and how would we run things? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=107.0s)]
*  Like what period of vulnerability would we have while we're trying to reestablish a new system, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=113.0s)]
*  and how would we know if the system could even work correctly without being influenced by money and power [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=118.0s)]
*  and all the shit that's fucked it up for what we've got right now? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=125.0s)]
*  It's a daunting challenge. I think that what Ron Paul used to always say was basically, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=129.0s)]
*  I mean these are my words, not his, but it was basically his plan, was he goes, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=135.0s)]
*  end all the worst shit first. End all the most evil shit first. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=138.0s)]
*  So the first thing is like stop bombing third world countries, stop locking people in jail for victimless crimes, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=143.0s)]
*  stop bailing out billionaires and corporations and stuff, like stop that first. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=148.0s)]
*  You don't start with like, well okay if there's a vulnerable population that's like dependent on this government program, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=153.0s)]
*  get rid of it tomorrow. So like you try to do that, and then the more of the corruption that you roll back, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=159.0s)]
*  you're going to see less wealth being extracted from regular American people and go into special interests, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=165.0s)]
*  kind of build that up over time. But it's a challenging thing to go from this insane system to something less insane is tough. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=171.0s)]
*  And throughout human history usually there's a pretty rough period in between there. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=180.0s)]
*  It's usually not a smooth transition. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=185.0s)]
*  Well it's kind of fascinating when you think that this is the only country that has been really established [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=187.0s)]
*  as like a colony that went on to take over the world. And it did it inside of 300 years, which is pretty fucking wild. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=193.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the most wild part is the time span. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=202.0s)]
*  It's pretty crazy. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=205.0s)]
*  Because going from being a republic to an empire has happened before, but we're the most powerful empire in world history. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=206.0s)]
*  At least in terms of like raw power, like the technology, the level of wealth, all that shit. And we did it in a very short time. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=214.0s)]
*  And some of the most unexceptional people are the ones who want to run it, which is so weird. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=221.0s)]
*  When you see like the squad, did you see that debate that she was having with those bankers where they were talking about eliminating fossil fuels? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=227.0s)]
*  She made me root for the bankers, Joe. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=235.0s)]
*  I was rooting for the bankers. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=237.0s)]
*  It is quite a feat to get me to say, you know, I think the head of Goldman Sachs is making a good point. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=238.0s)]
*  Imagine that she was dangling the carrot of the $10,000 we gave back in student loan debt forgiveness, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=243.0s)]
*  that those people are going to have bank accounts. And those people that got that free money are going to take that free money out of your bank account. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=250.0s)]
*  That was the immediate thing that she dangled, which lets you know some of the incentive involved in giving student loan debt. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=257.0s)]
*  It's not really that we want to help these people. It's that now we will have influence over those people for voting. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=265.0s)]
*  Oh, this was clearly like just throwing a carrot like pre-midterm elections. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=273.0s)]
*  How about only $10,000? How about all of it? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=277.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=279.0s)]
*  If you're going to really absolve student loan debt, if someone's $700,000 in the hole or whatever, what's like worst case scenario? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=280.0s)]
*  If someone goes to med school, someone gets a PhD. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=286.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, if they do all of that, probably $300,000, $400,000 at least. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=288.0s)]
*  Yeah, and then it compounds with interest over the decades. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=291.0s)]
*  Like I was reading this story about this woman who took out $150,000 in student loans and she hasn't been able to pay them back, and now she's $250,000 in the hole. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=294.0s)]
*  Yeah, geez. And they're the most vicious type of loans too. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=302.0s)]
*  Of course, because you never got it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=304.0s)]
*  Like it's easier to get out of credit card debt. You know, you can't even get out through bankruptcy. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=305.0s)]
*  Oh, it's the only one you can get out. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=308.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=309.0s)]
*  And they're having their social security docked. People who've made it to the end of life. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=310.0s)]
*  They're relying on government assistance, right? It's essentially government assistance that we pay for. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=315.0s)]
*  And they're getting that docked to pay for student loan debt. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=321.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's such a fucked up system. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=325.0s)]
*  Like I'm completely against student loan debt, you know, forgiving the debt, just because I think it's like, it's just, you're just punishing the taxpayers for the debt of, in many cases, a more privileged group. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=327.0s)]
*  It's like the people who didn't go to college now have to bail out the people who did, you know? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=342.0s)]
*  But man, it is such a fucked up system that they trap these 18-year-old kids into signing up for it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=347.0s)]
*  It's ruthless. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=352.0s)]
*  And that no one at the colleges even, like the fact, I mean obviously the politicians are like soulless and the bankers are just trying to make money, but that no one in the university ever has the basic human decency to look at one of these kids who goes, hey, you know you're spending 150 grand on a gender studies major? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=353.0s)]
*  Just think about that. Think about whether or not this is really a good idea. They just go, oh, okay, we'll take the money. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=372.0s)]
*  Well, all they're hoping is they're going to get a job in a university. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=379.0s)]
*  Right. It's a Ponzi scheme, basically. You'll teach this to other people until no one's signing up for this anymore. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=382.0s)]
*  You'll learn useless shit that isn't even true, and then you'll teach it to other people who want to learn this useless shit to teach it to other people. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=387.0s)]
*  And let's just hope we keep getting new investors into this thing until it all goes belly up. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=395.0s)]
*  What's really wild is then most, especially tech companies, they're so progressive and so liberal, and they're kind of trapped in that ideology which can hamper what they want to do and what they're allowed to do with their company because you get activists who are employees. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=400.0s)]
*  So your employees become, and they go straight from universities where they're indoctrinated into this ideology, and then they permeate these tech companies. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=418.0s)]
*  And some of them are fucked. Some of them are realizing it, and they're pushing back, and they go, stop, stop, stop. You guys are killing our stock. You're fucking up the business. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=427.0s)]
*  It's a giant loss in terms of whether or not it's good for the overall company. It's a giant loss for some of them. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=437.0s)]
*  Like Netflix. Netflix took a giant hit after all that Chappelle shit. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=444.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, of course. And if you think about with the tech censorship stuff, if you think about in 2014, 2015, this basically didn't exist. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=449.0s)]
*  This isn't that long ago that you kind of could say whatever you wanted to. Yeah, I'll have a little bit, thank you. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=460.0s)]
*  You could say whatever you wanted to on Twitter. I mean, I remember like really wild people saying crazy shit on Twitter, and there was never even a thought like, oh, you're going to get kicked off for saying this. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=466.0s)]
*  It was just like, it's the internet. That's Twitter. YouTube. You could say what you wanted to. Twitter has hardcore porn. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=476.0s)]
*  Well, that's the other thing that's very weird about what is allowed and what's not allowed. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=482.0s)]
*  Which I'm for. I'm not saying that they should censor hardcore porn. If you want to follow a porn star and they want to post pictures of them fucking and videos of them fucking. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=486.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't care. Who cares? Well, I just I also, yeah, I'm completely against any of the censorship. I think it's an awful slippery slope to go down. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=494.0s)]
*  It's a giant slippery slope and it shouldn't be navigated by people who are again indoctrinated into this system that they get straight out of universities and they're locked into these progressive ideas. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=501.0s)]
*  Yeah, but I agree with all that. But I mean, so the point I was just making is when you talk about like the bottom line. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=511.0s)]
*  So you could see why originally back then why they weren't kicking people off of their platforms is because like, well, there's no incentive for them to kick people off the platform. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=517.0s)]
*  The whole point is they want people to be on their platform. There'd certainly be no incentive to kick like really popular people off of their platform. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=526.0s)]
*  That's how they get people on to their platform. And it is there is a lot of truth to the fact that a lot of these kids coming out of the universities came in with this woke ideology. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=534.0s)]
*  But there was also like tremendous pressure from the top coming down. So like what really, really sparked all of it was in 2016 once Trump won, then Congress hold all the heads of the big tech companies in front of Congress and basically threaten the shit out of them. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=543.0s)]
*  That like, look, Donald Trump won. And here's why he won. He won because of fake news and Russian interference in social media. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=560.0s)]
*  And so you guys got to do something to crack down on them. And you see that to this day. Did you see Alex Berenson like shared the evidence? I mean, he was able to get back on Twitter through that lawsuit. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=567.0s)]
*  But he shared that the White House specifically asked about Alex Berenson. Yeah, why are they still on Twitter? We read it. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=577.0s)]
*  We read the quotes and who quoted them on the podcast. Now, technically speaking, they didn't say kick Alex Berenson off of Twitter. What are you doing about it? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=583.0s)]
*  But they did go, what are you doing? It's like this mafia shit almost. So that's, you know, I guess you could kind of say it's not exactly a violation of the First Amendment because they just asked. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=593.0s)]
*  But it's kind of like someone robbing you by just asking for your money in an aggressive way. Another more important point. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=602.0s)]
*  He was right. That is pretty important. This is a very important point, which is why he's back on. Yeah, he was stite. He was citing studies. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=610.0s)]
*  He was using the Israeli data. He was talking to scientists that were willing to go outside of the company line. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=619.0s)]
*  And there's quite a few of them. These are legit people. So what he was getting in trouble for with the government was being correct. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=627.0s)]
*  Yeah, which is really crazy because you're talking about a health pandemic. So you're talking about decisions that could possibly either save people's lives, ruin people's lives, save people's health, ruin people's health. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=635.0s)]
*  The only way you're going to know what's what is if you get accurate data. So if there's a guy who's talking about data, but the data is inconvenient to whatever the narrative is, if it's because it's inconvenient because the pharmaceutical companies fund 75 percent of all the ads on television and how many campaigns and how much how much money they have invested in this. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=648.0s)]
*  And does the government actually have a piece of the Moderna vaccine? Isn't that? Well, there was so Rand Paul. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=668.0s)]
*  I don't know if you saw one of these moments where he was months ago now, but where he was grilling Fauci and one of those Rand Paul versus Fauci moments. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=674.0s)]
*  And he said that they found out through a Freedom of Information Act that it was something like one hundred thirty five million dollars in royalties had been paid out to scientists on the NIH at the NIH from pharmaceutical companies. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=681.0s)]
*  And he asks Fauci straight up. He goes, have you received any money? Will you disclose all the money you've received? And Fauci in a roundabout way, you know, is like, well, Dr. Paul, I think I may have had one royalty for very small money, but now I don't need the law doesn't require me to reveal that. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=694.0s)]
*  So like, hmm, don't you think like shouldn't we know that? Shouldn't we at least be able to know like how much money does Fauci make from Pfizer and Moderna? Because that seems like a tiny conflict of interest, a giant conflict of interest. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=711.0s)]
*  But but to your point with Alex Barons and stuff like look, even if he was wrong, which he was right a lot more than he was wrong, put his track record up against Fauci's track record over the last couple of years. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=724.0s)]
*  He was right way more than Fauci was. But even if he was wrong, theoretically, he was making data based arguments. Yeah, like he wasn't like he what they justified like tech censorship with like, well, what if someone's just like a Nazi preaching hate or what if someone spreading intentionally spreading false information to change an election? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=734.0s)]
*  But he wasn't doing any of that. No, he was just like a guy who was worked for the New York Times. He was just a guy who was presenting sound arguments. Even if he got some things wrong, the idea that we would shut that down is a really creepy, very creepy thing. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=753.0s)]
*  And then that it's coming from the White House, it's coming directly from them. This isn't just like some random, you know, like it's not just that. Oh, there's a company with a woke ideology who doesn't think you should be allowed to do this on their platform like the kind of almost the libertarian argument that some people make. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=768.0s)]
*  Well, they're a private company. They can do what they want to do. But that's not what's happening here. Here you have the government who's saying silence our number one critic to our policies of lockdowns and vaccine mandates and all this stuff. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=783.0s)]
*  Right. And they also affected that Hunter Biden story. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=795.0s)]
*  Well, that's the other thing. What? And what? I mean, wasn't that pretty incredible, dude? What Zuckerberg said to you? It was look, he you asked him about the Hunter Biden story. Yeah. And his first response to you was, well, here's what happened. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=798.0s)]
*  The FBI told us there was going to be this this misinformation, this Russian misinformation coming. Now, I'm not saying the FBI told him specifically you have to turn down the Hunter Biden story. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=814.0s)]
*  But when you asked him about the Hunter Biden story, the first thing he said was, well, the FBI. So clearly, at least he took it that way. And then when the story came out, the FBI and the CIA and all these intelligence people are saying this has all the earmarks of Russian disinformation. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=826.0s)]
*  Yeah. And Joe Biden's bragging about this at the time. So if nothing else, they at least clearly sent a signal to these companies that like this is the one. This is what we were talking about. Now, could you imagine if you're these people at Facebook? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=843.0s)]
*  What do you do? Like, if you get that phone call or whatever it is, email, probably a fucking person to person meeting when they put your phone in a basket. Right. Really? What is it? What is it like? And what do you do? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=856.0s)]
*  And do you go into a deep dive and try to find out what's legit and what's not legit? Do you go and interview the people from the New York Post that wrote the article? What do you do? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=871.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a weird situation where they're kind of asking you to have this level of expertise in a thing that is not your area of expertise. Right. Or do you just have some faith in the system and go, well, I mean, this is the FBI telling me this. And if they're saying it's Russian misinformation, then I don't want to put it out there if that could affect the results of an election. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=880.0s)]
*  Imagine if it is. Right. Imagine if it is. Imagine if you've been warned and then it is Russian disinformation, but you also allow people to share it and it turns out to actually affect the election. Yeah. Well, that's- It swings the election the other way. Trump wins again. And then we find out it's a hoax. And we find out who really is in cahoots with Russia. That was the big fear, right? And that's not a narrative that you didn't hear. Like, you heard constantly he was in bed with Russia. You heard constantly Russia had stuff on him. Russia has this, you know, this is a big fear. Right? And that's not a narrative that you didn't hear. Like, you heard constantly he was in bed with Russia. You heard constantly Russia had stuff on him. Russia has this, you know, this is a big fear. Right? And that's not a narrative that you didn't hear. Like, you heard constantly he was in bed with Russia. You heard constantly Russia had [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=900.0s)]
*  this, Russia has that, he did this, people peed on him. Yeah. Right. And no matter- And [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=930.0s)]
*  there's an interesting thing like that because- And there's polling that shows this. Like, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=935.6s)]
*  I forget exactly what it is, but it's a very large percentage of Democrats, Democrat voters [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=939.4s)]
*  still believe Donald Trump was in bed with Russia, even though the investigation found [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=943.8s)]
*  no evidence that there was any conspiracy or anything like that. And in fact, anyone paying [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=947.76s)]
*  attention to it. The whole thing was just completely orchestrated to box Donald Trump [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=951.36s)]
*  in. Yeah. Again, I'm not a Trump supporter if anyone needs that disclaimer, but I'm just [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=956.24s)]
*  saying objectively, he was framed for treason, essentially, for being a traitor to his country, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=961.04s)]
*  working with Russia involved in a conspiracy to change the election results of 2016. Also, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=967.76s)]
*  and then there was no public apology once the investigations were over. There was no [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=974.12s)]
*  exoneration publicly. No, they just kind of in the last year of his administration stopped [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=980.76s)]
*  talking about it as much, never basically acknowledged that we had been saying Trump-Russia [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=985.4s)]
*  collusion for all this time. After the report fell apart, they moved immediately over to [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=989.4s)]
*  the Ukraine gate thing, which is very interesting given the context of everything going on now. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=994.12s)]
*  And then they just pulled it up again in the presidential election of 2020 when this laptop [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=999.52s)]
*  came out and they were like, oh, this is Russia again. Seems like that old thing. And it worked. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1005.04s)]
*  The thing is there is Russian disinformation, right? There's that too. Yeah. How the fuck [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1009.52s)]
*  do you know if your Twitter or Facebook, and I'm not exonering them for what they did, right? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1014.92s)]
*  They shouldn't have done it. I don't believe in censorship, especially when it comes to censoring [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1020.1999999999999s)]
*  a story that's from the second oldest newspaper in the fucking country. It's kind of crazy. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1024.3999999999999s)]
*  Like they're journalists, right? Whatever you might think of the New York Post and their funny [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1028.96s)]
*  headlines, they're essentially journalists. Yes. When they print something like this, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1033.6399999999999s)]
*  supposed to think first about where is it coming from? Think first about what's the [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1038.28s)]
*  ramifications of censoring this? What if it's accurate? I don't think anybody thought that. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1048.08s)]
*  I think the orange man scared the fuck out of everybody and they all acted irrationally. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1052.6399999999999s)]
*  And I think that's one of the things that broke mass media, mainstream media in terms [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1057.0s)]
*  of like television media and news. And it was just this hate for Trump was so overwhelming. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1061.28s)]
*  It's like you had to say that he was bad no matter what the story was. He pissed off a lot [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1067.52s)]
*  of people in an unbelievable way. But he also, I mean, he really pissed off people in like the [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1072.8799999999999s)]
*  intelligence agencies and people at very high levels for a bunch of different reasons. But [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1079.36s)]
*  like that stuff, it's like the same thing with the Alex Berenson thing. It's like, okay, but then you [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1084.68s)]
*  censored that story and you turned out to be wrong and they turned out to be right. They were [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1089.12s)]
*  telling the truth. And so now while you in theory may have been correcting for this one mistake, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1093.6s)]
*  which was a Russian misinformation could sway an election. What ended up happening was that the [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1098.12s)]
*  intelligence community interfered in the election and that they did not allow this story. The [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1103.8s)]
*  intelligence agencies and big tech interfered in the 2020 election. They silenced this story, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1111.08s)]
*  which was a newsworthy story, no matter how much weight you put into it, whether it's, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1117.48s)]
*  is it the, should it change your vote that the son of the president, then former vice president, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1121.6399999999999s)]
*  is clearly selling his last name for political, you know, his political influence to make money [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1128.9199999999998s)]
*  from foreign governments. I don't know how much you, how big a deal you should think that is, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1135.1599999999999s)]
*  but that is a story. That's something that if someone broke that, that's a story there. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1139.6399999999999s)]
*  And then there were questions about what did Biden know about this? Was he getting kickbacks [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1143.72s)]
*  from that? The Bobolinski, something like that, I think was a Hunter Biden's partner. He testified [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1148.84s)]
*  or not testified, but he was interviewed by the FBI. We just found this out last month that he [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1154.92s)]
*  was interviewed by the FBI and told them this, told them that yes, I've met with Joe Biden several [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1159.56s)]
*  times. He knew about all these business dealings while Joe Biden is claiming I've never talked to [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1164.2s)]
*  my son about his business. This is at least worthy to print this story and to have Twitter [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1167.96s)]
*  shut down one of the biggest newspapers in the country and then, and then like make it so you [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1173.8s)]
*  couldn't share the link and up. And then Facebook, as Zuckerberg said, I don't know, lowered the [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1178.44s)]
*  signal in a significant way, I think was the way he put it. I don't remember what he said, the way [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1184.52s)]
*  he said it, but essentially he admitted that there's some complex shadow banning type mechanism that's [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1189.16s)]
*  in place for information, you know, and fucking the whole thing's so complicated and I do not envy [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1196.76s)]
*  them at all. Imagine being someone at Facebook and the FBI tells you that or being someone at [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1205.16s)]
*  Twitter. What the fuck are you supposed to do? Tell the FBI to go fuck itself? You know how [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1211.24s)]
*  fucking scary that would be? Yeah, yeah. And that, and even if you, if you look at the way that the [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1215.32s)]
*  the Congress talked to him when they hauled him in front of Congress several times, I mean, they [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1220.04s)]
*  like really kind of shake him down. They're like, what are you doing about this? What are you doing [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1224.2s)]
*  about that? How are you making sure that, and imagine the task of making sure you create a [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1228.3600000000001s)]
*  platform where people can speak to each other and you now have the task of making sure they're all [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1232.92s)]
*  being honest. How the fuck do you do that? It's an insane thing and I really do think that obviously [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1237.72s)]
*  there's costs to everything, but the only obvious like human answer here is like, well look, we [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1243.8s)]
*  believe in the spirit of free speech or we don't. Like people can say things and then if you believe [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1250.12s)]
*  in democracy, which everyone claims to, right, they all say the reason they hate Trump is because [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1255.0s)]
*  he denied democracy or he's a threat to democracy. Well then you have to believe in the ability of [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1259.2399999999998s)]
*  voters to like make a determination for themselves of like what's what and if they can't then the [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1264.52s)]
*  whole project doesn't work anyway. But they're like these people, we've been lying to them for [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1269.9599999999998s)]
*  so long and they're so dumb. We can't let them run things. We can't let them just vote, just regular [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1273.1599999999999s)]
*  vote. Well it's like I see people up here, it's like um because all the people who are like selling [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1278.4399999999998s)]
*  the the war in in Ukraine right now and how we have to send more weapons in and we have to crack [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1282.84s)]
*  down harder on on Russia and be more involved in the war. It's like all the same people who sold the [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1287.3999999999999s)]
*  war in Iraq. I mean not all of them but a whole bunch of them are like the exact same people. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1291.7199999999998s)]
*  They're just people who sell war. Yeah and and you're like you and those same people were [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1295.7199999999998s)]
*  complaining about misinformation and they're like the ones who sold the war in Iraq and then they go [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1299.8799999999999s)]
*  okay remember how I told you that Saddam Hussein was in bed with Osama bin Laden and he had nukes [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1304.1999999999998s)]
*  that he was gonna detonate in Kansas. Well let me tell you what's going on now. You're like how do [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1308.12s)]
*  you get to tell me what's going on now? How are you even here? This is precisely what they warned [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1312.52s)]
*  about like when when Eisenhower gave that speech. It's precisely what he was warning about. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1319.08s)]
*  We're warning about undue influence and that there's a whole business behind war now. Right. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1325.7199999999998s)]
*  And they want to go to war. So he Eisenhower basically said that because it during World War [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1330.9199999999998s)]
*  II we built up this arms industry that has never been built up before and now you have these [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1336.2s)]
*  companies and that that's he coined the term the military industrial complex and you see this all [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1343.0800000000002s)]
*  over the place in in Washington DC man there are like these think tanks that get funded by the weapons [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1347.72s)]
*  manufacturers and then those think tanks come up with pieces about why we need to go fight a war [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1354.44s)]
*  and then they go and lobby the politicians to support some other war. It's like it's it's yeah [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1360.28s)]
*  it's something out of like a crazy movie and you could see that same thing in response to disease. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1366.84s)]
*  Oh yeah exactly. The pharmaceutical companies get involved the response to disease is always [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1371.96s)]
*  their pharmaceutical products. It's never lifestyle and health changes. What's one of the one of the [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1376.84s)]
*  best videos of Fauci is early on before the pandemic kicked off where he's saying just lose [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1383.0s)]
*  weight. You don't need a mask. It's not going to work. Just don't drink don't smoke try to take [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1389.0s)]
*  care of yourself. That's the most important thing like where'd all that go. Well that's not [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1394.44s)]
*  convenient to pharmaceutical companies and it's also lumping everybody physically into the same [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1398.6s)]
*  boat in the same category of risk is so crazy and that's what's really freaking people out [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1405.32s)]
*  because they're trying to do it to little children because they're trying to do that now to little [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1410.52s)]
*  children when there's significant risk of myocarditis. It's a real thing. We know we know [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1413.88s)]
*  it's a thing. These goddamn commercials that you see where they're talking about little kids and [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1418.12s)]
*  myocarditis on television like when when was that an issue. You're trying to pretend that this was [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1421.32s)]
*  an issue before. This was not an issue that you needed to advertise on television the risk of [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1426.76s)]
*  myocarditis in children and just give them some medicine and then they're going to grow up and be [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1431.56s)]
*  happy and healthy like you don't even fucking know that because you don't know the extent of the heart [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1435.1599999999999s)]
*  damage. You don't know that. There was a there was another clip of Fauci that was it was in it was [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1438.84s)]
*  in during the lockdown regime before Operation Warp Speed. So before before the vaccine regime [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1446.68s)]
*  when we were still in the lockdown regime and I this video I haven't seen go as viral but I played [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1452.1200000000001s)]
*  it on my podcast part of the problem if you go look it's in like one of the last five episodes [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1457.48s)]
*  if someone anyone wants to check it out but he was saying point blank during during the covid [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1461.64s)]
*  lockdowns that when people were going well maybe we could get a vaccine and that'll get us out of [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1467.16s)]
*  these lockdowns and he was like no no no because even if we got a vaccine it would take it [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1471.3200000000002s)]
*  at least two years of trials before we would know whether this vaccine was safe and then [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1476.6s)]
*  sometimes vaccines can have a negative effect where actually you're worse at fighting off the [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1481.9599999999998s)]
*  the virus afterward and he kind of breaks down this whole thing then then all of a sudden [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1486.4399999999998s)]
*  once Operation Warp Speed starts and then once Biden gets in you're not allowed to talk about [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1491.0s)]
*  that anymore and in fact when I was on with you was a couple times ago it was the clip that we [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1494.84s)]
*  went that you got like all this this heat for in Fauci even responded and essentially what you were [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1500.4399999999998s)]
*  saying was like hey if you're a young person just be really healthy that's my advice to you eat [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1505.8s)]
*  healthy exercise get a lot of sunlight get vitamin d like all these things and that became like a [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1511.72s)]
*  like a controversial statement there is all of the science backs that up that that is absolutely [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1517.4s)]
*  excellent advice but it had nothing to do with science at that point it was a narrative this is [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1523.16s)]
*  what's going to get us out of this horrible thing we're in now take it and everybody had to take it [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1527.64s)]
*  and if you didn't take it there was all this crazy nonsense like first of all they knew in the [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1533.4s)]
*  beginning that it wasn't going to stop infection they knew that Burke said that she said that now [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1538.92s)]
*  I should have said that before she said that I knew that it wasn't going to prevent she said [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1544.2s)]
*  we oversold it a little or something like that yeah I don't know what she was what she said how [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1549.0s)]
*  she said it but you know that that was known back then and it's also if you talk to virologists [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1552.68s)]
*  about respiratory illnesses like you can't contain them you you do your back like can you stop [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1560.44s)]
*  yourself from getting it yeah if you completely isolate from humanity and you stay on a ranch [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1566.52s)]
*  and you never leave and you get your own well water and you wait this bitch out that's possible [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1571.4s)]
*  you could do that but other than that if you're going to be in contact with human beings [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1575.8s)]
*  and especially something that you can spread before you know you have it which apparently [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1579.72s)]
*  is the case like people can have a mild form of it and be spreading it and then other people can [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1585.24s)]
*  die from it yeah and you might not be affected by it by at all but the other people that get it [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1589.56s)]
*  might die and so that was the big fear right and everybody was like if you are irresponsible at [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1594.28s)]
*  this point you're contributing to this horrible situation I get that but why didn't we put that [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1598.84s)]
*  same sort of the same sort of focus and and and same sort of pressure on people to take care of [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1605.0s)]
*  their health because that makes a big fucking difference a giant difference as big as anything [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1612.12s)]
*  yeah is whether or not you're healthy and you have a robust immune system that can fight off [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1617.16s)]
*  any kind of infection not just this one but all the ones that people get constantly and die from [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1620.92s)]
*  I mean there there's fucking in the neighborhood of 30 to 50 000 people every year die from the [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1626.3600000000001s)]
*  flu right isn't it something crazy yeah depending on the season yeah yeah what about that you know [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1632.0400000000002s)]
*  what are we just going to do the same lockdown thing for everything now like what are we going [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1636.44s)]
*  to do when diseases come is 50 000 okay but 500 000 is bad and out of those 500 000 how many of [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1640.6s)]
*  them were fat how many of them were old how many of them had four comorbidities which is the average [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1647.9599999999998s)]
*  four comorbidities of people that died from it yeah this is wild shit yeah and it's been and this [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1654.52s)]
*  has been true way before covid in america is something like according to the cdc there was [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1660.12s)]
*  something i think it was between like 66 and 70 percent of medical costs are associated with [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1666.6s)]
*  preventable illness so whether it's obesity smoking you know drugs you know what all this [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1671.96s)]
*  like unhealthy lifestyle type stuff and then you know we have like these debates over like obamacare [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1679.32s)]
*  and all these other things and none of that ever comes up like no one ever brings up the fact that [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1685.72s)]
*  like well if we actually want to have a solution to the health problem in this country well we [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1690.44s)]
*  kind of know what the solution is solution is to like eat good and exercise and things like this [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1695.56s)]
*  and don't do drugs and don't uh or at least the unhealthy ones don't smoke cigarettes you know [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1701.08s)]
*  that's kind of the solution and no one ever seems to be like well we're asking the people to do this [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1705.72s)]
*  i'm not certainly not advocating forcing anyone to do anything but you could at least mention that [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1710.28s)]
*  well you know i mean you could find a world in which that would be encouraged where it could be [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1715.3999999999999s)]
*  encouraged in a positive way and it would really literally change people's lives like they would [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1720.6s)]
*  start doing it and start feeling better and then that would become a new way of life for them [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1724.84s)]
*  and then they would look back a year two three years from now with so much more energy and so [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1729.32s)]
*  much healthier and feel so much better and go god why didn't someone tell me this earlier and [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1732.6799999999998s)]
*  that's the thing that that's a real thing that we can do this is a it's just such a fucking [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1737.72s)]
*  fascinating time to watch people's thought processes and how quickly people are to join [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1743.08s)]
*  the herd mentality and to not question things especially the people that put all their faith [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1748.76s)]
*  in some of the companies that have been shown to be the most deceptive and profited the most from [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1754.68s)]
*  that deception and have been penalized even though they've been penalized financially if you look at [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1760.36s)]
*  the like the gain versus loss it's a fucking it's not even a slap on the wrist because they were [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1765.56s)]
*  still allowed to make billions of dollars from pharmaceutical medications it killed millions of [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1770.12s)]
*  people yeah and then it's just like thousands of people yeah and then and then they're just like [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1775.0s)]
*  they're just doing math right they're like okay well we pay this five billion dollar fine but we [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1779.8s)]
*  make 40 billion in profits that's what aberson said when i had john aberson on who's a guy who's [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1784.04s)]
*  litigated against pharmaceutical companies in the vioxx case he got the internal memos where they [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1788.28s)]
*  said there's going to be all these complications but we will do well like they knew the health [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1792.68s)]
*  complications that were going to be associated with this medication that wound up killing at [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1798.44s)]
*  least 50 000 people which is fucking wild and they made like 12 billion they got penalized [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1803.56s)]
*  a few billion and so they made profit they made profit off of a disease which they they pushed [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1810.2s)]
*  through knowing that they were hiding data yeah it's and fucking and then people were willing to [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1816.36s)]
*  trust them and then you know when you look at like things like when they had these covet passports [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1822.44s)]
*  in all of these big cities there you know the thing that's so crazy like so then they go okay [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1828.36s)]
*  so the government is basically forcing you to consume this pharmaceutical product or you can't [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1833.3999999999999s)]
*  participate in the society that you live in and then all these people get forced into it it's clear [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1837.8799999999999s)]
*  as day that this did nothing i mean this they they put the vaccine passports into effect in [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1844.6799999999998s)]
*  new york city before the omicron variant and when omicron came through it just wiped through the [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1849.1599999999999s)]
*  everybody got omicron in the city it was like the most contagious it did nothing to stop the [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1853.8799999999999s)]
*  and then ultimately it was like so obvious and the people just weren't having it so they pulled [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1858.28s)]
*  back on it but then there's no admission that like oh we got that wrong there's no reconciliation no [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1861.72s)]
*  correction but the pharmaceutical companies they kept all the money for all the people who are [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1867.08s)]
*  forced to consume their product well not only that they have zero risk right zero protect completely [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1871.48s)]
*  protected from liability many of them got funding from the government for the development in operation [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1876.36s)]
*  warp speed so it's a pretty sweet uh gig look whenever there's a pandemic or ever there's a new [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1881.6399999999999s)]
*  thing there's a crisis there's always going to be mistakes made and it's whether or not we learn [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1887.24s)]
*  from those mistakes and whether or not you have a healthy distrust for narratives that are being [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1894.28s)]
*  pushed by people who have a financial incentive for these narratives to be correct here's another [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1900.76s)]
*  one we don't talk about respirators do you know how many people died because they were on respirators [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1906.0400000000002s)]
*  and the thing is that a correlation or is a causation well they don't fucking use them as [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1912.0400000000002s)]
*  much anymore that's a fact and 88 percent of the people in new york they put on something like that [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1915.72s)]
*  find out what percentage of people got put on respirators who wound up dying and then you could [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1921.4s)]
*  say well they were gonna die anyway and that's why there's some people that disagree with that [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1925.32s)]
*  and they say no you blew out these people's lungs well the reason i tend to i think that your right [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1929.64s)]
*  to disagree with that is because what you said is that the so at the beginning right this is when [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1934.28s)]
*  cuomo when he was still a governor there was demanding that trump send in 50 000 more respirators [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1938.76s)]
*  because we needed them or people are going to die and then the doctors basically all from the [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1944.04s)]
*  bottom up determined like we're not going to be putting these people on respirators anymore [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1948.12s)]
*  because they're so many of them are dying most new york coven patients on ventilators died yeah [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1951.56s)]
*  rose to 88 percent of those who received mechanical ventilation among the 2634 patients [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1957.3999999999999s)]
*  whom outcomes were known the overall death rate was 21 percent but it rose to 88 percent for the [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1963.8s)]
*  ones who were ventilated jesus christ so even just that so let's just pretend it's only what is that [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1969.48s)]
*  67 imagine that yeah just that 67 percent well that's a lot of fucking people dying [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1977.56s)]
*  and and this one to your point though i would say i don't think there was anything like malicious [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1986.1200000000001s)]
*  about this i do think doctors were trying to save people and then they quickly started realizing [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1989.8s)]
*  our patients are doing really bad when we put them on these ventilators and then they backed [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1994.04s)]
*  off and they were like let's not do this anymore so to your point yeah like mistakes will be made [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=1997.48s)]
*  and i think that one was like an honest mistake but the point is that at least the doctors then [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2001.08s)]
*  corrected that right and they went okay we're not going to do that anymore we're going to wait until [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2006.76s)]
*  that we absolutely need to to put them on these ventilators but there seems to be with all of [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2010.04s)]
*  these other like like major policies from the federal government and from a lot of these state [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2014.68s)]
*  governments that there's just kind of you know there's like no admission no recognition and [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2019.8s)]
*  i mean i remember like when when texas here when when you guys first opened back up and just ended [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2025.64s)]
*  all of the the covid restrictions all the blue state governors were saying this is so reckless [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2030.76s)]
*  and insane and people are going to die and then the the death rate was no worse than in any of [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2036.2s)]
*  these other blue states and now they all stopped yeah and they don't even acknowledge it everyone [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2041.24s)]
*  who wants a point to florida like florida what they did they had the highest rate of death in covid [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2045.08s)]
*  yeah but they have the oldest people and if you age adjust it's no different than california yeah [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2050.92s)]
*  that's right if you age adjust that that was the right way to do it he was right like it's not no [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2057.0s)]
*  no one's saying that covid's good it was not good but these people that did things that were not [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2062.76s)]
*  good for society were not good for small businesses were not good for people's mental health were not [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2069.08s)]
*  good for the development of children's language skills like all these things were wrong man well [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2074.76s)]
*  look i mean there's so much stuff we're it's going to be like a generation before we even see the [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2079.56s)]
*  damage from the lockdowns and we won't even be able to know for sure what exactly like trace it [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2086.04s)]
*  back to what exactly was the damage from the lockdowns but just think about what a nightmare [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2090.36s)]
*  you know 2020 i mean there were riots in that year that were obviously about the george floyd [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2094.44s)]
*  thing but were very related to the lockdowns as well like it wasn't a coincidence that after [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2099.64s)]
*  three months of being locked in your home with no bar no sports no friends house no work you know [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2104.6s)]
*  that you then all of a sudden people were riding because cops have done you know fucked up shit a [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2111.88s)]
*  lot of times before and this one led to national you know riots that was all part of the cost of [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2115.64s)]
*  lockdowns so the the economy the inflation that we're dealing with right now was a huge part of [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2121.64s)]
*  the lockdowns and it was partly because they printed trillions of dollars as a result of being [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2127.16s)]
*  like well what are we going to do to make sure we're not in a depression if we just stop the [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2132.44s)]
*  economy right now so of course the answer is always well we'll print trillions of dollars hand [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2136.44s)]
*  out most of that to big corporations and give some crumbs to the american people and so now [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2141.2400000000002s)]
*  you think of the cost of inflation i mean people are getting destroyed from the value of the dollar [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2149.0s)]
*  going down right now and the cost of everything rising this is all these things are all [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2154.68s)]
*  interrelated you know and it's like uh it's very hard to measure the cost of shutting down society [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2158.84s)]
*  no and that should have been taken into consideration the fact that it wasn't is so [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2164.44s)]
*  crazy but everybody wanted to be safe and the government you know said we have to at least have [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2168.28s)]
*  it has to have an illusion that we're doing something to protect people yeah but really i [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2175.0s)]
*  mean in in hindsight at this point looking back at it that if the government had just said look [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2180.52s)]
*  there's this uh there's this virus this nasty upper respiratory virus that's uh coming over here [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2185.88s)]
*  and we think that um if you are if you're in very bad health because this is like by march it was [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2191.2400000000002s)]
*  very clear in the data of who was dying from this it was very clear that it was old and sick people [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2198.2000000000003s)]
*  this was right away they focused a lot on outliers they focused on young people a lot of those young [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2202.6800000000003s)]
*  people unfortunately were ventilated yeah well that's true too you know michael yo's doctor [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2208.52s)]
*  told him i'm not going to put you on a ventilator because if i do you'll die and he got it early he [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2212.68s)]
*  got it in like february so it was early on his doctor was wise enough fortunately lucky yeah [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2217.8799999999997s)]
*  yeah yeah no but i'm just saying if you were being honest and not focusing on the outliers and actually [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2224.44s)]
*  looking at like what we can learn from this data they could have just said look if you are at risk [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2229.16s)]
*  we really recommend you isolate yourself for everybody else try to be smart try to be as [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2234.52s)]
*  healthy as you can like be you know what i mean and then if you feel sick at all don't come into [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2238.92s)]
*  work like don't do not power through it do not assume it's allergies or a cold or something like [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2244.6800000000003s)]
*  that like make sure get tested and the test weren't as readily available back then but just stay home [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2249.4s)]
*  wait it out you know what i mean whatever just doing that and not locking down the economy and [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2253.88s)]
*  not having all of these crazy restrictions would have unquestionably been a much much better way to [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2259.08s)]
*  handle covid because look from all these states if you look at the the lockdown states versus the [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2265.96s)]
*  non-lockdown states or the lockdown countries versus the non-lockdown countries if you look at [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2270.68s)]
*  the mask mandate counties versus the non-mask mandate counties there you can't draw any conclusion [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2275.7200000000003s)]
*  from any of them the truth is that this virus just moved the way it was going to move and so all you [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2280.6s)]
*  were doing was just destroying people's lives you were just adding more of a cost than the virus [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2285.4s)]
*  itself was going to add which was already significant and here's another thing they never [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2291.88s)]
*  did when they got data and the data was pretty clear that a large percentage of the people in [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2295.56s)]
*  the icu for covid were deficient in vitamin d and this is not saying that vitamin d is going to [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2300.6s)]
*  prevent you from getting covid but it 100 will increase the power of your immune system vitamin [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2306.76s)]
*  d deficiency is a real problem with people's overall metabolic health and there's a large [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2312.52s)]
*  percentage of our country because we stay indoors all the time we don't do things we're not active [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2317.72s)]
*  outside that it's vitamin d is a hormone and your body produces it from the sun and that's the best [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2322.2s)]
*  way to get it but if you're not getting it that way you can supplement and it's a definite best [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2327.9599999999996s)]
*  second choice and it really helps and it makes a big fucking difference it makes a big difference [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2334.4399999999996s)]
*  in everything and muscle development brain function like it's a real fucking problem [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2340.04s)]
*  with human beings they had that data there was no there was no like public declaration of this [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2345.88s)]
*  oh yeah this was known way before covid yeah such a simple thing to tell people vitamin d is so [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2351.7200000000003s)]
*  important go outside lay in the sun go to a fucking park park should be that that when they shut parks [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2357.1600000000003s)]
*  down that was fucking nice playgrounds down basketball courts down the ocean remember the [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2362.92s)]
*  fucking guy wakeboarding yeah it's like these people are out of their fucking minds and if they [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2366.84s)]
*  just did that then i would know at least you are taking measures based on data to try to help people [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2372.12s)]
*  and protect people and and just the insane thing is that they they all accuse people like us who [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2378.2799999999997s)]
*  talk about it like this of like spreading misinformation throughout the whole time meanwhile [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2384.12s)]
*  the people who say that like you know right like you should you should stay inside are not accused [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2388.6s)]
*  you know they don't get accused of spreading misinformation the people who say the people like [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2393.96s)]
*  the president of the united states and dr fauci the head of the pandemic responds who say if you [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2397.4s)]
*  get the vaccine you won't get covid and you won't spread it yeah point blank point blank that's what [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2402.28s)]
*  they say that's how they sold this to the american people and that's not like that's not you know [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2407.32s)]
*  that's not going to get you kicked off twitter no it's whatever it's wild man or the people that [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2412.28s)]
*  spread that story about uh folks that were uh they were having overdoses of ivermectin and so they [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2417.2400000000002s)]
*  were being rushed to the hospitals they had no room for gunshot patients because so many people [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2425.4s)]
*  were taking ivermectin a total 100 fabrication and lie that was in rolling stone that rachel [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2429.7200000000003s)]
*  mattoff tweeted and then she doubled down on it afterwards after it was proven we looked at the [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2438.04s)]
*  photo we're like why those people wearing coats it's august in oklahoma well it also just if you [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2443.48s)]
*  would just had anyone who knew anything i'm not a doctor or anything but if you know anyone who [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2449.56s)]
*  knows anything about it you would just look at that like i did the second i read that story go [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2453.96s)]
*  that doesn't sound right because ivermectin is known for being a very safe drug no whether the [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2457.88s)]
*  argument is that it helps with covid or not it's the reason why at the beginning doctors were giving [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2462.12s)]
*  it to people is because they were kind of like well this may help or it may not but it's definitely [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2467.56s)]
*  not a dangerous drug to take it's on the world health organization's list of most important [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2471.16s)]
*  medicines yeah like so that so it just made no sense you'd at least go in being skeptical of [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2475.32s)]
*  this by the way didn't just get added it just got added as a covid treatment i believe yeah i don't [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2479.96s)]
*  know what the find out what that is because what i've heard is it's just they just put it on there [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2485.32s)]
*  because just to give people information about it you know whether or not they're admitting that it's [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2491.08s)]
*  it's it's but why do they even call it ivermectin why don't they call it horse paste like why do they [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2496.44s)]
*  even why would they even refer to it like that here's the crazy thing that might have worked on [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2500.6800000000003s)]
*  some people at the moment where people like oh my god these idiots are taking horse paste [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2505.0s)]
*  but now given the amount of time that's gone on what it's done really is it's eroded significantly [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2509.48s)]
*  people's respect and people's trust in mainstream news which i think is good this is fucking very [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2517.32s)]
*  good because you know we got to find out what cnn really is yeah well that's propaganda armor the [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2523.0s)]
*  democratic party but if you think about it like there's this is um this is the consequence of [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2527.08s)]
*  all of this stuff and this one with covid is the biggest one by far but even when people would i [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2533.4s)]
*  remember like when when donald trump was running for president in 2016 and the people in the [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2538.52s)]
*  corporate press who i know some of them and they'd be saying these things like they'd be like he's [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2544.2s)]
*  just calling us fake news and liars and all of this and like how is this resonating with so many [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2549.0s)]
*  people and they were like completely like and you're like guys i don't know i mean you sold a war [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2553.24s)]
*  where a million people died off this guy had weapons of mass destruction and he didn't like [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2558.6s)]
*  real people's kids went and fought in that war and then came back and blew their brains out [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2564.2799999999997s)]
*  this happened tens of thousands of american soldiers blew their brains out you know like [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2569.0s)]
*  a lot of people knew that guy well you know what i mean like i don't know and they know that you [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2573.24s)]
*  sold this war do you think that in in the next 10 years after that the fact that people have no [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2577.08s)]
*  trust in you there might be a connection there you know do you think the fact that even like barack [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2582.4399999999996s)]
*  obama you know saying you know uh whatever if you like your plan you can keep your plan it's all [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2586.9199999999996s)]
*  these lies yeah like people remember this stuff but man if they think that the people in 2016 [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2591.08s)]
*  didn't trust the corporate press after this the amount of people who will never will never look [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2596.7599999999998s)]
*  at cnn again will never look at the new york times again as as as if there's any pretense [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2603.7999999999997s)]
*  of even your pretending to tell the truth it's just not going to happen it's not going to happen [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2609.7999999999997s)]
*  or at least it's for a huge numbers of people they'll never trust you again you can never talk [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2614.92s)]
*  to them again well i think what cnn is trying to do now is rebuild and they're trying to become [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2619.4s)]
*  a source of objective news and i think this new guy recognizes the mistakes of you're allowing [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2623.8s)]
*  editorials by some of the dumbest fucking people on television and people that are only there [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2630.6s)]
*  because they were hired one of the beautiful things about whether it's uh breaking points [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2635.2400000000002s)]
*  with uh crystal and saga who is my favorite show one of the great one of the best points about it [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2640.6s)]
*  is there's no one no one running that but them that's you're getting objective information from [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2645.72s)]
*  people that you trust they're gathering up everything they can find and they can give [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2652.44s)]
*  an assessment based on their understanding of these issues and then they debate it and they [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2657.16s)]
*  talk about it and they go over it back and forth that people chose them people know they can trust [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2661.56s)]
*  them so they follow them it's that's not the case with people on television they just get hired well [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2667.7999999999997s)]
*  right it's a thing you can read that it's kind of like however you feel about um uh crystal and [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2673.8s)]
*  segar they're not lying to you you can kind of tell that they're telling you what they think [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2679.6400000000003s)]
*  yes not not say that they're right about everything but they're telling they're also um there's no [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2684.36s)]
*  pretense of them being um uh objective journalists they both are opinion journalists like they're [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2689.0800000000004s)]
*  both like okay like she's kind of like a left-wing populist he's kind of a right-wing populist type [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2694.44s)]
*  but so they're like but that's our opinion we'll let you know that up front yes rather than [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2698.76s)]
*  pretending i take no opinion here i'm just an objective journalist and you know what brian [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2702.84s)]
*  stelter did and everybody knows that we're real news and they're fake news that's the objective [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2709.1600000000003s)]
*  truth it's like no it's not it doesn't work and no one trusts you you're not even a real person [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2714.0400000000004s)]

*  but what what gives me hope about those two crystal and saga is that they are a right-wing [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2725.4s)]
*  populist and a left-wing populist and yet they're very good friends and they get along great and [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2730.2000000000003s)]
*  they have respectful conversations about things and you actually realize that they uh have a lot [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2734.76s)]
*  of overlap which is a big which is a big uh thing that i like i think that the kind of powerful uh [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2738.84s)]

*  how much actually that your average like you know left of center person right of center person [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2755.08s)]

*  and they're just raking in billions of dollars in profits because no one's looking at them but if [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2784.12s)]
*  you really think about the things that most people care about like most regular americans care about [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2788.68s)]

*  issues that we're seeing in the news every day there is an element of distraction about that [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2862.84s)]
*  no matter how much you think these issues are important they are important they certainly are [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2869.1600000000003s)]

*  they're not talking about them because they're important right they're talking about them because [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2877.48s)]
*  they know this will solidify people's adherence to the ideology whether it's the right-wing ideology [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2881.5600000000004s)]
*  or the left-wing ideology when you have people like stacey abram saying that a fetal heartbeat [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2887.32s)]
*  is is an illusion like how did she say it yeah it's not it's not real what you're hearing there [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2893.0800000000004s)]

*  that just that statement alone should discredit you to the point where people should never listen [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2929.3999999999996s)]
*  to anything you ever say again and what does she even think who's who's manufacturing it like my [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2934.3599999999997s)]

*  eight months and four weeks or eight months and three weeks rather like right before the the kids [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2952.2000000000003s)]
*  coming out well this is okay well this is it's when it's like this is the logical conclusion of [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2958.12s)]
*  this kind of like well my body my choice and no restrictions and you go so let's say that there's [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2963.72s)]
*  a woman who whatever right eight weeks nine months because not everyone goes on their their due date [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2968.52s)]

*  charts um where you can chart like words that are used in in mainstream like big newspapers and stuff [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2988.36s)]
*  so you could chart like a word in the new york times and how many times it's used and if you so [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2995.08s)]
*  you know washington post or whatever if you take any of these like woke you know you take the term [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=2999.08s)]
*  racism and you put it in a nexus chart and they'll show you throughout the years how many times the [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3004.6800000000003s)]
*  term racism is used in the new york times and it's like this and then around like 2011 2012 [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3009.4s)]

*  universities these are the biggest corporate you know media platforms in the country all at this [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3028.9199999999996s)]
*  time like flooded the market with this woke shit now i'm not saying it didn't exist in in college [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3036.12s)]
*  universities i'm not saying that that wasn't already going on i'm just saying that what changed [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3041.96s)]
*  around that time and it was right toward obama's second term what changed was that all the sudden [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3046.68s)]
*  the woke shit went from being shit that was taught like critical race theory and this stuff was taught [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3052.6s)]
*  in college universities but all of a sudden it had the backing of all of the biggest most powerful [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3057.16s)]
*  corporations in the world and all of the political class and all of it just got pumped in and the [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3062.04s)]
*  theory kind of is that what had happened right then in 2010 was you had these huge these this big [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3067.8s)]
*  left-wing populist movement and this big right-wing populist movement you had the occupy movement and [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3076.44s)]
*  the tea party movement and they were kind of started over the same thing which were the banker [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3080.6000000000004s)]
*  ballots like the first tea party like things were started over the ron paul campaigns and the tarp [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3086.36s)]
*  that was like when the first tea parties broke out and then the occupy thing was in direct response [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3093.2400000000002s)]
*  to the banker bailouts and all of this stuff and you had these big movements and the lefties back [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3097.56s)]
*  then were standing outside of the big banks screaming we are the 99% and when they were saying 99% they [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3102.36s)]
*  didn't even mean 99% they meant 99.9% they were like we're the people who don't own banks like the [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3109.48s)]
*  people who own banks versus the people who don't own banks that's who we represent that was like [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3115.0s)]
*  the leftist populist movement and then all of these huge publications i'm not talking about mom [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3119.16s)]
*  and pop newspapers i'm saying the new york times and the washington post you know what i mean all [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3124.36s)]
*  they wanted to talk about all day was what divides all of them it was like no no no you're not the 99 [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3128.6800000000003s)]
*  percent you're the whites versus the blacks the gays versus the straights the trans versus the cis [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3134.76s)]
*  and it does if and now you look at it and you see like the gay pride parade floats and there's like [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3139.48s)]
*  a bank of america float and it just seems to me like these big banks essentially bought off the [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3144.52s)]
*  left with all this woke shit completely distracted them from where their eyes were on the prize and [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3150.6s)]
*  then turned the left and right against each other where now they're all fighting so like to your [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3156.04s)]
*  point it's not that what they're fighting about doesn't necessarily mean anything some of them [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3160.44s)]
*  are very important issues but none of them affect the bottom line for the most powerful people in [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3163.72s)]
*  our society and what are the bankers doing now since those banker ballots they got a whole new [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3168.6s)]
*  round of ballots in 2020 they're like they are they're raking in profits still nothing was ever [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3172.36s)]
*  addressed about that that whole corrupt system so do you think that there was a concerted effort [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3178.68s)]
*  to do this like was there a conversation like how do you think something like that happens [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3183.7999999999997s)]
*  if you think that there's this ramp up and it's been proven by these studies that if you look at [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3187.96s)]
*  the words like is it a function of people graduating from these universities and taking these [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3193.0s)]
*  jobs in these these companies and deciding to push this agenda because they think that social [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3198.68s)]
*  justice is important because they do see you know these opponents of obamas being these [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3204.12s)]
*  racist people that are like this this is like underbelly of society that we weren't totally [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3210.2799999999997s)]
*  aware of it needs to be addressed or do you think that there is really like a concerted effort [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3215.88s)]
*  from corporations to get people to divide and if if that's the case how was it discussed [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3221.48s)]
*  well i can't um so look the thing is essentially the answer is i don't know [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3228.3599999999997s)]
*  because you know i don't have like factually i don't know for sure but there's i think it was [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3233.3199999999997s)]
*  either i can't remember if it was michael tracy or if it was a matt tayyibi one of them said it but [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3238.2799999999997s)]

*  they're just mapping the work and how many times it's used but there is no question that amongst [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3255.7999999999997s)]
*  the most powerful you know like forces in media there was a concerted effort to do this and my [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3261.08s)]
*  guess is that it's much less likely that that came from the 20 year old interns than that that came [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3267.72s)]
*  from some power source up at the top and i think there was an effort to do this i like i think and [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3273.3199999999997s)]
*  i think it came from the very top and i think and this has been going on by the way for a long time [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3278.2s)]
*  like back in the day there was uh this is what they did to the right wing in this country this [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3282.68s)]
*  is what national review did when they turned the right wing into culture warriors when they never [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3286.44s)]
*  were before like the old right the the old um you know like robert taft who was known as mr [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3290.84s)]
*  republican his whole thing was like non-interventionist foreign policy sound money like some protectionism so [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3296.52s)]
*  you protect like american jobs and stuff like that it was all like this old school right wing thing [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3303.4s)]
*  and then national review and all this like new right rose up in like the the 60s and they were [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3308.44s)]
*  like no no no no listen what really matters is like there's homos out there all right like that's [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3314.04s)]
*  really what us right wingers care about what we really care about is abortion what we really care [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3320.44s)]
*  about again not saying abortion is not an important issue i'm just saying but they they use that and [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3324.68s)]
*  then they were like oh and by the way that non-interventionist foreign policy thing yeah [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3328.92s)]
*  we're not doing that anymore we're called warriors now and we're going to fight communism all [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3331.8s)]
*  throughout the world get on board and so it's just it seems like this is this is a tried and true [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3335.88s)]
*  tactic to like break up these these movements that can actually threaten threaten where like the real [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3342.84s)]
*  gravy train is and where is that that's like in the military industrial complex and the [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3349.7200000000003s)]

*  american fascism lies not in some like is that not in some people who you know trespassed on [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3358.92s)]
*  government property in january 6th who had nothing was completely powerless and then is now sitting [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3363.7200000000003s)]
*  in solitary confinement for how many hundreds of days that's not like the face of fascism in [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3369.48s)]
*  america if you want to talk about fascism in america look at like the patriot act look at [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3374.28s)]
*  vaccine passports look at like you know lockheed martin and raytheon that's where the fascism lies [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3378.44s)]
*  well the january 6th thing is not a small thing like when people enter the capital with zip ties [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3384.84s)]

*  there that had they gotten their hands on mike pence or something like that like something very [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3411.64s)]
*  ugly could have happened so i don't mean to downplay that aspect of it i'm just saying that like [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3415.48s)]
*  those people even had they done something to mike pence or something like that would have been shut [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3420.12s)]
*  down by i mean the military would have come in the national guard would have come in they were never [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3426.12s)]
*  a real threat to take over the united states of america and implement fascism my point is that [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3429.96s)]
*  these people that i'm talking about are really powerful and actually affecting the lives of [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3434.6s)]
*  everyday americans and my other thing is that a lot of those people in january 6th weren't that [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3439.0s)]

*  then he's on the other team so why would you be defending him if he's literally inciting yeah you [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3478.52s)]
*  would be calling him an insurrectionist or a domestic terrorist he's telling people to go [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3483.32s)]
*  inside how is that how are all these other people arrested and sitting in jail and this guy isn't [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3487.48s)]

*  this is not just a conspiracy it's a conspiracy with evidence there's a real person it's a there [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3533.72s)]
*  are real conspiracies and it's reasonable to to question some of this amazing job they did of [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3538.2s)]
*  making the term conspiracy theory sound like you're a kook yeah even though it has to be like sandy [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3543.48s)]
*  hook it has to be something like completely preposterous it has to be pizza gate it has to [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3549.16s)]

*  a negative term is a really genius thing yeah what they've done is really amazing and i think they [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3578.68s)]
*  started that during the kennedy assassination i think that's when the whole conspiracy theorist [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3583.3199999999997s)]
*  term because they're like yeah like you're not allowed to ask questions about this thing [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3588.2s)]

*  this isn't going to trend because it's just we're not in that right now but right but then you see [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3721.56s)]
*  with with the russia thing when that first starts then all of a sudden if that's what's hot now and [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3725.4s)]
*  this is how they always do this like in the moment they try to really make it they try to make you [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3730.52s)]
*  intimidated to say the important thing in the moment but man dude this thing with russia is [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3735.64s)]
*  just like the craziest thing in the world like the idea that we're actually flirting with a nuclear [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3742.04s)]
*  conflict with russia is the most important priority in the history of humanity is that [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3748.6s)]
*  america and russia do not go to war there's nothing more important than that that's that's it [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3754.28s)]
*  we'll destroy the the human species if we do this and yet there's this war right on russia's [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3759.32s)]
*  border and there's no effort to negotiate going on there's like no effort in fact from from very [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3765.6400000000003s)]
*  solid reporting that actually america through boris johnson in in told ukraine not to negotiate [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3772.04s)]
*  with russia at the very beginning of the war when they had a deal worked out they had a they had a [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3778.84s)]
*  deal worked out has been reported in multiple sources that they had a deal worked out and the [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3783.2400000000002s)]
*  deal was basically that vladimir putin would pull back he would pull back his troops and leave [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3787.16s)]
*  ukraine under the condition that the very simple conditions that ukraine guaranteed [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3791.56s)]
*  autonomy for the donbass region and agreed to never join nato and like that was a deal like [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3798.12s)]
*  okay i'm not saying everyone thinks that's the perfect deal but it's better than what we got [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3803.8799999999997s)]
*  right now better than nuclear war and right now just the other day dude the official narrative on [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3807.3199999999997s)]
*  this this whole war it's just like it makes no sense and again like i said remember the same [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3811.3999999999996s)]
*  people who are pushing this are the ones who are telling you saddam hussein had weapons of mass [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3815.72s)]
*  destruction stuff but the official narrative joe is basically that um okay so uh vladimir putin [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3819.0s)]
*  is a mad man a crazy war criminal who's hell bent on um reforming the soviet union and this is a [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3826.68s)]
*  real threat that he could do this but also he's he's getting humiliated in this war in ukraine [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3835.64s)]
*  it's like he's losing the poorest country in europe and he's just getting humiliated in beat [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=3840.8399999999997s)]

*  it's basically robin to russia's batman and the challenge here the challenge here is to try to [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4119.32s)]
*  attract it to the west to get it to flip sides so the the rebels in the streets what are they [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4126.36s)]

*  basically after the end of the soviet union faced two tracks it could stay a sort of stagnant [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4140.84s)]
*  corrupt authoritarian country tied to russia or it could essentially join the west it could [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4145.96s)]
*  modernize liberalize become a democracy at the last minute when it looked like it was going to [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4151.8s)]
*  trade up from its sort of abusive relationship with its boyfriend from the hood to a nice yuppie [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4156.6s)]
*  you're not loading these choices in any way whatsoever it's actually true when it looked [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4163.24s)]
*  like it was going to trade up to a better environment at the last minute putin offered [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4167.8s)]
*  a bribe how much 15 billion it's a lot of cash it's a lot of cash and the president who himself [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4172.4400000000005s)]
*  was tied to the old elites and the eastern part of the country with us to russia decided to back [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4178.04s)]
*  off the change and go you know how many pirate themed restaurants you can buy with 15 billion [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4183.320000000001s)]
*  dollars the problem was the western parts of the country and the younger parts of the country and [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4188.2s)]
*  the more modern liberal parts of the country basically knew that they had no future being [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4193.16s)]
*  russia's russia's vassal do we they took to the streets is america taking sides in this in any way [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4197.48s)]
*  if these people the the rebels are winning right now right yes just recently why isn't obama [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4202.76s)]
*  spiking the ball in the end zone and calling putin and saying hey you might have won the [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4207.72s)]
*  medal count but we won the country count beacch it's actually a very good question and the answer is [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4212.04s)]
*  that we don't want russia to intervene and kick over the table like a game of risk [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4218.6s)]
*  and take ukraine back and so they do that could he send in troops yes he could so we are [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4223.64s)]
*  choosing does ukraine have any troops of their own would they fight back yes but we don't want [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4228.360000000001s)]
*  this to escalate and we don't want russia to crack down so we want to basically distract russia oh [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4232.120000000001s)]
*  look you have the highest medal count oh you did really well uh and you know focus on the olympics [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4236.92s)]
*  there's a shiny object we'll just take an entire country away from you [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4243.0s)]
*  holy shit yeah now isn't that funny there's a power vacuum right now there's a power vacuum the [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4248.2s)]
*  opposition is all together which everybody it's easy to agree on getting rid of the bad old regime [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4253.56s)]
*  and much harder to create a stable country in which everybody compromises and moves forward [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4258.28s)]
*  so they need a strong leader to move the country forward do you know who's always good at a moment [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4263.16s)]
*  like that Vladimir Putin do you think he might volunteer to come in and and and help Ukraine [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4267.32s)]
*  the reason we don't want we don't want we don't want Putin to get involved in this and so we are [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4274.44s)]
*  basically we want to try and involve him in this decision so that he allows Ukraine to go we [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4278.28s)]
*  actually want to not we want to say we want a non-exclusive relationship with Ukraine you [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4283.5599999999995s)]
*  can have a relationship with him too you're the only one making this into a girlfriend boyfriend [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4287.4s)]
*  relationship Ukraine is basically choosing its future between two completely different courses [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4291.0s)]
*  of action and we're trying to blur that choice so the old boyfriend doesn't get too upset [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4295.96s)]
*  so just uh that's basically that's the point but just to add to this right so and it's not just that [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4301.96s)]
*  that the guy at foreign affairs is saying stuff like this right but you also have those when he [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4307.08s)]
*  says the people took to the streets you can trace where they were getting their funding from and [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4311.08s)]
*  it's a whole bunch of NGOs that are [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4316.2s)]

*  and I said george saw us too you're not gonna be good goodness it's a goddamn conspiracy but [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4325.0s)]

*  no worries no problem [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4334.68s)]
*  that shit's wild though right it is wild it's gonna be even while they're listening to the [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4341.32s)]
*  people theorize and why this went down [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4346.360000000001s)]
*  we're back are we back yeah so explain what happened jimmy just so it just makes it [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4353.320000000001s)]
*  thought I mean I can keep all the video going it's just that my good audio recording just [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4360.280000000001s)]

*  militias on the ground who were overthrowing the the government and then there's a tape of [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4374.12s)]
*  victoria newland who's who's uh was at the state department at the time one of the top people at [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4377.72s)]

*  you know what happened basically was as gideon rose was even saying the ukrainian government [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4391.0s)]
*  was kind of siding with russia or at least a lot more pro russia and then we overthrew that [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4395.32s)]

*  our point of view if like russia was coming over here and overthrowing the pro america government [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4411.96s)]
*  in montreal and installing a pro russia government there then you know like this would be seen as [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4417.4s)]
*  would you call that an unprovoked attack you know if we were to go in there and then go overthrow [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4422.92s)]
*  that government so again i'm not justifying what he's doing but and then the other thing to this [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4428.12s)]

*  at least in the in the larger conversation i don't see anyone connecting these things [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4438.44s)]
*  is that there's two things like involving ukraine that they were very big that happened very recently [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4442.76s)]
*  in american history that very much connect to this war and one is that our last president was [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4446.84s)]

*  the current president's son was getting paid millions of dollars from a company barisma in [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4457.56s)]
*  ukraine and these things all connect basically what happened was after the 2014 coup this company [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4463.72s)]
*  barisma they were and by the way matt taibbi has done incredible reporting on this i highly [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4470.68s)]
*  recommend everyone read his stuff his sub stacks incredible unbelievable but so basically [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4475.88s)]
*  barisma was in bed with the old government that had allied with russia and so when this government [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4481.56s)]
*  was overthrown they were very worried because they were like oh we were in bed with the old [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4487.88s)]
*  government and now there's this new government who's in there and so instead of bribing the new [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4491.88s)]
*  government they just went right to the source and bribed the son of the sitting vice president joe [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4497.160000000001s)]
*  biden when he was vice president was in charge of ukraine policy so they just went that was why they [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4504.120000000001s)]
*  put him there and then they put some other like cia guy or something like that on their board [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4509.64s)]
*  they're just paying him money to just be like hey keep us in with you and then trump was telling them [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4513.08s)]
*  to investigate all of this shit he got on the phone with them as was like i want to investigate [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4518.76s)]
*  everything that was going on with joe and hunter biden in ukraine and donald trump did he got into [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4523.64s)]
*  an area that it was there's an argument it was not okay what he was doing because he was kind of [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4530.360000000001s)]
*  going like maybe you don't get this these uh these weapons that i was going to send in unless [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4535.0s)]
*  you go investigate them and this was his political opponent so it was a little bit of a shady thing [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4539.96s)]
*  but then the other story about that is that ultimately trump caved and he sent in the weapons [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4545.4s)]
*  to ukraine so now not only did obama overthrow the regime when joe biden was the point man joe biden [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4550.28s)]
*  was running ukraine policy obama leads this coup overthrows that government and puts in a pro western [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4556.36s)]
*  government then trump comes in sends in a whole bunch of weapons to this new government that obama [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4562.52s)]
*  wouldn't even send in because he was concerned it would provoke uh russia and then the next president [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4567.400000000001s)]
*  is joe biden the last guy who was the point man on ukraine who who was there when this coup happened [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4573.64s)]
*  then he comes back in this is all like the context that led to vladimir putin invading ukraine so [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4580.120000000001s)]
*  again i'm not saying the other little thing i should mention there too is that that donbass region [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4587.240000000001s)]
*  on the eastern portion of ukraine is like majority ethnic russians and they got really pissed off at [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4591.8s)]
*  when the new government came in in 2014 and they were basically warring with uh with the the you [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4598.12s)]
*  know the kiev western portion of ukraine since then and they had a referendum in 2015 and voted [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4603.64s)]
*  overwhelmingly that they wanted to be a part of russia and vladimir putin didn't take them but they [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4609.400000000001s)]
*  said they voted that they wanted to be uh part of russia not a part of ukraine so it's just a very [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4613.96s)]
*  complicated mess and it's the same thing with like the war on terrorism if you're going to [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4619.16s)]
*  tell this story of like what led to this to understand where to go from here the story [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4623.24s)]
*  has to include that america was intervening in the middle east for decades before 9 11 the story [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4628.6s)]
*  can't just start at 9 11 you know what i mean and so i guess the the biggest part is what i said [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4633.48s)]
*  before that the concern of all of us should be just that there's no nuclear conflict between [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4638.84s)]
*  america and russia which seems like we're like dangerously close to more close at any point in [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4645.080000000001s)]
*  our lives than since the 80s when there was and and i grew up during that time there was this [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4652.120000000001s)]
*  hovering fear over most of america that it was there was a potential for nuclear war with russia [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4658.040000000001s)]
*  we always thought about it man when i was in high school we thought about it all the time [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4665.320000000001s)]
*  when the soviet union collapsed it was the greatest sigh of relief like in my adult life [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4669.48s)]
*  and it was the the hover of war with russia was out and then people got relaxed and then how long [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4675.639999999999s)]
*  did that last before operation desert storm uh a year yeah like maybe a year right and then it was [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4683.16s)]
*  like holy shit we're at war again i remember watching it on television i remember being so [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4690.12s)]
*  confused because when i was a kid vietnam ended and you know it was like i think it was eight [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4694.76s)]
*  or something like that i think i'm pretty sure i was living in san francisco i might have been [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4700.76s)]
*  a little older than that like what year did vietnam end uh 72 70 well wait when did we pull out [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4704.2s)]
*  oh man i might have that wrong 73 so whatever year that was so i was like uh probably [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4711.4800000000005s)]
*  nine or ten years old i think oh yeah i guess 75 but i think we were pretty much out uh before [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4718.6s)]
*  then maybe i'm wrong about that it wasn't until 75 okay so either way so i'm a kid and i remember [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4724.36s)]
*  thinking at that time like wow okay this is great now we're never gonna have war again because like [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4731.639999999999s)]
*  we figured out that we shouldn't have right i remember really thinking that as like whatever [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4738.92s)]
*  i was eight years old nine years old i remember thinking when there was hearing the war was done [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4742.679999999999s)]
*  there were soldiers are coming home i was thinking oh my god we're never gonna have war again because [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4747.719999999999s)]
*  i was terrified that i was gonna have to get drafted you know and um my stepfather uh he [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4751.4s)]
*  didn't get drafted he got lucky he was one of the lucky few because it was just it was a thing like [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4759.24s)]
*  people would dodge the draft they would fucking move to the woods they'd move to canada a lot [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4764.04s)]
*  of people moved to canada they're like fuck this and people don't understand how unpopular that was [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4767.799999999999s)]
*  that war was so unpopular that muhammad ali decided to give up his heavyweight championship [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4774.28s)]
*  of the world in his prime in his prime he was when he fought cleveland big cat williams which was [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4779.64s)]
*  was like what year was that that was ali's prime and for the next three years they made him sit [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4791.160000000001s)]
*  out and he didn't train he didn't do anything and he was a different fighter when he came back [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4798.52s)]
*  those three years of taking off like of not training at all like you could see it in his [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4802.360000000001s)]
*  he never moved the same way that he did before no no no he was a different guy he still had some [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4807.24s)]
*  great fights and some great wins after that but it wasn't yeah it wasn't it wasn't the same go to [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4811.96s)]
*  cleveland big big cat williams show me that because cleveland big cat williams was this like [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4816.28s)]
*  super powerful heavyweight he was jacked and he looked fantastic he was a knockout puncher [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4822.84s)]
*  and muhammad ali just danced around him it was magic man and he hit him with this fucking [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4829.0s)]
*  combination like if a middleweight threw combinations like this you would be [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4836.04s)]
*  shocked but here you have a heavyweight how light he is on his feet just already this was when he [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4841.0s)]
*  was in his prime this was ali at the very best this is before they took it away from him and if [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4846.28s)]
*  you look at him then it's timing everything his movement and cleveland big cat look how jack [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4850.6s)]
*  williams is i mean he's a dangerous fucking puncher and he's stalking muhammad ali and muhammad ali is [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4855.64s)]
*  just slowly putting it on him just finding the openings looking looking showing him this showing [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4861.72s)]
*  him that never standing right in front of him and as he got older he couldn't do that anymore man [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4867.64s)]
*  like when he fought foreman he essentially let foreman hit him he tired him out by doing the [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4873.160000000001s)]
*  rope-a-dope on him but back then ali was just sonny liston was fucking perplexed especially in [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4878.12s)]
*  their first fight the second fight it looks like sonny liston took a dive but in the first fight in [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4885.56s)]
*  the first fight he was trying to get ali to the point where he put liniment on his gloves and they [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4890.4400000000005s)]
*  he went back to his corner he said he's got something on his gloves got something on his [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4897.0s)]
*  gloves he goes and keep keep playing that and angelo dunn d was like you got it you can't quit [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4900.04s)]
*  we can't take the gloves off champ like you're in the heavyweight title fight like you got to fight [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4905.4800000000005s)]
*  through this so he fights through this and starts busting liston up and it eventually stops him and [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4909.400000000001s)]
*  wins the heavyweight title when listing quits in his corner but he was you know he was so good [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4915.32s)]
*  man he was so fast and nobody had seen a heavyweight move like this this looks like it'd be so [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4920.679999999999s)]
*  frustrating to fight someone like this oh so you're just walking them down and then they're [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4925.799999999999s)]
*  constantly gone and you're but there there he starts oh yeah so he starts tagging him and now [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4929.639999999999s)]
*  cleveland's confused because now he's getting hurt he's getting hurt by this guy's moving backwards [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4934.759999999999s)]
*  and he can't hit him look at that jab look at that jab dude i mean and his hands are low and [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4939.24s)]
*  it steps in with a left hook jab into the body and now he starts to piece him up and when he [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4944.28s)]
*  starts connecting with him you could see the magic that he had back then it was just there [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4949.400000000001s)]
*  was combinations that came from from him that you never saw a heavyweight throw you would see like [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4955.08s)]
*  sugar ray robinson throw combinations like this to see a guy who's 200 plus pounds doing it was just [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4961.96s)]
*  unheard of and even since then i mean when have you ever seen a heavyweight who fights like this [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4967.64s)]
*  nobody fights like him nobody fights like him and you'd think someone would have because he's like [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4972.36s)]
*  the greatest ever someone would have studied this and tried to replicate it but like no ollie could [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4976.12s)]
*  knock you out too man so once he starts finding cleveland's number and here you see him finding [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4981.48s)]
*  cleveland's number he's really starting to land some decent combinations on him and cleveland's [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4986.12s)]
*  still coming forward looking to land the haymaker he's got serious power and that's why he's so [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4990.679999999999s)]
*  confident right he's like moving forward because he knows if he could hit this fucking dude like [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4995.24s)]
*  he hits everybody else everybody goes night night and all this dancing and moving around and stuff [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=4999.0s)]
*  inconsequential if he could land on them it kind of it reminds me of the way anderson silver used [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5004.12s)]
*  to fight like in his prime where he'd dance around and then when he'd start really getting in his [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5008.12s)]
*  rhythm just open up like crazy but he was 185 pounds yeah there's a little bit of that to that [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5011.32s)]
*  but anderson was much more subtle in his movement anderson of course kicks and knees and all that [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5015.8s)]
*  shit anderson was just a master computer he would like download all your movements and put him in [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5021.4800000000005s)]
*  the master computer and then somewhere around the end of the first round he would start lighting [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5027.16s)]
*  you up and you're like oh shit he's like yep he collected all the data the only people that [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5031.0s)]
*  were successful against anderson made anderson lead it's very interesting patrick cote was one [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5036.2s)]
*  of the first guys to figure that out yeah he made anderson lead and patrick was super dangerous like [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5041.08s)]
*  serious one punch knockout power and so he like he had that right hand cocked and he made anderson [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5046.84s)]
*  lead and it was a very boring fight because anderson wouldn't lead and then somewhere in [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5052.84s)]
*  the fight unfortunately patrick blew his knee out and he blew his knee out like throwing a kick or [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5056.84s)]
*  something like that his knee exploded it was collapsed i remember i think it was when he was [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5061.4800000000005s)]
*  going into the third round and he held up number three i go that's how big the aura of invincibility [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5065.32s)]
*  around anderson silver was that he was like i'm in the third round yeah and everyone was like how is [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5071.56s)]
*  this even possible yeah how is it possible he hasn't killed you already well patrick was very [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5076.52s)]
*  smart very smart in his approach and he he fought a very intelligent fight if you're going to fight [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5081.08s)]
*  a guy like anderson silver and patrick always had the threat of the one big knockout punch [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5087.48s)]
*  he knocked out everybody man patrick cote if he connected whoo that guy was throwing some [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5092.04s)]

*  get involved in coaching you know because some of them actually make better coaches than they made [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5107.88s)]
*  fighters yeah like dean thomas was a really good fighter but he's probably a better coach than he [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5111.72s)]
*  was fighter because he's like one of the best he's got the best insight whenever we come to him like [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5116.200000000001s)]
*  he should actually he's great he should be doing commentary for events as well not just doing the [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5120.68s)]

*  i think this fight this was like my favorite version of ali yeah because it's kind of a little [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5143.639999999999s)]
*  bit of a mismatch ultimately we know because ali went on to be the greatest arguably of all time [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5149.639999999999s)]

*  it's just like such a great bit because it's completely true it's like it's like when you [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5413.56s)]
*  put it like this how is this not the most insane shit ever that's literally what the supposed like [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5418.12s)]
*  leaders are deciding yeah well he was that's one of the reasons why he was so important is [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5423.0s)]
*  because he he wasn't just an important um athlete like the greatest boxer that we'd ever seen as a [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5428.04s)]
*  heavyweight for sure but he was also an important cultural figure because when he was saying no [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5433.96s)]
*  vietcom ever guy ever did anything to me i'm not going to go over there and kill people and he said [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5439.4800000000005s)]
*  it publicly like this is why i have no problem with vietnam people why am i going over there to [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5444.04s)]

*  and as it turns out it was for no good reason based all sold off a lie yeah all just like all [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5451.72s)]
*  the other ones another conspiracy the gulf of tonkin incident is a real conspiracy and that's [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5456.28s)]
*  not even something that people debate anymore it's just like this is this is just known you go to the [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5461.88s)]
*  gulf of tonkin so we can because i don't want to fuck this up but the way we got into the vietnam war [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5466.84s)]
*  was basically just a made-up story and it's true with the the lucitania in world war one two it's [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5474.4400000000005s)]
*  like completely uh the way the story was told to the american people what's that story it was [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5480.6s)]
*  basically that there was like oh this ship that had americans on it was shot down by german [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5485.32s)]
*  submarines and they were like well why would they do this they knew it was just a ship of of [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5492.68s)]
*  civilians but then it turns out that actually the ship was delivering weapons to the british and so [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5497.16s)]
*  it's like oh yeah you were delivering weapons into a war zone got a little bit more reasonable [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5502.44s)]
*  to shoot down your ship the gulf of tonkin incident occurred august of 1964 north vietnamese warships [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5507.32s)]
*  purportedly attacked united states warships the uss ss uh usss uss maddox and the uss c turner j [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5514.68s)]
*  two separate occasions in the gulf of tonkin a body of water neighboring modern day vietnam [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5526.280000000001s)]
*  but what actually happened new documents and tapes reveal that with the stories could not prove [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5531.0s)]
*  there was not a second attack on u.s navy ships in the tonkin gulf in august of 1964 furthermore [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5536.84s)]
*  the evidence suggests a disturbing and deliberate attempt by the secretary defense [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5543.88s)]
*  mactamara to distort the evidence and mislead congress [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5548.92s)]
*  um so so was there an initial attack and not a secondary attack was there any attack at all [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5555.4800000000005s)]
*  yeah i haven't read up on this in a while but they definitely made that up and it was completely [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5566.52s)]
*  misrepresented and yeah it was all like you know it's hard because it still seems like the official [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5572.2s)]
*  story is that it's not a hoax the official see look what it's saying there like it says it was [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5577.48s)]
*  passed on august 7 1964 by the u.s congress after an alleged attack on two u.s naval destroyers [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5585.16s)]
*  sanctions in the coast of vietnam it doesn't say that that was a hoax well the history.com version [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5592.12s)]
*  probably wouldn't go into the right right but is it a conspiracy is my question or is it just [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5596.68s)]
*  proven fact over time that just hasn't been accepted because the initial narrative by the [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5603.0s)]
*  government has never been rescinded yeah i don't i think that it at least partially has been [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5609.64s)]
*  admitted that at least they they lied about the way they presented it jamie will get to see what [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5615.72s)]
*  i mean what do you um just give me a full research project on the golf of tonkin right now you have [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5620.68s)]
*  time uh is um is there a way to see whether or not it was a hoax like how do they know if it was [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5625.32s)]
*  or was not a hoax there's no source to go to for that necessarily so when people say that the golf [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5635.719999999999s)]
*  of tonkin tonkin was a hoax are they just hearing it from me and repeating it it's not just from you [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5641.5599999999995s)]

*  is based on provable fact yeah i'd have to i i did i remember learning all about this but it was [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5653.16s)]

*  you repeat it based off your previous memory of this but i'm like no i remember knowing this [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5667.48s)]
*  so i'm pretty confident in repeating it that is the worst thing about memory like you can [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5671.4s)]
*  repeat a memory of it wrong all right yep here's another uh reporting of this it says there remains [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5675.96s)]

*  but this is boring already yeah but basically the whole thing was was completely misconstrued and [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5888.36s)]
*  made up right like so that what they're saying is that they they acted like oh it was just they [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5892.92s)]
*  this unprovoked attack on one of our naval ships when actually the first attack our [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5897.16s)]
*  naval ship was involved in this intel in this what they called aggressive intelligence gathering [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5901.0s)]

*  twice by the other side and then the days preceding it so they responded and then the second attack [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5910.04s)]
*  just never even happened right so that's i mean it's it's and the thing about it is is that there [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5914.28s)]
*  it's it's like it's like they knowingly lied about this because they wanted a pretense to [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5919.4s)]
*  get into the war and that's it's so much how all of these wars start and all of the ones since but [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5924.44s)]
*  the difference is like at least in vietnam basically the thing has been since world war [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5929.24s)]
*  two that like we fought a whole lot of wars but we don't fight wars with nuclear armed powers [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5933.799999999999s)]
*  we fought a few proxy wars with nuclear armed powers like vietnam and a proxy war with russia [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5939.879999999999s)]
*  in vietnam or in korea like a proxy war with russia but in korea but there was a buffer zone [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5945.16s)]
*  there like it wasn't right on russia's border and it wasn't right on our border so we could kind of [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5950.12s)]
*  like fight these proxy wars out there but the thing with ukraine is that it's like like i really [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5955.64s)]
*  think the thing that scares me about the nuclear threat from vladimir putin is that i feel like he [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5961.08s)]
*  can't lose this war and the american position is that he must lose he must completely lose the war [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5965.64s)]
*  and retreat and give ukraine all back to ukraine and it's like however you feel about that that's [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5973.96s)]
*  just not going to happen that's not going to happen he's not handing the whole thing back over [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5979.08s)]
*  and you may think that's wrong and i kind of think it's wrong too i don't know i think maybe [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5983.72s)]
*  he should keep donbass i don't really know but it's like it's not going to happen and he joe [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5987.48s)]
*  biden is acting like this is it's he must win this war but that's not really true like we don't really [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5993.5599999999995s)]
*  need it but vladimir putin does need it he can't lose a war right on his border you know like that's [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=5999.8s)]
*  a different type of thing to give up and so now he's saying that if the territory of russia [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6005.24s)]
*  is infringed on he will use nuclear weapons and he said straight up this is not a bluff [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6011.5599999999995s)]
*  he goes this is not a bluff i will use nukes he's just said this the other day and then zelinsky [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6016.44s)]
*  goes on on and gives a speech and zelinsky says that his standard is not just that russia has to [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6021.88s)]
*  retreat and give back all the territory to ukraine but that russia must be punished [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6028.36s)]
*  for the aggression into ukraine and then zelinsky says that if russia even thinks about using nukes [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6033.4800000000005s)]
*  that the other nuclear armed countries should use their nukes against russia and you're just like [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6040.84s)]
*  dude what the fuck are we talking about here and like i'm sorry no no we shouldn't we shouldn't [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6045.96s)]
*  use nukes against russia preemptively because this zelinsky guy wants us to the people that we have [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6053.96s)]
*  that run the country there's not one thing that you point to and you go well they're fucking [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6060.52s)]
*  awesome at that right not one thing not one thing where you're like i have full trust in them when [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6066.360000000001s)]
*  it comes to that not a single not a single thing yet we're entrusting them with the biggest most [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6072.6s)]
*  important thing ever yeah avoiding a nuclear war imagine how crazy that is now imagine what kind [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6078.360000000001s)]

*  the people that are like the thought leaders of the world these are the people that win the [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6089.72s)]
*  popularity contest and a lot of them are winning because they're connected to whatever the fucking [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6093.08s)]
*  current hive mind ideology is and they pump up and they use these words and they say the certain [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6099.240000000001s)]
*  things that that group is saying whether it's on the right or the left that's what a lot of these [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6105.64s)]
*  people are doing well it's kind of and it's kind of the flaw it's a flaw in in the democratic process [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6109.240000000001s)]
*  in a way yeah because it's like well i'll just play to the most low information you know voters [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6114.92s)]

*  mind reading yeah maybe oh maybe that maybe that's what that's coming dude let's hope that comes [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6127.08s)]
*  before the uh this nuclear war i think that's gonna be like life before the internet and life [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6132.92s)]
*  after the internet but like times a million and i think it's coming and i don't think that's uh [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6138.52s)]
*  i don't think it's an if it's a matter of when and only if if we don't blow ourselves up or [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6144.04s)]
*  get involved in some sort of a natural disaster get hit by an asteroid super volcano that kind [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6150.68s)]
*  of shit could fuck everything up but if that doesn't happen if we can just keep going on this [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6155.4s)]
*  path and let these super nerds figure shit out for the next thousand years or hundred years or [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6160.44s)]
*  whatever it is that it's going to change everything because we're going to know how people actually [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6166.12s)]
*  operate how they're actually thinking and it's going to be really weird because like all of our [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6171.64s)]
*  thoughts of romance and and interpersonal relationships and how people really feel about [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6176.280000000001s)]

*  thing and and i'd imagine i mean i don't know enough about this but i'd imagine even before [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6187.400000000001s)]

*  reading whether they're lying or not you know what i mean just knowing whether what they're saying is [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6195.400000000001s)]

*  country and family and i understand i can understand um so i grew up in a very liberal [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6498.36s)]

*  a political leader campaigning on god yeah uh nation and family like they're like hey this should [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6510.04s)]
*  somehow like government should be neutral on those issues or something like that but you know at [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6515.4s)]
*  least i would think like if you're like a liberal or a leftist or something at least i understand [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6520.36s)]
*  like why do you think it is that that message is so appealing to so many people and you have to [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6525.32s)]
*  almost objectively say that like look those things are things that a lot of people care about you [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6529.96s)]
*  know like just just in the the 20th century alone how many people were willing to go and fight in [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6536.759999999999s)]
*  wars for under the banner of nationalism like for their country you know yeah and like people care [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6542.36s)]
*  about their country and obviously people care about their god a lot and obviously people care [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6547.64s)]
*  about their family a lot and what i saw of her assuming the translation was correct in her speech [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6551.56s)]
*  was she was saying that these things are constantly under attack right now and there's no need like we [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6557.0s)]
*  don't have to live in a society where like uh christianity and patriotism and family is constantly [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6563.240000000001s)]
*  being demonized like all of the things that we like to identify as are constantly being demonized [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6572.12s)]
*  and i would at least like say to like left wingers you know if you keep up this game of like demonizing [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6577.96s)]
*  all of those things there's going to be a right wing response to it people are going to rally [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6583.96s)]
*  around the political leaders who are like saying like no we're for traditional families and [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6589.08s)]
*  christianity and national greatness and i'm not even saying i'm for that but i get the appeal of [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6593.8s)]
*  that yeah but not even saying traditional family just family period yeah i mean it's not it's not [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6599.56s)]
*  labeling it but traditional family but the idea that those things would be offensive yeah it [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6604.200000000001s)]
*  shouldn't be but here's the thing it wouldn't be offensive it was a particular god so like if you're [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6609.160000000001s)]
*  talking about islam like if you are against anything that is islamic or muslim you'll be [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6613.64s)]
*  thought of as islamophobic that's there's no christianophobic which is fascinating yeah it's [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6621.0s)]
*  really weird because there's there's a political leaning in in this country where where people look [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6626.68s)]
*  at people that have certain religious beliefs and they'll mock them like christianity is a very easy [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6633.88s)]
*  one to mock because well the easiest are like scientology that's number one sure and then [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6639.4800000000005s)]
*  mormonism is you know it's like joseph smith was 14 when you wrote that you know it's kind of it's [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6644.76s)]
*  wild shit right but those are easy but when it comes to like the one that you're allowed to mock [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6650.04s)]
*  you're allowed to mock christians that's the one that's like the easiest to mock if you mock [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6655.96s)]
*  muslims and islamic culture like you're in danger yeah but i would also physical danger yes i also [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6661.719999999999s)]
*  think you're you're right about all of that but also a distinction that i'd make is like it seems [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6668.599999999999s)]
*  to me when there's the the mocking of mormons or something like that is more of a kind of like [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6673.16s)]
*  making fun of them whereas with christians there seems to be like real vitriol in it with them like [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6679.0s)]
*  there's more hatred toward them to stupidity it's almost it's connected to like a lack of [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6684.68s)]
*  intelligence and a lack of education and you know yeah no question about that and when in fact it's [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6690.84s)]
*  like you know the the truth is that for for better or for worse and there was a lot of both there's [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6698.44s)]
*  a lot of good and bad but christianity i mean you know had a huge impact on civilization and it's [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6703.24s)]
*  like it was the the foundational ideology of western civilization now that doesn't mean you [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6709.88s)]
*  have to be a christian but it all of that is really dismissed like the contributions that [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6716.28s)]
*  christianity made to the world that so many of us enjoy well you mean it's not like christianity [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6722.04s)]
*  needs a fucking star in the hollywood walk of fame but it's but it is it's an ideology that [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6726.92s)]
*  millions of people hold and there's tenets in it that could lead to a better world if people [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6733.96s)]
*  followed them that's undeniable for sure treat people as if they're your brothers and sisters and [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6742.2s)]
*  the you know do unto others as you would have them do unto you there's certain principles involved [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6749.0s)]
*  in a lot of religions that are that guide ethical behavior yeah and as the problem is you're so [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6754.68s)]
*  outdated well that's true but the well that's the problem right but you're reading these things [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6760.12s)]
*  it's so like they condone slavery they treat women as second-class citizens there's like a lot of [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6764.92s)]
*  weird shit but but most of that stuff at least in christianity isn't actually followed in practice [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6769.5599999999995s)]
*  today right like people aren't practicing slavery and aren't practicing treating women like second [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6775.5599999999995s)]
*  class citizens the way it's laid out in the bible and you know the thing like the flaw to me at least [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6779.64s)]
*  the flaw in atheism is that it's always the idea is always sold as like well look you have like [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6785.48s)]
*  you have reason and then you have faith and faith is believing something in the absence of reason [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6797.32s)]
*  so reason is preferable to faith but the issue is when you remove religion it never is in any mass [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6802.2s)]
*  level replaced with reason it's always replaced with another religion right you know it's and and [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6811.8s)]
*  because the desire to worship is so hardwired into humans that like you know you see you look [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6817.16s)]
*  at the most insane like woke kids and some college campus they're all atheists yeah but they're not [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6822.68s)]
*  atheists they're the most religious zealots amongst us you know what i mean so it's like you remove [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6829.400000000001s)]
*  this thing and then it's like the promise of this vacuum will be filled with reason never really [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6835.0s)]
*  comes true and and at least while you're right when you say like okay well these religions are [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6839.96s)]
*  very old and outdated but the flip side to that is like well they've been stable for thousands of [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6844.28s)]
*  years these have at least been able to work and if you accept that basically there's going to be [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6849.8s)]
*  some religion whatever it is you know like the nazis basically got rid of religion the commies [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6854.36s)]
*  really got rid of religion but there was just state religion is what you know filled the void [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6859.96s)]
*  and it was much worse much worse than christianity so you're like if there's going to be a religion [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6864.68s)]
*  one way or the other i'd probably like the one that is at least has thousands of years of stability [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6869.88s)]
*  behind it and has at least like moderated on its worst issues and is no longer being used as a [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6875.32s)]
*  justification for how many times you can beat your slave a day even though that is in the book [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6881.16s)]
*  you know what i mean but like people aren't really doing that anymore so yeah if you're going to base [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6885.4800000000005s)]
*  it all on that to the to the word then you're going to have a problem in modern society sure like then [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6892.28s)]
*  how can you be a christian and follow those rules well yeah that's going to be tough that's if that's [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6899.4800000000005s)]
*  what it's saying but i think what people need is something that makes sense for today you know [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6906.360000000001s)]
*  something that and i think it's probably psychedelics i think if there's going to be a thing that brings [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6913.56s)]
*  people the problem is that that the problem with that is just like the problem with anything else [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6921.240000000001s)]
*  it's humans and humans get involved in things and ego get involved in things the next thing you know [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6926.12s)]
*  you're a guru the next thing you know you're banging all your disciples and you're living on [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6931.72s)]
*  some fucking you know like wild wild country you know like that's what that's where it fucking goes [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6935.48s)]
*  because because of humans because we are primates and we we do have these fucking weird dominator [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6940.92s)]
*  minds and even when you connect them to psychedelics it creates these people that like they get all this [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6945.8s)]
*  adoration out of like introducing the ceremonies and having people you know come together and do [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6951.08s)]
*  these things together and they it's it's a weird thing well there's always with all these things [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6956.5199999999995s)]
*  there's a lot of benefits but there's also like the negative sides right so it's like people do [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6959.96s)]
*  have um particularly with like psychedelics like with with mushrooms and lsd and stuff like that [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6964.28s)]
*  people do have these like pretty amazing experiences yes and i've had some and um there's [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6970.84s)]
*  a lot that you can learn about the world through them but then they also do make it kind of like [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6976.599999999999s)]
*  you know and i've never done a dmt or ayahuasca or whatever but particularly with those like [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6981.639999999999s)]
*  you are in a state where like okay if you have some guru or whatever who's like leading you [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6986.5199999999995s)]
*  through the journey well that person is put in a position of a lot of power over you now you know [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6990.12s)]
*  what i mean and you see like this stuff with manson he would like he would stay sober and [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6994.44s)]
*  give them all the mushrooms and then guide them in these crazy directions and stuff like that [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=6998.599999999999s)]

*  yeah by just not having him be touched and then that same guy gets involved in the harvard lsd [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7133.72s)]
*  studies jesus christ goes on to blow people up like what a shocker yeah really fuck man and he [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7139.16s)]
*  was a super genius which is like the worst combination ever and so of course like there's [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7144.76s)]
*  these things right like if you like you know when people first like really started discovering when [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7149.24s)]
*  they discovered lsd and when people like you know what i mean like it's like there is this thing [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7154.12s)]
*  was wow this has so much potential it's very interesting and we don't exactly understand it [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7158.36s)]
*  but it really creates this these like experiences and then it's like you leave it to like the [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7162.12s)]
*  government to be like well let's use this in the most fucked up way imaginable how about that [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7165.8s)]
*  let's dose up john's when they're going to brothels and study them through mirrors it's just insane [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7170.28s)]
*  oh but i do think there's like with even with uh with pot which is i guess just a mild uh a [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7175.88s)]
*  milder hallucinogen right um i think there are there are a lot of benefits to smoking pot but [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7182.12s)]
*  then there's also like these real these real problems with it i know i used to smoke a ton [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7188.68s)]
*  of pot and i think that um i i kind of credit i think it's a one of the reasons why i'm good [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7193.08s)]
*  at breaking down this type of stuff i think it really helped i think there was there was [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7199.16s)]
*  something about it that was it it allowed me to um to kind of zoom out and question things and [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7203.96s)]
*  look at them in different ways you know what i mean like it's a very uh uh you remember the [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7210.76s)]
*  video you did that went super viral i think it was before you started the podcast it was right [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7216.04s)]
*  around the time that went real viral about you talking about war and stuff like that and it was [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7220.36s)]
*  like this viral video someone edited it together and it was all you talked about and i remember [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7224.28s)]
*  you said in the thing i loved it where you were like wait a minute so we fight these wars you're [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7227.799999999999s)]
*  telling me we send big metal machines of death to go like rip human beings apart and just the way [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7232.04s)]
*  you describe that that's like that's the way somebody who's done some hallucinogens or like [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7238.44s)]
*  smoked some weed in their life would describe it i smoked some weed five minutes before i said that [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7242.839999999999s)]
*  well but that's but that's the way you would describe it's like well let's zoom out and just [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7247.56s)]
*  like look at this from a different angle like what the fuck are we doing here you know because [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7250.68s)]
*  that's what like that's what hallucinogens let you do they kind of like that you rise above your own [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7255.240000000001s)]
*  little preconceptions and your things and you focus on what's really going on here but then like the [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7261.0s)]
*  downside to that is that that also allows for like escapism because you're you're not worried [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7267.0s)]
*  about your own little dumb life anymore you're worried about like the bigger picture and things [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7273.08s)]
*  but sometimes people need to be worried about their own life they actually need to be worried [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7278.44s)]
*  about like how are you going to make rent this month or how are you going to do this this month [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7283.08s)]
*  and i see that with young with young guys sometimes where it's like but that you are smoking way too [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7286.2s)]
*  much pot yeah that's where personal responsibility comes into play yeah the my description of pot was [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7290.44s)]
*  like it's like a tool like any other tool like a hammer you could build a house with it or you [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7295.5599999999995s)]
*  could hit yourself in the dick yeah fucking crazy i think that's right and that's that's what the [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7299.96s)]
*  way i think about marijuana like i think you have to have you have to have some structure and you [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7304.28s)]
*  have to have some discipline in your life to get anything done now if you don't have those things [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7308.76s)]
*  and then you also really enjoy getting high that's going to be a problem yeah yeah that's a bad [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7314.12s)]
*  combination problem is not getting high the problem is your behavior patterns lack structure and [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7318.68s)]
*  discipline if you knew the things you had to do and you went out and did them and you pursued them [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7325.32s)]
*  because they were the most important things whether it's finding meaningful work whether it's [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7329.88s)]
*  getting you know whatever whatever you're trying to do in your life focus on that primarily because [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7333.96s)]
*  that's what's going to get you ahead in life yeah and if you're not doing that that's the problem [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7338.92s)]
*  and if you're smoking pot at the same time you're not doing that it's not the pot's fault it's your [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7343.88s)]
*  fault yeah i completely agree and anyway none of that is a justification for any of it being [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7349.56s)]
*  none of it is it's insane and too many people find benefit in it it's too beneficial medically [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7355.719999999999s)]
*  like psychologically it's it's too beneficial but even and even the stuff that you could argue is [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7361.32s)]
*  not beneficial um should also yes like cocaine it should all be legal cocaine because if cocaine [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7366.5199999999995s)]
*  was legal we would have so much less less death in this country so much less death we got a hundred [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7372.28s)]
*  thousand ods a year yeah in this country right now number one cause of death for people 18 to 49 is [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7377.5599999999995s)]
*  overdose the life expectancy is going down because of the overdose epidemic and we still [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7383.32s)]
*  can't just work up the the like the will to just be like give it up just call call it quits on this [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7388.2s)]
*  war on drugs that they're dying because they're getting fentanyl on the black market and they have [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7395.32s)]
*  no idea what the dosage is of it and people are going out and getting what they're told is heroin [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7400.2s)]
*  and they're told is cocaine and has all types of other shit in it the uh they're they're not they [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7405.16s)]
*  can't get these opioids anymore so now they have to go and try to get them from drug dealers you [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7410.04s)]
*  got people dying in the the drug trade the smuggling coming in from mexico and that all goes away if you [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7414.36s)]
*  just legalize it not saying everything's perfect i'm not saying and when i say all of it i mean i [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7420.5199999999995s)]
*  don't mean like that nobody will ever abuse drugs if they're legal i'm just saying that you the [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7425.08s)]
*  smuggling is completely over and then the the overdose numbers will like drastically be reduced [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7430.28s)]
*  because at least people will know what they're getting and know they're getting clean stuff and [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7436.36s)]
*  like know they're getting the right dosage and stuff like that it's just like it's insane like [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7440.12s)]

*  yeah well it's got you have to be it has to be regulated and it has to be legal because if it's [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7469.32s)]
*  not you're going to get unregulated illegal drugs and you're going to prop up criminal [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7475.8s)]
*  organizations that are extremely violent that could just walk across the border that's what's [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7480.28s)]

*  out and say what joe biden just said the other day he goes oh if china invaded uh taiwan we would [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7757.32s)]
*  send in the military well the problem with that is like that might be the encouragement taiwan needs [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7764.52s)]
*  to go okay then we declare independence and if they declare independence china will invade taiwan [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7770.360000000001s)]

*  like i'd vote for trump before i'd vote for biden and the reason being is like you knew this you [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7814.92s)]
*  knew he was deteriorating forget about his policies when he was lucid yeah forget about like [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7819.72s)]

*  yeah he was much much better if you listen to like a speech he gave in 2012 or 2013 he has [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7832.52s)]
*  lost several steps see regardless of what you think about his policies like as a human that's [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7838.84s)]
*  in a position of extreme stress and power that is nuts that's nuts that's nuts it's really [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7844.92s)]
*  unbelievable that's insane he's so far gone and i mean look that this was the knock on donald [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7852.28s)]
*  trump is like well he'll say reckless things but i mean what is more reckless than just like and [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7858.04s)]
*  the crazy thing about it you know even henry kissinger like came out recently and was talking [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7864.04s)]
*  about how insane this whole uh ukraine uh policy is because he's like well what do you do is the [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7868.68s)]
*  plan here that we're going to provoke russia and china like we're going to provoke nuclear [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7874.04s)]
*  conflict with the two countries who you just don't want to have a nuclear conflict with [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7879.72s)]
*  and you know whatever anyone says and i know there's some like uh um some of the the kind [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7883.08s)]
*  of populist right-winger types who are real china hawks and are really concerned about china but [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7887.32s)]
*  the the truth is that neither one of these countries pose a military threat to america [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7892.6s)]
*  it's just like it's there's just no way there's no way that they pose a military threat to us like [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7899.48s)]
*  does just trying to pose a military threat to taiwan perhaps you could argue that although [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7905.08s)]
*  the peace has been kept for many decades now but perhaps you can argue they they they pose a threat [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7909.16s)]
*  to them but they don't pose a threat to us and the idea that we're like trying to find it's just so [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7913.5599999999995s)]
*  bananas that you go okay so we have 20 years of the war on terrorism which is basically at this point [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7918.919999999999s)]
*  almost nobody even argues that it was anything short of a disaster i mean i've seen i've i saw [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7927.16s)]
*  bill crystal debate uh scott horton who's incredible everyone should check him out scott horton at [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7933.0s)]
*  anti-war.com and he debated him in new york city and one of the people in the crowd asked a question [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7938.92s)]
*  bill crystal you know neocon number one guy and he goes what was the last u.s.a intervention that [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7945.08s)]
*  was successful and he uh i think he said um i can't remember if he said uh he ever said said [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7951.16s)]
*  kosovo or something like that maybe bosnia i can't remember which one he said but even he didn't [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7958.04s)]
*  try to defend any of the interventions of the 21st century he didn't even try to say he couldn't [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7962.5199999999995s)]
*  he couldn't even look this kid who asked him the question look him in the eye and go uh iraq [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7968.04s)]
*  afghanistan libya syria somalia yemen pakistan like no he couldn't he couldn't even tell him so we have [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7972.84s)]
*  20 years of just disastrous wars at least a couple million you know innocent people dead not [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7980.52s)]
*  to mention i don't know what 50 000 of our soldiers who have blown their brains out after they came [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7986.76s)]
*  back from these wars a few thousand who died in the battles you know and trillions of dollars [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7991.400000000001s)]
*  wasted nothing to show for it and finally we end the longest one the war in afghanistan you know [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=7996.200000000001s)]
*  and we're finally kind of moving toward like okay we kind of recognize this is wrong so let's start [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8001.8s)]
*  provoking a war with russia and how about china too like what the it's like what you were talking [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8006.84s)]
*  about at the end of the the collapse of the soviet union and then you're like oh good we don't have [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8011.24s)]
*  to be at war no more and you're like saddam hussein we gotta go fight this guy now we're just always [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8014.92s)]
*  trying to find the next war i'd say this is potentially even stupider than that because [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8020.2s)]
*  they're talking the biden guys they're talking about putin like he's saddam hussein like he's [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8024.76s)]
*  momar kaddafi like we could just tell him what to do and he has to fucking do it but he doesn't [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8028.68s)]
*  because he's sitting on the biggest nuclear arsenal in the history of the world second only [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8033.48s)]
*  to ours i think his is first actually might be first yes actually might be i thought ours was [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8037.32s)]
*  the biggest yes yeah i think you're right about that but it's like it's kind of a moot point [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8041.879999999999s)]
*  because we can all destroy the world many times over yes yes and then there's the threat of [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8046.12s)]
*  hypersonic weapons yeah yeah that apparently he has that's what he says well didn't he engage [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8050.679999999999s)]
*  one in syria didn't they try one yeah i read that i don't know if they're no no it was he [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8056.28s)]
*  it was in ukraine it was recently i don't know about this i read about this but i haven't like [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8063.08s)]
*  verified like if that was confirmed that it's actually true but i know that basically this was [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8067.08s)]
*  his big thing in response to george w bush putting the the dual rocket launchers in uh poland is that [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8071.64s)]
*  he was like well now our entire effort is to like improve our military capability because you can [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8078.92s)]
*  hit us quicker so now we have to be able to hit you quicker and it's just been like this brinksmanship [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8083.4s)]
*  for so long it's just so stupid we have these really narrow narratives that were fed in this [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8088.04s)]
*  country and this one of the things that i love most about this conversation is because these [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8094.36s)]
*  these all these things that you've laid out and all of these things that most people are not aware [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8098.44s)]
*  of about the history of this conflict like now people get an understanding of how this is a [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8104.68s)]
*  pattern that just is going this is what heisenhower warned of this is a pattern that exists and is [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8109.4s)]
*  going to exist in this current form if we keep supporting it yeah no that that's it and just that [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8116.76s)]
*  it's it's not um and it's not that there's you know and then i get people who try to like almost [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8122.280000000001s)]
*  you know like kind of counter with the simple opposite narrative it's like well you're supporting [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8127.16s)]
*  this or we have to support the freedom of these people and stuff but i i really think what what [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8130.84s)]
*  has to break in america is this empire mentality this mentality that even if something is bad is [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8135.56s)]
*  happening around the world well then we must go and stop it and you're like you know i i heard [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8143.16s)]
*  people talking about this with the the protest going on in iran right now we have to support [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8148.84s)]
*  these people who want freedom and you're like dude this country was just locked down [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8153.16s)]
*  for like a year and a half we were in lockdowns maybe we're not in the position to start exporting [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8157.72s)]
*  freedom around the world why don't we like start at home let's try to make this a free country [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8164.44s)]
*  let's work toward that and you know paradoxically every time we go to expand freedom around the [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8169.56s)]
*  world we get less and less freedom here and then we don't end up giving any freedom that you know [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8175.4800000000005s)]
*  it's like we got to go uh bring freedom freedom anywhere where it's like super successful i mean [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8179.56s)]
*  you could argue that like in in post world war two japan and germany but by the way that also [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8184.360000000001s)]
*  came with the price tag of slaughtering their civilian population you know like it's not as if [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8190.120000000001s)]
*  that just went easy but you know then if you look at the war on terrorism i mean we went to spread [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8196.04s)]
*  freedom to the middle east but that comes with the price tag of the patriot act in the department of [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8200.36s)]
*  homeland security and you know all of this stuff and then by the way we didn't bring any freedom [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8203.960000000001s)]
*  there either so and i think that what we were saying earlier about the way the internet has [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8207.720000000001s)]
*  kind of changed the way people view governments and people view information and people have acts [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8214.28s)]
*  we were more informed maybe more confused in a lot of ways than ever before but i think mind reading [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8219.320000000002s)]
*  is the next one maybe i think when that happens we're fucked we're fucked for a while because [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8226.04s)]
*  it's going to be mad chaos where people try to make sense of people's real thoughts and real [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8231.0s)]
*  intentions and the real mechanisms behind everything that runs the world all of our money our government [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8236.76s)]
*  the mindsets of people that are just trying to acquire money and how insane that is how insane [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8243.480000000001s)]
*  is that just the pursuit of only numbers that's it the constant pursuit of numbers and objects [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8247.960000000001s)]
*  well there's also like it's it's there's this thing where there's like the pursuit of money [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8254.2s)]
*  is almost like i break it up into like two categories where there's like there's a lot [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8259.0s)]
*  of people pursuing money but a lot of people are pursuing money like private citizens you know like [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8262.6s)]
*  in the marketplace are like even if they're really trying to pursue money basically the only way they [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8266.6s)]
*  can get it is like by offering a product to people and see if they want it right it's like if you want [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8271.480000000001s)]
*  this if you're willing to buy this then i can make money off of that but you only buy it if you think [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8276.36s)]
*  well i would like to have that i value that and then there are these people who are connected to [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8281.4s)]
*  the government who are basically in rigged games where they've rigged they've stacked the deck [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8285.72s)]
*  against regular people where you essentially have to give them money you don't have a choice [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8290.52s)]
*  and so like that's and those people are just like that's a win-lose relationship not like a [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8294.76s)]
*  win-win relationship you know what i mean and i really think the only hope like i've said this [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8299.4s)]
*  to you before but i think the only hope for america is some form of liberty some form of [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8304.6s)]
*  libertarianism like we've just gone way too much in the other direction of like the government [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8309.24s)]
*  having way too much power and running everybody's lives and the only way to like to like save this [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8313.48s)]
*  thing to cool off the culture war to stop drowning the next generation in debt and destroying our [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8318.92s)]
*  currency and all of this stuff is to just like there's got to be some form of like decentralization [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8324.199999999999s)]
*  limiting of the power of government rolling back some of these institutions and the only way to do [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8330.28s)]
*  that is to get enough people to demand it and then enough powerful people to support that you [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8335.32s)]
*  know like get enough like powerful people like on board with this and enough popular support to to [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8341.48s)]
*  just like be like okay there's real will the problem is once the game is rigged it's hard [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8346.68s)]
*  to get people to go back to normal it is they've had a rig game for a long time to to open it up [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8352.6s)]
*  to an ethical logical reasonable playing field at this point in the game where it's like really [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8359.48s)]
*  locked down well you mean like so from the track so you're saying like for those special interests [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8365.56s)]
*  who have this game rigged right so like i think what it's almost got to be is some combination of [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8370.44s)]
*  like where the there's enough of the people who are so angry and are just demanding their their [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8374.68s)]
*  freedom and that this this rigged game be rolled back and then it's almost kind of like they're [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8379.48s)]
*  like look you got away with this for a long time but you're going to meet something like you're [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8384.52s)]
*  going to meet a very bad fate if you continue on this path well i don't want there to be violence [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8388.84s)]
*  you'd much rather be like hey look take this deal cut your losses net like you did this you got away [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8394.84s)]
*  with it for a long time go away stop doing it because look how angry you're going to make these [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8401.32s)]
*  people if you continue ripping them off um but you i you always want a peaceful solution to all of [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8405.4s)]
*  this stuff but there's got to be you know like look i'll say the thing that to me is like the [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8410.76s)]
*  silver lining the note of optimism is that there there really is something important about people [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8415.48s)]
*  waking up there's a reason why they work so hard to propagandize people there's a reason why they [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8420.68s)]
*  flipped out on you so much for having just like dr malone and people like that on your show they're [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8425.4s)]
*  really concerned about that they're really concerned that you might talk to people and [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8430.199999999999s)]
*  that they might hear from this expert and they might believe him it's like why are they so [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8434.039999999999s)]
*  concerned about that because if they knew that they may not support these policies and if they [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8437.56s)]
*  don't support these policies they may not be able to get away with them that's ultimately why the [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8442.28s)]
*  covid passports failed just because enough people were outraged about it they didn't even give this [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8446.04s)]
*  a lot of coverage a huge protest in new york city over this stuff and then it was just like people [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8450.36s)]
*  weren't doing it they were they weren't following the rules and stuff and eventually they just [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8455.0s)]
*  walked it back there's there's like real power in waking people up and so that's what that's i [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8458.44s)]
*  think there's there's at least a hope for the country now that it's like people don't trust [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8464.44s)]
*  these institutions that they shouldn't trust because they're just lying to them and there's [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8468.04s)]
*  platforms like yours you know what i mean where that are bigger than any of those platforms where [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8471.16s)]
*  people can hear the truth so i'm optimistic at least for that as long as we stop provoking [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8474.84s)]
*  putin and we don't fight a nuclear war yeah all the above and i think there's just the problem [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8479.56s)]
*  is that people who talk like you don't become governors they don't become senators maybe maybe [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8485.72s)]
*  senators maybe but they generally know and don't become president yeah you know you have to play [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8492.68s)]
*  the game and what do you think it's like well now if you get into office what kind of fucking [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8499.88s)]
*  horrible shit are they going to write about you i don't know there's too many people in the [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8504.039999999999s)]
*  libertarian party who want me to try to find out but uh don't do it don't do it dave smith i say [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8506.92s)]
*  that as your friend but if i wasn't your friend but like fuck yeah that guy should do it well what [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8512.759999999998s)]
*  if i just run but i don't win that's not good enough that's not good enough but that's no but [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8516.039999999999s)]
*  see it could help in the effort to wake a whole lot of people up maybe maybe it'll confirm people's [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8521.64s)]
*  suspicions that no matter how good a candidate is if they're not one of the two candidates [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8526.44s)]
*  one of the two parties they're not going to support them because it's a wasted vote [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8530.76s)]
*  yeah but even that but even that would be like an interesting thing to like let people know [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8534.12s)]
*  you know what i mean like it'd still be an interesting thing to at least point out to [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8538.2s)]
*  people it's like yeah but that's the essence of the problem and then the crackpots would say that [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8541.16s)]
*  you're taking away uh votes that could have gone to uh my party whatever it is right or yes and [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8544.52s)]
*  you're the reason why we lost you piece of shit you fucking coward you unpatriotic traitor you [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8551.88s)]
*  treasonous this that or the other thing yeah you would you do get that but i also just kind of [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8558.759999999998s)]
*  think i go and this is why i'm a member of the libertarian party and this is why like i joined [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8563.56s)]
*  it i'm excited about it because my camp kind of just took over the whole party basically there was [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8567.64s)]
*  like a little like civil war in the libertarian party between like the gary johnson of course it [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8571.64s)]
*  was well there's the gary johnson people and the ron paul people then i'm like the ron paul people's [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8575.96s)]
*  guy and we won we took over like every position in the party now but my thing about like why a [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8581.0s)]
*  third party is just that at a certain point you're like look there's an argument to this like [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8587.32s)]
*  okay if there's a lesser of two evil well then the third party might help the more evil of two evil [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8592.12s)]
*  get in or something like that but at a certain point you're just like this is the united states [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8597.56s)]
*  of america still kind of or at least it's supposed to be and both of these two major political [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8601.88s)]

*  and we should at a certain point just go now you know what we won't support either of you guys [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8617.24s)]

*  like how china is gaining look there's no question right over the last 20 years let's say american [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8926.52s)]
*  influence in the world has gone down and china's has gone up but the way china's been doing it is [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8932.52s)]
*  by doing business with the world while war fighting wars with the world so what's the lesson there [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8937.48s)]
*  it's like stop fighting stupid wars do business with people trade with people have good relations [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8942.92s)]
*  business yeah they're doing some shady business for sure they're doing some shit that we were [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8947.96s)]
*  criticized for doing right like offering loans going into places making sure that they can't pay [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8952.359999999999s)]
*  the loans yeah no there's over territory that's for sure that's for sure but certainly i don't [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8959.0s)]
*  think there's any it's smarter than going in and just spending a trillion dollars to kill a few [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8964.92s)]
*  hundred thousand people for no reason why is one morally and ethically superior and why is that one [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8970.12s)]
*  war i mean think about the two different business models that you're talking about that ours is [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8974.84s)]
*  morally and ethically superior because we have free speech is that what it is because we have abortion [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8979.72s)]
*  because we have all these things that we want over here so we're okay with doing what we do in other [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8984.92s)]
*  countries and that's where it gets squirrely because like if you say what china's doing is [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8989.72s)]
*  scary and dangerous and awful like yeah yeah so what we do right well the right it kind of all [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8993.96s)]
*  depends on what side of it you're looking at it from like if you're like an iraqi citizen then [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=8999.72s)]
*  yeah what we did is pretty scary and awful and horrible and you know it's uh it's it's also just [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9004.839999999998s)]
*  it's been so damaging that it's like george w bush and and barack obama too you know they they [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9010.599999999999s)]
*  fought the war and terrorism under the banner of like this is freedom and democracy right and that [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9017.88s)]
*  and then it's kind of like oh why why aren't other people like getting on board with freedom [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9025.64s)]
*  and democracy it's like i don't know because this is how you defined it as dropping hellfire missiles [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9029.48s)]
*  on weddings like if that's freedom and democracy who wants that and so it's it's the damage is like [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9035.0s)]
*  you know like all these other things it's kind of measurable imagine if that was going on in this [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9041.16s)]
*  country imagine if there was drones that were targeting people that you know the iraqis wanted [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9044.92s)]
*  dead or the iranians wanted dead and they were killing 90 civilians 90 regular people that were [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9052.04s)]
*  just going about their day but unfortunately we're grouped up with a person who had metadata on them [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9063.0s)]
*  yeah and that's by the way that even that 90 number is like that was just who wasn't the person on [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9067.960000000001s)]
*  the target list but even of the people on the target list they get that wrong sometimes and [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9073.8s)]
*  just had the wrong person on the target list so the actual number is even of like people who [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9078.279999999999s)]
*  weren't actual terrorists is even higher than that and like yeah imagine i mean imagine like [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9082.519999999999s)]
*  there was just right like a campaign in you know chicago to do that right we're just blowing up [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9088.359999999999s)]
*  buildings you know because well we suspect someone that says suspected bad guy is in that building so [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9094.92s)]
*  we blew it up turns out it was just kids it was just a daycare they have and then [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9099.72s)]
*  people and the people who did that and then they don't even like lose their jobs [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9103.4s)]
*  no the people who supported that don't even lose their job they just go like [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9107.8s)]
*  yeah i now agree it was a mistake anyway here's why we got to do this it was a mistake [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9111.4s)]
*  most of them at least acknowledge that iraq was a mistake right but they're not saying that the [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9115.96s)]
*  drone attacks no that's true that's that's that's fair mistakes but the drone program yeah and it's [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9119.64s)]
*  still going on i mean biden's dropped a bunch of drone bombs i mean it's a trump did a ton of them [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9126.28s)]
*  too they're kind of known they are they doing it like or is it happening with their authorization [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9130.76s)]
*  is it happening whether or not they know about it like how much involvement does biden have in [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9136.12s)]
*  day-to-day drone operations i mean it's how much how much involvement does biden have in anything [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9141.320000000002s)]
*  that's happening in the material world but what you're saying biden did it right yes it's under [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9146.44s)]
*  the biden administration so technically under his authority and at least by what the rule of law says [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9149.560000000001s)]
*  he could stop it right but in your opinion how much influence does he have on my guess is he is [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9155.32s)]
*  there's just other people in charge do you think they even assess him i i think um quite possibly [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9162.6s)]
*  they it's possible they do because biden was you know like biden is somebody who would probably [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9169.64s)]
*  approve of these things even if they did run it by him but i also i mean i know with with donald [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9174.039999999999s)]
*  trump like they bragged in certain time in certain areas where they lied to him about the number of [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9179.08s)]
*  troops that were in different regions like there are all types of lied to him yeah yeah they lied [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9183.48s)]
*  to him about the number of troops that were in syria and they bragged about it there's like [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9187.4s)]
*  there's articles on this who's they misled him uh it was somebody at the defense department yeah i [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9190.76s)]
*  don't know jimmy you could pull that up but it was that um or someone at the pentagon but they were [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9195.56s)]
*  basically like they misled him about the number of troops that were actually there because he was [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9199.24s)]
*  saying he wanted to pull all of them out oh and they were like so it's just and the fact that [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9203.32s)]
*  there's even articles written about this and you're like wait a minute but that's the commander and [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9207.24s)]
*  however you feel about him that was supposed to be the commander in chief outgoing syria envoy [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9210.6s)]
*  admits hiding u.s troop numbers praises trump's mid-east record we were always playing shell games [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9215.32s)]
*  said as uh amb is that ambassador jim jeffrey who also gives advice to president-elect biden so he [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9221.56s)]
*  still gives advice to biden while he admits to playing shell games with information we were [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9230.04s)]
*  always playing shell games to not make clear to our leadership how many troops we had here [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9236.36s)]
*  there uh jeffrey said in an interview the actual number of troops in northeast syria [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9242.84s)]
*  is a lot more than the roughly 200 troops trump initially agreed to leave there in 2019 trump's [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9247.0s)]
*  abruptly announced withdrawal u.s troops from syria remains perhaps a single most controversial [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9254.6s)]
*  foreign policy move during his first years in office and for jeffrey the most controversial [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9260.44s)]
*  thing in my 50 years in government the order first handed down in december of 2018 led to [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9266.04s)]
*  the resignation of former defense secretary jim mattis it catapulted jeffrey then trump's special [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9271.880000000001s)]
*  envoy for syria into the role of special envoy in the counter isis fight when it sparked the protest [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9280.2s)]
*  reese resignation of its of his predecessor brett mcgurk okay so basically basically what [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9287.08s)]
*  they're saying is that this one guy stepped down because he was upset at trump so the next guy [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9294.04s)]
*  just lied so mad dog mattis who was trump's first defense secretary which which is so bizarre [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9300.04s)]
*  that's such a donald trump thing too is that donald trump was running on ending the war in syria [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9306.2s)]
*  he ran on that in 2016 and then he picks this guy mattis as his defense secretary and then when he [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9312.119999999999s)]
*  tries to end the war in syria mattis resigns over it he's like i will not do this i'll resign before [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9317.96s)]
*  i carry out these orders and you're like did you guys never have a conversation about this like [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9323.32s)]
*  when you were running on ending this war and then you picked a guy to be your defense secretary [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9328.039999999999s)]
*  did you never like talk to him about like hey i by the way i mean it like i actually want to end [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9332.599999999999s)]
*  this war so he resigns trump's like whatever i'm still pulling out of the war and then the next guy [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9336.92s)]
*  who comes in and moves up the ranks just starts lying to him about how many troops there are [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9342.68s)]
*  there and by the way the the story at the end of this is that trump just backs down and just [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9346.28s)]
*  doesn't doesn't end the war which is basically what trump did on everything mattis is a scary [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9349.960000000001s)]
*  dude yeah i think that's why trump picked him you ever hear mattis talk about whether or not [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9354.6s)]
*  he sleeps well at night no i don't think i've heard that find that clip i don't even want to [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9358.92s)]
*  butcher it uh someone questions mattis is whether or not he sleeps well at night knowing that the [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9363.48s)]
*  enemy's out there you know this is the type of guy you want to be a general well i think this is [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9369.88s)]
*  probably the type of reason why trump picked him yeah this guy's badass listen to this shit hold on [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9378.6s)]
*  a second keeps you awake at night nothing i keep other people awake at night oh yeah yeah i do [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9383.96s)]

*  interest and what's that right and and you know donald trump did get the guy in and the guy is [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9411.24s)]

*  but who was wise enough to completely like like turn against american foreign policy in the middle [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9422.36s)]
*  east early on i think he got out in like 2005 or 2006 or something like that and he was like this [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9428.36s)]

*  ourselves in a more dangerous situation and all of this stuff and trump hired him and he made him [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9440.36s)]
*  the top uh the top advisor at the defense department after he lost the election to joe biden [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9444.36s)]
*  so he had him there in the lame duck period after biden was there and they tried like they tried to [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9450.44s)]
*  like work out a deal in fact i think trump signed off on the order to immediately like [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9456.52s)]
*  withdrawal from syria and afghanistan and like i think one other theater and then like a couple [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9461.0s)]
*  days later trump rescinded the the order someone else got to him and convinced him not to what kind [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9466.76s)]
*  of conversations are those like yeah i like imagine the first day in office conversation [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=9472.36s)]

*  the vast majority of them there are a few exceptions of people who are like somewhat good [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=10859.56s)]
*  but it is it's unbelievable how many are there is clearly established yeah and it's segmented by [[03:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=10863.4s)]
*  advertisement to make sure that nothing ever gets too deep yeah yeah yeah and there's just more and [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=10868.84s)]
*  and they i think gnome chomsky like went over this back in the day but how the advertising just gets [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=10873.96s)]
*  longer and longer and the segments get shorter and shorter and just what they're saying gets [[03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=10878.279999999999s)]
*  dumber and dumber it's really it's unbelievable it's all pharmaceutical ads now when you watch it's [[03:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=10882.84s)]
*  all pharmaceutical yeah there might be like a boeing commercial in every now and then it's [[03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=10887.88s)]
*  rolling like an oreos commercial yeah yeah yeah that's not you cookies or something yeah [[03:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=10891.32s)]
*  pharmaceutical because we just care about your health but have an oreo by the way it's so nuts [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=10896.759999999998s)]
*  and it's like you see a stampede just headed towards a cliff and you're like how do we slow [[03:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=10902.359999999999s)]
*  everybody down how do we how do we make this sustainable how do we make how do we realize [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=10909.48s)]
*  that we are temporary beings we have a finite lifespan and we are are somehow involved in these [[03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=10914.68s)]
*  squabbles with places that are nowhere near us with people that we have never met and somehow [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=10923.0s)]
*  or another we are inexorably tied to these activities that taken place on the other side [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=10929.08s)]
*  of the world and particularly the fact that they pose no threat to you and that you're a part of [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=10933.960000000001s)]
*  the biggest baddest most powerful society that's ever existed and they're a part of like these very [[03:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=10938.76s)]
*  weak vulnerable societies and yet you're convinced but this is what i say i think the ultimate like [[03:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=10943.72s)]
*  like optimistic thing is that all trust in all of these institutions is completely evaporating [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=10948.76s)]
*  and there's something you know a lot of people a lot of people talk about how like um we need to [[03:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=10954.199999999999s)]
*  like unify the country and like we're so polarized and wouldn't it be better if we were more united [[03:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=10958.599999999999s)]
*  which i understand like the idea of that but if i go i go i think the most united times in in my [[03:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=10963.16s)]
*  lifetime the time the country was the most united was right after 9 11 where like everyone was [[03:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=10969.56s)]
*  really together yeah and then the politicians just exploited that and gave us the patriot act [[03:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=10975.0s)]
*  in the war in iraq and the war in afghanistan and this whole disastrous you know start to the 21st [[03:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=10979.16s)]
*  century and then i actually think everyone was pretty united when covid first came and it was [[03:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=10983.48s)]
*  like 14 days to flat 15 days to flatten the curve okay we'll give you guys a couple weeks [[03:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=10987.88s)]
*  yeah and then the politicians exploited that and just took advantage of the whole thing and just [[03:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=10993.16s)]
*  so it's like there's real weakness to being united maybe it's better at least if we're if [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=10997.0s)]
*  we're united let's be united and not trusting any of the institutions well again they suck at [[03:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11001.48s)]
*  everything they suck they're gonna suck at this too they're gonna they're not gonna make decisions [[03:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11006.84s)]
*  that are good for all of us but this is this is to me the the like basically the libertarian [[03:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11011.96s)]
*  argument is that it's like we don't suck at everything like the the free market like voluntary [[03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11016.52s)]
*  like people we actually do amazing things we do so many things so well but everything the government [[03:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11022.04s)]
*  touches they're terrible at or they're really good at it but it's incredibly evil like we're [[03:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11026.68s)]
*  really good at slaughtering people it's like that's true you are very good at that yeah they're pretty [[03:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11032.28s)]
*  good at that and they get better at it every year yeah what's the defense budget like what's what's [[03:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11036.28s)]
*  the amount of money that's involved in these decisions i mean i think i think fucking crazy [[03:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11040.76s)]
*  at this point on the books i think is like 700 billion dollars but if you look at all of the [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11044.68s)]
*  things that are also basically part of it it's over a trillion dollars a year is there a way to [[03:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11048.76s)]
*  redistribute that money to make it so that like they can make that kind of money [[03:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11053.56s)]
*  cleaning up cities each year federal agencies receive funding from congress known as budgetary [[03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11057.64s)]
*  resources in 2022 the department of defense had 1.77 trillion distributed amongst its six subcomp [[03:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11063.4s)]
*  components agencies spend available budgetary resources by making financial promises called [[03:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11072.84s)]
*  obligations 1.77 trillion it could be in one of the six but the uh nuclear program is not part of [[03:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11079.64s)]
*  the department of defense right right so department yeah yeah so that cost isn't even included look at [[03:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11088.359999999999s)]
*  that number though 1.77 trillion is that right that was that's in 2022 the department of defense had [[03:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11093.64s)]
*  1.77 trillion distributed yeah see that i think that's more what i was thinking that it would be [[03:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11101.16s)]
*  somewhere at 700 billion something but then if you if you take into account what jamie was talking [[03:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11107.24s)]
*  about the energy department like nuclear maintenance and stuff but regardless i mean it's just whatever [[03:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11111.96s)]
*  the month the number is insane amount of money it's whether it's 777 billion or whatever the [[03:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11116.6s)]
*  fuck it is that is so much money yeah and you notice and the funny thing is like we end the [[03:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11121.64s)]
*  war in afghanistan and like the budget doesn't even go down it's like you end a war and they [[03:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11126.68s)]
*  just find other things to spend the money if you have that much money being distributed in one year [[03:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11131.4s)]
*  imagine just cutting that off well yeah i mean that would that would be something but honestly [[03:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11135.64s)]
*  even just cutting it off i think would be overall like an overwhelmingly good thing [[03:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11144.039999999999s)]
*  but could you imagine the pushback you know what do you think would go down what do you think would [[03:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11149.32s)]
*  go down if someone actually tried to cut that off first of all you can never cut it off totally you [[03:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11153.72s)]
*  have to have some support of the military well yeah but i mean so what's the budget well look [[03:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11158.119999999999s)]
*  even if the budget was zero next year we still have the most powerful military in the history [[03:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11161.8s)]
*  of the world right but then you gotta pay people there's gonna be some yeah there's gonna be some [[03:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11166.679999999998s)]
*  maintenance or something like that sure but let's just say hypothetically i mean look there are [[03:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11170.439999999999s)]
*  the the you know we spend more than i think like the next 13 countries combined or something like [[03:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11175.4s)]
*  that on our defense budget um so let's just say we cut it in half hypothetically i think you [[03:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11180.279999999999s)]
*  probably my guess is like yeah there'd be enormous pushback from all of the special interests who are [[03:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11186.439999999999s)]
*  losing their money so in other words the only way it could work is if someone like let's say the [[03:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11190.68s)]
*  person who won the presidency won by running on i'm gonna cut the defense budget and got overwhelming [[03:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11197.0s)]
*  support for it because then if there was so much support for it it could be kind of like no matter [[03:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11205.800000000001s)]
*  how much you push back it's just not going to matter that being said i don't really think [[03:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11210.84s)]
*  there's going to be a centralized federal political solution i think what's much more likely to happen [[03:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11215.32s)]
*  in this country is that um this system is going to fail and fail and fail more and hopefully at [[03:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11220.2s)]
*  that point you get more and more decentralization and just like like different areas are going to [[03:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11225.720000000001s)]
*  like not follow federal guidelines and things like that and just kind of like because i just [[03:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11231.0s)]
*  don't see it like to your point there's so much entrenched powerful interests in washington dc [[03:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11236.68s)]
*  it's very hard to see someone rolling it back from there without a huge movement behind them [[03:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11241.16s)]
*  them. [[03:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11245.24s)]
*  I hate to end on a bummer but there's no way to get out of this well no i mean there's just a bummer [[03:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11249.32s)]
*  well that that alone just that number alone whether it's the 777 billion or the one point [[03:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11254.68s)]
*  whatever trillion that that's so scary dude yeah but such an enormous amount of money but the the [[03:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11260.199999999999s)]
*  the thing that's not a bummer is that it's like yeah dude like dude this show gets more like people [[03:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11265.96s)]
*  listening to it than all of these shows that aren't talking about but i'm saying that's that [[03:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11271.32s)]
*  but that's and it's not just you i mean you're like kind of the biggest one but there's so many [[03:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11277.64s)]
*  of these podcasts now that lap you know cnn in terms of the people listening and there are all [[03:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRT-bxjY7So&t=11281.8s)]
