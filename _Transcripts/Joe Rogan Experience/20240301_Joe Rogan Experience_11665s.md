# Joe Rogan Experience #2112 - Dan Soder
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [March 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7be7OxPr1Lo)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.
*  Let's go, Dead Soda. Let's go, baby. What's happening?
*  I forgot how good a weed you have.
*  This is Cal Williams weed.
*  Is that really? Oh shit, I'm going to start talking shit on everyone in the business.
*  And that ain't never been a day that Shane Gillis ain't never texted me, you gay.
*  Always calling me gay.
*  We had Cat Williams ride the racing simulator and I filmed it and put some of it up on Instagram.
*  He's like, this is how he drives. This is a normal thing. He does this because he does this in real life.
*  Yeah, I would love for Cat Williams to be the voice of my self-hate.
*  He's like, you ain't never going to be nothing, baby. You suck.
*  I know. Just to wake you up every day and get you to go to work.
*  He's the new David Goggins. He's like, pain is good. Feel everything bad, Pimpin.
*  I'm out here golfing in five thousand dollars sneakers.
*  Dude, the books thing is still the funniest shit in the world.
*  Bro, he doubled down and then some.
*  Respect. Doubling down on a crazy shit is fucking hilarious.
*  He was saying, I went to the library and I got 20 books at a time because that's all they would let you get.
*  And I would be there three times a week.
*  What? Oftentimes I'd be reading eight books simultaneously because I have the original book and then I have books and annotated.
*  And I love it. The idea that a librarian sees him coming and gets nervous.
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. Lock the doors here.
*  Twenty, only twenty, only twenty books.
*  I need to read thirty books today.
*  How was he saying a week? How many?
*  I don't give a fuck what he said. He's a gem. That guy's a gem. I love him.
*  I was so happy that I got him to come on the podcast because like he's a Joe Rogan.
*  Don't want me on this podcast. I do though.
*  I fucking love that guy. I've always sung his praises.
*  When you heard him say that, did you talk back to the interviewer like, but I do want you on.
*  No, no. I immediately went on Twitter. Yeah.
*  I immediately went on Twitter and I said, dude, I love that guy. Yeah.
*  Let's go. And it was just never met him. I never met him until yesterday.
*  I've never met him.
*  So it's just like we passed each other in the night at the store.
*  I just never was there when he was there.
*  And he was already a big, you know, giant theater act by then. Yeah.
*  And now he's an arena act. You know, like he's just I just never met him.
*  That's all it was. Like it's hard to meet arena acts.
*  Like unless it's Chappelle who still goes to the clubs. Yeah.
*  Like I asked him to do the club. I go, you want to do a spot at the club?
*  Somebody goes, I'm an arena act.
*  Just to clarify with someone like that.
*  I do arenas, too. It's OK. The club is amazing. Can't.
*  Yeah. Not enough people.
*  No, he I think he genuinely doesn't enjoy being in tight crowds like that.
*  I think he's uncomfortable. And I just I told him, I go, you got too famous.
*  And he goes and he was like, look, you got too famous.
*  I mean, he's been doing arenas for over 10 years now, probably.
*  And then theaters the whole time. Well, Pimp Chronicles was when?
*  When was Pimp Chronicles? I want to say I'm going to guess.
*  I mean, I know Jamie's going to look it up. I'm going to guess oh, two, oh, three.
*  Somewhere around that. I watched that in the gym yesterday before I came to do the greatest standup specials of all time.
*  It's fucking amazing. The the the amount of yes, it's crazy.
*  It's like up there with like the energy of Chris Rock.
*  Bring the pain where there's like it's like yell laughter.
*  His own flavor is the best, dude. It's his own flavor of comedy.
*  Like his his flavor of comedy is uniquely cat Williams, like the way he can repeat things and they become funnier.
*  Who could fucking repeats a line and it becomes funnier?
*  He died. Get the bit gets better. He.
*  I was saying even his 2019 special was so funny that I sat through 16 minutes of Jacksonville jokes,
*  acting like I knew that about Jacksonville, like I'm like, oh, those bridges.
*  I forget who Chris Rock was watching it with, but they were they were going crazy just because he was just talking about Florida.
*  Sixteen minutes. And by the way, by the way, you're laughing with him the whole time.
*  Yeah, he doesn't lose you. And then the special just gets better and better.
*  He was doing sex robot bits on that. That's right. Yeah, he's a monster.
*  I think he is top 10 of all time and people don't even I think he gets overlooked a lot for a guy that's been doing arenas.
*  Well, it's not a lot of controversies and craziness.
*  But that's what you get when you get a brilliant mind.
*  You get a fucking Ferrari engine on a kid's bike. Yeah.
*  And sometimes it goes off the rails. Oh, absolutely.
*  It's almost like Howard Hughes shit where you're like you're either going to be wearing a box boxes of Kleenex shoes or wrestling a seventh grader.
*  And it's going to be film because that shit, if you had enough money, you'd be like, new to the Internet.
*  I want that off. But when you see the Howard Hughes type characters,
*  you see those guys just get completely isolated and they can't interact with people.
*  That is terrifying. Yeah, but I see it. I get how it happens.
*  I see how it could happen. Yeah. A lot of money. Yeah.
*  And no, it's a lot of money and become defensive, like crazy defensive and paranoid.
*  The paranoia is the thing that makes you just go like, no, I'm just going to grow my beard and my fingernails and not leave outside.
*  Well, you stop it. You have to stop and think about the time that Howard Hughes lived in.
*  And how easy it was to kill somebody. There was no fucking video cameras everywhere.
*  There was no cell phone cameras. There was no DNA evidence. And everyone was corrupt.
*  And people like it wasn't a thing where after 12 hours you're like, let's get let's get eyes on it.
*  It would be a couple of days. People would be like, you just didn't show up for work for sure.
*  They'd want to kill you. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
*  You're the billionaire guy who's controlling the schools.
*  You're making weird decisions about the drinking water in the Rockefeller.
*  Yeah, you're just like, you've got to be you. But you better be concerned.
*  Yeah, you better have people around you.
*  Well, that's where you got to worry about who are you insulating yourself with?
*  Because if you're like a billionaire like that and you've got crazy motherfuckers in your ears.
*  Yeah, that's how you get like last time I was here.
*  We were talking about Saddam Hussein's kids. That's the kind of similar shit.
*  You just get like crazy people around you, some Machiavellian shit.
*  You're like, yeah, burn the town. It's always the evil son of the king.
*  Yeah. Mafia kids.
*  Mafia kids are always not as good at mafia is their dad.
*  That's the kind of dangerous because they didn't earn it.
*  Right. Yeah. They just got that power.
*  So they've never had to work for it, which is really weird, which also leaves a hole.
*  I think it leaves like they have to prove themselves more to.
*  Yeah. Whereas if you make your money yourself, there's always this like gaining momentum
*  where you're like, look what I'm doing. Right. You all you know, you didn't just hit the lottery.
*  Yeah. Well, you kind of hit the lottery at many steps along the way.
*  You're lucky for sure.
*  There was a lot of work involved in getting to where you are.
*  So, you know, your progression and what you put in to get to that progression.
*  But if you just are born the son of a king.
*  That's a dragon. Yeah. You're just like, let's torture.
*  What's torture about dogs?
*  Well, you're probably empathize with these guys, but you're probably trying to feel something.
*  You're probably like everything is all the great shit that I have does nothing to me.
*  Right. That would change someone's life. Right. So now what do I got to do to go?
*  Yeah. Okay. Then they're like, oh, the milk of magnesium and just putting hot, hot flames on people and shit.
*  When did they figure out cocaine? Who was the first to figure out cocaine?
*  A brave person, a brave person that knew a little bit about science because it ain't like weed where you can just pull it off and put fire to it.
*  Cocaine and alcohol takes someone so dedicated to getting fucked up that they become good at science.
*  Because I watched. Have you ever seen that show Trafficked? No.
*  There's this woman who's like one of my personal heroes, Mariana Vanzeller.
*  She was she was a she's like a real on the ground journalist.
*  Okay. Goes to dangerous places. Yeah. Yeah. The kind of the people that need to do ayahuasca to stop the PTSD.
*  I don't know what she seems to find, which is crazy.
*  All those war correspondents are all like you're like you need to probably go do something to erase everything you've seen.
*  She was first on the show like 10 years ago because she exposed the fentanyl issue and the excuse me, the opioid issue in Florida where they had those pill mills and they didn't have a database.
*  So you could go to they call them pain management centers.
*  You would go there. You would talk to the doctor on the left side.
*  The doctors say, oh, you need pills and you go to the right side and they give you pills and that's all they have is pills.
*  And then people would go to multiple ones stockpile, get a big bag of them, go to different doctors.
*  You can go many doctors. Yeah. Oh, yeah. They call that. What do they call it?
*  Doctor shopping or like going around and like there's a word for it where they go doctor to doctor.
*  Yeah, you can. You could. You back then you could do it because they didn't have a database.
*  Everybody thought was insane. This is a controlled substance, a highly addictive heroin.
*  They take in pill form and you don't you don't like it.
*  It's like, I don't know. Did you come by today? No.
*  And they're like, we can't. She did a whole documentary on it called the Oxycontin Express.
*  That's right. Amazing. I'm going to absolutely check that out.
*  But she went to the fucking jungle of Colombia to where they make cocaine and filmed the whole process with the people making it and then hiked out with them when they carried it on their backpacks through the jungle.
*  Who does she talk to? To set that up. To also feel comfortable.
*  You're like at any moment I'm in the jungle in Colombia. I'm fucking dead.
*  Not only that. I just got my little recorder and I go, so do you like cocaine?
*  And they're like, what? You can expose to your enemies roughly where this is.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Roughly. You're going to give away some information that can be used against you.
*  I'll find those guys who are on that video. I don't I don't need they have a mask on. I know who that is.
*  That's Pedro. When I know Pedro, like if you had a fucking mask on and you were talking, I was like, hey guys.
*  That's dance. You'd have to do it. You guys like Macho Man. You'd have to do it in all Cat Williams.
*  While you're working on cocaine. I ain't giving away this cocaine. Ain't no one touching it, Pimpin.
*  Just just the entire time you work at the Coke factory. That's good.
*  Different voices or just I change my voices so no one knows who I am. I'm like, I'm telling you, this cocaine is unbelievable.
*  And they're like, they feel bad doing coke. When I was a I was a busboy at this steakhouse in Aurora growing up when I was in high school.
*  And we'd smoke cigarettes in the room that wasn't being used. You could smoke in restaurants.
*  And there was this old waiter and he was a former Marine and he was like old school.
*  Like I don't want to talk about it. Old school like did some shit.
*  And then one time after work, me and my buddy Mike were sitting there and we were smoking. He'd smoke cool unfilters.
*  And this guy was just telling us stories about he was a sniper in the army and his job in Central America was to kill donkeys that were carrying drugs north.
*  And he's like because we always ask him, like, you kill people? He's like, no, I just shot a shit ton of donkeys.
*  Because all these donkeys just have all this weight on them.
*  And then you just pop them in the middle of the jungle and you'd be like, well, now you've got, you know, and then it would set up like, OK, now go get them.
*  But this dude, like them telling us that and us being 16 and wanting it to be people like, no, but you kill people.
*  He's like, no, you're not listening to what I did. I fucked their shit up.
*  What a really dumb way to handle a problem is what here's the problem.
*  Some people think you shouldn't do cocaine. Yeah.
*  So we're going to lock everybody up who sells it.
*  So the only people that are going to sell it are the people that can get away with sell it in Mexico.
*  And those people are going to be a super billionaire, powerful cartel, like an army, an industry, an army, a well funded army.
*  Yeah. And they're they can walk here. Yeah.
*  And that's because you don't want people over here to sell coke, even though people want to buy coke.
*  Yeah. Let it rip. I kind of feel like the only real answer.
*  Don't do it. Don't do it.
*  But if it was sold in America, it would be actual coke.
*  Is it that hard to sell pure coke? I bet it would.
*  I bet it would make a lot of people's lives better and a lot of people's lives worse.
*  It would go like this.
*  Richard Pryor got just regular coke and it ruined him. Yeah.
*  I mean, some say Hunter S. Thompson. Some say Hunter S. Thompson's writing.
*  Sigmund Freud loved cocaine.
*  I mean, all the old school gods.
*  Love the way cocaine made him feel fucking duh.
*  Also, and he's into psychology.
*  I bet there were some Freud talks that you're like, dude, I don't want to do this.
*  And he's like, no, think about it. You want to fuck your mom.
*  He goes, dude, Simon, we're on a lot of blow right now.
*  Dude, it's like 80s coke movies where you know they were writing and making it when they were doing coke.
*  There's some of those movies like what are you saying?
*  Electric. I probably knock maybe.
*  But Electric 2, Electric Boogaloo, Breaking 2, Electric Boogaloo.
*  I watched that in my hotel room the other day and I was like, this was written on cocaine.
*  Because every scene just goes like, and then they're here and then they're here and then they're here and everything's all right.
*  My number one speculation is Showgirls.
*  Yeah, Showgirls was written with a half erect penis.
*  That movie was written by a guy that's like, and then boobs come out.
*  That movie hit when I was in middle school, like right when Jerking Off started.
*  And so it was a gold mine because you could be like, it's a legitimate movie.
*  It wasn't porn.
*  But she's topless.
*  Oh, dude, the sex scene in the pool is the dumbest shit where she goes like.
*  She starts flopping around.
*  She looks possessed.
*  It doesn't make any sense that anybody would be like not lose their boner and go, oh my God, she's insane.
*  Having sex with an insane person.
*  Also, that would hurt having sex like that. You'd be like, hey, calm down.
*  That was only NC 17, the first and to date only NC 17 film to be given a wide release mainstream theaters.
*  I'm telling you.
*  It was so dumb. It's one of the dumbest movies ever.
*  It was so stupid.
*  But it's great to watch.
*  Eighth grade Jerk Off. It's Hall of Fame.
*  Well, it's just great to watch because it's so goofy.
*  If you're with a bunch of buddies and you get high and watch Showgirls, you're going to laugh.
*  You're going to laugh really. Hinchcliffe, Gillis, Showgirls.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  We're having fun.
*  All the dialogue, the choppy dialogue.
*  It made it made Cinemax movies look better.
*  We were like, man, we were really making fun of Shane and Tweed and all those Cinemax movies.
*  And then you're like, actually much better than this.
*  It's better than Showgirls.
*  But Showgirls, the so wild movie, they were like, Jesse Spano gets naked.
*  I mean, I'm telling you, it timed out perfectly with me.
*  I was young enough to watch Saved by the Bell and take it seriously that by the time puberty hit and Showgirls happened, you're like, I was waiting for something like this.
*  I think kids now get it too quick.
*  Way too quick.
*  The sexualizing of like everything happens.
*  So boys are seeing porn the moment they get a phone.
*  Yeah.
*  The moment they get a phone.
*  Why wouldn't you?
*  You can't stop them.
*  Yeah.
*  They're too smart.
*  My youngest, my middle daughter, rather, she figured out how to my wife put a password on her phone.
*  Yeah.
*  And so like she could limit the use.
*  She figured to record the screen and give my wife the phone.
*  So my wife punches in the numbers.
*  It's recording the screen.
*  It's like velociraptors learning how to open doors.
*  What the fuck?
*  She was 12.
*  That is they know so fast.
*  That's so creepy.
*  Yeah.
*  You little raptor.
*  Yeah.
*  Like imagine taking that.
*  Here, mom.
*  Here, mom.
*  Here's my phone.
*  Can you put it in?
*  I really agree with you that limitations are important.
*  I want to see the puppies.
*  And then she's like, look at her screen time and it's four hours of TikTok.
*  She goes around the corner and she looks and she's like, we got her.
*  Well, they're little drug dealers.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what the phone companies are.
*  Little drug dealers for kids.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, we do it too.
*  And the kids are little junkies and we're junkies too.
*  But I think it is, I think it's one of those things where you're like, what's going to be their response to it?
*  Because they're smart.
*  They can do shit like that.
*  When they get older, are they going to be like, hey, we should limit this?
*  No, no, it's not going to be limited.
*  We're in it now.
*  We're in it now.
*  And this is us.
*  And I think it's just going to get more and more invasive because that seems the direction that it keeps going.
*  If I had to guess, and then this is obviously just a guess.
*  I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, but I feel like this can't be stopped, especially with AI.
*  When they're talking about AI and all the things that AI can do for you now, it's just people are getting papers written.
*  They're getting busted all the time.
*  Chat GBT is writing them.
*  Any answer to kind of anything, it can code websites instantaneously.
*  It can do your voice, it can replicate your voice.
*  The Google one can't show white people though.
*  Really?
*  Which is a real issue.
*  No, really?
*  You didn't know this?
*  Oh, dude.
*  Are you ready for this?
*  They asked the Google one to show images of World War II Nazi soldiers.
*  Yeah.
*  And they made it all woke.
*  So they made like a Native American Nazi.
*  They have an Asian lady Nazi.
*  They have a black man Nazi.
*  You are describing a perfect punk album cover from the 80s.
*  Bro, it couldn't describe the founding fathers of the United States.
*  Well, they were just, they were men.
*  But were they?
*  Did they identify as men?
*  Dude, you have to see some of these pictures.
*  Can you got any, Jamie?
*  I was seeing it on Twitter.
*  Here's my question to you.
*  And this is the perfect place to ask this question about cell phones.
*  Do you think there's any chance that cell phones are weapons from aliens that disarm us?
*  Because we're all looking down and they know it can use our emotions.
*  Like a grenade that takes a long time to explode.
*  Because we each have them.
*  Because I love alien shit and you're like, I'm going to go to the bathroom.
*  I love alien shit.
*  And you're like, there's got to be some alien technology.
*  If they're watching us, they just drop something.
*  They're like, hey, you guys want to watch them get fucked up?
*  Let's give them cell phones.
*  Look at that.
*  That's great.
*  Founding fathers of America.
*  This summer, George Washington.
*  I like how one of them is a Native American.
*  That's like saying a Holocaust victim is a Nazi.
*  Yeah.
*  That's so crazy to say that's one of the founding fathers of the United States.
*  No, that's who he stole the land from.
*  This was theirs.
*  What the fuck are you talking about?
*  Look at the images of Vikings.
*  Dude, that's great.
*  A Samoan dude and a black lady.
*  Look at the popes.
*  An Indian woman and an African man.
*  It's amazing.
*  This is hilarious.
*  Google Gemini.
*  That's so funny.
*  Google Gemini is like, I don't want to say it.
*  That's not good.
*  Because you are messing with the fiber of reality to fit in with your ideology.
*  And you shouldn't be doing that if you're in control of artificial intelligence.
*  It's supposed to be an artificially intelligent program that takes all the information
*  in the world and gives you a take on things.
*  It's not supposed to be an indoctrination tool.
*  You can't use it to fit an agenda.
*  So you're saying opinions should be a regurgitation, not an opinion.
*  You can't fucking lie about who the founding fathers were.
*  But can you imagine if you could use AI to make yourself look awesome?
*  If you're just like any AI Dan Soder stuff, you're like seven foot tall,
*  could dunk easy, run up and down the court.
*  Show me the one where they showed the Nazi soldiers.
*  The Nazi soldiers ones, the most preposterous.
*  Look at this, bro. Look at this.
*  An Indian Nazi nurse.
*  Like the darkest African looking man you've ever seen.
*  Was the top left, they're attempting a white guy and they're just like,
*  ah, we can't even do it.
*  I think the top left is a white guy.
*  So they gave you one white guy when it came to German soldier.
*  But then you got an Asian lady.
*  You got an Asian lady Nazi? What?
*  What the fuck are you saying?
*  What the fuck did you say? Do you know what a Nazi is?
*  How are you so dumb and yet so smart?
*  That is the dumbest thing I've ever seen in my fucking life.
*  We're going to need to hope that robots stay that way when they turn on us.
*  That there's still some stupidity in them so we can win.
*  It's this weird white thing that they have a problem with white people.
*  It's so bonkers.
*  You also just don't know the programming.
*  People can program this.
*  At what point does AI get away from people?
*  At what point does AI...
*  I want you to imagine a world where it was the opposite.
*  I want you to imagine a world where you said, show me Muhammad Ali,
*  and it shows you this white guy.
*  Didn't they do that with rock and roll?
*  Where they're like, hey, black music, but it's a white guy.
*  Well, for sure that was the criticism of Elvis.
*  Yeah, that he stole rock and roll.
*  Ray Charles never liked Elvis.
*  Ray Charles would talk shit about Elvis.
*  Yeah, you never see Ray Charles talking shit on Elvis.
*  I want to see that immediately.
*  With his sunglasses on, talking shit.
*  But it would be for effect if he took them off and looked at the camera.
*  He's like, look at me, and he's got the blind eyes.
*  Fuck Elvis Presley.
*  Look into my gray eyes.
*  Like an oracle.
*  I'm going to touch you.
*  He grabs your wrist and takes a...
*  Do it.
*  Okay.
*  You know better than I.
*  Let me ask you differently.
*  What Elvis did, he caused a lot of the populace, if you want to say,
*  and usually when people say populace, they usually mean white people,
*  to start listening to a lot of music that normally they wouldn't have been listening to.
*  And black people have been going out shaking their behind for centuries.
*  What's the hell's unusual about them shaking their hips and stuff?
*  And that's all Elvis was doing was copying that.
*  And he was doing our kind of music.
*  That's black music.
*  So what the hell am I supposed to get so excited about, man?
*  He's the king and he's the...
*  He's a punk.
*  Dude, it's funny that...
*  He's a punk.
*  No more about Elvis because you got me in enough trouble.
*  I think he...
*  Everybody...
*  He called Elvis a punk.
*  Everybody in entertainment has that...
*  Where they go like, yeah, he did this, but also fucking...
*  Let's stop sucking his dick.
*  Anyone in entertainment has that exact muscle, that response muscle.
*  So he's the king.
*  He ain't the fucking king.
*  It might be off microphone, but everyone, Cat Williams is off.
*  Right. But in his case, this is a totally different time in history.
*  You got to think of that was like, if you were a really good black artist, you actually couldn't get on TV.
*  It wasn't like today.
*  Black artists are hugely successful.
*  They're like, no, it's not happening.
*  Back then, you were not going to make it.
*  And they were going to really promote this white guy.
*  Yeah, a white guy walking up...
*  We're going to get the shit out of this white guy.
*  Girls would scream and cry like this is what we've been looking for.
*  That reaction, can I just say, that reaction always has been like...
*  There's no way I could handle that.
*  Someone's scream crying the second they saw you.
*  Well, he couldn't handle it either.
*  Look what happened to him.
*  He went crazy.
*  He just went...
*  Well, the Vegas.
*  Living in Vegas full time and just doing fucking pain pills.
*  That's like living right next to Sauron's dick.
*  Just the pull.
*  You are on.
*  Just the eye above you.
*  The fucking eye in the sky.
*  And then they're giving you weird jumpsuits and you're learning karate.
*  And you're doing all kinds of drugs.
*  But by the way, peanut butter and banana sandwiches, fried.
*  They're good.
*  You know what's really good?
*  Peanut butter and bacon.
*  Really?
*  Peanut butter and bacon with honey.
*  I've been running back peanut butter and honey recently.
*  Is it true Elvis died on the toilet?
*  That's what they say.
*  But that's just a rude thing that I would say too if I was like, he's a punk.
*  He died on the toilet.
*  That was the end of the cut off.
*  I heard he died on the toilet.
*  And then it just gets around like that?
*  Elvis is probably still alive when he said that.
*  I don't know.
*  Actually, probably not.
*  Do you think he...
*  Do you think Elvis did the fake death?
*  No, he's dead as fuck.
*  Yeah, he's dead as fuck.
*  He can't do pills forever.
*  Yeah.
*  They can't chew.
*  But what a way at the end.
*  There was a moment there where you were flying high.
*  And then you got to be like, well, you either got to wrap it up or just be like, what's this playing out?
*  There are so many of his concerts where he's got pill sweat.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Like just pill sweat all over his face.
*  Dumping.
*  Pill sweat.
*  Just dumping sweat.
*  Elvis Presley autopsy explains grotesque illness that caused him to die on toilet.
*  He was 43?
*  He had constipation because of everything.
*  This city had a four month old stool.
*  No way.
*  That's what killed him?
*  That's what this says.
*  But isn't that one of the things that happens when people take like Viconins?
*  Opiates.
*  They usually have a hard time shitting on.
*  Yeah, I hear it.
*  Due to his high fat, unhealthy diet.
*  What about the pills?
*  The Jilapes Rocks suffered from chronic constipation.
*  Are they doctors?
*  Due to his high fat, unhealthy diet.
*  What about due to his pills?
*  It's the next sentence.
*  I know, but that should be at the top.
*  Like that's probably why he was constipated for fucking months.
*  The unhealthy diet people shit like racehorses.
*  They shit everywhere.
*  Yeah, he must have been, the amount of pills he was on that was stopping the shit and then
*  making it damn in him for four months.
*  So the rock singer, anyway, I went off on a tangent, suffered from chronic constipation
*  and a post-mortem examination found he had a four month old compacted stool sitting in
*  his bow.
*  Oh my God.
*  Can we talk about what came out?
*  But imagine how much that dude was eating at four months worth of food.
*  And banana, peanut butter sandwiches.
*  He didn't shit for four months.
*  He just packed it in.
*  How could you not shit for four months?
*  Because my initial thought is, this is just as a challenge.
*  No way.
*  Ask him some time.
*  No way.
*  Not four months, but weeks.
*  What, Ari would go weeks?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I've heard the story.
*  It's gross.
*  I got constipated two years ago and it was one of the most terrified I've ever been in
*  my life.
*  Scary.
*  For two weeks I couldn't, two and a half weeks I couldn't shit.
*  Oh my God.
*  And you're still eating?
*  Yeah, but you're also like, you have to poop.
*  You like go and you have to poop, but it just doesn't show up.
*  Oh God.
*  Dude, it was after I got.
*  I had a friend who had to go to the doctor to get it pulled out.
*  Oh.
*  Yeah, my friend Larry.
*  Shout out to Larry.
*  Yeah.
*  I used to work with him on Fear Factor.
*  Yeah, and he had to get poop pulled out of his butt.
*  The story, every time he would tell the story, I literally couldn't breathe.
*  I was laughing so hard I couldn't fucking breathe because he's funny anyway.
*  Yeah.
*  He was telling the story.
*  And when it got to the point where it was hard, so they had to go in there and like
*  break it up.
*  Like dynamite it?
*  And pull it out.
*  They had to use tools.
*  They had to just chip away at the cement shit.
*  Marble poop.
*  That was stuck at the fucking base of his butt hole.
*  Dude, there was a moment where I was at, I was in Rochester working a weekend, comedy
*  at the Carlson Gray Club.
*  Didn't shit all weekend.
*  And the next day or day I was like emotionally going through it and I had suppositories
*  and I was like, do a suppository.
*  I was like, just do it.
*  Just do it.
*  And it didn't work.
*  Oh no.
*  And I was like, it was one of those moments where you go, why have you forsaken me, God?
*  I was like, dude, nothing.
*  Nothing.
*  And then after the weekend, I went back to New York and my doctor was like, just drink
*  Miralax.
*  Just keep drinking Miralax.
*  Fuck what it says.
*  Every time you think about it, have a couple of Miralax.
*  So I was just a ticking time bomb.
*  Oh my God.
*  I was a ticking time bomb.
*  You went on stage like that?
*  Dude, I had to.
*  I was like, I had to go.
*  So I get through the weekend fine.
*  I get through the weekend.
*  But the second I got back to New York, the next morning I woke up and was fucking around
*  in my apartment and all the adrenaline had dumped from the past two weeks.
*  I sat down and took the most glorious shit.
*  I took like a Jeff Daniels Dumb and Dumber.
*  My legs were fucking, it was unbelievable.
*  It was almost worth the constipation for that dump.
*  Why is it so satisfying to look at a giant shit?
*  Dude, it's just dropping out of you.
*  You're like, whoa.
*  But when it's really big, you get excited about it.
*  Oh my God, when it snakes out.
*  I have to stop myself to yell to my fiance.
*  Because there's times where I'm like, someone's got to see this.
*  Ari would send me pictures.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I mean, Ari will box up his poop like he did when he gave Big Jay a box of poop on skanks.
*  That makes me gag just hearing it.
*  He said it was an Avenged Sevenfold album.
*  And he fucking shit in a box and gave it to fucking Jay.
*  And he opened it in front of a crowd.
*  Oh my God.
*  And everybody was like, whoa.
*  It cleared the room.
*  It was at the old creek in the Queens downstairs.
*  It cleared the entire fucking room.
*  Everyone was like, that smells horrible.
*  He's the best.
*  Ari is one of those people where you're like, and now you see he went viral with that sweet story about what he did for his girlfriend.
*  I did see that.
*  I didn't read it, though.
*  It's just, you know, we both know Ari the person.
*  We both know the very good side, a sweet man.
*  He's a mensch.
*  He's one of my favorite people.
*  I love him to death.
*  He is truly a mensch.
*  He's a great guy.
*  He united New York and LA comedy.
*  He did.
*  Single-handedly.
*  Well, he went over there with the attitude that we all had at the store.
*  He's like, you guys should just meet these guys.
*  You would like everybody.
*  Yeah.
*  Big Jay was the first person that he was like close with.
*  And then through Big Jay and Ari, the healing started.
*  We started hanging out, going to LA and everyone became friends.
*  The New York versus LA comedy feud was the dumbest thing of all time.
*  It made zero sense.
*  You are literally giving power to all the industry separating like that.
*  Not only was it so dumb, but it never made any sense because most of us started on the East Coast.
*  You're from Massachusetts.
*  You started like Stan Hoepf from Worcester.
*  So many guys started in New York.
*  I moved to New York in 07 right when Burr left.
*  And so it felt like ridiculous that people were like LA comics.
*  You have a Burr just Burrs.
*  Like we knew people that were there.
*  It was ridiculous.
*  It was stupid.
*  But it was a dumb thing.
*  Like we just weren't communicating.
*  Fuck those guys.
*  Fuck those guys.
*  It's like the walled garden feel.
*  Like you'd come to the store and there would be all the clicks and you didn't know who to hang out with.
*  It's all high school.
*  It's always high school.
*  High school just keeps repeating itself throughout your life.
*  But you can have a cool group of friends in high school.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's what I try to cultivate.
*  Yeah.
*  Just people you want to hang with.
*  Cool group of friends.
*  I figured out a long time ago on the road, and I was trying to explain this to Fem, it's better to make less money on the road and then pay a guy who's good to open it.
*  Absolutely.
*  And pay for his airfare and his hotel.
*  So you make less money, but you'll have more fun.
*  You have to have more fun.
*  Fun is the whole thing.
*  I'll add to that.
*  I like bringing my friends who I like to watch because then I get to watch a show.
*  Yes.
*  I watch them in the middle and I go like, this is so fun.
*  Yes.
*  And you get to go on laughing.
*  Yeah.
*  Like you're already laughing.
*  Dan St. Germain is one of my best friends and he's a hilarious comic.
*  And I bring him on the road and he just does little stuff that I'm just like, dude, that's so funny.
*  He'll get off stage.
*  I'll be like, that line is so funny.
*  And he'll be like, oh, thanks.
*  When we filmed, because I put out my special on YouTube Friday, March 1st.
*  When we filmed that, I brought him because I was like, let's just keep this like a weekend.
*  We're just going to film this like this is because it was I was just on the road.
*  Yeah.
*  And I was like, let's just film a show at a club that I love, Portland Helium.
*  We'll just film it like it always is.
*  And I get to bring my friend.
*  And then it's just like a hang.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like a fun hang that doesn't feel because you know when you do a show, you're like, oh, I'm going to do this.
*  That's cool.
*  Because you know when you do special tapings, they can feel like everyone's like, are you going to do it?
*  Right.
*  Is it going to be like and you got like your managers there randomly?
*  Yes.
*  And it just doesn't feel like a show.
*  Right.
*  Filming it at Portland Helium with St. Germain and having like people around and just friends come through, that's just a show.
*  It was like, oh, and then I'm like, I'm just going to put this up on YouTube for free and this is great.
*  And this is exactly what I do on the road.
*  Yeah.
*  It was like a fun fucking hang.
*  And I think the club shows represent like a more intimate thing, which is what you're doing at home anyway, if you're sitting in your living room.
*  Yeah.
*  I think there's a disconnect. Like if you watch like I've seen some guys do arena specials.
*  Which is nuts because it's still great.
*  Listen, arena shows are fun. Dude, I went and saw Nate at fucking State Farm in Atlanta.
*  I'm not saying arena shows aren't fun. I love arena shows.
*  But here's the point I'm making is I went and saw Nate and live it was an experience.
*  Oh yeah.
*  It was like watching one man in front of all those people just murder my friend.
*  Just being like buddy, my wife. It's just like sending out waves.
*  But at home.
*  And so calm. With like minimal exertion but maximal reward with the punch lines.
*  If we were in the 40s, he would have had so many, he would have been a Hall of Fame sniper in the army.
*  Just how calm he would have been and he would have been like seven degrees left.
*  That's a great description of him.
*  Nate would be like seven degrees right.
*  I've never seen someone more calmly kill.
*  It's incredible.
*  Yeah.
*  And by the way, the way he kills, his bits are stuff that are so organic and from who he is.
*  Yeah.
*  That like you're like, I've had multiple phone conversations with Nate.
*  Multiple. Over the years.
*  Where we have talked about something and then months later that conversation is a seven minute bit and it's just destroying the room.
*  We had, because we all used to hang in New York like around 07, 08 at Stand Up New York when Patrice, Patrice's manager, Wayne Rada was booking it.
*  So it was like Patrice was there, Attell, Big J and then Nate.
*  All these guys that I met, specifically Luis J Gomez and all them are all from this time period.
*  So you would have weird hangs like me, Louis and Nate.
*  Nate had a bit that he did on Conan about his friend trying to fight staff members out of McDonald's because he took a bite out of his burger.
*  That was Nate, Lewis and I, because we took a bite out of Lewis's hamburger and rack it back up.
*  And this psycho came back in and was like, oh, what's up?
*  And started walking at the McDonald's workers.
*  And Nate and I were like, no, no, no, no, no.
*  Dude, Nate was laughing so hard he had to bail out of the McDonald's and I had to get in front of Lewis and be like, it was us.
*  It was us.
*  And then six months later, Nate's on Conan murdering with a bit about it.
*  Dude, I bought a cheeseburger once from Burger King and it had a bite taken out of it.
*  That is an act of war. If it's not your friend, it's an act of war.
*  I was driving home from training and I got a cheeseburger.
*  What a bad guy to pick. A guy coming home from training.
*  I was so sad.
*  Yeah, I mean, you have to throw it away.
*  I was so hungry. I ate it.
*  Did you bite around it?
*  Yeah, I was so poor. I needed the food.
*  When I was a waiter, that's what I would do when someone, I worked in Midtown and they would like throw out this steak.
*  We had a steak and it was in little slices all the way down.
*  And I would see how much they would eat.
*  And then I would just go on over and be like, that's mine.
*  I just put that in a dish and I'd be like, and I got some steak.
*  That's always the way to do it.
*  When you're that poor, you're like, I'll eat around it.
*  Yeah, I just ate it. I was so hungry.
*  But it is a bummer.
*  And I didn't know what to do.
*  I didn't let go and tell them.
*  So I took a bite out of my burger.
*  I have to get home. I'm tired.
*  Was that?
*  I just ate it.
*  Because I'm saying they picked the wrong guy.
*  You pick me who just smoked a bowl.
*  What am I going to do? Go in and karate kick people?
*  Yes. Yes.
*  No, I wasn't that type of guy.
*  Dude, you could be like, show enough and hit the last dragon and go fuck up.
*  Who ate my motherfucking cheeseburger?
*  When I say who ate my burger.
*  You could pick the wrong guy to do that to though.
*  You could pick a guy who just found out that his wife's been fucking his best friend
*  and she stole $100,000 from his bank account and his boss just fired him.
*  And then he is in a fucking rage.
*  And he gets a cheeseburger and it's got a bite taken out of it.
*  And it's like, oh, OK, motherfucker.
*  And then you pull in with that cheeseburger and just start laying people out.
*  Yeah. You're describing what's going to happen to all these YouTube pranksters.
*  Some of them are bringing big giant security guards with them.
*  Well, that's their thing now because there was a story about a guy,
*  one of these pranksters that got shot.
*  He got shot in the stomach.
*  Oh, I saw that.
*  And then the article came.
*  An article came out with interview with his dad.
*  Shot in the stomach by an illegal immigrant, by the way.
*  Yeah, but still a prank.
*  It's just so quick to pull guns.
*  I mean, where's he from?
*  Fuck around with it. I mean, he ran from something.
*  You know that that guy ran from something more dangerous than him.
*  Yeah, maybe jail.
*  I mean, yeah, there's like some guys, some of these people are like, dude, do you don't want to fuck?
*  It's again, the wrong guy. You picked the wrong guy.
*  Yeah, you picked the wrong guy.
*  You picked the wrong guy by fucking pull his pants down.
*  Just shot him in the gut.
*  Dude, there were old pranks.
*  People used to, because this is coming waves.
*  There was like in the vine days, people were doing pranks.
*  Yes.
*  And they were deep pantsing like black dudes just walking up and deep pantsing black guys like in the hood and being like, no, no, no.
*  And the second they would like get swarmed on it like, no, no, no, it's a prank.
*  And there's one where a guy does it and you hear that gun hit the street and that pranksters like, and the guy like picks up the gun.
*  And you're like, dude, what did you you could have been dead?
*  You could have been dead.
*  A hundred percent.
*  And by the way, the security guards are just going to make it worse because then you're going to get a guy.
*  Maybe you have a guy that can fucking handle himself and he's not scared of your security.
*  And now there's two people getting hurt.
*  Or the security guy gets shot first.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  And you're like, dude, that's crazy, man.
*  That's what people will do for attention.
*  It's just nuts.
*  But that's what that's alien.
*  Dude, it's alien weaponry.
*  You might be onto something.
*  They're coming from under the sea.
*  Here's the thing.
*  They're giving us weapons.
*  I'm all about USOs now, dude.
*  Yeah.
*  Undersea UFOs.
*  It's unidentified submersible objects.
*  Yeah.
*  That's where they are, dude.
*  Yeah.
*  They're at the floor.
*  That's what Cat Williams said.
*  Yeah.
*  We were talking about sonar hearing devices.
*  That just touched my heart where I'm like, do we both have the same crazy theory?
*  And you said, is this correct or incorrect?
*  I love that.
*  We were talking about space, about how we know more about space than we do about the ocean, which is true.
*  And he was saying that those underwater listening devices were most likely so that they could hear UFOs moving around.
*  Dude.
*  Because if they're really, imagine if they're really on bases under the ocean and they know about them.
*  Well, here's the thing.
*  If they know about them, fuck you.
*  You should tell us.
*  But here's what I think.
*  The theory I heard, because I heard about, I listened to an episode of last podcast on the left where they were talking about USOs and I got super into it because I was high enough.
*  You know, when the song hits correctly, sometimes the podcast will do that.
*  And I was listening to last podcast on the left and it hit where I go like it unlocked because they had this theory that that they talked about that the millions of years it took us to crawl out of the water and evolve into fucking whatever we are like monkeys and then Neanderthals and then humans all that millions of years.
*  There were things under the ocean evolving for millions of years with technology and stuff and we're just up on the roof.
*  But yeah, the problem is we've never seen anything other than us that manipulates its environment.
*  The intelligent things that we found in the ocean that are real are dolphins and orcas and whales.
*  But what about dolphins and orcas are crazy.
*  But like octopuses too.
*  That's true too.
*  But but none of them, the octopus are very smart, but none of them have ever figured out how to make things like make houses and cars and ships and it's it's all like they're out in the wild.
*  There's no houses.
*  I used to do a bit about how dangerous the ocean is because there's no doors.
*  I'm like there's no doors no matter what you just fucking sharks and crabs and no doors.
*  And everywhere you look, everything is eating everything.
*  It's literal murder soup because they all eat each other.
*  It's a ladder of eating.
*  Yes, everything goes up and it's something at the top.
*  You have killer whales that are eating whales.
*  They eat everything.
*  But what if we're missing something?
*  What if we don't see it?
*  What if we are too stupid?
*  What if we're just like rock monkeys and they're just like they can't see down here.
*  These guys have no fucking clue.
*  You know when you're in a tinted car and someone's like looking in the window and you're looking at him like look at this fucking idiot.
*  You don't even see me mate.
*  What if that's us with the aliens in the water?
*  What if we're like looking down there in the water and they're like these fucking idiots even when they come down here they can't see shit.
*  That's possible.
*  It's possible that they also can be completely invisible.
*  Yeah, we're really close to being able to do that now with stuff.
*  They figured out how to like project what's behind things on screens so you can you can like have theoretically have a vehicle that as it's moving through an environment it's projecting what's there.
*  That's a predator shit.
*  Yeah, like literally that's that's a concept that they're working on.
*  They're working on for air aircrafts.
*  They're working on it for for vehicles.
*  Terrifying.
*  So terrifying.
*  And that's just step one.
*  Step two would be do something that alters reality around the thing so it's invisible.
*  Yeah.
*  It look so that's right.
*  So you go into the ocean and we're like down there and we're so limited because we can't breathe down there.
*  So we're limited.
*  We're in like submarines or we have robots and it's just like it's just like a fucking ring.
*  Every footage under the sea looks like a ring doorbell where it's just like and we don't know what the fuck they could be behind it like these idiots.
*  There's so little of it that we've explored.
*  There's only like 10 percent of the ocean floor that we've explored.
*  Ten percent.
*  That's so crazy.
*  Ten percent.
*  And then the thing that they always see you UFOs or USOs over water.
*  It's like the high frequency that they see them and then they just fucking just down in there and they're like follow me bitch.
*  We're like we can't we can't breathe you know space or the ocean.
*  We can't breathe down there.
*  We have a limited amount of room we can move around in.
*  Just the idea of something being here the whole time is so creepy.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And then but us being what's comforting is we're all so stupid we don't see it.
*  Right.
*  Imagine if you had a friend that's like hey if a couple people could see it you would be terrified.
*  Imagine if society had gotten to a point at one point in time where artificial intelligence and human brains mixed and we created a super class of species like a new thing that's both technological and biological.
*  Yeah.
*  And only a small number of beings got that.
*  I mean you.
*  And those beings for some reason left and left us here the way we are.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what we're seeing with these aliens.
*  Those are humans that went that went down the road that we're going down right now.
*  And they were like dude we're going to get out of here.
*  Yeah.
*  And then maybe there was like all the disasters that happened like the the younger dry ice impact the asteroids hit all that stuff in level society but they escape because they're interdimensional travelers.
*  Yeah.
*  They're like we're gonna get the fuck out of here.
*  It's like leaving a house.
*  You're just like I don't care about the house anymore.
*  Yeah.
*  Somewhere else.
*  They don't need food anymore.
*  They probably work on nuclear energy or something.
*  It's probably some crazy power source.
*  Or like anti-matter.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like a thing that we would never even think of.
*  Yeah.
*  They don't need to breed.
*  The thing that I the Jimmy Carter brief did you know about this when he where they briefed him and it like broke him emotionally where he was like so upset where they were like hey by the way they've been here forever.
*  Like there he was like a deeply religious man.
*  Well Tucker Carlson has talked about this recently.
*  Really.
*  Yeah.
*  Tucker Carlson said that he believes that they've always been here and he believes that it's probably you know he's talking about like good and evil.
*  Yeah.
*  We all we know that good exists and we know that evil exists.
*  Sure.
*  We know that people are capable of doing evil.
*  Like these are real forces in the world.
*  Yeah.
*  And there so what people are saying is that these experiences some people are having with like benevolent ones that you're this is that stories of demons.
*  This is the stories of the Bible that there's like there's there's races that are evil.
*  There's alien races that don't give a fuck just like praying mantises.
*  Yeah.
*  They eat hummingbirds like in nature just just because there's there are creatures that are aggressive that are smart like a hyena.
*  And then there's like animals that are aggressive and just powerful like lions.
*  And think about us the smartest animal on the planet that we know of.
*  And what do we do to chickens.
*  Fuck them.
*  No.
*  Those chickens.
*  I go no you don't fuck.
*  Oh god.
*  This is what my whole world unravels.
*  I go Joe I fuck chickens dude.
*  I don't know.
*  I didn't think you were going to get me like that.
*  But yeah there could be the idea of benevolent aliens of like the idea that there are aliens that are good and that are good.
*  And aliens that are bad scares me so much more because you're just like please leave me alone.
*  Like good ones bail me out of it.
*  I mean but imagine like if something became super intelligent but in a more balanced environment like instead of the way humans are so much more intelligent than everything else.
*  Yeah.
*  What if there was other shit around that was pretty close to us.
*  So you're saying like what if the food chain the gap wasn't as big between one and two.
*  Right.
*  Would we have that would be a lot nicer to each other.
*  Right.
*  But would we ever get to this point.
*  That's the thing.
*  I think if it did it would be a slower role.
*  Way slower.
*  But I also believe that community and empathy would be higher if we had less of us more more of a threat more if there were if there was like I tried this as a bit but it never worked if dolphins had legs like if they just came out because they raped.
*  And if dolphins came out and just on land and you'd be like because they're so they're all muscle.
*  Yeah.
*  So they would just fuck our shit up.
*  Oh they kill you.
*  Yeah.
*  A dolphin that could breathe.
*  Yeah.
*  And then you're in trouble.
*  Yeah we're absolutely fucked in trouble.
*  Imagine if you're so pro dolphin but dolphins evolve legs and they just become the worst rapists on the planet and they're like what were you wearing.
*  And you know rape your dog.
*  They rape everything.
*  Everything.
*  They rape your car.
*  Yeah.
*  I got super intelligent.
*  They just fuck everything they find.
*  They go my Altima got fucked by a dolphin.
*  I'm gonna be late to work.
*  They your emus laid out in the fucking garage.
*  They're just just like a tornado of rape.
*  It's just coming through and fucking the town up.
*  They also commit infanticide.
*  What's that?
*  They kill babies.
*  So those Chinese anti-native side.
*  What do they call it?
*  Infanticide is like large scale killing of children.
*  I think I think I might have exaggerated that.
*  But I think what they do is when female dolphins have babies apparently they they won't breed for a long period of time while they're raising that baby.
*  Sure. They're being good moms.
*  And what male dolphins would do if they have not had sex with the female dolphin.
*  I hope I'm not fucking any of this up.
*  They'll kill the babies.
*  To fuck the mom.
*  To force the mom into breeding again.
*  Force them back into estrus.
*  That's some trailer trash shit.
*  The strategy that the female dolphins have employed is to have sex with as many male dolphins around her as she can so that no one knows who's the baby.
*  Yeah. So everyone's like that might be my kid.
*  Exactly.
*  Genius.
*  Reports of infanticide infanticide incestations have been quadrupled in the past decade and now infanticide has now been documented in six species of toothed whale including multiple populations of common bottlenose dolphins.
*  Damn. Yeah.
*  So if you're a grown dolphin you've made it through a lot.
*  You made it through a lot.
*  You made it through a lot of dolphins wanting to fuck your mom while you were a kid.
*  If you can't make a house the world is rough.
*  Do you know how different I would have been.
*  I was raised by a single mom who dated.
*  If all those guys had to kill me to fuck my mom.
*  Do you know how dangerous I would be right now.
*  I would be dead.
*  I would just be a wet.
*  Yeah I'd be absolutely dead.
*  You'd be dead if you were a kid.
*  I was also I was a little sweetie pie.
*  I was a Kevin McCallister.
*  I'm not setting home alone traps.
*  I would have gotten rolled.
*  Dennis I'll tell you the guy's name.
*  That's hilarious.
*  He was the first guy my mom dated after my dad.
*  Dennis would have killed me.
*  Yeah probably.
*  Yeah because he would have been like well you're not going to fuck when this when this kid's around and she's like he's nice.
*  Just coming up behind me with piano wire.
*  I think for dolphins it's like six years too.
*  That times out.
*  Exactly how old I was.
*  I was maybe five when my mom started dating.
*  That's so funny to think about them.
*  I have to be like my mom's like I'm going on a date.
*  Just the whole day.
*  It's like where the fuck is he.
*  Come get me you son of a bitch.
*  How weird is it we put those things in swimming pools.
*  And pet them.
*  And ride them and shit.
*  Yeah just tricks.
*  Do a trick.
*  I went to the Atlanta Aquarium.
*  They have a great aquarium and I was doing shows there and I went and went to the dolphin exhibit.
*  And I thought it was funny because these dolphin trainers are also scientists.
*  Yeah.
*  But then they have to dance.
*  It's like the weirdest thing.
*  They're like they know all this stuff about dolphins but then they're like hey do a little do a little routine and feed them a fish.
*  And you're like how disrespected are you as a scientist that they're like and fucking twirl around a little bit.
*  And making these incredibly intelligent wild wild beasts of the sea do these dance.
*  I'm surprised they don't snap all the time.
*  Yeah.
*  Do they kill a lot of trainers.
*  Killer whales do.
*  They've killed a few.
*  Yeah that's when they bring them down.
*  There was one they kept using them because they're so valuable.
*  A male killer whale.
*  So he killed someone and they kept him around.
*  Who's the guy that's next up on that.
*  Who's the guy that they're like.
*  I think they sold them to another place.
*  That's what you do because no one working there will be like.
*  Yeah.
*  Whatever happened with that one.
*  There was one in Sea World.
*  So the four four fatal attacks by orcas in captivity till it come was involved in three and he's killed three people.
*  He's the one from Blackfish right.
*  Yeah he probably killed three people.
*  He's got three bodies on him.
*  Why wasn't Tillicum put down.
*  Brand shows family and animal rights activists say they do not want to see Tillicum killed.
*  Brand how do you say that name Brand show.
*  Brand show.
*  Brand show sister Diane Gross told the Associated Press that the trainer loved the animals like they were her children.
*  It would not want anything done to that whale even though it killed her.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Get over it lady.
*  The things things murdering people.
*  Yeah just it killed your kid.
*  If you're the family members of one of those people.
*  I will kill like first of all you should really let it go.
*  You're you're holding it in captivity against its will and it's a super intelligent like behemoth of the sea.
*  I had a lung infection.
*  Damn it went down with emphysema.
*  Where did it where they take it.
*  They moved it somewhere after it killed three people.
*  Just imagine working at that fucking place.
*  And you go who do we guess is the killer where that's killed three people.
*  We got tilly in Orlando.
*  Move to Victoria British Columbia and then back to Orlando.
*  Wow.
*  A long trip.
*  He sired 21 calves throughout his life.
*  So that's what I want him for.
*  He's come.
*  They want his jizz.
*  Yes one is his hot orca whale.
*  You're not.
*  You're not allowed to capture them anymore.
*  Yeah wasn't that that show whale hunters all about that.
*  Just like I don't know.
*  I didn't say it.
*  Oh dude it was wild.
*  I think and there was just these guys going out there and they were trying to stop people from whale hunting.
*  So they just like smash into their boats and shit.
*  Isn't it crazy that they're saying you're not allowed to go capture them.
*  OK.
*  Everybody would agree that's a good thing right.
*  Sure.
*  But you're allowed to keep them and make them breed and make you more of them.
*  That's like saying like no more slavery except for the slaves you have.
*  And if they and you can have kids with them.
*  Yeah.
*  And those count.
*  But no new.
*  You can't.
*  It's almost like you can't go buy a new one but you can keep the one you have right now
*  and force it to breed like if they are as intelligent as us.
*  Yeah.
*  But they just can't manipulate their environment.
*  It's very similar.
*  It's not a human being obviously.
*  So we don't respect it and treat it the same way as we treat ourselves.
*  Sure.
*  Imagine if it was a human being in the same role.
*  That would be insane if there was a human being that had to live in a swimming pool and do tricks.
*  And if like if it's as smart as a human being.
*  Yeah.
*  You go insane.
*  They don't know how smart they are.
*  They really don't know.
*  So you think they just feel crazy the whole time.
*  100 percent just out of their fucking mind.
*  Am I fucking nuts.
*  Out of my fucking mind.
*  How can I have to dance to eat.
*  And you're trapped in a swimming pool.
*  Where's the ocean.
*  But it'd just be like us in a room like a pretty big room that you could run around in.
*  And some of them are born in captivity.
*  When this one was captured at two years old it was put into one tank in Iceland and that
*  was transferred and when it was transferred to the new tank in British Columbia it was
*  abused it said by two older female.
*  Oh wow.
*  Or it says forced him into a smaller pool.
*  That is crazy.
*  Get out of here.
*  He's like I go to the medical pool.
*  Wow.
*  The trainers had to keep him in the other pool for protection.
*  So it's probably isolated just like a person who becomes a serial killer.
*  Yeah.
*  Abused isolated.
*  Yeah.
*  No wonder he's killing people.
*  Because he's trying to he's flailing to get out.
*  He doesn't want to live like that.
*  Fucking asshole.
*  So that's why he grabs a lady that's like I think we can get him up here.
*  But that energy of them getting like killed right before you go.
*  Shut the fuck up.
*  She goes I think we can get.
*  Yeah.
*  Guys if you clap I think he'll come up.
*  You just feel that like that pull that like animal strength of an orca whale.
*  That has to be the most terrifying way to die because you are drowning which is horrible.
*  But number two you're being forced down by a thing that's the size of a building.
*  Yeah.
*  Or not that big but like it's the size of a Mack truck and it's fucking holding you down at the bottom of a pool.
*  And you're just like.
*  And you're just trapped in its teeth.
*  Yeah.
*  So it obviously doesn't give a fuck about you.
*  But it's holding you in a way that you're like well this is it.
*  Rescue attempts were thwarted by the whales who refused to let Burn go even after she was believed to have fallen unconscious in the water.
*  Her corpses later retrieved with a large net after which she was determined to be deceased.
*  Her death was ruled an accident.
*  It's murder.
*  That was murder.
*  The whales were like that they were keeping her there.
*  They were high fiving after.
*  They were stopping the rescue attempts.
*  Yeah.
*  They dapped each other out.
*  They wanted her dead.
*  After they were like we got her.
*  They wanted her dead.
*  Yeah.
*  That's so crazy.
*  They're so smart man.
*  Also was she the head trainer?
*  The lady that got killed?
*  Well she was only 20 and then I'm reading in the second one this says that this the second was a guy they call him a vagrant snuck into the pool.
*  Which by the way.
*  And Tilikum killed him?
*  Yeah.
*  By the way.
*  Well that's on him.
*  You sneak in dude.
*  That is the Ace Ventura moment where he's like here Snowflake.
*  Here Snowflake.
*  See now all of a sudden I'm on Tilikum's side.
*  That guy.
*  That guy.
*  Fuck you.
*  Yeah.
*  That's on you.
*  That's him.
*  But I'm on Tilikum's side like what are you doing?
*  Why are we still allowing that?
*  That's so crazy that after if anybody's watched that movie the orca movie what is it called?
*  Blackfin?
*  Oh Blackfish?
*  Blackfish.
*  I thought you were going to say free willy.
*  I was going to go I know in the soundtrack.
*  Blackfish or have watched any of the documentaries any of the YouTube videos that you could see about orcas in captivity.
*  It's crazy that that's legal.
*  Yeah.
*  It's torture.
*  Yeah you're taking a thing that.
*  It didn't do anything.
*  It's a prisoner.
*  It's a prisoner for life.
*  It's also giant and needs space.
*  Yeah.
*  It needs.
*  It's insane.
*  I can't imagine feeling guilt free owning that place.
*  It's literally like you being stuck in this room for the rest of your life.
*  And then I come out and I do a sick routine and then I come back in and you give me like cheeseburgers and I come back in here and I go like that new Batman bit's really hitting.
*  Yeah.
*  Imagine.
*  Stuff my face and then finally I've just had enough of it.
*  After years.
*  Years of daily of just that.
*  Yeah.
*  And by the way absolute abuse because I'm sure orcas they're smart enough that they don't always listen to commands like anything with intelligence.
*  It's not 100 percent going to listen to commands.
*  Right.
*  It's got to think and sometimes it doubts and sometimes like and then they probably were like abusing it.
*  The fact that they killed her and that the other whales did look out like a fucking prison hit would I would be like I don't want to speak out there but if I was her family back to Shamu because I was like why did they call them all Shamu.
*  Yeah.
*  The first one not the first but it was one of the first ones was called Shamu and this one had an incident too.
*  It didn't though the woman didn't die but.
*  Which she bit the legs and hips of the net.
*  A sea world employee who was told to ride her as part of a film publicity event Shamu refused to release the woman until other workers came to the rescue and pride the orcas jaws apart with a pole.
*  Oh my God.
*  She died four months later.
*  The whale not the woman.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh she's only conditioned to perform with trainers wearing wetsuits.
*  So the problem is this girl got on with wearing a bikini.
*  Because by the way it was 71.
*  So they were absolutely doing that like why don't you give him a sexy ride.
*  A sexy ride on Shamu.
*  Shamu loves sexy ladies.
*  And then Shamu was like I am a devout Muslim.
*  Either get a brick on.
*  That's I mean do you like skin.
*  Yeah.
*  Get your dirty vagina off of me.
*  Yeah you fucking weird rock monkeys touching me with your fucking land skin.
*  You get your feet on me.
*  Your dry skin.
*  She was only trained to do it with people wearing wetsuits.
*  Yeah.
*  So she had previously attacked people in bikinis before.
*  And if you're like if you're one of those guys that like is running that park and you're all sexed up on cocaine on good days.
*  And you're like yeah baby you can ride Shamu.
*  No no it's a sexy ride.
*  She loves sexy rides.
*  He pulls up in his trans am.
*  Yeah you can ride the whales.
*  Because back in the 70s they didn't give a fuck about animals.
*  They didn't give a fuck.
*  70s and 80s.
*  Dude one of my.
*  Fur coats bro.
*  Dude I'm not gonna lie.
*  There's a movie called Milo and Otis in the 80s and 90s.
*  What is it?
*  It's a movie about a puppy and a dog that love each other.
*  Right.
*  My favorite episode of Legion of Skanks ever is I wasn't even on it.
*  Luis J Gomez talks about it gets teared up because he loves the movie so much.
*  I think he's drunk on the podcast.
*  It's like if you watched it in your childhood it sticks with you.
*  It's a movie about a dog and a cat.
*  From 86.
*  I think it's a movie about a dog and a cat.
*  It's about a dog and a cat.
*  From 86.
*  And it's like.
*  Yeah it's about a pug and this cat and their friends and they just go on a wild adventure through.
*  Wherever they're going through.
*  Right.
*  And you're like as part of my childhood it's live action.
*  I remember this being like dude this is such a sweet movie.
*  You look up the animal abuse that occurred on this movie.
*  And I can't even watch this because it upsets me knowing.
*  I think you can look it up.
*  There was a scene involving a cat where they killed like 12 of them to get this scene done.
*  Because I think it was filmed in a country with like no animal rights.
*  Like no at all.
*  And they were just like that scene.
*  That was the scene where the cats and the thing I think they lost like a bunch of cats.
*  Oh my god.
*  There was a scene where they had to make him walk with a limp and they were just breaking his leg.
*  Oh.
*  That's what I mean.
*  You read about it and you're like.
*  Oh my god.
*  Once they did that episode on skanks and then I read about it because I like was listening to the episode playing video games and I was like I got to look this up.
*  It fucked me up.
*  I like can't.
*  Oh my god.
*  It's the animal welfare allegations.
*  Yeah.
*  OK.
*  Yeah.
*  They probably aren't going into the details but you can find the details online.
*  But they were like because you see it and you're like oh look at that.
*  An animal and a cat friends.
*  I like the idea of like if you ran like a billionaire pedophile business.
*  Sure.
*  All right.
*  I'm with you.
*  You did it through an animation company.
*  Oh is that kind of like that.
*  Well the Nickelodeon thing where that guy got busted.
*  That guy Jane I talked to on the bonfire before I left but this guy at Nickelodeon did he was like on.
*  Remember the show head of the class.
*  He was don't remember.
*  Yeah this guy names his name's Dan something and he was a higher up at Nickelodeon and it found out that he was just like like wildly abusing everyone like feet pictures.
*  Dude his pool at his house this guy Dan Schneider this guy his pool at his house is a foot and he was accused of having like a crazy foot fetish.
*  If you have a crazy foot fetish don't make your pool a foot.
*  Whoa.
*  Yeah.
*  Invest.
*  Yeah there's a series.
*  That's what it is.
*  I'm not gonna get from bad documents.
*  The problem is if you get busted for something like that you look like that everyone's going to believe you did it.
*  Yeah but you got pedophile face like a motherfucker.
*  He's got that face.
*  Yeah.
*  You're like.
*  Yeah some deviant shit.
*  You know who else had that was the guy that did all the boy bands in Orlando Lou.
*  Lou what was his name.
*  Lou Pearlman.
*  Lou Pearlman you're just like yeah you abused kids.
*  Like you see a picture of him.
*  Bro the best one is Jimmy Savile.
*  Oh my god dude.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Look at that.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Look at him.
*  Just a bunch of hot boys screaming like they're all having a good time.
*  He's like yeah.
*  He's just nut.
*  Oh my god.
*  He looks like a Philip Seymour Hoffman wore a fat suit and played an evil guy.
*  It was on worse heroin.
*  Yeah.
*  He was on mean heroin.
*  Look at him.
*  Oh my god.
*  But Jimmy Savile was like.
*  The creepiest looking creep of all time.
*  But by the way he did shit that was like in the documentary I don't even know if they
*  brought it up like he would like fuck with kids that were dying like.
*  On the step of death maybe even past.
*  Oh my god.
*  That is evil.
*  Look at him.
*  He looks like.
*  Evil man.
*  A demon.
*  And also who wears a mesh shirt like that when you're all old and got turkey skin.
*  A freak.
*  A sexual freak.
*  Oh.
*  And he had his own supply of kids.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's sexually abusing these kids.
*  And these kids are like dude I'm dying.
*  I got fucking leukemia and I got to fuck this weird looking dude.
*  But imagine that other people knew.
*  Yeah.
*  And they protected it.
*  That's the worst part.
*  There's no way no one knew that he was fucking kids.
*  No it's like it's like the Sandusky thing in Penn State where there were like people
*  that were like kind of found out about it and then were scared that if they said anything
*  they'd lose their job.
*  Right.
*  And then you're like well yeah that's that's where the power comes in.
*  It's not necessarily a clean and cut thing morality wise.
*  I mean obviously it is.
*  I think you say if you see something you say.
*  But like those people kind of who are next to that kind of power.
*  Well they have that thing in them that they want to be close to that power.
*  Yeah.
*  They have that like thirst to be close to that power.
*  So they're not going to say anything because if they say anything they're kicked out of
*  the party and they don't want to get you know what in reality guys like him should be hunted
*  for sport.
*  Yeah.
*  By people.
*  And then you put that on cable.
*  Yeah.
*  And I watch that.
*  And you get really rich.
*  Yeah.
*  You get really rich.
*  You bad people.
*  Yeah.
*  And you go like I want to see Jimmy Sandusky.
*  Imagine if we did have the ability to film things in HD from the sky where you never
*  interacted.
*  You could do the entire show.
*  It's got it's common.
*  And it's Jimmy Savile gets let loose.
*  And one of those kids is 18 now.
*  Oh yes baby.
*  He's got a battle axe.
*  And it's him and his dad.
*  So it's like a bonding experience.
*  Yeah.
*  Or you get the guy Larry Nasser Nasser from Michigan State.
*  I just watched that video of the dad trying to attack him in court.
*  That'll fire you up when you see a dad be like can I get a minute with him.
*  And the judge is like you know I can't do that.
*  Does that move.
*  And then he gets like this guy.
*  Yeah.
*  This and it's completely understandable.
*  Larry Nasser is a piece of shit.
*  What happened to that guy.
*  Did he get in trouble.
*  Yeah.
*  This is it.
*  By the way shout out his daughters for being proud the entire time of him.
*  They don't ever break.
*  They watch it and they're like thanks dad.
*  He just wanted to get his hands on Larry Nasser.
*  That's the one recently the guy jumped across and got to that's why that one's wild.
*  I got some air that one.
*  That guy got a full fucking jump.
*  That was a full Goldberg spear here.
*  That was not instantaneous.
*  He was preparing for that.
*  There's no way.
*  Did he go like do you think he did like a.
*  I just went for it man.
*  It was so fast.
*  There's a moment where you wonder if he goes like it was so fast.
*  Watch how fast he moves.
*  Here he is.
*  Gets her to.
*  You know what.
*  Whatever prison over the whole desk whatever prison he gets put in.
*  You're hoping there's a longest yard situation where you can use this guy on the field.
*  He's going to be a hero.
*  He's going to go in and be like and you got her too because he got he got him.
*  It was an arm tackle.
*  He got her.
*  Did you see what they did to him though the next time they brought him in.
*  Yeah they like muzzled them and kept them like Hannibal Lecter like Hannibal Lecter.
*  Yeah.
*  Show show how they brought him in the second time.
*  Look at look at how they brought him in which you should have entrance music like a fighter.
*  Look at this guy.
*  Look at that.
*  They gave him a net.
*  They put his chain.
*  His hands are in bags.
*  He can't use his fingers.
*  He's handcuffed and shackled and they got seven guys around him.
*  Yeah.
*  Wild dude.
*  Look at his eyes.
*  Fuck.
*  But you know what you hear that thing imagine being him right now.
*  But you hear that thing where the judge goes like because from what I read he was prepared
*  to get like paroled I think.
*  That's where he was in his head and the judge is like no no no you're staying for like five
*  more years and he's like fuck that shit.
*  Like that is such an instantaneous like yeah fuck this.
*  What.
*  Yeah.
*  Like I don't know what he did.
*  I don't know what you know.
*  Yeah.
*  Situation was.
*  But in that moment of being told like no no no you're.
*  He had just been doing a speech.
*  I remember hearing that he said like he had not been committing crimes anymore.
*  He is rehabilitated and shit.
*  And she's like no I don't think she then did the mood.
*  She did the campaign with Tombo and she's like no no no no.
*  What was he being tried for.
*  Like what was he there for.
*  Convicted.
*  But dude that.
*  Battery.
*  Battery.
*  Battery.
*  No way.
*  Not that guy.
*  No no no no.
*  That guy doesn't have an aggressive bone in his body.
*  Dude but by the way that is a fucking hell of a defense.
*  Battery on a protected.
*  Oh that's the one we got for the.
*  Oh that's what he got for her.
*  That's what we got for the judge.
*  For jumping at the.
*  They hit him with the book.
*  Yeah.
*  They hit him with so many charges and it's a viral video.
*  They have to put a stop to that.
*  Yeah it's like streakers.
*  Right.
*  Like they're like they don't show them on TV.
*  Right.
*  They do catch them.
*  They're like we got to hit you with something.
*  We got to hit you something big.
*  I was at the Super Bowl and they ran in the streakers that got there.
*  Do you see the one guy bet on himself.
*  Yeah.
*  That's immediately what I said to Che when we were at the game I was like dude those guys
*  put a bet down that they would do this and they're going to make a lot of money off this.
*  That's pretty wild.
*  Because why not.
*  You'd be like I bet there'll be a streaker in the third quarter and then you're like
*  I can affect that.
*  That's pretty wild.
*  My favorite is that all these betting sites now allow wrestling as a lifelong wrestling
*  fan.
*  I'm like come on guys.
*  That's hilarious.
*  This is crazy.
*  Like you're watching Monday Night Raw and they're like Monday Night Raw Draft Kings.
*  This is fake.
*  This is predetermined.
*  How is that legal?
*  Do you guys try to ruin gambling forever?
*  Dude also what's next?
*  You're going to bet on Fast and Furious movies?
*  I bet Vin hits nausea in the first fucking hour of the movie.
*  You're like this is fucking wild.
*  You're watching, you're going to bet on plays on like Broadway plays or like you know Funny
*  Girl.
*  I bet she has a problem at the end of Act One.
*  It's fucking ridiculous.
*  It's so stupid.
*  And I love wrestling but I would never be like oh finally.
*  My favorite thing was coming up with gambling for my friends when we watched the Royal Rumble.
*  Like you put money in a pot and then you get numbers and then that's your guy.
*  But not like going on an app.
*  Yeah.
*  Putting down like a thousand bucks.
*  Fuck that.
*  Well I think guys get super addicted to that too.
*  It's gambling.
*  Yeah.
*  It's 100% gambling.
*  You ask like people that went to Gamblers Anonymous.
*  Like people that have been through the program through that and they'll be like fuck heroin.
*  Well they say it does the most damage.
*  It does the most damage out of all the addictions.
*  Heroin is a set price.
*  There's no set price with gambling.
*  And by the way the more you go up the higher the high and lower the low.
*  So you're doing big, big bets.
*  You're going to if you get fucked you're fucked.
*  Sure if you win it's amazing.
*  But then all you do is you just want to go do it again.
*  People don't walk away.
*  It's like dealing drugs.
*  People never walk away from that shit.
*  They never win.
*  The house always wins.
*  They're going to take your money.
*  Always.
*  Always.
*  They're not.
*  They have the smartest.
*  Dude I had a buddy when I first moved out east.
*  I lived with my buddy Morgan in New Jersey and he loved he loved the taste.
*  And this is like when you had to go to a bookie and shit.
*  So he was like doing some real gambling.
*  He would get so fucking into it.
*  But then he was right.
*  He would yell this thing all the time when he would bet on the points and the points would hit to fuck him.
*  He would be like they're from the future.
*  They're from the fucking future.
*  He would like scream it if he lost like a thousand dollar bet on the Knicks.
*  And you're like yeah they have the smartest guys working for them.
*  Like they know how like to set the line.
*  Like all those guys are fucking crazy smart.
*  They're crazy smart and they use analytics.
*  Exactly.
*  You're going to you're going against Wall Street.
*  You're going against guys that probably could be making millions on Wall Street.
*  Yeah.
*  And you're just like yeah I think the Chiefs are going to win.
*  Dude the worst was gambling has got it was in Vegas.
*  So you know obviously there's more gambling.
*  But the Super Bowl if your team's in the Super Bowl you fucking care.
*  But I've been to two Super Bowls and what I've learned is there's a lot of people there that don't give a shit.
*  They just want to go to a Super Bowl.
*  They're just out of Super Bowl.
*  They don't care who the teams are.
*  As someone who does care who the team is it's a different viewing experience.
*  Right.
*  So the fourth quarter of the Niners Chiefs game I'm a diehard Niners fan.
*  I am like sweating.
*  I'm like Che and I are like punching each other in weird ways.
*  Like we're just like we're just like this the whole time.
*  We're like holding hands.
*  It was fucking nuts.
*  These fucking guys in front of us were just these like business CEOs from North Carolina.
*  And as they got drunk they like they noticed Che because you know he's on SNL.
*  So they like know a famous guy.
*  So they kind of were doing that thing where they wanted to talk to us.
*  But we were like dude it's a fucking Super Bowl.
*  Like we're watching the Super Bowl.
*  This is big for us.
*  We're 49ers fans.
*  Can we watch this?
*  And by the fourth quarter the guy goes yeah I've got to parlay if Brandon Iuke can get two more catches.
*  And I just put my hand in front of his face and I went what do you know.
*  I don't want to talk to you right.
*  He was turned around talking to me and you're like stop.
*  Because he thinks I care about his bets.
*  You're like dude I love this team.
*  We are almost at the mountaintop.
*  Shut the fuck up.
*  Right.
*  About.
*  It's like having a party over your house.
*  And it's just the wrong person shows up.
*  It just camps out in front of you and starts talking to you.
*  And you're like do you not understand.
*  No.
*  And I give too much of a shit about the 49ers because it was the only thing my dad and I shared.
*  So I give like that extra.
*  Extra.
*  Like this is connected.
*  Like Boston with the Red Sox.
*  It's like yeah it is.
*  National identity.
*  It's a disease more than it is an enjoyment.
*  It's like a thing like I see that logo and I'm like let's fucking go.
*  I just fucking care so much.
*  And that's hilarious.
*  They played last season they played the Eagles in the NFC championship game and all my friends are from Philly.
*  Like a lot of my comedy friends are Eagles fans.
*  Big Jay.
*  Vecchione.
*  Fucking Shane.
*  Tommy.
*  Like there's so many guys I know that love the Eagles but specifically Big Jay.
*  And Big Jay is like dude I'm having a party.
*  Come over and watch it.
*  And I was like no.
*  I care way too much.
*  I care way too much.
*  And it was just him, Eagles fans and then friends that didn't give a shit.
*  And that's what I said.
*  I was like I know there's going to be one person that talks to me that I'm like please don't talk to me right now.
*  But also I'm the enemy over there.
*  So then I watched it at home.
*  Worst decision I've ever had in my life.
*  Because I watched it alone and I just went like crazy like an orca whale.
*  I was just like screaming at a TV by myself.
*  I'd do that if I watched fights.
*  Yeah?
*  Yeah if I watch a good UFC at home I'm screaming.
*  Yeah.
*  Because you.
*  Especially if I shut the door.
*  It's pure enjoyment.
*  It's like yeah.
*  It's the sports viewing equivalent of walking around your hotel naked.
*  Yeah.
*  You're like no one can come in here.
*  This is my room and I'm going to do whatever the fuck I want right now.
*  Yeah.
*  It's unbelievable.
*  And if you're live and you're screaming it just seems normal.
*  But you want one other person there.
*  You want a person.
*  All I had was my dog.
*  And she didn't understand.
*  Why you were yelling.
*  Why I was so fucking hyped up.
*  And when Brock Purdy's elbow got injured she just saw me spiral in a way.
*  You know what dogs can tell you're anxious or whatever.
*  Yeah.
*  She's just like slamming her body into my leg and shaking.
*  And I'm like no no no it's all right.
*  It's all right.
*  We're fucking still in this thing.
*  My dog is so sweet that he freaks out when there's violence in movies.
*  Oh really?
*  We're watching movies together.
*  We're watching this new Netflix show.
*  What is this new Netflix show?
*  It's a Korean series about people that get infected and they become monsters.
*  I don't know.
*  I think it's called Sweet Home or something like that.
*  Sounds badass.
*  It's fucking great.
*  Sounds.
*  It's a fun show.
*  Fun show.
*  But there's some violent moments where the monsters get people.
*  And the dog is like what the fuck is going on.
*  He gets up and starts spinning around.
*  That's called Sweet Home.
*  Fun show.
*  Dogs having anxiety about stuff they don't understand.
*  He's like what is going on.
*  He's got a toy.
*  He's like bringing the toy to me.
*  I'm like dude it's not real man.
*  It's not real.
*  Dude my dog whenever a dog comes on the screen.
*  Because she's like what the fuck.
*  Like someone's in her house.
*  Like we'll just be chilling there.
*  And then she'll try to like Shane came over and was hanging out.
*  It was the first time he met Myrtle.
*  And I think my dog was like trying to impress him.
*  Because most of the time she'll look up and be like.
*  And you're like shut the fuck up.
*  But this one she was like.
*  Like ran to the TV.
*  We're like you're not big.
*  Stop acting big.
*  Because that dog was in this room.
*  It would fuck your shit up.
*  Also she only barks at cute dogs.
*  If it's like a hell hound or something.
*  She's like nah I'm good.
*  She's just completely passing over.
*  She's like nah I'm not fucking around.
*  The first time Marshall saw the American werewolf in London.
*  He barked at it.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh in there.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah that thing.
*  If you're a dog.
*  Yeah.
*  That has to be terrifying.
*  Yeah he saw it.
*  He just went.
*  Yeah.
*  What the fuck.
*  Is he cooled it now.
*  Oh yeah yeah.
*  He knows it's not real.
*  Alright.
*  But that first time he's like.
*  The first time he's like.
*  And he hardly ever barks.
*  Does Carl.
*  One of his first barks ever I think.
*  Carl saw it and was like.
*  What the fuck.
*  You make noise.
*  Hey cool.
*  Dude that is great that you have a dog that you don't know if it barks or not.
*  Marshall never barks.
*  He'll bark if he wants to come inside.
*  Like if someone leaves him outside for a bit.
*  And he comes to the door he'll bark.
*  He'll like one bark.
*  Like mom.
*  No.
*  Dad.
*  Someone's here.
*  Yeah dad.
*  We rode it.
*  We were like.
*  Because we got her during the pandemic.
*  So everyone was inside in New York.
*  And so we're like don't bark.
*  We live in an apartment.
*  Shut the fuck up.
*  And then hilariously.
*  Katie and I left the dog with her parents in Boston.
*  Oh no.
*  And we came back.
*  And the dogs barking.
*  And her mom rules.
*  And her mom just in a boxing accent goes.
*  She box now.
*  And you're like.
*  Well no.
*  I don't think we want that.
*  We still.
*  We've tried hard not to do that.
*  And now she'll just like.
*  She'll pop off for random shit.
*  Like people in the hallway.
*  Oh no.
*  Because we live in a big building.
*  Right.
*  So someone will be out in the hallway.
*  And she'll be like.
*  And just that.
*  And then it's the little grumbles.
*  God damn it dude.
*  I'm so jealous you can go everywhere with Carl.
*  I wish I could bring my fat little bitch everywhere with you.
*  Yeah Carl could go anywhere.
*  Carl just sit in your lap.
*  Yeah Carl's just like.
*  Especially if you time it right.
*  Oh Jamie you get to get so evil if you want to.
*  And then you can just have like a dog where you're like.
*  That is correct.
*  Yeah man.
*  I fucking.
*  Having a dog was the greatest thing about the pandemic.
*  Was we got a dog.
*  And it has made my life.
*  It just.
*  Really.
*  It's just.
*  I've never had a dog in my life.
*  It just rules.
*  Dogs are amazing.
*  It just absolutely rules.
*  They're amazing.
*  I had one growing up.
*  And then I just didn't forever.
*  And I was always like.
*  No I loved seeing dogs.
*  But then having one.
*  You're like.
*  You know what's really funny.
*  I always try to attribute human thought to the dog sometimes.
*  Yeah.
*  Like I'm like one of these days is going to get bored chasing this ball.
*  Nope.
*  There's not a chance in hell.
*  Every time I have one of those.
*  It's like a stick with a scoop on the end of it.
*  That the ball goes in.
*  Oh yeah you get to highlight that shit.
*  And then it's like.
*  It's like a stick.
*  And then it's like.
*  It's like a stick.
*  It's like a stick with a scoop on the end of it.
*  That the ball goes in.
*  Oh yeah you get to highlight that shit.
*  Yeah you highlight the shit out of it.
*  You got a fucking dog highlight.
*  It's nice.
*  It's nice.
*  It's fun.
*  Yeah you can get that thing going.
*  He fucking loves that thing.
*  When he sees me pull that thing he's like.
*  I videotaped it because it's so silly.
*  He's like bouncing around.
*  Oh Jesus.
*  We do it every fucking day.
*  Dude if someone.
*  If someone controlled my PlayStation intake.
*  And then just pulled out a controller.
*  I'd be like.
*  Are we going to play rocket league?
*  It's so funny.
*  I'm like.
*  I'm like.
*  I'm like.
*  I'm like.
*  I'm like.
*  You're like.
*  Are we going to play rocket league?
*  So I guess that's what it is.
*  Yeah.
*  Because you never don't get pumped to play a really good game.
*  No dude.
*  Spider man 2.
*  I'm so excited that they're coming out with DLCs coming and I'm gonna go home and be like.
*  That's me.
*  I'm like Marshall with the toy.
*  Hey have you fucked around with VR at all.
*  No I don't like that shit.
*  Let me explain why.
*  Old school pothead.
*  Loved to be very high.
*  I liked controllers.
*  Right.
*  What I got was a Steam Deck.
*  Which is like.
*  You know the Nintendo switch.
*  It's like that on steroids.
*  And it gets games like really good games for the road.
*  It has made it,
*  because I've fucked with everything from Game Boy on
*  and having a Steam Deck, I'm like,
*  I got it for Christmas.
*  I was like, this is the greatest thing I've ever had.
*  I had to draw the line with video games.
*  When we had, we set up a LAN.
*  Yeah, you get that.
*  Back at the old studio.
*  I got the bug again.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Where I was like.
*  I mean it is.
*  Running in there to play Quake.
*  Turn your brain off.
*  Couldn't wait.
*  Yeah, turn that.
*  But always feel like shit when you leave.
*  What the fuck did I just do?
*  You gotta do it in small servings.
*  Or there has to be a purpose to it
*  where you're done at this moment.
*  Because if you can go, that's where you get sick.
*  It's as if you can just keep going until,
*  like you need an ending point.
*  That's why Madden, the game ends.
*  You're like, I played two games.
*  I'm good.
*  I should walk away from this.
*  With Quake, you could play death matches
*  where you have like five, six guys in a room
*  and you're all killing each other.
*  And you respawn and it gets up to a certain amount of deaths.
*  Oh dude, I absolutely love video games.
*  When I moved to New York, I was like, I'm done with them.
*  And then six months later, I was like,
*  where can I get a cheap Xbox 360?
*  I need to plug back in.
*  But yeah, I mean, Shane and I on my podcast
*  were just talking about NCAA college football's coming out
*  and we're, I think, gonna plan a vacation around playing it
*  because it's a game that hasn't been out since 2014.
*  How does the new Apple, what is it called again?
*  Vision Pro.
*  Vision Pro work.
*  Does it work?
*  I know it works with movies,
*  but does it have to be everything from like the app store
*  or could you play like PlayStation on it?
*  Yep.
*  You can play PlayStation?
*  Yes, there's a way I've seen people connect,
*  which is actually look like,
*  oh, I'll find the video of it.
*  You know how that environment.
*  So if you could do that,
*  then you're watching augmented reality PlayStation.
*  That's the way to get me in VR.
*  So you're seeing a screen.
*  Yeah, you're seeing a screen that's like fucking 30 feet wide
*  and you're on the field.
*  Yeah, dude, I would love to be.
*  And you got a remote controller,
*  just like you do with your regular game.
*  You know, I grew up with the Miami Dolphins coach,
*  Mike McDaniel.
*  It'd be fun to play Madden
*  and just be standing next to him in VR with a controller.
*  I'm like, run the goddamn play, Mike.
*  Dude, I fenced with Mark Zuckerberg
*  and we weren't anywhere near each other.
*  He was on one side of the room, like 15 feet away.
*  You did this, really?
*  Well, this is the best example I can show you
*  is that like they're playing Red Dead Redemption 2
*  Red Dead Redemption on a big screen,
*  but this is the Yosemite environment
*  that the Apple headset puts you in.
*  I love that.
*  Oh, wow.
*  So the sky is dark.
*  Cause here's the thing,
*  Red Dead Rockstar did such an incredible job.
*  That's insane.
*  I would shit.
*  By the way, there's scenes where you're out.
*  Look how big it is, too.
*  It's your entire field of view.
*  And you can look around and just see.
*  That's about the most you could do right now.
*  But that must be amazing
*  when your entire field of view is taken up by the game.
*  And in moments like this, like Red Dead,
*  there's moments where you're in the desert
*  or where you're in a rainstorm up in the mountains.
*  Here's the question.
*  Here's the question.
*  Can you play Quake on that?
*  Dude, you know what it is?
*  You're one of those people, you go,
*  I don't party anymore.
*  And then two hours later, you go,
*  You got it from Peru?
*  I'm just gonna do a gummer.
*  Look how flaky it is.
*  Is that pure?
*  I saw your reaction to those screens in there.
*  The big 55 inch screens.
*  I have one of those at home.
*  I try to play Call of Duty on it.
*  There is a level of, it's too big.
*  Oh, really?
*  What do you mean it's too big?
*  It just gets too small.
*  Have you ever played a Call of Duty in front?
*  Have you ever gotten really close to the screen to play?
*  Yeah, when we moved into our apartment,
*  we put the wrong TV in the bedroom.
*  And Katie plays Call of Duty.
*  She was playing video games.
*  She's like, this is too much, this is too much.
*  Because the screen was like fucking on it.
*  So we were like, oh yeah, we switched it out.
*  I remember back in the Quake playing days,
*  that guys didn't like, some guys didn't like monitors
*  that were more than 21 inches.
*  They wanted it right in front of them.
*  Because you're moving your mouse, right?
*  And the mouse speed.
*  Oh damn, I didn't know Quake was a keyboard mouse game.
*  That's like some real shit.
*  Real shit.
*  That's the real shit.
*  That's the scary shit.
*  You get really good at the movement with the keys,
*  and you get really good with your cursor,
*  and you know how to jump.
*  And every time you hit the space bar, you're jumping.
*  Yeah, that's like Counter-Strike.
*  People used to be into Counter-Strike.
*  But Quake is really fast.
*  The thing about Quake is it's superhuman speeds.
*  You're moving at superhuman speeds with rocket launchers.
*  Oh, hell yeah.
*  And you can instantaneously change weapons.
*  You rocket someone in the air,
*  and you electrocute them to death.
*  It's insanity.
*  If you could do that, like that, on that kind of a screen.
*  I don't know, but I'll tell you what.
*  I'm looking up Quake 4 on my Steam Deck
*  when I get to my hotel.
*  It's a keyboard mouse.
*  You really want a keyboard and mouse.
*  It's tough.
*  You don't wanna fuck with it.
*  You need really precise movement.
*  You're trying to find someone to show it.
*  Find a good one with good graphics.
*  The thing I'm trying to show you is how close
*  some people put their face to their screen.
*  Yeah, they get right up on that.
*  Because I would imagine if you're controlling
*  a 21 inch space.
*  Yeah.
*  And you are very accustomed to moving your cursor
*  around a 21 inch space with your mouse.
*  You're moving it around.
*  You're very precise.
*  If you stretch that bitch out to 40 inches,
*  or 45 or 50.
*  You're gonna lose.
*  Now you're doing this.
*  Yeah.
*  100%.
*  So it's all in one field of vision.
*  You really want it like a 21 inch monitor, I think.
*  24 to 27 is the sweet spot.
*  That's it, right?
*  Yeah, that makes sense.
*  Like right there, bam, bam, bam.
*  And then you gotta get glued onto that screen.
*  Because you don't wanna go back and forth the screens.
*  It's gonna fuck with your timing.
*  Yeah, you need something that's consistent.
*  Yeah, you need to consider.
*  Those guys are fucking freaks with their mouse sensitivity
*  and the weight of the mouse.
*  They add weights to the mouse.
*  That's funny.
*  They take weights away.
*  Some of them like lighter mouses.
*  They make mouses that are hollow to take as much weight
*  out of them as possible.
*  So these guys make custom.
*  Gaming mice.
*  Mice.
*  Mice, find the lightweight gaming mice.
*  They literally, like you know what they do with race cars?
*  They take everything out.
*  Anything that weighs anything.
*  They drill holes in the door handles.
*  They do that.
*  Look at these mice.
*  Hybrid, dude.
*  Look at that.
*  They're like skeletons.
*  Those ones, there's $170.
*  Oh dude, they're money.
*  By the way, some of them are more than that.
*  It's at Pwnage.
*  Some of them are more than that.
*  I love that it's called Pwnage.
*  Yeah, do 495 bucks.
*  See that one in the lower right hand side?
*  Yeah.
*  It says Eurogamer Jamie.
*  The right hand middle.
*  Yeah, that one.
*  Oh, right there, that lightweight in the middle row.
*  That's my style.
*  Damn, dude.
*  And so what you're hitting,
*  because I know you're, are you using the wheel on the top?
*  I use the wheel to switch weapons.
*  Sometimes I use the reel for a rail gun.
*  So when I know I wanna hit the rail gun,
*  I just turn the wheel and it turns into the rail gun
*  instantly, so I have keys pressed
*  that are all set up exactly for each weapon.
*  I feel like a coke head talking to a crack head.
*  Yeah.
*  Here you go.
*  Right key.
*  I do blow and you go, I smoke it out of glass
*  after it's a rock and I'm like, this is nuts.
*  Yeah, right key is all rocket launcher, always.
*  Always. Always.
*  Keep that thing on rocket launcher.
*  Right key is rocket launcher, left key is fire.
*  And how long the games last?
*  You said they're fast, but like five minutes fast or like?
*  Well, there's a timer.
*  Okay.
*  So if you're having a one-on-one death match,
*  you'll set a timer and it'll count you down
*  and then it'll say fight.
*  And then you're just running through the corridor,
*  picking up weapons, trying to pick up armor,
*  and then dudes know where you're at
*  because they can hear you,
*  because they can hear your footsteps
*  and you're grunting as you're running.
*  And so you're running through these corridors.
*  It's always one-on-one?
*  Always.
*  Well, you can do multiple death matches
*  where you just have a fucking melee.
*  Yeah.
*  Where there's like 30 dudes just killing each other.
*  Royal rumble.
*  And you keep respawning and they kill you.
*  Those are fun.
*  Those are really fun.
*  But the way to do it, like one-on-one death match style
*  is the real way to do it.
*  Do you have a friend, do you have any friends
*  that if you picked Quake 4 up,
*  you could call them and be like, we're doing this?
*  I wouldn't do that to them.
*  I wouldn't do that to them.
*  You wouldn't bring that back into their life?
*  It's too immersive, man.
*  It's too good.
*  It's too good.
*  And if you have responsibilities.
*  Yeah, oh, no, I mean, dude, I do my responsibilities.
*  Look at this, this is Quake.
*  So it's kind of similar to Fortnite, right?
*  Look how fast this motherfucker's moving.
*  So he's shooting the rail gun.
*  Now the rail gun kills you instantaneously.
*  The rail gun is like wherever you point at, you hit.
*  You got that doom view.
*  This is like doom.
*  Look at this.
*  And you're running like insanely fast.
*  Look how fast this moves.
*  I love, it's fun to watch the camera on the guy
*  because his face is doing nothing
*  because he's so concentrated.
*  Yeah, and you can see how he's switching weapons.
*  Yeah.
*  That's right, now he's back with the rail gun.
*  He's got a rocket launcher.
*  He's just flying around.
*  Are they?
*  Yeah, shotgun, boom, shotgun, killed that dude.
*  Now he's got the, oh, that was the rail gun.
*  This is the rocket, that's the rail gun.
*  That's the rocket launcher.
*  So he's just hopping around.
*  Do they do like pro tournaments of this?
*  Fuck yeah, they do.
*  This is the finals, this is the top two guys.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, so see how he keeps running back to these spots?
*  That means the weapons are respawning.
*  So every time you snatch a weapon,
*  you have a little bit of time.
*  Boom, fuck that dude up.
*  Damn, okay, all right, this is the closest we've seen.
*  Now they shoot rail guns at each other.
*  So a rail gun is like an instantaneous death
*  unless you're really armored up.
*  Did he kill that guy?
*  It's 11 to three, so whoever liquid RPH is.
*  He fucked that dude up, but that dude had to run
*  and get some more shit.
*  So he had to run and get health,
*  so now he knows where he is.
*  Now he's chasing him.
*  How good did you get at this?
*  I got decent.
*  You got decent, but you get on and then see some guys.
*  I get fucked up.
*  I get fucked up all the time.
*  When you play online games, you'll go against people
*  and you're like, oh, you're at a different level.
*  You don't have the time to compete
*  with some autistic dude who's on ADHD medication,
*  who doesn't have a job, who gets a government check,
*  and he's just rocking people online.
*  It's like that South Park where they play World of Warcraft
*  and their villain is that guy that's like,
*  with those wrists braced on.
*  Those guys get good.
*  And their identity wraps around whatever their name is
*  and they're going out fucking people up.
*  There's certain guys that you would see on a server
*  and you're like, oh no.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, you have a match with them.
*  You just get killed like 100 to nothing.
*  Do you get that thing where you're like, stop?
*  Oh yeah, you get panicky.
*  You're like running into walls trying to find armor.
*  Whoa.
*  Boom, getting blown up again.
*  Do they have videos of them freaking out?
*  Because that's something I like to see is like,
*  gamers spazzing and being like, what the fuck?
*  Oh, there's a lot of those on Twitch, right?
*  It's great.
*  It's almost better than sports fans losing it, punchy TVs.
*  Well, it's so crazy and you can do it anytime you want.
*  So you could have a match anytime you want.
*  That's too tempting, online with real people.
*  Anytime you want, you log in, you see a server,
*  you join the server, boom.
*  Yeah, you're in it.
*  There's one-on-one death matches
*  where there's people waiting.
*  So you'll look, you'll find a server,
*  you're like one guy's waiting,
*  Death Slayer 69 is waiting.
*  And he's just like.
*  And you spawn and they'll start talking shit.
*  And you got the keyboards, you can talk quick.
*  Fuck you, bitch.
*  Do we have to, we'll play online Rocket League or whatever,
*  which is like car soccer and it's fun.
*  This guy's playing, he's about to rage right here too.
*  Yeah, I rage a lot at Rocket League.
*  What is this?
*  I played this for years.
*  It's soccer with cars.
*  Which sounds, dude, it is so addictive.
*  We get online at night and Katie and her brother Kevin
*  are both really good at it.
*  And I'm like, I get too intense and I'm like, fuck, fuck.
*  And I'll like miss the ball and be like, fuck.
*  I'll like rage out.
*  But you'll play guys that you're like,
*  oh, this guy's too good.
*  Like he'll hit it in the air and then just like over you,
*  just score a goal and you're like, what are you doing?
*  Yeah, there's tricks people can do and quake.
*  Yeah, that's what I mean.
*  Like guys that get so good at it that you're like.
*  Guys rocket jump.
*  What is that? When you rocket jump.
*  So if you are fully armored, so if you have 200 armor,
*  you can point your rocket down at the ground
*  and jump at the same time as you pull the trigger
*  and you go flying.
*  That's genius.
*  So you can rocket launch and rocket jump
*  up to like a platform and then hide
*  and then just start picking bitches apart.
*  And so everybody that walks in, you got the rail gun,
*  you got your cursor pointed right at the doorway.
*  And every time people run in the doorway, boom.
*  Out, respawn.
*  That's how it is when I watch people play Call of Duty.
*  I'm like, oh, you're just picking people off.
*  Campers, people get very mad at campers.
*  Yeah, dude.
*  But it's a fucking, look, you're gonna get mad
*  at snipers in a war?
*  Shut the fuck up, that's the part of the war.
*  Cheating.
*  Are you mad at snipers?
*  Snipers are cheating?
*  Stop camping, he's like, I'm a sniper.
*  Was cheating big back when you were playing?
*  Oh yeah, there's bots.
*  Yeah.
*  So they would hide, they would like.
*  People would program, there was different bots
*  and one of them was an aim bot.
*  So what the aim bot would do is you could never miss.
*  So just with a regular stupid gun
*  that only does 10 points of damage every time it hits you,
*  you get a pistol when you start.
*  You're minimally armed.
*  That's why you're going around getting the guns.
*  It's very difficult to kill a fully armored guy
*  with a pistol or a rifle or whatever you get.
*  So then you have to run and grab armor,
*  you have to run and grab a rocket launcher.
*  It's like a super, what are those sweepstakes?
*  The super store sweepstakes where they're like, go!
*  And you're just going through.
*  Yes, you're just running through,
*  trying to gather up as much shit, and you know the map.
*  Everybody has maps memorized.
*  So they know when things are spawning.
*  And some of them even have prompts that tell them,
*  health spawns in 30 seconds.
*  So every time they pass over armor, armor respawns.
*  And they have it all listed on the map
*  and they're running around.
*  And the guys would have these aim bots
*  and they could never miss.
*  So they would kill you and every time they kill you,
*  they would be fully armored.
*  They'd have all the weapons
*  and then they'd know exactly where you were gonna be.
*  And then they would kill you again
*  and they'd kill you again and kill you again.
*  And you couldn't, every now and then they would die
*  and they would respawn and they would kill you again.
*  Cause they couldn't miss.
*  I would love to just talk.
*  Is this a name bot?
*  This is all sorts of, at the beginning of this video,
*  which you were talking about.
*  This is Call of Duty?
*  Yeah, it shows you what the cheats you can buy
*  and how you can subscribe to them per month.
*  Oh, so you pay a company and they give you all that shit?
*  Oh, that's crazy.
*  Oh, that made me mad.
*  That's crazy.
*  And how do you prevent that?
*  You don't.
*  Bro, Call of Duty is a lot quicker than I thought it was.
*  That's fast as shit.
*  This game gets very fast.
*  When they do multi-players, there's one game.
*  That's almost Quake-like.
*  Yeah, there's one level where they're doing
*  like storage units that I watch.
*  Shipment.
*  Yeah, shipment, that's what it is.
*  And it's like nonstop.
*  Like you just like turn a corner, you're dead.
*  Shoot, dead, like that fast.
*  But I remember one time, laser tag,
*  back in the laser tag days.
*  Laser tag?
*  I camped one time.
*  You got a laser tag camping?
*  I camped at laser tag.
*  I just sat by the charge station
*  and every time someone recharged, I'd be like.
*  And then do my stats.
*  We all went, you know how you go out in the lobby
*  and they show your stats?
*  My stats were like, I'm surprised they didn't get a call
*  from the military.
*  It was like 700, I had like 300 kills.
*  It was something wild, because I was just sitting there.
*  I was like a shitty little nine year old.
*  Just being like.
*  You know what you wanna do?
*  What?
*  You wanna do the zombie experience at Sandbox.
*  What is this?
*  Sandbox is a VR game place.
*  Okay.
*  You go and there's a thing called Deadwood Mansion
*  and then there's a new Deadwood something.
*  So you go to a place to do VR.
*  They have two zombie games.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay, you put on the headsets and you are in a house.
*  You are in this house that's getting stormed by zombies.
*  Yeah.
*  And everyone has something.
*  You either have two pistols or you have a shotgun
*  or you have a rifle.
*  And then so then you're just.
*  Listen to me.
*  Get the shotgun.
*  Okay.
*  The shotgun is overpowered.
*  Sometimes they fuck up when they make a game.
*  Yeah, they gotta nerf a weapon.
*  The shotgun's overpowered.
*  The shotgun kills everything.
*  The shotgun is the weapon.
*  And you just stand there.
*  And you just cha cha boom, cha cha boom.
*  But you're in a safe room so you don't run.
*  I'm just down in zombies, bro.
*  So you don't run into a table or anything.
*  Yeah, but you run into your friends too sometimes
*  because you're all together.
*  You can see each other though.
*  So if you bump into.
*  So literally I would see you with your armor on.
*  I would know where your space is.
*  And we would all be moving around together.
*  But sometimes you bump backs into each other.
*  Yeah.
*  But there's zombies coming through the ceiling.
*  They're storming at you and clawing at you.
*  You see red in front of you when they get you.
*  As someone that has sworn off VR,
*  this is the way to get me into it.
*  Which is saying VR zombies.
*  It's so fun.
*  Because it's gotta be scary as shit.
*  Yeah, at one time I had the number three score
*  for this Deadwood Mansion game.
*  Just sit there.
*  I was like what?
*  Because I got the shotgun.
*  Did you feel it though?
*  Because one of the dudes at work there told me,
*  get the shotgun.
*  Really?
*  He goes, yeah, get the shotgun.
*  Yeah, because you show up and he goes,
*  hey Joe Rogan, get the shotgun.
*  It's fucking overpowered.
*  Thanks man.
*  It's really fun.
*  It's a crazy game dude.
*  It's crazy.
*  What the VR does to video games
*  is it just heightens the emotional impact
*  that it has on you because it's sensory.
*  It's kind of like deprivation tanks
*  but it's just putting all the senses into that.
*  Yes.
*  Because I was obsessed with this game
*  Friday the 13th that they made back on PS4
*  and you would either be a counselor or Jason
*  and it's just all online.
*  Dude, it's fucking wild.
*  It was wild.
*  I loved it.
*  But what I would do is I'd smoke a fucking doink.
*  I would smoke a giant joint
*  and then I'd turn off all the lights in my apartment
*  and I'd play Jason and it's scary
*  because this is the guy as Jason
*  but you go around and you hunt.
*  See the counselors inside?
*  Oh my God, you're hunting counselors?
*  Yeah.
*  Bro, that's a dark one.
*  And that's the phone box.
*  That's how you call the cops.
*  He's got set in a trap.
*  He's a decent Jason.
*  I still play it sometimes and I got it.
*  I'm level 150.
*  So Jason is smart?
*  Well, you can set, it's you.
*  It's all strategy.
*  It's you versus these counselors.
*  But Jason can set traps?
*  He has five bear traps and then five throwing knives.
*  Doesn't that seem unrealistic
*  that Jason would know how to set traps?
*  Yeah, he's a stupid mutant that drowned in the lake.
*  He's dead.
*  He's dead.
*  He's a monster.
*  Shouldn't be satisfied.
*  This game fucking, you get so scared.
*  Dude, you get so scared when you're like,
*  because when you're a counselor,
*  you're just like walking around.
*  You're like going through drawers
*  trying to find weapons or whatever
*  and then all of a sudden it's just like
*  in the background it's slowly like,
*  chh, chh, chh, ah, ah, ah.
*  And then when Jason shows up at,
*  when you're at a cabin,
*  he'll smash the window and it's like,
*  yeah, yeah, and if you have headphones on,
*  you're like, get the fuck out here!
*  Dude, it's, I'm getting all goose-ed up.
*  I'm going home.
*  I'm playing Jason.
*  If the servers are still up,
*  I'm fucking back on it when I get home.
*  I have not seen it,
*  but I have heard legend of this alien game
*  that's on VR that's supposed to be insane.
*  Like Alien, the first movie.
*  Oh, oh, Alien.
*  Ridley Scott Alien.
*  There's an alien game.
*  I just watched Prometheus.
*  Is this true?
*  I wanna make sure this is true.
*  Someone told me that it's a terrifying game
*  that you can play on VR
*  that's based on the first Alien.
*  I just went through an Alien kick.
*  They told me this at least a year ago,
*  maybe more.
*  Probably more than a year ago.
*  Do you think we see in the future,
*  do you think we see things like
*  heart attacks and shit from VR
*  as they're already happening?
*  People getting so scared
*  that it hurts them in real life.
*  Well, I think if you're really vulnerable
*  and your heart gets jacked up
*  to like 190 beats a minute,
*  especially if you have one of those guys
*  on those omnidirectional treadmills they have now.
*  Oh, really?
*  Dude, they have a surface.
*  This is a new surface
*  that it's a contained surface,
*  like a contained space,
*  and whatever direction you walk in, it moves.
*  Oh, so it does like the topography of like...
*  No, no, no.
*  It just stays flat,
*  you can go left and right,
*  and it goes left and right,
*  and it goes, you back up,
*  it backs up with you,
*  you stay in the same spot,
*  but you're walking around.
*  And it somehow or another registers
*  through the headset, into the flooring,
*  which direction you're going,
*  and it compensates for that.
*  They're gonna think we're such idiots in the future
*  when they're like,
*  you're just holding a controller and playing.
*  But do you know what kind of good shape you would get in?
*  Disney updated this.
*  It's not available yet,
*  but they've made one that's now,
*  they've shown it this year.
*  Here's what you do.
*  You put ankle weights on,
*  and you put a weighted vest on.
*  And then you play one of these gun games
*  that's like really intensive,
*  and you get that,
*  and you get jacked,
*  and you're walking around with all that weight on.
*  That's a fucking workout.
*  Also, what they should do is,
*  we got those trillions of dollars
*  going around in our military.
*  The military probably has something like this developed.
*  100%.
*  They're with Boston Dynamics.
*  They're probably laughing at this.
*  You wanna see our robot take down
*  a fucking village in Columbia?
*  The alien game I found,
*  if this is the correct one,
*  is someone made the actual alien game,
*  and they made a VR port of it, if you will.
*  They've sort of hacked it so that it works in VR.
*  Oh really?
*  I don't know if that's the official.
*  I think that must be it.
*  But dude, alien.
*  But what I heard is it's fucking terrifying.
*  Yeah, because you can get scared as shit.
*  I mean, I got scared as shit at that Jason game,
*  and I knew what was going on.
*  But that one movie was scarier,
*  because there was only one alien that was smart.
*  It was great.
*  They kind of fucked that up in the second one,
*  because there was a bunch of them,
*  and they were kind of easy to kill.
*  What happened?
*  And they also just threw it in.
*  They were like, and we're on the ship,
*  we're on this planet, here you go.
*  There's a ton of them.
*  I never bought the second one.
*  It's a great movie.
*  I love it.
*  By itself.
*  Aliens is a great movie,
*  but it's not the same thing as the first movie.
*  That first one was smart as fuck.
*  Yeah.
*  It was smart and clever.
*  It would wait for people and hide.
*  It knew how to get around you.
*  It knew how to attack you when you weren't looking.
*  And the second one, there were-
*  And the little mouth.
*  Yeah.
*  Was the little mouth in the second one,
*  where it came out and was like-
*  Oh, they always come out.
*  Right here, they come out of there.
*  The little thing?
*  The tongue, it's like a mouth,
*  and it gets you right in the head,
*  and sucks your brains out.
*  Did you like Prometheus?
*  Yes.
*  I loved it.
*  I just watched it.
*  I did, I loved it.
*  I loved the idea.
*  I had a problem with, I loved the idea.
*  I had a problem with the ending,
*  because she escapes on this,
*  spoiler alert,
*  she escapes on the spacecraft of the architects,
*  like the big humans that made us.
*  Yeah.
*  And she's going back to their world.
*  She sets the course to be like,
*  no, fuck this, I'm gonna go where these people are from
*  that made us, and made the Animorph,
*  made the alien.
*  Yeah.
*  And it just leaves you,
*  just leaves you high and dry.
*  Where'd you go?
*  Show me that shit.
*  I wanna see what planet all these architects are living on.
*  The last one was really good.
*  Alien three?
*  What was, no, the last, what was the last, Covenant.
*  Covenant was good, dude.
*  Really?
*  All right.
*  You know who's in that?
*  Jesse Smollett.
*  Really?
*  Yes.
*  Damn, when he pops up and stuff,
*  you're like, oh, hey, like Mighty Ducks.
*  It was on like during Christmas,
*  and it was just on in my hotel,
*  and I was like, hey, Jesse Smollett.
*  That's the kind of mistake that's tough to forget.
*  Well, it's getting caught in such a major lie.
*  Such a sociopathic situation.
*  But also-
*  It's something for attention that's so-
*  And you get turned on by the people that were helping you?
*  Where they go like, yeah, fuck that guy.
*  I helped him, and he's a fucking dick.
*  And you're like, oh my God.
*  That's what's wild is, dude, if I got-
*  It's also like the way it was structured,
*  to come in with the noose still on his neck.
*  Like what?
*  Yeah, dude, it's like, oh no.
*  It's like a-
*  Holding a Subway sandwich.
*  You know what it's like?
*  It's like murder mystery dinners.
*  Do you know where they have to oversell it?
*  Where they're like, oh, the knife is still in me.
*  But isn't that crazy that there's people out there
*  that will do literally anything?
*  Yeah, because they're not in therapy.
*  They don't understand why they're reaching out for this.
*  But don't you think people that are that broken,
*  like it's not that simple?
*  That's so broken.
*  No, not at all.
*  I think what it is is it's like,
*  you know when there's like an infection
*  because something's embedded in you?
*  But it's not the thing that's embedded in you
*  that's causing the problem as much as it is
*  the part of it that's infected
*  and now it's got a different thing.
*  That's what that is, where it's like,
*  something happened to them
*  and instead of them solving it and pulling that out,
*  that splinter that got infected,
*  the infection built on it,
*  and now you're dealing with six things
*  on top of the actual problem.
*  That's my guess, but that's what it feels like.
*  Because I've seen people go through bad shit
*  and correct it and be okay,
*  and I've seen people go through kind of bad shit
*  and then it just snowballed.
*  There's also this thing that people do
*  when they do things like that,
*  where they recognize that a certain amount of bullshit
*  is tolerable.
*  A certain amount of you exaggerating an experience
*  and saying that you were threatened,
*  a certain amount of that seems to be tolerated.
*  Where you don't want to question
*  because then it appears that you're insensitive
*  and you go, well, you know,
*  and then there were so many people
*  that stood up for that guy
*  and made these tweets about.
*  We're knee-jerk reaction.
*  Yeah, but it's also like we don't have any information.
*  You don't have any information and you're acting on this,
*  but the story seems so implausible.
*  But nobody wanted to say it.
*  Nobody wanted to say, I think he made that up.
*  I immediately thought of when that happened
*  in the reaction a couple weeks later,
*  I immediately thought of Ben Stiller in the cable guy
*  when they're doing like the Menendez Brothers spoof
*  and they do the phone call and he goes,
*  I don't know who it was, but he was Asian.
*  And they just like, they're clearly lying on the phone call
*  and you're like, that's kind of how that felt to me
*  where you're like, dude, you work in the arts.
*  You should know how to tell a better story.
*  Your storytelling is dog shit.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  But he looks Asian and he's speaking another language.
*  I'm like, Ben is Asian.
*  So that's like they're spoofing the Menendez.
*  They clearly killed their parents,
*  but that was their excuse.
*  And you're like, when someone like him
*  who's been a child actor,
*  this guy's been a child actor his whole life, right?
*  And they know how the roller coaster goes.
*  They know they're on fire, they're in Mighty Ducks,
*  they're in fucking Alien Covenant, you know what I mean?
*  And then they're on a big show.
*  They're on a big fucking show.
*  And then the tank starts running out.
*  Where you're like, hey, the show's running out
*  and we're not paying you as much
*  as you think you need to get paid.
*  You get desperate.
*  And you start being like, well, what can I do
*  to stay up there?
*  What's gonna keep me, how do I rocket launch?
*  Am I wearing enough armor to rocket jump
*  and rocket launch myself back up?
*  And he fucked up.
*  And he just is like, it was a desperate move.
*  A publicity move.
*  Yeah, we're being like, if this works, I am the victim.
*  Everyone loves a victim.
*  And it'll just keep being that,
*  but then you get fucking caught, dude.
*  Hilarious.
*  It's just funny.
*  It's just the funniest shit in the world.
*  It's just like, what's up?
*  Like that call when they, dude,
*  Ran Aziz did this awesome show in Edinburgh at Fringe
*  in 2019 when I was there.
*  And he did an hour about what it was like being busted,
*  lying about 9-11.
*  Right.
*  Dude, the show gave me anxiety.
*  Cause have how, he did it beautifully.
*  He did it beautifully.
*  He was, it was funny.
*  It started funny.
*  He was explaining how he was famous.
*  It was the league.
*  It was the last season.
*  And he goes into the, and he tells you about the call
*  from the New York Times where the guy goes,
*  I wanna talk about 9-11.
*  And Ran Aziz, he was like, dude,
*  the way he even telling you that.
*  The way he describes it, you're like, oh fuck.
*  But he made it funny.
*  And he made it into a thing of like, I fucked up.
*  It was a great hour.
*  I hope he taped that.
*  I don't know if you ever taped that, but I mean,
*  that feeling of like Smollett getting caught
*  with that first thing where they go, they're not buying it.
*  And he's like, fuck.
*  I think he's maintained that he told the truth
*  through the entire time, hasn't he?
*  Yeah, I think he, I think he.
*  Did he ever say?
*  I don't know.
*  This is where I feel bad for actors because as comedians,
*  we can immediately go like, I'm a fucking idiot.
*  We can say we're wrong much easier than actors.
*  Because actors have that, and you know,
*  you've been around them.
*  They have that like, it's like being around the queen.
*  There's like little rules that you can't do.
*  I can't bust your balls because you'll take it seriously.
*  That's just how the entertainment business is.
*  Musicians act different than actors
*  and actors act different than comedians.
*  And there's just all this stuff,
*  but I don't think as an actor, he can go like,
*  fuck man, I was desperate.
*  You don't know when you're gonna get on your next show.
*  You don't know when you're gonna get your next gig.
*  If he would have just done one of those,
*  he probably would have.
*  But then he'd have to admit that it was true.
*  That's what I mean.
*  And I don't think he wants to admit that it was true.
*  And now he's stuck in that prison forever.
*  And now he's stuck in that thing where you're like,
*  so you're saying something that we all,
*  that the guys involved said that you were full of shit.
*  You know what's wild though?
*  I guarantee you that some people believe him still.
*  Like there's people that believe Cosby to the end.
*  That is, what a ride or die.
*  When that evidence comes out,
*  it's like women that love serial killers.
*  You're like, you can just get there, huh?
*  It's like thinking that that orc is not gonna turn on you
*  after it did three.
*  After it killed three people and you're like,
*  ah man, you know, my pool's a little bit bigger.
*  And then there's like the female vampire helper.
*  Like, Ghislaine Maxwell's like the female vampire helper.
*  There is a level of evil
*  on that whole Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein.
*  That's why it's such a joke right now
*  is because it's so bad.
*  They're like, oh, this is fucking Epstein Island.
*  And you're like, oh, it's the worst of the worst.
*  It's like the most disgusting shit.
*  But it's what kind of,
*  it comes back to what we were talking about with billionaires.
*  It's like, if you got that evil person
*  in your ear right there, you're doing some dark shit.
*  Looks great.
*  Ghislaine Maxwell looks great
*  as she runs Florida prison half marathon,
*  does yoga and Pilates ahead of March appeal.
*  Who reads that and goes, good, good.
*  Let her out, yay.
*  Let her out, let her out.
*  Look at where she's running.
*  There's gotta be people,
*  her life is threatened on a level
*  that we'll never understand.
*  Bro, there is no chance she stays alive
*  if they let her out.
*  No, because the people that are.
*  She's gonna be writing a book, you know.
*  If she writes a book.
*  There's already a manuscript.
*  There's already like.
*  Do you think that that's why she's in prison?
*  Yeah, it's.
*  Listen to this.
*  What if she goes to prison to write a book?
*  Because they say the only way
*  that this information is gonna get out.
*  Is if we have you locked.
*  We have you locked up.
*  We protect you and you write a book.
*  Dude, her information of Rolodex
*  of the things that have happened
*  can destroy people that are as powerful
*  as our top businesses.
*  Will topple kings.
*  Like she has information on people.
*  Of course they're gonna lock her up.
*  Isn't that wild?
*  Yeah, let her live in the villages in Florida.
*  She's fucking.
*  This woman has.
*  She's dangerous.
*  She has a dangerous amount of knowledge.
*  And she's probably knowing the clock's ticking.
*  Yeah, release of court documents
*  expect well over 100 people connected to Epstein.
*  Which is just like.
*  Hold up, what's the full.
*  She's serving 20 years in prison
*  for luring young women, blah, blah, blah.
*  Shared her thoughts via an attorney
*  ahead of the release of court documents
*  expected to name well over 100 people
*  connected with Epstein.
*  Maxwell's lawyer, Arthur Idala,
*  Idala said that New York Nation's Mario Cuomo.
*  No, not Cuomo.
*  Cuomo.
*  Chris Cuomo, right?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  It's Cuomo, Chris Cuomo, not Mario.
*  I think it's the younger one, I don't know.
*  Yeah, the guy who used to be on CNN.
*  Yes.
*  News Nation's Cuomo that Maxwell has nothing to say
*  about the impending release of names,
*  but that the former socialite takes issue
*  with the fact that the only person facing consequences
*  over the rampant sex trafficking of young girls is a woman.
*  I don't think she has anything to talk about.
*  That's how smart she is.
*  Maybe that if you look at this crime, this overall crime,
*  it's all about men abusing women for a long period of time
*  and it's only one person in jail, a woman.
*  Absolutely genius.
*  What a genius defense.
*  Her going like this.
*  So I guess it's a boys club when everyone's getting abused,
*  but in court it's only a woman.
*  And you're like, well the other guy got murdered.
*  Epstein got murdered in jail.
*  Maybe you should tell us who else is involved
*  and we'll lock them up too.
*  Yeah, we'll throw some boy names out.
*  But how weird is it that no one gets named?
*  Well, that's what I mean with she's on a-
*  That's how you know how much power is involved in this.
*  She's on a level of danger that they're like-
*  She's like, that's what we need to really get in our heads.
*  There's still an I can kill you in front of everybody
*  and hide it in the news thing going on.
*  What did Putin just do?
*  Yeah.
*  Putin just killed a journalist and was like,
*  what are you guys gonna do?
*  And we're like-
*  That Naval-
*  Those subways are real nice.
*  What was that guy's name?
*  Navalny?
*  Yeah, I always fuck it up.
*  I've only read it.
*  That guy seemed to be not like the sweetest of dudes either.
*  Everyone's dirty.
*  Everyone's a human being.
*  That's the whole point is like there's danger on-
*  Was he a nationalist?
*  I think he just spoke out against Putin.
*  The crazy one that I'm still obsessed with
*  is the dude that tried to overthrow Putin.
*  Do you remember that?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  We were moving in with an army and then-
*  Let's get to this guy first though.
*  Alexei-
*  Russian, yeah.
*  Alexei-
*  Navalny was a Russian opposition leader,
*  lawyer, anti-corruption activist, and political prisoner.
*  He organized anti-government demonstrations
*  and ran for office to advocate reforms against corruption
*  in Russia and against President Vladimir Putin
*  and his government.
*  So what was the controversy about him though, his views?
*  He's against Putin.
*  No, no, no, but there were some other ones.
*  There were some other ones like-
*  He's a Cosby believer.
*  He's like, I think Bill Cosby got a bad rep.
*  He had some questionable things that I was reading.
*  But the other dude led an army and they were like,
*  hey, he's marching on Moscow.
*  And then he went, just kidding, no I'm not.
*  And then a month later they're like, his plane crashed.
*  And you're like, why were you getting in a plane?
*  You went against Putin and you're gonna fly around in Russia?
*  Are you out of your fucking mind?
*  What the fuck is wrong with you?
*  How is no one around him going like,
*  you can't John Madness, you can't take a bus.
*  We can protect the bus.
*  Imagine thinking that Putin wouldn't kill you
*  when you pulled up to Moscow.
*  In a tank, he showed up in a tank.
*  It was before he died.
*  Okay.
*  From the honesty.org.
*  Just like who he was.
*  Who he was.
*  I mean, I don't know what-
*  So he's basically an anti-Putin activist.
*  Yeah, he's poisoned by it.
*  Russian opposition figure, anti-corruption activist
*  was unlawfully detained and has now been in prison
*  for 11 years and six months.
*  He's still in prison and suffers continual ill treatment,
*  including constant surveillance and psychological pressure.
*  He must be freed immediately and unconditionally.
*  So he died in prison.
*  Yeah.
*  And what was the controversy about him?
*  Someone was saying something about his nationalist views.
*  It could be.
*  Just see if you can find something.
*  Someone was saying terrible things about him.
*  I mean, that guy dies.
*  You always wonder.
*  That is something that they would do.
*  Yeah.
*  They'd say, oh, he's just-
*  Do you remember when he got that guy Litvinenko
*  with the, in England with the sushi?
*  Yeah.
*  Where they just reached down and were like,
*  you're dead.
*  They put plutonium in the guy's sushi.
*  And there was like, he was like a rogue KGB agent.
*  And they were like, we'll see.
*  But dude, you think they're bad.
*  What do you think we do?
*  Yeah, we do that too.
*  What do you think we do?
*  We do shit that we're like,
*  the CIA has been cooking up stuff that like,
*  even Russians go like, that's pretty fucking good.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, do you ever think they like wink at each other?
*  Like, you're fucking nuts.
*  And he's like, yeah, we fucking did this whole thing.
*  We flew planes into our towers.
*  And they're like, you guys don't give a fuck.
*  Like if there's an open conversation about it,
*  they just fuck around.
*  Not a Western liberal Democrat.
*  There's a darker side to him some say.
*  That's such a fucking,
*  they're pushing that out there to be like, hey.
*  Is controversial views on Muslims in the caucus,
*  Georgians and Central Asian migrants in Russia.
*  Immigrants from Central Asia bring in drugs to Russia.
*  Navalny said in an interview with 2012,
*  defending what he described as a realist visa requirement
*  for wonderful people from Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.
*  While he was reflected upon some of these past remarks,
*  they frequently resurface,
*  causing some to question if Navalny is what many
*  in the Western world think he is.
*  Navalny's controversial statements stem
*  from his political origins in the nationalist movement,
*  according to McGinn.
*  There will be a feel-good A24 movie
*  about this guy in two years.
*  He used to attend the Russian march,
*  a very far right nationalist group,
*  generally behind the slogan, Russia for ethnic Russians.
*  Anybody who expects Navalny
*  to be an ideal Western liberal Democrat has been mistaken,
*  she tells Euronews.
*  His ultra-nationalistic sentiment was prominent in a video
*  dating back some 17 years, filled with xenophobic comments.
*  Do you think this is like his getting like when comics,
*  when they bring up old clips of comics on podcasts?
*  Like he was like, oh, that was 12 years ago.
*  I was crazy.
*  So this is what he was saying.
*  He said, everything in our way should be carefully
*  but decisively removed through deportation.
*  Navalny said in the video dressed as a dentist,
*  comparing immigrants to dental cavities.
*  He was dressed up, he was doing costume work.
*  He's like, he has his hands like this.
*  He's like, I know we're having fun here,
*  but really we've got to get rid of immigrants.
*  Maybe it was a sketch.
*  Yeah, he's just doing an SNL sketch.
*  He's like, live from Moscow, it's political prisoner.
*  Someone said, you know Navalny,
*  the best way to get this information out is humor.
*  I want you to be over the top against the immigrants,
*  over the top, like they're fucking cavities.
*  And I am the dentist.
*  Navalny, take care of cavities for you.
*  They go, we'll call it laughing gas.
*  And it's all sketches done like, and this.
*  And it's trick this dude into doing this.
*  They really did a movie already?
*  Already made a documentary about him two years ago.
*  Oh, they had it.
*  And what does the documentary say?
*  I have no idea.
*  Does it say, is it all a pro thing?
*  Yeah, HBO and CNN.
*  Yeah, see anybody that's in opposition to Putin
*  has to be good, you know,
*  it's the enemy of our enemy, it's my friend.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, that's a controversial take.
*  This guy was just gossiping.
*  This guy's like, did you hear what Putin did?
*  And then the other guy was like, I got tanks, bro.
*  We're fucking pulling up to Moscow.
*  And he thought he was gonna be okay.
*  Thought he was fine.
*  And by the way, it was in the news a lot,
*  and then it was completely gone, which you're like.
*  Of course he did it.
*  Like everybody knows he did it.
*  They just suck the air out of the room.
*  But Putin's always like, what are you guys doing?
*  Yeah, that's my favorite.
*  Why are you always going after me?
*  What are you guys doing?
*  We haven't invaded anybody.
*  Oliver Stone interview and the Tucker interview.
*  He really loves to be like, you guys are so great.
*  You know when you fight with your girl
*  and she'll bring up something you did
*  and you get defensive, so you just go like,
*  yeah, but what's up with you?
*  Fucking, you do stuff?
*  Ah!
*  Totally.
*  You're a bitch sometimes.
*  Fucking bitch.
*  God damn it, I got nothing.
*  I got nothing, I'm sorry.
*  Ah!
*  That's true, but he's got a point.
*  I mean, dude, he is like.
*  We do live shit.
*  Do you remember the lady that wrote him the poem
*  when he invaded the Ukraine?
*  She wrote him a poem?
*  This Hollywood actress did a thing that was like.
*  Yeah, dude.
*  No way.
*  This shit is so funny.
*  No, this is not real.
*  Don't tell me this is real.
*  You never saw this?
*  No.
*  This shit is so funny.
*  Play it from the beginning.
*  This is the most I'm in LA bubble.
*  Oh my God, I have to see this.
*  I have to see this and I don't want.
*  I was at Vladimir Putin.
*  I'm so sorry that I was not your mother.
*  If I was your mother, you would have been so loved.
*  Held in the arms of joyous light.
*  Never would the stories plight the world,
*  unfurled before our eyes,
*  a pure demise of nations sitting peacefully
*  under a night sky.
*  If I was your mother,
*  the world would have been warm.
*  So much laughter and joy and nothing would harm.
*  I can't imagine the stain, the soul stealing pain
*  that the little boy you must have seen and believed
*  and the formulation of thought quickly taught.
*  This is so self gratuitous.
*  But also.
*  This needs an editor.
*  Yeah, lady.
*  Get to the punch.
*  There's too many superfluous words.
*  This is a world salad.
*  It's quite superfluous.
*  It's a word salad, lady.
*  It's nonsense.
*  But by the way, do you know that.
*  I bet she's a wild one though.
*  Yeah, but you also know that Vladimir Putin
*  was given up, you know he's given up by his mother
*  for adoption.
*  Oh really?
*  He has like a horrible relationship with his mother.
*  He was like, he was given up for adoption
*  and the people and they like started training him
*  as like a young, young.
*  He got into like.
*  As a soldier.
*  Yeah, he's like a super soldier.
*  He was like built for this shit.
*  So this woman in a condo in Santa Monica going,
*  I would hug you and I would feel the plight of the world
*  on my shoulders and he goes, lady, I was left for dead.
*  Yeah, and you would be dead as well.
*  You would not be my mother.
*  I would kill you.
*  He'd be like, dude, he fucking done given shit.
*  Putin is so scary that when he put on hockey equipment
*  and played against the Russian team,
*  they let him score like six goals.
*  It was some Kim Jong Un shit.
*  100%.
*  They're like, oh whoa, look at him go.
*  He's like.
*  He's a legit black belt in judo though.
*  Is he?
*  Does he does Sambo and judo?
*  I do not know if he does Sambo as well.
*  But that guy could fuck shit.
*  He definitely does judo.
*  He's a legit black belt.
*  Really?
*  Like he's an older guy, but by the way he moves
*  and the things he does,
*  he does everything absolutely correct.
*  And I'm not a judo expert.
*  But also.
*  But I know how these throws look
*  when I see judo experts do them.
*  But this isn't the Steven Seagal videos
*  where he's just doing like the.
*  Well, no, that's not.
*  See, like right there, that's a beautiful hip toss.
*  That is a beautiful hip toss.
*  The way he did that, the way.
*  Look at the smoothness, man.
*  That's legit.
*  That's legit.
*  Do you think wars?
*  He's a legit judo black belt.
*  So that guy is definitely not helping at all.
*  No, no, no.
*  No, no, no.
*  No, Jamie.
*  The whole time that guy is like fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
*  This is how these things are trained.
*  No, I know.
*  I'm just saying.
*  But guys do resist too.
*  But this is just an execution of technique.
*  Just the fact that he can do that.
*  That is very.
*  Like if I showed you how to do that,
*  it would take you a long time
*  before you could do it that smoothly.
*  Now I'm very dumb when it comes to both judo,
*  but also more importantly,
*  I'm very stupid when it comes to politics.
*  Here's my question.
*  Jamie, you questioning this?
*  Is that what you.
*  No, I'm not questioning it.
*  I'm just saying if you're the guy that's going with Putin,
*  you're definitely gonna be the best dance partner
*  of all time.
*  Yeah.
*  Yes, but you're gonna lean into it.
*  You're selling the moves.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  You're wrestling.
*  This is.
*  I've literally had this done to me.
*  K-Fabe, a little.
*  And it's sort of.
*  It's actually just drilling.
*  But I've had this done to me by people who are good at judo
*  and it's shocking how easy they can throw you around.
*  Yeah, cause like when he kicks his feet out.
*  All he's doing is it seems a lot harder than it is.
*  You're just getting the guy, you're bouncing together,
*  you're timing the bounce and you're sweeping him
*  and pulling at the same time and you just go flying.
*  Yeah, it's like when you were little
*  and you'd be walking in front of one of your friends
*  and they'd kick your foot with the other one
*  and you go like.
*  You go fucking flying.
*  Fuck you.
*  I think wars should just be our leaders versus theirs.
*  Oh, he would win.
*  That's what I mean, like maybe that would also.
*  He would fuck up all of them.
*  He would fuck up everyone who's ever been president.
*  That would change the way we elect our president
*  where we're like who we got, who can we roll with.
*  Well, we would change, it would be UFC champions.
*  Yeah, yeah, John Jones.
*  We'd be president John Jones in 2024
*  and we'd just be dominating the world.
*  Yeah, we'd make Alex Baheda
*  an official US citizen immediately.
*  Dude, immigration would change so fast.
*  Francis Engado, US citizen.
*  You go, I would love to have you, sir.
*  Full US citizenship, raise your right hand.
*  We fucking love you, bro.
*  Brazilian population shot through the roof
*  of the United States once.
*  If that would be, if there was one guy,
*  it would either be John Jones or Francis Engado.
*  That would be the one person.
*  I mean, we don't know until they do it,
*  until they do the dance.
*  But you know what?
*  Another country would probably be smart
*  and they'd go like, hey, Francis,
*  how about we give you everything?
*  You're our king, you're everything.
*  And then you're just, we have the best,
*  now we have the best military in the world.
*  One guy military.
*  But we still have Bones Jones.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh man, can you imagine that?
*  Imagine that.
*  We gotta get Jones on steroids.
*  We gotta drop the USADA right away.
*  Dude, I'm telling you right now, USADA's gone
*  and they put him in like a Weapon X program
*  where they're like, how can we?
*  USADA's gone, Brock Lesnar returns.
*  Oh my God.
*  Oh my God, dude.
*  Brock Lesnar returns, he's 350 pounds at 49 years old.
*  Yeah, with 4% body fat.
*  Just fucking juggernaut.
*  And you just hear the.
*  Just like a juggernaut.
*  And you hear that WWE music here, it's like,
*  banna.
*  Yeah, and you just hear, that was romance,
*  everyone's getting smashed.
*  Yeah, dude.
*  You're trapped in a cage with a superhuman.
*  But that's what it, I mean, that was like,
*  we do that, how many lives are you saving?
*  How many trillions of dollars are you saving?
*  We don't need missiles and fucking, you know?
*  Yeah.
*  We get away from the American military industrial complex
*  and just have a badass president.
*  And then no one talks shit about the president.
*  You think CNN or Fox News is gonna run their mouth
*  about a guy who's like, by the way,
*  I'm doing a press briefing.
*  He's just doing his, he's like, oh yeah, huh?
*  You thought about that?
*  They're like, what about taxes?
*  He goes, I think you need to shut the fuck up,
*  is what I think you need to do.
*  Yeah, dude.
*  Because Putin is like.
*  He's the only badass.
*  You see that guy, you go, he's killed people.
*  Well, I think Netanyahu has as well.
*  Netanyahu was like a serious operative
*  in the Israeli army.
*  What was Netanyahu's military background?
*  It's like, it's actually very impressive.
*  When you hear about the stuff that he's done.
*  I mean, yeah, in Israel, everyone serves.
*  So it's not a question of if he did or not.
*  Yeah, but I think he was like a special forces guy.
*  Their version of whatever the Navy SEALs are.
*  Also, the idea is always funny to me
*  of running up on someone that's like
*  trained to be a badass and you think they're an old man.
*  And it's taken.
*  It's the whole idea of taken.
*  But I just watched.
*  Here it is, after graduating from high school in 67,
*  Netanyahu returned to Israel
*  to enlist in the Israeli Defense Forces.
*  He trained as a combat soldier and served for five years
*  in a special forces unit of the IDF.
*  Yeah, that guy's.
*  He's, yeah.
*  Run up on him.
*  Run up on Bibi.
*  He'll kill you with a pencil.
*  Yeah, he'll, you won't even know what happened.
*  Your arm will be broken and you'll be like,
*  I didn't even reach for him.
*  The crazy thing about this Israeli thing
*  is before October 7th, there was thousands of people
*  in the streets protesting against him.
*  Thousands for like months.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Because he was trying to expand the powers of government.
*  Yeah.
*  He's a guy where he's like, you know,
*  you look at people that have been through war
*  and that kind of shit, they're just like,
*  they're calloused to it.
*  If I was your mother.
*  Bibi.
*  I would have taken you in in a joyous bathing light of.
*  I would have had you suckle on my teat
*  until you were 12 years old.
*  The madre earth in spirits of the sky.
*  Just adding words.
*  I would have bathed you in crystals.
*  I love watching videos of guys, of older guys.
*  Like Don Fry was one of my favorite guys
*  when I was young to watch him.
*  Pride and shit.
*  Yeah.
*  And then he's like just a true Arizona badass.
*  So you see him now as the old man
*  and you're like, you could still fuck shit up.
*  But recently retired, I was watching an interview
*  with Donald Cerrone, who I love.
*  He's one of my favorite fighters.
*  I love Donald.
*  I'm from Colorado and he's just like.
*  He's a great dude too.
*  He's just a fun guy.
*  He's like a badass.
*  All the story he told on here about cave diving
*  gave me legitimate anxiety listening to that.
*  I was too high and he was talking about being lost
*  and I was like, fuck.
*  Bro, that story was fucking insane.
*  He was like lost and could only get back
*  through pure darkness underwater.
*  He's like a true American badass.
*  And he was on this podcast talking about
*  how he got this idiot ran up on him
*  and he just head kicked him and it was fucking done.
*  And he was explaining the situation.
*  He was on a dock.
*  Yeah, they were at a lake.
*  And I was watching it when I was flying to Austin
*  and I was like, I found my genre of my favorite thing,
*  which are people fucking around with older badasses
*  and finding out.
*  But this wasn't even, he was older.
*  But I mean like. Active.
*  Cerrone's a bad, like an old.
*  Now don't run up on the guy.
*  Like I don't run up on him anytime in his life.
*  But this was like years ago.
*  Oh, this was when he was active in the UFC?
*  Yeah, he was active.
*  That's what a dumb thing.
*  These guys that think that they can,
*  you can beat a trained fighter.
*  They didn't know he was a trained fighter.
*  They're just douchebags.
*  Well guess what?
*  And they got head kicked.
*  Back to the wrong guy.
*  I mean imagine that's your opening move too.
*  So how much disdain do you have in this guy's ability
*  that you're just gonna head kick him?
*  How much athleticism?
*  Yeah.
*  I can barely clip my toenails now.
*  This guy's starting with a head kick.
*  He's like.
*  And he's like.
*  That's literally what he does for a living.
*  Yeah dude, he was a guy man like,
*  you grow up in Colorado and you go to like
*  the Western Stock Show or whatever.
*  And I was just like, I'm just like a pussy suburban kid.
*  But you see these like Eastern Colorado kids
*  or these kids that are from like the real front range
*  and you're like, oh you're a badass.
*  This is how the land got settled.
*  Yeah.
*  He has this one KO in the UFC, this one combination
*  where he lands on this dude where it's like the matrix.
*  He like, and he's just touched him.
*  He punches him up, punches him down,
*  face kicks him, follows up.
*  And the way he did it was.
*  I forget the fighter's name that he did it to.
*  We went to.
*  Rick's story.
*  We went to a UFC.
*  Is that it?
*  Yeah.
*  So watch this.
*  Hold on, let me do it from the beginning.
*  We'll get this combination.
*  Jab to the body, left hand, ducks down, head kick.
*  That's a full meal.
*  Are you outta your fuckin' mind?
*  That's a full meal.
*  Are you outta your fuckin' mind?
*  It's so cool.
*  It's so cool you could do that in real life.
*  I went to a UFC event at Barclays
*  because Steve Amy Oetich was on Billions.
*  And so. Oh nice.
*  And Steve is the man.
*  He's like the coolest fuckin' guy.
*  He's awesome.
*  And his manager was like,
*  oh I can get you tickets to the fight that's at Barclays.
*  Steve wasn't on it but Cerrone was.
*  And I'm a huge Cerrone guy.
*  And I went with Louis J Gomez.
*  And we sat there and I got so excited
*  when Donald Cerrone knocked the dude out
*  that Louis was like,
*  as a friend it bothers me how much you like this guy.
*  He's like stop it.
*  It's like a friend calling.
*  I was like, it's like you want him to be your dad.
*  And I'm like, no fuck that.
*  He's just like the coolest.
*  When you're like, that guy's so fuckin' cool.
*  Louis can't help himself.
*  I love it dude.
*  The first event we ever went to,
*  the first live UFC event I ever went to was
*  Jones Sonin in Jersey.
*  It was like, I don't think Jones had the title yet.
*  Or maybe he did, the light heavyweight.
*  But it was John Jones, Chael Sonin.
*  And we're in the crowd.
*  And I've been to boxing matches and you feel that.
*  John had the light heavyweight title back then.
*  Yeah.
*  And he was just shootin' on, I mean.
*  He beat the fuck out of Jones.
*  He broke his toe.
*  Yeah, he beat him up so bad he broke his own toe.
*  Yeah, shooting on him.
*  He just bounced off so hard off the ground
*  while he was smashing him.
*  You could see it in the video where it turns over.
*  It was like an overhead shot where they see
*  where it turns over.
*  Yeah.
*  He just beat the fuck out of him.
*  And here's the thing, he didn't even know it was broken
*  until he was talking to me.
*  Yeah, in the ring, you look down,
*  I remember that, because I was in the arena.
*  You look down and you're like, I think your toe's broken.
*  And he was like, he hopped over to you.
*  Bro, that's how much he wanted to fuck Chael Sonin up.
*  That's crazy.
*  He just wanted to fuck him up and teach him
*  that you do not belong in here with me.
*  I mean, dude, Bones Jones is just unbelievable.
*  He's a monster.
*  And the thing is, greatest light heavyweight of all time
*  without question.
*  There's no second place.
*  It's John Jones is number one for sure.
*  Those old Nike with the open slit on the side
*  so he could knee you.
*  Yeah, dude, that was wild.
*  So we were there.
*  Here's the thing, man, if he didn't get busted
*  all those times and all of the things that he did,
*  he would have Nike sponsorships.
*  He already had one.
*  He had one lined up.
*  He would be the Jordan of fighting.
*  Yeah.
*  He would just be like.
*  That's how talented that guy is.
*  Yeah, you're just like, no, this is the greatest
*  and you can't even argue it.
*  You can argue who comes close to him.
*  But we were at that fight and we're watching these guys
*  get chippy, these Jersey Italian guys
*  are just fucking yelling at this guy.
*  And it's like a dude, eight mile style,
*  like a white guy being like,
*  yo, what's up with the disrespect?
*  And Lewis just so casually goes,
*  it's gonna be a fight.
*  You should pull your phone out.
*  Those guys are gonna fight.
*  And I was like, no, they're not.
*  They're just John or whatever.
*  And then it just, they just start fighting in the crowd.
*  And I was like, damn Lewis, you really felt that.
*  He felt it in the senses.
*  He's like, it's about to go down.
*  Lewis has had some fights.
*  Yeah, dude, I love it.
*  He's got some crazy stories.
*  He's told on, when I've done podcasts with him
*  about like growing up, he had a fucking tough life.
*  That's why I always say people with Lewis,
*  I go, if you had that tough of a life,
*  there's no way you'd end up how good he's done.
*  All of us would have failed with all the hard shit.
*  Cause sometimes you talk to people
*  and you're impressed by what they've responded to.
*  And you're like, there's no way
*  I could have responded to that.
*  Like Vladimir Putin, he's an evil guy.
*  He's done evil shit.
*  But you read about his childhood,
*  that's why that lady's poem's so funny.
*  And you're like, this guy was literally thrown
*  in a ditch basically.
*  And then came up and is now the most powerful man
*  outside of the United States.
*  That's a fucking drive.
*  That's a response that I do not have.
*  You don't get that drive if you're the son of the king.
*  That's exactly it.
*  If you're like given everything,
*  you don't have that in you.
*  Where you're like, everyone left me.
*  He was like, I changed rules.
*  I run it again.
*  That was my favorite thing is he goes,
*  I am no longer president, prime minister.
*  Guess what?
*  Prime minister has more power than president.
*  After a while he goes, I'm just president again.
*  And you're like, dude, the guy is just changing shit
*  in a way that everyone around him is going like,
*  bad asses, Russian bad asses around him are going like,
*  hey, that's a good one.
*  I like that one.
*  You just have to be agreeable.
*  His yes, man, it's gotta be a terrifying thing.
*  Well, he's got it locked in.
*  As long as you play by the rules,
*  seems like he lets you live.
*  Who do you think, that's exactly it.
*  That's how it goes.
*  I might live.
*  Who do you think has the more ass kissers around them?
*  Putin or Kim Jong-un?
*  Kim Jong-un.
*  Yeah, that's like crazy.
*  I bet Putin, Putin's intelligent.
*  I bet Putin requires people
*  to have different perspectives.
*  Challenging.
*  So that he can take into consideration.
*  And I bet he's very strategic about what they do
*  and why they do it.
*  I think Kim Jong-un, like that's.
*  Well, he's a rich,
*  you wanna talk about a prince's, a king's son.
*  Exactly, exactly.
*  There's the comparison.
*  But the difference is like the people of Russia
*  are doing way better than the people of North Korea.
*  Well, people from North Korea,
*  they like find out about stuff on the outside.
*  Like when they get out and they're like,
*  what the fuck, dude?
*  I'd be so mad.
*  If you're North Korean and you get out
*  and you go like, the fuck?
*  That's a whole country like an Orca tank.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  They're just like, nah,
*  you don't even get info from the outside.
*  You get nothing.
*  And when dear leader dies,
*  you have to cry for like months.
*  Can you imagine?
*  They'll put people in jail
*  that didn't cry hard enough.
*  If I got arrested, my grandmother passed
*  and I loved her.
*  If they were doing that and I didn't get arrested,
*  I'd be like, dude, I was dealing with shit.
*  You know, like explaining.
*  I do it in my own way.
*  I go inward.
*  I go like, dang, think about it.
*  I cry when I'm alone.
*  I need to fuck alone.
*  I had to watch Iron Claw,
*  that wrestling movie last night in my hotel room
*  that jarred something loose.
*  So look, this is people that have to publicly cry.
*  All right, listen.
*  Can we also admit though,
*  when Kim Jong-il died, right?
*  Think of them.
*  It is hilarious that you're that powerful,
*  that you're like, cry harder motherfucker.
*  That everybody has to cry.
*  This is where communism leads kids.
*  All you fucking idiots out there
*  that think that just no one's ever done it right.
*  There's only one way to do it.
*  You have to ask.
*  Someone has to enforce the rules.
*  That person is always the military
*  and they have power over everything.
*  Jamie's pointing this guy out.
*  You think he's gone?
*  This guy in the middle goes like,
*  oh fuck, I didn't know a camera was there.
*  I didn't know a fucking camera was there.
*  That guy's probably tortured right now.
*  He's probably still being whipped.
*  Yeah, Kim Jong-un, didn't he have his uncle killed?
*  Kim Jong-un was just like when Il died.
*  Yeah, some people are trying to move in on the territory.
*  It's like, uh-uh, I'm the prince, bitch.
*  But also, so the difference between a self-made man
*  and a prince is that prince has that like, let them die.
*  Like they have that energy.
*  Would they go, my uncle has ran upon me.
*  Like Vladimir Putin would be like,
*  I am very disappointed that you would not think
*  that I would take care of you.
*  He'd be like, right.
*  You know, he's like, you are dead.
*  You are dead to me.
*  You're like that prince energy.
*  And now the sun and the stars have spoken
*  and you have died.
*  Dennis Rodman wants you to die.
*  Dennis Rodman, would you like to kill my uncle?
*  Thumbs up or down.
*  He's like, oh, hey, what's up, man?
*  When he's over there and he's hammered in that documentary,
*  he's like, oh man, you rule.
*  When he sings him Happy Birthday, wild.
*  Big Jay showed me that documentary
*  and he's like rubbing his hands together.
*  Imagine being friends with a dictator of a country
*  where the people are starving
*  and you're getting drunk with that guy
*  and playing basketball and just hanging out.
*  And then you, and then like, yeah.
*  And then you walk outside.
*  Oh, there it is.
*  What is he saying?
*  They're clapping off.
*  Dude, the NBA players that are there for the fat check.
*  Wow.
*  You know what though?
*  How many times have we,
*  how many times have we done gigs that have killed our soul?
*  That one's gotta feel weird.
*  Now do you have to lose?
*  Going like this?
*  Do you have to lose to the North Koreans?
*  It's just going like this, Joe.
*  Just standing there after you were a four time all star
*  in the NBA and you're like.
*  I don't know how they could lose.
*  Here's the question.
*  Do they have to lose?
*  I mean, are they allowed to really play?
*  Probably not.
*  Probably, probably.
*  It seems like there's no competition here.
*  This is, this is insane to watch.
*  I would say they give them as much pushback
*  as that guy in the judo class did against Putin.
*  That guy was good.
*  No, they're not playing defense.
*  That guy was good.
*  Shut up, Jamie, that guy was good.
*  No, hold on, go back.
*  That is a bunch of giant dudes letting a really short guy
*  shoot a ball from very far away.
*  You know what I mean?
*  There's no one within 15 feet of him.
*  It's like airbag defense.
*  Jamie, you're a hater.
*  No.
*  That guy's the best.
*  I'm a basketball player.
*  Jamie's like, no, I would key up on that guy
*  and make his life a living.
*  He'd be that much better.
*  He'd look like an all star in this game.
*  So they let guy, oh, they let the Koreans get close?
*  Is that what happened?
*  I would guess they would want this to be
*  like a Harlem Globetrotters game
*  where they want these players that they know
*  to just beat the shit out of their.
*  Yo, they let Rodman play with lip rings.
*  This can't be real.
*  Dude, that story when he left in the last dance
*  when they're talking about that bowls team.
*  That's a movie they're making, I think.
*  Are they?
*  I don't know who's in charge of it,
*  but I think they're making a movie
*  about this whole day or two.
*  Oh, in Poyn Yang?
*  No, no, Rodman going to Vegas.
*  Oh, it's, oh, dude.
*  I think Billy Corgan talked about it on this podcast.
*  Oh, that's nuts.
*  Yeah, it's.
*  I think he did too, now that you brought that up.
*  He just asked Phil Jackson.
*  He's like, I'm gonna go to Vegas.
*  Phil Jackson's like, please let it be two days.
*  And it was like four.
*  They were on a run in the season.
*  He's like, I'll go to Vegas and get fucked up.
*  I'm hanging out with Carmen Electra.
*  And Phil Jackson's like, God damn it, you're so good.
*  Being that good at something
*  where they bend the rules for you.
*  They go like, fuck dude, all right, just go ahead.
*  Just come back, please.
*  I might not.
*  Did he miss any games?
*  I think he did, right?
*  Did he miss games, Jamie?
*  Trying to remember that the movie right now
*  is in production.
*  It's called 48 Hours in Vegas, but it's been.
*  So that's what it was, he asked.
*  For three years.
*  But that's not what I think he took.
*  I think he took like four days.
*  It was during the finals.
*  The finals!
*  It was during the finals.
*  Oh my God, was it the same person?
*  They usually maybe have three days off,
*  but I think he took for two days.
*  They had to go get him, as I remember.
*  Michael Jordan, Phil Jackson, Scott Pippen,
*  all got on a plane and were like, you gotta come back.
*  We have a game tomorrow.
*  You're our leading rebounder.
*  Oh my God, that is so insane.
*  And he's just been partying for days.
*  Dude, it's like the Hangover meets a Space Jam.
*  We're showing up and you're like,
*  hey, we got the biggest game of our life
*  and you're here in Vegas?
*  Vegas.
*  Vegas.
*  Did you ever see where, God, what was it?
*  What?
*  Production's off a little bit, I guess.
*  Jonathan Majors, who's had some problems this year.
*  He was.
*  Oh, he was playing Rodman?
*  He was supposed to be Rodman, yeah.
*  Oh.
*  Did you ever see when he was on Celebrity Rehab?
*  Yeah, it was horrible.
*  It was hilarious.
*  Celebrity Rehab was like.
*  He got in shape.
*  All he did was run on the treadmill,
*  like drinking water. Oh, really?
*  He was like, he just partied a little too much.
*  I think Celebrity Rehab, the one I'm thinking of,
*  is the first season where you saw people melting down
*  in ways that you're like, what the fuck?
*  Oh, first of all, it's the worst thing you could ever do
*  to someone who's in the middle of recovery,
*  is to broadcast them and all their insecurities
*  to the world and have people shit on each other
*  and insult each other.
*  Like, what?
*  Dr. Drew hosted that show,
*  and it led to one of my favorite Stan Hope bits,
*  where he said, Dr. Drew is to science.
*  I forget what it was, but he was talking about,
*  he's like, that'd be like being an OBGYN
*  that only specializes in hairless,
*  stinkless Norwegian pussy.
*  Like the way that Stan Hope described it,
*  I was like, it's so funny.
*  I fucking love that.
*  Yeah, but Celebrity Rehab,
*  you just saw people be like,
*  oh, here's your favorite guy, and he's super broken.
*  Yeah.
*  He's fucking crazy broken.
*  And it gives you a window into the dark side of Hollywood.
*  Well, you see them be like, I don't keep that money.
*  That money doesn't keep coming in.
*  That's like the Jussie Smollett thing,
*  where you're like, you wonder how many of those people
*  that are on drugs hit that moment,
*  they're like, I have to do something crazy
*  to get back up there, I'll do Celebrity Rehab.
*  Right.
*  I'll be the victim.
*  What do you do if you're that guy?
*  That guy can't work.
*  He's gotta save three babies.
*  He's got a music career, apparently.
*  No, he doesn't.
*  No, he doesn't.
*  Does he, though?
*  What if it, fucking rules.
*  What if it's like, good?
*  Wow, that'd be a problem.
*  What if we heard music and it was like, damn.
*  It's always releasing last year as a single, but.
*  Let's hear it.
*  I mean, before he got in trouble,
*  he had a record career.
*  But did he, though?
*  Can we hear it and edit this out of the show?
*  We can, I can just let you guys.
*  Can we just play it for us?
*  Just play in house.
*  And what will the audience hear?
*  Nothing?
*  I'll cut it out.
*  Okay, cut it out.
*  Or you can overlap elevator music.
*  We'll be right back with our commentary, ladies and gentlemen.
*  B-Boy Blues.
*  It was a gay novel in 1994.
*  Going for that gay market.
*  Yeah, he's got it all.
*  This was also a year ago,
*  and I was like, that's the best I could find.
*  I would describe.
*  He had a bunch of charting songs in 2014, and then.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  He had songs on Empire that were making it big,
*  and then that's where I was looking to around 2018,
*  and they started not charting anymore,
*  and then 2019 is when.
*  Is when the thing happened.
*  Is that crazy?
*  You can follow it like that?
*  You can go like, oh, here he is,
*  and then now you're like, it's dipping.
*  Are we about to see something?
*  Are we about to see a little fuckin'.
*  I will say my review of the song
*  is it sounds like AI R&B.
*  It sounds like.
*  Yeah.
*  There's not one specific thing that I was like,
*  oh, that was really, he can sing.
*  For sure he can sing, but it just feels like AI.
*  A lot of shit feels like AI.
*  You know what flavor my coffee is?
*  Thanks.
*  What?
*  That's it?
*  Huh?
*  What?
*  Okay, cool, I know what you want to drink in the morning.
*  Thanks.
*  I don't know what's worse, that or the open letter
*  to Vladimir Putin.
*  That's the worst thing.
*  That's one of the worst things.
*  You're dealing with a man that's a murderer,
*  and you're writing him a poem about.
*  If I was your mom, I'd fix it.
*  First of all, how outrageous.
*  Great shit talking.
*  And is she even a mom?
*  No, we looked it up.
*  I think we looked it up on the bonfire.
*  Even funnier.
*  I don't think she's a waltz.
*  Makes it funnier.
*  It is probably the best piece of shit talking
*  we have against Vladimir Putin.
*  Because Biden or Trump, either one of them
*  talking shit about Putin.
*  They won't say nothing.
*  But this woman being like,
*  just a self-important actress being like,
*  I'm gonna tell you what I would have done.
*  Nothing can stop hot actress energy.
*  It was just like.
*  Yeah, it's an immovable object versus a sink.
*  Some mentally ill people are also hot.
*  It's just the Harvard Crimson.
*  They were just satire about it.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Oh, if I was your.
*  White woman single-handedly stops war in Ukraine.
*  If I was your mother.
*  Imagine.
*  Imagine.
*  Imagine.
*  I give me like best case scenario
*  when you put that on TikTok,
*  is this really does go viral.
*  It gets to Vladimir.
*  It gets to Vladimir.
*  And you see him crying in the Kremlin.
*  Someone slides it across his oversized desk.
*  And then she gets a phone call from Russia.
*  What's going on?
*  What is this?
*  I wish you were my mother.
*  Could you still be my mommy?
*  She goes, who is this?
*  And that's how he tricks her into moving to Russia.
*  And then he's got a new bride.
*  Yeah.
*  And now we have a.
*  She's married to me now.
*  And that's their meet-cute.
*  That does sound like a rom-com from the 90s
*  where it's like, she's an actress.
*  He's a bloodthirsty dictator.
*  What happens when a poem goes viral?
*  It's their sleepless in Seattle.
*  I didn't watch the, I watched small clips
*  of the Tucker interview with Putin.
*  Oh, it just looked.
*  What did you think?
*  It looked, I mean, did you see what Putin said about it?
*  What did he say?
*  He just like made fun of how softball of an interview it was.
*  Oh, did he really?
*  He like made fun of Tucker to the Russian press.
*  He went, I prepared.
*  I think the quote was something like,
*  I prepared to be challenged.
*  Oh, interesting.
*  I was prepared for them to come at me.
*  Yeah.
*  You're right.
*  Someone in his inner circle is smart
*  because he was clearly got his balls busted
*  for all the ranting he did.
*  Putin says he prefers Biden to Trump
*  and mocks Tucker Carlson questions.
*  Wow.
*  Which again, this could all be a psy-op
*  because he's a, you know, how he moves and shit.
*  He said Biden is more predictable.
*  The lack of sharp questions.
*  Yeah, it said it threw him off
*  because you could tell someone busted his balls
*  for how long he ranted on shit
*  when they were like, what are you talking about?
*  Interesting.
*  And it said, yeah, he was expecting them to.
*  But here's the other part of the quote
*  that people aren't using, scroll back up again.
*  He said, he goes, I think that he said between Biden
*  and Putin, Putin said without hesitation,
*  the current US president was more experienced,
*  predictable, an old school politician,
*  but added we will work with any US president
*  who the American people have confidence in.
*  Like, why is, besides preferring Trump,
*  he says he'll work with anybody.
*  Yeah, but that's what I mean.
*  He says this guy.
*  He doesn't say unreasonable things when it comes to that.
*  Well, he just says stuff that you go like,
*  he says stuff that's smart enough that you go like, oh.
*  Yeah. Okay.
*  Well, that's not a real, like Kim Jong-un is like,
*  the stars have told me that I'm the leader
*  and you're like, you're a fucking moron.
*  And Putin says stuff and you go,
*  I mean, it's not completely incorrect.
*  Well, he's very intelligent.
*  Yeah, the guy worked for the KGB.
*  It's like a CIA operative being our leader.
*  And they're like, hey, I know how these fucking things go.
*  Have you ever seen when he talks about
*  how many US presidents he's been through
*  and about how they all have these promises.
*  And then once they get into office, he goes,
*  men with coats like mine, sit down with them,
*  not with this color tie, you know?
*  And they tell them exactly what you're going to do.
*  Like, it's cool to see because he's telling the truth.
*  He knows what he said.
*  He's on the other side of it.
*  He's on the other side of it, but it's not a lie.
*  No.
*  Like, so it's-
*  And we all know that.
*  Yeah, they all, no one, like,
*  Obama, one of his things was to help whistleblowers.
*  It was like a part of the website to get him elected.
*  It's like protection for whistleblowers.
*  They were like the worst for whistleblowers.
*  But dude, I'm telling you, they all,
*  he knows that all presidents, left or right,
*  are just the same arms,
*  they have the arms of the same monster.
*  He knows how they work.
*  That's what he means by Biden's a predictable one.
*  He goes, I could fucking,
*  it's like knowing how to drive an old car.
*  Exactly.
*  Like, I could fucking have one of these.
*  Like, throw it in reverse.
*  They were saying that those Chinese weather balloons,
*  those flying over things, those big balloons,
*  that they were doing that when Trump was around,
*  but they didn't tell Trump.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Because Trump would like shoot him down.
*  That's hilarious.
*  But people like Biden shot him down.
*  Yeah.
*  Which is even crazier, that it was like good.
*  Yeah, but it's fine.
*  But if Trump shot him down, like,
*  he's fucking launching missiles into the sky.
*  Well, they threatened a world war.
*  That's always the threat either side pushes on the other,
*  where they go like, World War III is coming.
*  Did you ever see the dude who tells the story to the news
*  about the missile that, or the jet that crash landed?
*  Have you seen this?
*  No.
*  There was a jet or a pilot ejected from the jet.
*  Like some fucking super expensive fighter jet.
*  And it flew into the ground.
*  And this one dude was there when it happened.
*  This dude's like super country.
*  I love it.
*  Damn dude.
*  That is possibly, I love the beginning of the interview.
*  He goes, I've been on this earth about 72 years.
*  I just love a guy that states how old he is
*  in the beginning.
*  With a straw hat on.
*  Yeah, he goes, I ain't seen that shit.
*  In the country.
*  But I'm having to shave,
*  which is definitely code for a shit.
*  He was taking a dump in that plane crash.
*  Oh, taking a shave.
*  Oh, I said what in the world is this?
*  I love it.
*  I'm like, wow.
*  Oh yeah dude, that fucking rules.
*  What if it was a cover story for a crashed UFO?
*  That's what I mean.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean that's, I want his explanation on you.
*  If he goes, tiny little gray man, they seem mean.
*  I think they lost the jet though.
*  They knew the guy ejected from the jet.
*  And they lost the jet.
*  It was reported that the jet was lost
*  before this guy reported.
*  And they found out where it slammed.
*  It was lost like two or three days though.
*  Yeah, because I remember reading that news story
*  about a lost jet.
*  And you're like, how the fuck do you lose a jet?
*  He's also wearing a weighted vest.
*  Yeah, that guy's probably got low body fat under there.
*  Is that what that is?
*  That's probably shredded.
*  That's PRI.
*  He's working out.
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe he's like a dude who's just out there
*  works out all the time.
*  Yeah, he's taking off, he's just shredded.
*  Yeah, just old man ripped.
*  He's like an old Rambo.
*  Have you ever seen those old dudes that work out
*  in the park on those monkey bars and-
*  Yeah, dude, up in Harlem?
*  Yeah, and the gymnast bars,
*  the various different height parallel bars.
*  I did this.
*  These guys are insanely fit, dude.
*  There's this one old dude that does it on Instagram
*  that I follow.
*  Well, I've met back when I was getting out
*  of the waiting tables days, this was about 12, 13 years ago,
*  I did a series for Yahoo called Mansome,
*  which sounds so good.
*  But they would have me do different weird shit or whatever.
*  And I went up to Harlem and did an episode with these guys.
*  And they were showing me the shit they could do.
*  And it was unbelievable.
*  Like, oh, there it is.
*  Yeah, the bartenders.
*  What'd you do, bro?
*  Dude, I am full alcoholic at this point.
*  Very hungover.
*  Dude, this guy would do stuff.
*  He would do, and then I would try to do stuff
*  and I'm out of shape, so my arms are doing stabilizers.
*  They can do insane shit, do flag poles.
*  Yeah, he would lift himself all the way up
*  and then all the way back down with not even breathing him.
*  Just try doing the monkey bars back and forth
*  a couple of times and see how hard it is on your forearms
*  and your grip strength.
*  Especially at 40.
*  Like, look at this, they can just do stuff.
*  But that just shows you also,
*  their physiques come entirely from body weight.
*  And look at gymnasts.
*  They're some of the most fucking ripped people alive
*  and it's just all body weight.
*  Yeah, it's no weight lifting, it's just that, pull-ups.
*  How hard, look at that.
*  Yeah, like these guys do some crazy muscle ups, flips.
*  Parkour guys are crazy strong to have that kind of control.
*  Oh, for sure, for sure.
*  No, I could do that if I got up there.
*  I wouldn't do that.
*  I could flip around.
*  If you fall, you're fucked.
*  Especially at 40, I'd fucking take a fall and be like,
*  oh!
*  I think they have a rubber floor there, it looks like,
*  which is nice, it'll help you a little bit.
*  But it's still not good.
*  Being out of shape and trying to do that in front of them.
*  Those are just like little liability places.
*  Like, there's so much liability in there.
*  I would like to know the insurance on city playgrounds,
*  like the legalities of what they have to be like,
*  you're not suing us.
*  And is there some stuff that's grandfathered in,
*  like those domes, those iron domes.
*  Those thunder domes?
*  They're like monkey bar domes.
*  Those are the shit.
*  Like there's grips all around,
*  you'd be inside of them and shit.
*  In the fall?
*  Yeah.
*  Dude, I used to go to this place in Denver
*  when I was a kid called Big Fun,
*  and it was like a Discovery Zone kind of thing.
*  But they had these rubber straps.
*  It was called the spiderweb.
*  And it was these tight, thick, like that wide, that thick,
*  across, but like dozens of them all the way up.
*  And you would climb through, disaster.
*  When you fall, you're back,
*  and you like go through these like straps
*  slapping you in the back of the neck.
*  You would come back with like lacerations
*  on your arms and shit.
*  It was the most fun I've ever had.
*  And there's zero chance they would do that now.
*  Just rubber straps and be like, climb to the top.
*  Yeah.
*  And it was like a good 20 feet tall.
*  You know what they do have still too
*  that I'm kind of shocked they still have,
*  is those trampoline buildings.
*  Those are awesome.
*  When you go in them, and it's just trampolines everywhere,
*  and everyone's just bouncing from one trampoline
*  to the next one.
*  Yeah.
*  Fuck.
*  Dude, this guy, very funny comic Damien that opens,
*  he's open for me.
*  He used to do slam ball back in the day.
*  And he showed me.
*  I remember slam ball.
*  They just brought it back this summer.
*  Yeah, they brought it back,
*  but now they do it with contact.
*  Or I think you used to be able to do it with contact.
*  What a wild idea to have basketball with trampolines.
*  It sounds good on paper, but your knees are like,
*  dude, I can't do this.
*  Oh yeah, it's gotta be terrible for you.
*  Like you land wrong.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Like it almost, I wonder if it's almost easier
*  to land on a hard floor.
*  I bet you have to do everything totally different
*  because you have two different things going on.
*  You got trampoline jumping,
*  and then you have running on a court.
*  Yeah.
*  You're going back and forth to both of these things.
*  That's probably really hard to do.
*  Yeah, go from.
*  But is it actually better to see people fly
*  through the air like that and dunk?
*  They can do crazy, I mean.
*  Is it better?
*  I mean, you look for baseball for home runs,
*  of course this is what everybody wants to see.
*  They get to do crazy, crazy dunks.
*  Yeah, but you can't even dribble in the center.
*  Yeah, who cares?
*  You kind of have to though, right?
*  Like how much traveling happens?
*  Well, they take as many steps as NBA players do now,
*  that Euro three step.
*  What are you allowed?
*  It's like.
*  There's a lot of.
*  They call it a Euro step.
*  You're basically allowed what, three steps, I think?
*  It's, the NBA apparently,
*  there's like a two and a half step rule
*  is a gather step dribble that people can take.
*  Like you can pick up and go like one, two, and then run.
*  There's a few guys on Instagram
*  that break down these crazy plays and be like,
*  this is not a travel and here's why.
*  And they take five minutes in slow motion
*  to show you why it wasn't a travel.
*  I got here crazy early and I was on my phone in my car,
*  watching highlights of this dude on Twitter,
*  that they're starting to call him Cream Abdul-Jabbar.
*  He's a white guy from Indiana State.
*  This reporter, Matt Ross called him Cream Abdul-Jabbar.
*  And he's a white guy from Indiana State.
*  Let me see what his name is.
*  I think I have it still up on my phone.
*  Oh yeah, dude, he rules.
*  His name's Robbie Avila.
*  And he's like, when you see this guy, you're like,
*  oh, he's just a big fat white guy with glasses.
*  And then he just balls.
*  Really?
*  He just balls out and he's at Indiana State.
*  Yeah, I love it.
*  I love a goofy white guy.
*  There he is.
*  That's him?
*  Yeah.
*  This guy had 35 points last night.
*  He was just putting it up.
*  Yeah.
*  Really?
*  Let me see some highlights.
*  This guy can fucking go.
*  He plays like he's playing with kids.
*  Like that's how he kinda looks sometimes.
*  He's right there down on the key, right there, yeah.
*  Up and in.
*  And he just looks like, if he showed up at the playground,
*  you'd be like, he's probably not that good.
*  And then he just fucks shit up.
*  Those goggles are fresh too.
*  Yeah, dude, I love it.
*  He's got those old school Kurt Rambas glasses on.
*  I love a guy that has Horace Grant up top.
*  Those glasses probably help.
*  Oh yeah, it's like Ricky Vaughn in Major League.
*  You can finally see the strike zone.
*  I wonder if he was on.
*  You can really see everything.
*  Yeah, but look, he can dish.
*  Wow.
*  I love a goofy big white guy that's great at basketball.
*  That's why I love Jokic on the Nuggets so much.
*  He just looks like he should not be good.
*  And he's awesome.
*  Wow.
*  I don't think he's not trying.
*  Yeah, he moves slow in that way where you're like.
*  But he's precise.
*  But he's just like, fucking.
*  Larry Bird.
*  Yeah, Larry Bird you're like.
*  And also Larry Bird is, they say arguably,
*  the greatest shit talker of all time.
*  That he was like other tier level of shit talking.
*  He would apparently show up to like,
*  remember when they had those free throw competitions?
*  And he said, who's coming in second?
*  Oh yeah, he said that at the All-Star game
*  for the three point competition.
*  He goes, who's gonna be in second place?
*  There was one.
*  And I don't really know how true this story is,
*  but you know, Joe List is a huge Celtics fan,
*  huge Boston sports guy.
*  He told me a story that Larry Bird,
*  it was like the 86 season, and he was lined up on a guy.
*  And Larry Bird hit three shots in a row.
*  They call a timeout.
*  And he comes back on the court and he tells the guy,
*  he believes they're gonna give the ball to McHale?
*  I just scored six straight points on you
*  and they're giving the ball to McHale.
*  And the guy went, what?
*  And then the play happens and McHale scored
*  and Bird looked at him and was like, I told you.
*  Like, he's just so good.
*  He's like, yeah, I'm not getting the ball
*  and I'm mad about it.
*  This guy is.
*  He's like, you gotta be so good to be able to talk that.
*  LeBron tells the players on the other team
*  what they're doing wrong sometimes.
*  Really?
*  He's like, you're supposed to be over here.
*  That's wild.
*  You're fucking, hey, move.
*  Yeah.
*  He knows what everybody's doing.
*  He's got basketball knowledge at the level
*  so far above everybody else on the floor.
*  He's, most coaches also.
*  Wow.
*  What I love is in sports where someone calls something out
*  in the middle of a play.
*  There's two examples in the NFL that I know
*  where Peyton Manning gets mad at his tackle
*  for missing a block and he's running.
*  He's, when he's on the Colts and you can hear him go,
*  God damn it.
*  He like yells the guy's name in the middle of the play
*  and still has the play done.
*  But he like, in the middle of the play goes like,
*  you fucked up.
*  He like screams it out.
*  It's fucking hilarious.
*  You know one of the best versions of that?
*  Max Holloway was fighting Brian Ortega
*  and he told Brian Ortega you gotta block like this.
*  He puts his hand up to help him block.
*  In the middle of beating his ass,
*  he takes his hand and he goes, put your hand right here.
*  I mean dude, that, that, that moment.
*  You don't need to see this, watch.
*  Look, watch this.
*  Look, he puts his, see?
*  He's teaching him how to do it.
*  That's so funny.
*  He says look, look, protect me.
*  Look, see?
*  Watch this.
*  Look at this, man.
*  Bro, put your hand there.
*  And he did like the demonstration.
*  Like, I won't even do it to you.
*  And then he beats his ass more.
*  He's just such a nice guy.
*  Wild.
*  That was like when Khabib got Connor in the corner
*  and was talking to him.
*  Yeah.
*  Let's talk now.
*  Let's talk now.
*  Let's talk now.
*  You're like just getting elbows hammered on you
*  and you're like.
*  Fucking wild.
*  Wild.
*  It's a wild sport, man.
*  Yeah, those guys are bad asses.
*  That's why.
*  For real.
*  Because it's a different kind of human being.
*  Kind of human being that can do that successfully
*  for a living.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a big one coming up soon in Miami.
*  Big fucking card.
*  You excited?
*  Oh yeah, it's a big one.
*  There's one fight I'm really excited about.
*  Dustin Poirier versus Benoit Saint-Denis.
*  Okay.
*  Benoit Saint-Denis was a French special forces guy
*  who now fights in MMA and is murking people.
*  Like he's a straight up killer.
*  I mean he looked at that chest tattoo is fucking tough.
*  There was one of the fights that I called
*  and I'm interviewing him afterwards
*  and he starts talking about,
*  I like America, you helped us out during World War II.
*  Thank you very much for bringing us back.
*  He's talking about America in terms of like military,
*  like that we've always been kind of aligned.
*  Yeah.
*  And I'm like, that's how he's thinking.
*  Yeah.
*  He's a problem.
*  He is a killer.
*  He got into MMA to be better as a soldier.
*  I think he already had a judo background
*  but the MMA thing is fairly recent.
*  It's only been like six years I believe or so.
*  He's 13, I saw his record.
*  He's 13 and one.
*  He's called the God of War?
*  Yeah.
*  That's bad ass.
*  As a fan of God of War, that's bad ass.
*  I think the fight he lost was at a different weight class too.
*  I think he fights at 155 and I'm pretty sure,
*  should check on that.
*  I'm pretty sure his fight that he lost was at 170
*  but he's very good, man.
*  He's very good and he's calculated
*  and he doesn't have any weaknesses.
*  He's very good on the ground.
*  He's very good standing up.
*  He's just good everywhere.
*  If he wins that fight, does that elevate him
*  to a shot at the title?
*  Boy, it's a big jump.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a big jump in competition.
*  And this guy goes from beating guys who are pretty good,
*  good fighters, solid fighters,
*  to the top of the heap, Dustin Poirier.
*  Yeah.
*  A guy who's been interim champion.
*  It's a different level.
*  And for Dustin to accept that fight is a big risk
*  and Dustin must've got paid a lot of money to do that
*  because that's a...
*  His favorite guy, Saint Denis' favorite.
*  That's crazy.
*  Saint Denis' favorite over Dustin Poirier.
*  Dustin Poirier who has fought fucking everybody.
*  Yeah.
*  Everybody.
*  The guy beats Connor twice
*  and he's still the underdog against Saint Denis.
*  That's insane.
*  That's how scary that dude is.
*  I like that Michael Page is fighting in the UFC.
*  Kevin Hall and Michael Page is fun.
*  I know Michael Page from the, he's fun, dude.
*  That's a real fight.
*  Yeah.
*  Because Kevin Holland is fucking dangerous.
*  Yeah.
*  He's fucking dangerous and he's got a lot
*  of MMA experience, a lot.
*  And he's very good on the ground
*  and he's got ridiculous one punch power.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's also a welterweight fight
*  where Kevin I think is at his most dangerous.
*  At 170, Kevin is so fucking dangerous.
*  He would do like spinning back elbows and shit.
*  Like I know Michael Page from watching like his highlights.
*  If you go to Michael Page,
*  Michael Venom Page before he was ever an MMA fighter
*  was a high level karate point fighter.
*  And I was always wondering like when are those guys
*  going to make their way into MMA?
*  Because we had this one guy, Raymond Daniels,
*  who was also an opponent of Michael Venom Page
*  in a karate thing.
*  But there's a video you can watch of that,
*  of them competing in a karate tournament.
*  What's the-
*  Those guys at that, those high level karate guys
*  can move in and out very fast.
*  Is that what their, is that what their like superpower
*  you would say is, is dangerous like-
*  It's a blitz.
*  They're just crazy in and out and can nail you with shit.
*  They can cover distance much faster than everybody else
*  because their game is all about touching you once.
*  So it's just, it's like you're playing a game
*  of karate tag.
*  Yeah.
*  It's probably safest.
*  Karate tag is the funniest name to call it though.
*  It kind of is like that.
*  Like to make it sound safer.
*  You go, you want to play karate tag?
*  You just get kicked in the fucking head.
*  But you don't, most of the times guys
*  don't even get knocked out.
*  They just get touched.
*  You know, it's a lot of like this, like this kind of thing.
*  And then when someone does touch, make contact,
*  they separate and they call a point.
*  Now it's based on the very ludicrous notion
*  that one strike could kill someone.
*  Okay.
*  And so you wouldn't want to be hitting
*  anybody more than once.
*  Yeah, you could do one hitter, quitter shit.
*  Yeah, so this is like based, you know,
*  they started these tournaments based on that idea
*  a long ass time ago and they keep doing them that way.
*  But the skill that you get from that
*  is the ability to close the distance and hit someone.
*  Look at that crazy jumping wheel kick you did.
*  Yeah.
*  A 720 degree wheel kick.
*  Look at this.
*  I mean, that's crazy.
*  If you're in a street fight, right?
*  And you see a guy take a karate stance.
*  Yeah.
*  There is a chance he's gonna hit you with one of those.
*  Most likely.
*  That's a one hitter where you take that shot.
*  But if you're a wrestler, you go,
*  oh, this is gonna be great.
*  This is gonna be great.
*  You're gonna kick me.
*  Okay, I'm gonna time this.
*  And then I'll just.
*  Yeah, I'm gonna tackle you on the concrete fuck face.
*  That's why that Dagestanian wrestling thing.
*  Wrestling is the number one foundation of all martial arts.
*  I think if you don't know how to wrestle, you can't fight.
*  You have to know how to wrestle.
*  Even the high level kick boxers, like, you okay, bro?
*  What happened?
*  I'm still coming over with allergies from my school.
*  You son of a bitch.
*  You guys COVID.
*  It's COVID, it's the new COVID.
*  Give it to me.
*  Even guys like Alex Paheda,
*  who's one of the most devastating strikers
*  to ever fight in the sport.
*  He had to learn how to wrestle
*  before he could fight in MMA.
*  You can't just go in there and not know how to get up.
*  You can't go in there and not know how to defend yourself.
*  It's just too dangerous.
*  I remember the old school
*  when they did James Tony with Randy Couture.
*  Oh yeah.
*  And you're like, and Randy Couture's like,
*  well, I'm not gonna stand with you.
*  And Randy Couture's like, you can't wrestle at all.
*  Randy ankle picked him.
*  Which is like embarrassing.
*  He just dropped down and grabbed his ankle
*  like, sit your ass down.
*  Yeah, dude, he didn't even let him have a shot.
*  That was fun to watch.
*  Randy was actually nice to him.
*  He could have tortured him.
*  He could have like proven a point
*  and just stayed on him and punched him in the face
*  as long as he wanted to.
*  But that's why I liked Khabib.
*  Cause Khabib just did that to the top guys
*  that could wrestle.
*  Guys that could wrestle were like,
*  it was like watching someone fight a shark
*  and get brought into the water.
*  And you were like, he's just got you.
*  Yeah, I mean, that's what Poirier said about him.
*  I just couldn't believe he was doing that to him.
*  Can you imagine that?
*  Just so good.
*  You're just so good.
*  The guys at the top level were like,
*  I can't even fuck with this guy.
*  Getting mauled by this dude.
*  And he's talking to you.
*  And Poirier tried for a guillotine at one point in time
*  and almost had it.
*  Remember that?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  It was pretty tight.
*  Poirier has a nasty guillotine.
*  Was that fight in London?
*  Or it was, I think I remember watching.
*  Why do I remember watching it in the afternoon?
*  I do not know.
*  But I remember watching that and you're like,
*  oh, he's got no, he doesn't.
*  Oh, it was Justin Gaeth.
*  Was that the last fight?
*  Gagey.
*  Gagey was the last fight for.
*  With Gagey, did he catch Khabib in a something?
*  I think he tried something and then all of a sudden.
*  He tried a triangle or a guillotine?
*  Was it Gagey?
*  Am I remembering it wrong?
*  I thought it was Dustin Poirier almost had a guillotine.
*  You probably know more than I do.
*  I just remember.
*  I get them confused though too.
*  Being high at helium in Philadelphia during the day
*  and they're like, we'll put the fight on here.
*  And I was like, that'd be awesome.
*  Walk over from the hotel.
*  The story was that he actually likes Gagey.
*  Poirier.
*  It was Poirier.
*  It was Poirier.
*  So here it is.
*  He gets him in a guillotine.
*  This is pretty fucking tight, dude.
*  It's pretty fucking tight.
*  And it would have been much better
*  if he had that right knee engaged.
*  See how it was, Khabib just steps over that right knee.
*  He just alleviated a lot of pressure there.
*  But there's still a tremendous amount of pressure
*  on his neck.
*  But the key thing here is Dustin tried to scramble
*  and re-engage, but he never got that right knee in play.
*  Khabib kept that right knee from being in play every time.
*  See how he pushed it down and get sideways?
*  That alleviates the pressure from the hips.
*  So now the hips aren't squeezing down
*  on your lower back anymore,
*  which accentuates the pressure on the hip.
*  And now he's out.
*  Now he's out.
*  It was the whole key to that.
*  If he was in full guard there.
*  Look at how scary it is.
*  Then all of a sudden he's on his back
*  and he's just like, shit, shit.
*  Well that's the problem with pulling guard for a guillotine.
*  Right here, right?
*  And then he just switches over, goes over,
*  and now he's just gone as a back.
*  Also, Dustin needs to take a break here.
*  He just exerted an insane amount of energy
*  trying to close the deal.
*  So when you're trying to close the deal on a guillotine,
*  your whole body is involved.
*  And you're arcing into it.
*  And he didn't have the leg, man.
*  And then he just, he didn't have that leg.
*  If he had that right leg over,
*  and that's why Khabib, that was his number one priority,
*  he wasn't even defending the choke.
*  If you notice, the number one priority
*  is moving over that right leg.
*  Yeah, got over him.
*  Because as soon as someone has a guillotine
*  like Dustin does, and they have two legs,
*  and you're really trapped, it might be night-night.
*  Yeah.
*  It might be night-night.
*  Because they're pulling down on your lower back,
*  and then they're up on your neck
*  and twisting it to the side.
*  I'd be trying to talk.
*  And you can't even get hands involved.
*  You're just fucks, Bill.
*  Please let me alone.
*  That was what I was saying last night
*  where you get choked and it changes your voice
*  and you go like, Khabib, fuckers.
*  That's just how fucking good Khabib was.
*  He's so good.
*  It's almost a tragedy that he never wants to fight again.
*  Because he doesn't, right?
*  It was like the promise he made his dad.
*  It's beautiful.
*  He's made his mother.
*  He's gonna have one more fight,
*  and that was gonna be it, and it's beautiful.
*  That's a great way to go out.
*  And now he's just a badass coach.
*  Yep, and he'll be one of the greatest coaches of all time.
*  And he'll go out as, without a doubt,
*  one of the greatest to ever do it.
*  One of the greatest to ever do it.
*  Pound for pound.
*  If not the best ever, he's definitely in the argument.
*  The argument is Mighty Mouse,
*  who's always had a special place in my heart
*  for when he was in his prime.
*  When he was in his prime, Mighty Mouse
*  was a motherfucker to watch.
*  He would do shit that no one could do.
*  He would do shit where he would throw a guy into the air,
*  suplex him, and then catch an armbar
*  in the middle of him being in the air.
*  I just saw that clip.
*  And finish it on the ground.
*  I just saw the flying armbar.
*  There's not a champion alive that can do that
*  the way Mighty Mouse did.
*  You toss the guy in the air,
*  and then on his way down,
*  throw him in an armbar when they both hit the mat.
*  Bro, when he fought Henry Cejudo the first time,
*  it was a master class.
*  It was a master class.
*  When he put Henry away.
*  Yeah, when you're...
*  This is his last fight.
*  That was the fight with the fly.
*  That's a great fight too, though.
*  Show that, show that KO,
*  because it's a flying knee.
*  And this is a guy who had knocked him out
*  in the previous fight with a knee.
*  So check this out.
*  Look at this combination.
*  Look at that fucking timing, dude.
*  Dude, the head.
*  And walk away.
*  Oh my gosh. Walk away.
*  Look at that timing, man.
*  Oh my God.
*  When you're watching this cage side,
*  and you see a guy like Mighty Mouse do some wild shit.
*  Yeah.
*  Are you just like, as a fan of the sport,
*  you're calling it, but you're just like,
*  does it take your brain a little bit to process?
*  Like what the fuck did I just watch?
*  It's so magical.
*  It's like, I know how hard it is to move that way.
*  So when I see a dude who can move the way he does,
*  I'm like, that is so fucking beautiful.
*  So for someone who does martial arts.
*  Flying arm bar.
*  So this is against Ray Borg.
*  So in the middle of the suplex, he catches the arm.
*  Before the dude hits the ground.
*  Oh, that's what it is.
*  Before the dude hits the ground, he caught the arm.
*  And then he swings over and get,
*  now he's having fun here.
*  He's having fun.
*  For him to do this, he's like, I'm gonna show off.
*  And if you know Demetrius, he's a fun dude.
*  He plays a lot of video games.
*  That's awesome. Streams and stuff.
*  He's a really sweetheart of a guy.
*  You would never imagine he'd be that good.
*  He had a German suplex.
*  Into a fucking, he had a WWE move.
*  Into a fucking WWE.
*  In the air.
*  And this was a fight that he was just
*  lighting this dude on fire.
*  Like he was just lighting this dude on fire.
*  I maintain that he is the finest expression
*  of martial arts I've ever seen.
*  Cause it's creative.
*  It's just, he didn't have the kind of competition
*  and the men aren't as big.
*  But if he was welterweight, he would be no question
*  the greatest of all time.
*  No question.
*  He was so good, dude.
*  You gotta look at them when they're in this window of time.
*  And sometimes it's just a few years
*  where they're accomplishing things in a way
*  that is so extraordinary.
*  You go, I've never seen anybody better.
*  And that's how I feel about Mighty Mouse
*  when he was in his prime.
*  And then the other one that's like that is Anderson Silva.
*  Anderson Silva when he was in his prime.
*  All the defenses, the title defenses, that run.
*  It was the way he was doing it too, man.
*  He was operating at a different speed than them.
*  He was processing things with a 2024 computer
*  and they were using some Windows 95.
*  The way he would dodge punches all the time.
*  And then I also loved, he was part of the reason
*  I wrote that joke about translators in the ring afterwards
*  because his voice was so soft and he was like,
*  what's your language?
*  Just in Portuguese and they'd be like,
*  Anderson says he'll kill all comers in any way.
*  And you're like, but his voice is so sweet.
*  His voice was like, what's your voice?
*  When he beat Rich Franklin to win the title.
*  Yeah, Ace, or is it Ace Rich?
*  Or Rich Ace Franklin, because he looked like Ace Ventura?
*  A little bit.
*  I love that.
*  God, those were my mushroom days
*  where I'd just take a ton of mushrooms and watch UFC.
*  I was fucking drunk.
*  That's a crazy thing to watch on mushrooms.
*  Oh dude, it was, dude, I got robbed
*  when I lived in Tucson because I lived with a weed dealer.
*  And I got fucking hogtied, like going on 45 on the head,
*  like cleaned out.
*  I did the whole story on Ari's,
*  there was the season Ari got fired,
*  but this is not happening.
*  But I lived with a weed guy and we got set up
*  and I was just a roommate.
*  How hard did they hit you on the head?
*  Not hard, I had to pretend that it was harder
*  because the guy was like smaller than me.
*  So I had to pretend that he really fucked my shit up
*  when really he just kind of dinked me.
*  And then he was, I mean, he was a pro.
*  Like he had an army duffel bag, zip ties.
*  Had like a real gun.
*  Like I had a cheap one.
*  Was it one guy?
*  It was two guys, got both me and my roommate
*  and they knew we were college kids.
*  Both guys had guns?
*  Oh yeah, hammers dude, 45s I think.
*  Both of them had 45 caliber.
*  Like he was tapping it on my head being like,
*  you're gonna fucking die white boy,
*  where's the fucking money?
*  And you're like, I don't fucking know.
*  And then, so I got robbed
*  and then I got out of it or whatever.
*  I was fine.
*  I wasn't physically hurt.
*  They took my car, which had six loads of laundry in it.
*  So I lost all my clothes.
*  That sucked.
*  Wearing a bathing suit as underwear for three days
*  because I was so broke.
*  I couldn't afford anything.
*  I lost my CD booklet.
*  Did you ever get the car back?
*  Yeah, cleaned out.
*  Where was it?
*  In the desert.
*  That's what happens in Tucson.
*  It's all happened in Tucson.
*  And they called me and they're like, we got your car.
*  And I was like, is my CD?
*  I was at a bar and Tucson police called me
*  and they go, we found your car.
*  And I go, was the CD booklet in it?
*  And the guy goes, no.
*  It's like, you're lucky we found your fucking car.
*  That's the thing we used to carry CD books in our car.
*  I had a zip one.
*  I had a zipper one with multiple pages.
*  Dude, I had pages of bands.
*  I had a whole sound garden page.
*  I had a whole Nirvana page with bleach.
*  All the way to fucking, dude.
*  And you'd keep the CD thing for inside
*  so it looked professional.
*  Dude, I had a banger of a CD booklet that got taken.
*  But then that night.
*  It's kids today.
*  Yeah, they're just like, not digital.
*  I won't own my media.
*  But I went to my buddy Sumner's house
*  and I took probably three and a half, close to four grams.
*  And I was drunk before I took it.
*  Oh boy.
*  And Mark was sober and he let me in
*  and we watched the first season of The Ultimate Fighter.
*  Oh wow.
*  And we had it on like.
*  Did you get robbed while you were watching it?
*  No, this was at night.
*  But it was hyping me up.
*  Or I was like, maybe I would have pulled.
*  I was on Mushroom.
*  So I was like, maybe I wouldn't have pulled shit.
*  But I was like, oh.
*  And then we watched that till like five in the morning
*  but I was just tripping, being like.
*  And I was like watching UFC on Mushroom's Rules.
*  And I thought it was just a cool.
*  So I did it a couple more times.
*  And I was thinking the last time I did it
*  was like Lesnar Shane Carwin.
*  Oh wow.
*  Cause I was like, oh he's from Colorado.
*  I always loved Colorado fighters.
*  That was the closest Shane had come.
*  I mean he really came close to beating that guy.
*  Yeah, we watched.
*  The top of him was pounding him.
*  Oh I wasn't on Mushroom's.
*  I was drunk at Hooters with Lewis.
*  Oh that's funny.
*  I was drunk at a midtown Hooters with Lewis
*  cause I was yelling out Aurora
*  and then fucking Shane Carwin lost.
*  And I was like, ah!
*  Cause he gassed out.
*  He gassed out, that was it.
*  He emptied the tank trying to finish Brock.
*  Cause he wobbled him.
*  Well he was on top of him.
*  Raining bombs down on him.
*  A lot of referees would have stopped that fight.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, watch it.
*  Watch it, let's watch it.
*  Let's watch the end of the first round
*  of Brock Lesnar and Shane Carwin.
*  God I forgot where we were at.
*  Shane was a terrifying puncher.
*  Terrifying.
*  He was the only guy in the UFC
*  that they had to have gloves bigger than Brock Lesnar's.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, they had like four XL gloves.
*  Cause I remember when Brock came to the UFC.
*  They were like.
*  They have to make his gloves bigger.
*  Shane's are bigger.
*  Really?
*  Bro, Shane's hands were like.
*  They were a bad ass.
*  They were like canned hands.
*  Look at these guys.
*  Shane was so dangerous man.
*  Like people forgot about him, like in his prime.
*  He could put anybody to sleep with like a six inch punch.
*  He was so fucking dangerous.
*  And he was a really good wrestler too.
*  Yeah.
*  And a Colorado guy so I loved him.
*  He's a fucking beast dude.
*  Was he in the Greg Jackson gym with all them?
*  I believe.
*  Well I know he's out of Colorado.
*  Yeah.
*  I think he trained with Jackson.
*  Yeah, but this is at the point where he's already gassed.
*  Yeah, this is at the point where he's gassed.
*  And this is the second round.
*  This is when Brock wins.
*  Can you go back to like the first round?
*  You said last round.
*  No, I'm at the end of the first round.
*  Oh yeah.
*  So this is it.
*  So go a little bit before that so you can see how this takes place.
*  Because like he stuns him on the feet.
*  So they're standing up there.
*  God, listen to that.
*  And there was the uppercut.
*  Look at that uppercut.
*  That uppercut was nasty.
*  Josh and Carlin pummeling away.
*  Lesnar desperately wants the takedown.
*  He stuffed the takedown.
*  Shane was so dangerous.
*  So dangerous.
*  I thought it was over right there.
*  Look at this.
*  It could have been over right here with a lot of referees, man.
*  A lot of referees.
*  And then not here.
*  There has to be a feeling where you have Brock Lesnar and then you don't and you go like
*  fuck.
*  Like look at this.
*  Look how close this is.
*  So he's getting fucking pummeled, dude.
*  This goes on for a while.
*  The thing is Shane right now is emptying the tank because he thinks he's got the close.
*  He's at the end.
*  That's what he thinks.
*  This goes on for a while, dude.
*  It keeps going on.
*  Look at this.
*  Big shots.
*  Like right there, stop the fight.
*  Right there you can stop the fight.
*  But Brock is still pushing him off but he's not really effectively defending himself.
*  Like many referees would have been like I've seen enough.
*  Like right here the blood spraying.
*  Many referees.
*  Damn.
*  But no.
*  I don't remember this fight that well.
*  I just remember that Shane gassed.
*  Yep.
*  Oh my god, dude.
*  The feeling of having someone almost knocked out and they don't call it.
*  But it gets worse.
*  Look.
*  It gets worse.
*  So now he gets, I think he fully mounts him at one point in time.
*  Like look at this.
*  Look at this.
*  This is big, dude.
*  These are big fucking shots.
*  That's a big elbow.
*  But he's tired.
*  You can see him breathing heavy.
*  But now he's just looking for one big shot.
*  I mean dude, the way he has him, I've never seen.
*  He's beating the fuck out of Brock here.
*  But now those aren't effective.
*  But the referee could stop the fight, man.
*  This is fucking close.
*  This is one of those things where the guy's getting beat up so bad, you could make an
*  argument for stopping it.
*  Look at all the blood.
*  But Brock is fighting back.
*  Shane gets on top of him again.
*  Brock can't get up, right?
*  He's getting mauled here.
*  No, but Brock's saving energy doing this, right?
*  Like he's not.
*  Well, I mean, he clearly had the better gas tank because he made it out of this.
*  And then the second round he was fresh and Shane was done.
*  Yeah.
*  Like Shane right now is done.
*  Yeah.
*  He's done.
*  He's so tired.
*  I don't understand how he has nothing in his arms.
*  He just exerted everything.
*  He emptied the tank.
*  Have you ever seen a fight where a guy does that and then wins by using his legs or something?
*  Most of the time when guys empty the tank that bad, they can't recover.
*  So it's just they're done on everything.
*  And so look, Brock is scrambling at the end of the round and he's getting back up.
*  And now he's up.
*  Now he's up.
*  Damn, dude.
*  If someone stands up like that, especially a Brock Lesnar against you, you go like fuck.
*  And Shane is kind of breaking here.
*  He's really tired.
*  Like you get him breathing.
*  He's just trying to figure out a way to recover and Brock's not going to let him recover because
*  if he's defending constantly, then he's still breathing heavily and then he's not going
*  to be able to get his wind back.
*  Because this isn't just like, it seems like no one's doing anything, but he's got to fight
*  Brock off him with that overhook.
*  He's got to do something to like keep him.
*  Right now he's not doing shit.
*  Right now he's just hanging on.
*  And Brock is catching his breath too.
*  So Shane doesn't even have his hands clasped here.
*  He's literally not.
*  He's not digging that overhook.
*  He's really needed a break here.
*  And Brock knows this too.
*  So Brock recognizes that he's exhausted.
*  So Brock knows probably also that this is the end of the round and he's going to make
*  it out of this.
*  And so then when he comes into the second round, he knows this dude's toast.
*  Because there's a level that you get to where you're so exhausted, like you're not going
*  to be okay in a minute.
*  So here's the second round.
*  Do you think when he sits down or when he comes back out right here, he's like, oh fuck.
*  Yep.
*  Oh, you can see him breathing.
*  He's already exhausted and Brock looks way better.
*  And Brock is going to just set it up, look for the moment.
*  But he kind of knows that Shane's toast right here.
*  And then he eventually shoots.
*  Jesus man.
*  That's something where you just want to be like, let me go home.
*  I'm just fucking zapped.
*  So he's moving away from the shots now.
*  Look, they're like telling him to like get the fuck over there.
*  This is good for both of them too.
*  It gives him a chance to recover.
*  So he swung in there, tried to land a big bomb.
*  Do you think it's similar in any way, like being at a job where you feel out of your
*  depth where you're just like, fuck, I'm done.
*  I thought this was it.
*  You know what I mean?
*  There's the shot.
*  So he gets on top of them and eventually arm triangles.
*  Yeah, so he's just out.
*  Here it is.
*  He gets them in the arm triangle.
*  I mean, this is heavy pressure, head and arm choke, heavy pressure.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Oh fuck.
*  He's got to push with his elbow.
*  See how his hand is right there?
*  Yeah.
*  What he really needs to do is what's called answering the phone.
*  You put your hand in between Brock's head and your ear so he tapped.
*  He was done.
*  The defense, and it's not the best defense, but it's the only thing you have is to get
*  your hand like this.
*  Hello.
*  Yeah.
*  Hello.
*  Hello.
*  Because if they just have this like completely locked up, you're fucked.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  You got to get a little bit of space.
*  Our future president, Brock Lesnar.
*  Isn't that an idiocracy?
*  Yeah, it is.
*  It's a former WWF champion.
*  Yeah, that would absolutely be, we would hate idiocracy.
*  I just watched Idiocracy about a year ago and it fucking holds up.
*  Mike Judge is just amazing.
*  By the way, Office Space still holds up.
*  It all holds up.
*  One of the greatest movies of all time.
*  Beavis and Butthead, still funny.
*  Amazing.
*  King of the Hill, everything the guy does.
*  He's unbelievable.
*  Beavis and Butthead, when I first moved to California in 94 was this shit.
*  Yeah.
*  It was the funniest thing on television.
*  It was great.
*  Music videos.
*  Remember when he became Cornholeo and he had too much sugar?
*  The great Cornholeo on your teepee for my bumhole?
*  Dude, I was in middle school and it was like everybody was doing Beavis and Butthead impressions.
*  It was like, hey, you just hear the weird kid in the back be like, that rules.
*  And you're like, Jesus Christ.
*  It made being a degenerate dirt bag fun.
*  Yeah.
*  Beavis and Butthead.
*  These guys ruled.
*  The movie was great.
*  Beavis and Butthead do America.
*  Let me see what he does.
*  So he gets too much syrup.
*  He's just drinking all the soda.
*  Yeah.
*  I am Cornholeo.
*  I need teepee for my bumhole.
*  Guy Rolfe.
*  I love that.
*  I remember going to see the movie like pumped, like waiting, like getting friends together
*  and being like Friday, Friday, Friday night.
*  We're going to go see Beavis and Butthead do America.
*  I haven't seen new ones.
*  Aren't there new ones?
*  Yeah, they're doing new ones.
*  Are they good?
*  Did you like them?
*  Because they watch TikTok stuff now.
*  Now they don't watch music videos.
*  They watch like what we would watch and make fun of social media like that poem.
*  They would like to watch that.
*  It was great.
*  Perfect.
*  Yeah.
*  What's it on?
*  Paramount Plus.
*  OK.
*  It's like buried on one of those streaming services.
*  Go watch it.
*  Because that's like where South Park is.
*  You got a bunch of stuff there.
*  Yeah.
*  Paramount Plus has some good shit on it.
*  It's just annoying that you have to subscribe.
*  Wow.
*  Old Beavis and Butthead.
*  They're old now.
*  I mean, I think some of them.
*  Yeah, they just did.
*  Oh, they.
*  The show I really want to watch is Ronin on FX.
*  You mean Shogun?
*  Shogun.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  Shogun looks amazing.
*  They put the two.
*  I think there's two episodes out right now.
*  I'm going to watch it tonight after shows.
*  What streaming service is that?
*  It's on Hulu.
*  It's on Hulu.
*  Yeah, it looks sick.
*  I remember the original.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah, the original was amazing.
*  I didn't know there was.
*  I didn't know this was a remake.
*  Yeah.
*  The original show Shogun.
*  Way back in the day.
*  Very excited for this.
*  I mean, yeah, it was Shogun.
*  This looks awesome.
*  It's based on a novel.
*  Oh, it is?
*  Yeah.
*  OK.
*  I love.
*  FX does random shit sometimes and you're like, this is awesome.
*  They do some great shit.
*  Yeah.
*  They do some great shit.
*  They're kind of like what HBO used to be.
*  They did the shield.
*  Yeah.
*  That was a great show.
*  The shield was very good.
*  Michael Chiklis or whatever.
*  Yeah.
*  So Shogun American Historical Drama Limited Series created by Rachel Kondo and Justin
*  Marks based on the 1975 novel of the same name by James Clavel.
*  The novel is previously adapted into a 1980 limited series.
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  1980.
*  Yeah.
*  Click on the 1980 series.
*  Who was in that?
*  Oh, shit.
*  So this was.
*  Who's the guy?
*  Can you find it?
*  Chamberlain.
*  That's right.
*  That's right.
*  Can you find it?
*  This is like when they were letting white dudes play Japanese guys.
*  No, he was a white guy.
*  He was supposed to be a white guy living with the Shoguns.
*  Oh, like kind of like the last samurai.
*  Exactly.
*  OK.
*  Basically like the Tom Cruise movie.
*  Yeah.
*  They just stole that idea.
*  It's like Shogun is a real version of it.
*  That's totally lifted.
*  Yeah.
*  Like the one white guy fucking kicks ass as a samurai.
*  Good luck, bitch.
*  And we're watching that.
*  We're going.
*  Yeah.
*  They were raised to sword fight.
*  You shut your fucking mouth.
*  You're going to lose an arm instantly.
*  You're going to lose an arm.
*  And then the rest of your life, you're going to lose.
*  And you have no honor.
*  Yeah.
*  Because you were a dickhead and they cut your arm off.
*  Dude, that would be a fucking.
*  And they decided not to kill you and just leave you with no arm.
*  But dude, then they shut off contact with the outside world.
*  And then the Shogun fell and shit.
*  And everyone was like, yeah, our militaries are advanced by like 100 years now.
*  And Japan was like, fuck.
*  Forgot about bullets.
*  We got to catch up.
*  Well, they didn't want to use bullets, too, right?
*  It wasn't an honorable way to kill you.
*  Yeah.
*  It wasn't Bushido.
*  Yeah.
*  They're one of the only successful cultures that fought off the Mongols.
*  I mean, you're talking about my favorite video game of all time, Ghost of Tsushima.
*  Yeah.
*  Game's unbelievable.
*  It's a video game about the samurais and the Mongols?
*  Yeah.
*  It's about the invasion of Tsushima Island by the Mongols.
*  And you, dude, you learn four different sword styles and you change your sword styles to
*  play.
*  Dude, this game, I played this game, I want to say three or four times completely.
*  Look at the graphics.
*  It's unbelievable.
*  And it's open world.
*  So you ride around and then you'll duel Mongols.
*  There's also no difficulty level, right?
*  It's supposed to be pretty hard.
*  You can change the difficulty.
*  Yeah, you can change the difficulty level.
*  That's awesome.
*  You go around, you get armor, you learn how to duel, but you start off after they lose
*  the invasion.
*  So this is the actual game or this is the game?
*  This is the cut scene.
*  But then that's the real game.
*  That's what it looks like when you're riding through.
*  It's unbelievable.
*  Holy fuck, dude, this is amazing.
*  Jin Sakai.
*  So you could stumble upon a camp?
*  That's what it is.
*  And then you fucking sneak attack.
*  Oh my god.
*  Right there, they have this what you do.
*  So you can do multiple assassinations.
*  Dude, it's...
*  This is insane.
*  Anyone I've ever told to play this game comes back and they're like, that's fucking unbelievable.
*  This is insane.
*  Ghost of Tsushima rules.
*  Oh my god.
*  And they said they're due for a sequel because this came out a couple of years ago.
*  Flaming arrows.
*  It's unbelievable.
*  You do so much shit that you're like, this is the coolest thing.
*  And then you have one-on-one sword fights with Ronins and shit.
*  Like your best friend is a Ronin that betrays you and you have to fight him in an awesome
*  sword, like big sword duels.
*  It's awesome.
*  And your uncle is kind of like runs it, you know, and you have to either you choose if
*  you go with him or against him.
*  It's fucking rules.
*  Dude, it's easily my top three in my top three video games.
*  These games are so next level.
*  Well, they're movies that you play now.
*  Yeah.
*  And they're more compelling than movies because you're a player in it.
*  Like Last of Us, Tanaka was just like, it's not as good as the game.
*  Like you play Last of Us, you're in that shit.
*  Or like God of War, they'll never make it into a movie, but you play it as a game and
*  you're like, this is so fucking fun.
*  You just get into shit.
*  Spider-Man 2, the video game, is better than...
*  Dude, you're a real video game junkie.
*  I'm a nerd, Joe.
*  Yeah, you're a junkie for it.
*  I'm a junkie.
*  Fuck it.
*  Right in the face.
*  I mean, Ragnarok, it's unbelievable.
*  Spider-Man 2 is better than any Spider-Man...
*  The video game is better than any Spider-Man movie they've made.
*  Wow.
*  As a comic book fan, it's better than anything they've made.
*  Look at this.
*  Yeah, dude.
*  Balder versus Kratos.
*  It's fucking insane.
*  It's not as fun as doing Gay of War.
*  God, the fucking...
*  He's like, I want to suck, boy.
*  Boy, I'm going to suck you.
*  Is that what they do?
*  No, I just make fun of that.
*  Shane and I used to do this thing.
*  This is actual gameplay?
*  That's a cutscene.
*  Incredibly disappointing.
*  Yeah, that's where you fight them.
*  Better look out.
*  Reds you can't defend.
*  Does he have magic?
*  Yeah, it's all about this shit.
*  You basically fight against Odin and everyone of all the Norse gods, and they find out that
*  you're a former Greek god.
*  Oh.
*  It's awesome.
*  It fucking rules.
*  Red Dead Redemption 2 came out.
*  Shane and I were going on the road together.
*  I was taking Shane on the road.
*  He would joke that I'm such a nice guy.
*  He's like, what's your demons?
*  What do you do?
*  It'd be funny if I jerked off homeless guys, and that's what came out about me.
*  So Shane and I would do a running bit where we'd do a homeless guy being like, hey, watch
*  out, buddy.
*  You're about to make me cum.
*  And it's just me being like, shut up.
*  I'm going to fucking jack you off.
*  He's like, oh, hey, man.
*  What are you doing?
*  Shane and I would do that for weeks.
*  And then I was out of the country, and Red Dead Redemption 2 came out.
*  And I just got this voicemail from Shane that was so excited.
*  He's like, dude, have you played Red Dead Redemption 2 yet?
*  I'm like, no, I'm not home yet.
*  And he goes, Arthur Morgan is our homeless jerk-off voice.
*  Oh my god.
*  And so the main character of the voice is a guy going like, well, hey there.
*  And we're like, dude, that is our homeless jerk-off voice.
*  Oh, jack you off.
*  Hey, mister.
*  I brought some food and whiskey for you, fellas.
*  That game rules.
*  There's another game where you can do wild shit to people, too.
*  Wild shit.
*  By the way, it's a game you can play four or five times and not find all the stuff.
*  Like, they put that much work into it, where they're like, no, this is layered.
*  You can go on treasure hunts and shit that you would never find unless you win after.
*  You don't ever wonder if you're killing too much time doing those things?
*  All the time, dude.
*  All the time.
*  Does it give you anxiety?
*  Yeah, but I also level it by like, all right, if I'm going to spend 30 minutes writing jokes,
*  then I could play like video games for two hours.
*  Because I'm high, what else am I going to fucking do?
*  Well, that's good if you give yourself a reward.
*  I'm like, quit drinking.
*  My video game went up.
*  Makes sense.
*  Fills the time.
*  Because honestly, like one in the morning, I'll hang out at the cellar until like one.
*  And then I'm like, time to go.
*  I kind of want to go home and play video games.
*  I want to go smoke a fat bowl and play fucking Ghost of Tsushima.
*  So that's the new Grand Theft Auto.
*  Think about the pleasure that that kind of technology gives people.
*  People, their lives suck, but their video game lives are awesome.
*  I get it.
*  And it's the joy you get is real.
*  Yeah, you have to deal with post-video game, post-nut syndrome.
*  You're absolutely like wiping off your belly and you're like, I was a Greek god fighting.
*  Breaking life is bullshit.
*  I fought Thor.
*  But it is, they do incredible shit.
*  And that's why it's like it's moving away from movies and shit.
*  We were like, yeah, Spider-Man movies are really cool.
*  But when you're actually Spider-Man and you're flying around New York City and then you got
*  to go fight fucking Venom, you're like, this is unbelievable.
*  It's unbelievable.
*  And then they're going to get those things to be virtual.
*  It's drugs.
*  Yeah, it's heavy drugs.
*  Heavy, heavy, heavy.
*  And you better believe when I get to my hotel in San Antonio.
*  Dan Soto, you're the man.
*  Thanks for being here.
*  Appreciate you.
*  You're always fun.
*  I'm excited to work mothership this weekend.
*  I'm excited you're going to be there too.
*  That's I'm fucking pumped.
*  And then tell everybody social, all that stuff.
*  Got a new special out on YouTube called On the Road.
*  It comes out March 1st, which is I think today, but at Dan Soto on everything.
*  Subscribe to my YouTube channel.
*  I got a podcast called Soto just having comics come and sit on my couch and bullshit for
*  an hour.
*  Yeah, man.
*  And I'm on the road.
*  I'm on the road.
*  So dansooto.com.
*  Beautiful.

*  Appreciate you.
*  Bye, everybody.
