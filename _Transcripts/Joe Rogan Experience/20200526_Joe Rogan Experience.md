# Joe Rogan Experience #1481 - Adam Eget
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 26, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvHqvYesr9M)
*  Adam motherfucking EGOT
*  How are you brother? Good to see you my friend. Good to see you. Thanks for having me on. Please.
*  I'm excited to see you. Dude I haven't seen anybody.
*  I know it's like you're a long lost friend. It feels that way. Yeah.
*  But it also feels like you're literally like the only person I've seen.
*  Oh you haven't left the house? Not much. I go out on daily walks. Oh no.
*  That's not good for the mental health. Not good at all.
*  How are you feeling? You alright? Yeah I'm okay. I'm watching a lot of Korean baseball.
*  Why Korean baseball? Cause it's the only live sport available.
*  Oh they're playing in Korea already. Oh it's wild. There's stands, you know stadiums are empty
*  but they have like cardboard cutouts. Oh no they don't.
*  Cheerleaders with masks. Really? And like DJs. It's hilarious. Oh wow.
*  But it's great. It's fun. That's so weird. Yeah. So they use cardboard cutouts in the audience?
*  Yeah. Just in like the front where the cameras are behind home plate.
*  Oh that's too strange. Oh it's hilarious. I think I saw that in a movie once.
*  There was a baseball movie and you could clearly see that there was cutouts.
*  Cause have you ever seen what happens when they take old movies and then they
*  port them over to like Blu-ray? No. Oh. One of the best
*  example is Aliens. The second. That's my favorite
*  action movie of all time. It's a great fucking movie. It's a great fucking movie. I don't think it's as good
*  a horror movie as the original one. No. It's not a horror movie. Cause the first one's a horror movie.
*  Yeah. It's James Cameron. It's just fucking guns blazing. It doesn't stop.
*  Never stops. It's the most adrenaline fueled movie I've ever seen from beginning
*  and it just keeps progressively getting more intense and more intense. And you know what's
*  great about those movies? The hero is a woman and no one
*  gives a fuck. Cause they're so good. There's no
*  like oh yeah it's a diverse movie. Exactly. It's amazing for women.
*  It's not Captain Marvel. No. No. It's just Sigourney Weaver
*  being a fucking badass fighting the most evil monster
*  movies have ever created. Yup. Fuck yeah.
*  That's the best. Yeah. I love that kind of
*  like gender equality. When it's just equal because it's
*  awesome and nobody even brings it up. Exactly. Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2.
*  Yes. Perfect example. Are you fucking kidding me? You don't need to bring it up. She's doing
*  you know. You see her fucking back. Just intense.
*  I'm gonna fucking kill you. It's amazing.
*  Yeah. Amazing. That's what I like. Like you watch Ozark?
*  No. I tried. I watched the first four episodes and then I didn't.
*  Okay. So get back into Ozark. The two scariest bitches
*  are women. The two scariest ladies in the show. Okay. The two scariest people
*  in the show are two women. Not Laura Linney. No. Okay. But she's fucking
*  great too. She's great in everything. She's kinda scary too. Oh is she? She's kinda scary too.
*  The decisions they're willing to make. That's funny. Here's Linda Hamilton doing chin ups.
*  Fucking rough. This is pretty cross fit bitches. There was no cross fit
*  back then. She was a goddamn pioneer. She's like I'm not gonna
*  fucking die. In the first one I had a huge crush
*  on her and in the second one she terrified me. She was so fucking awesome. She's fierce.
*  Well she became more fierce right? She adapted to the world of the
*  Terminators. Which doesn't seem that far off from where we're at right now.
*  We're like closing in on Terminator time. Oh definitely. Dude there's a fucking
*  article I was reading today about a bionic eye that will be available
*  in five years that will be superior to a biological eye.
*  That's insane. Insane. Within five years. And I was
*  gonna send it to Michael Bisping. Yeah that's like how do they even make
*  Black Mirror anymore? We're already surpassed. That's what
*  the Black Mirror guy said. He's like I'm not even doing the season. I can't do it. The world's too
*  absurd. But my friend Michael Bisping he's a former UFC middleweight
*  champion. You think he's from like Manchester or something? Yes exactly. His one eye is
*  super fucked up. He's had several detached retinas
*  to the point where it's basically blind. He barely can see anything out of one eye.
*  From fighting? He's a beast. Bionic eye could offer
*  perfect sight. Night vision within five years. Motherfucker.
*  That's crazy. This is how they're gonna get us man. Between Elon Musk
*  and these eyeball people you're gonna be half human. Half human
*  in five years. This is five years. Because five fucking years from now they're gonna
*  have a human eye that you could like if you lose your eye
*  like Dan Crenshaw he's gonna be the first president with a
*  bionic eye. He's gonna have a bionic eye. He's gonna have a fucking artificial
*  super eye. That's insane. Wait what happened with the cardboard cutouts? You said that
*  when they transferred a blue ray. Yeah that's marijuana talking for you.
*  We went from Korean baseball to bionic
*  eye in like two minutes. So this is the cutouts. They're showing us the cutouts
*  in Korean baseball. Oh wait in soccer they got in trouble because they use
*  the sex dolls. Oh that's not good.
*  First of all if this is in America everybody would be triggered
*  because it's all white lettering on red like no
*  MAGA! They're MAGA in. They have robot drummers.
*  It's wild. It's like the XFL but baseball in Korea.
*  Seems very strange. It's hilarious. So anyway I watched Aliens
*  on blu ray. Okay. And it's so terrible.
*  Why? Not the movie itself. But there's one scene where the
*  spaceship is in the foreground and in the background
*  is supposed to be like you know some space type shit. Sure. It looks so
*  bad because it was just a painting. Right it's a matte painting. Yeah and because
*  the way they were focusing you barely could see it so it was fine
*  in the film when he was watching it in low def on his monitors he was like perfect. Looks great.
*  But in high def it looks so fake. That makes so much sense. They created
*  and based on the technology available at the time. Yeah you
*  shouldn't watch those movies enhanced. They should just keep them at the original
*  resolution. It's really kind of stupid to do that because
*  there's stuff they made decisions man back when special effects weren't the same
*  thing. They made decisions. Exactly. And they were good decisions. Yeah it's hard to watch
*  some of those in high def. You're like ruining the movie. Yeah it takes you out of the whole thing. Yeah it does.
*  There's something about also like there's something about when they colorize
*  Don with the Wind. Oh yeah. Stuff like hey. What are you doing? You're not supposed to do that.
*  I know. You don't have to. Yeah it's ridiculous. Like colorize Schindler's list.
*  It's like what are you doing? Yeah it's like you forgot what color a dress is.
*  You forgot what a red dress looks like. Bitch I know what a dress looks like.
*  This is a time capsule. Right that movie is a time capsule. Exactly.
*  Twilight Zone. Twilight Zone is my favorite television
*  show of all time. I've seen every episode at least five times. I would agree
*  with you and specifically because the fact that it came
*  first but I put Black Mirror in that leak.
*  Black Mirror was so good. It's so good. Do you have a favorite Black Mirror
*  episode? Yes. The one that you and I watched when we were getting NAD'd
*  the museum. Oh that was a fucking
*  God damn. Terrifying. God damn that was good. So good.
*  That and Crocodile. Crocodile was very underrated. Very underrated.
*  Terrifying. Because you could see like a good person making these
*  choices and these choices accelerate to the point where. She's great. Whoo. Yeah.
*  That's such a good show. Yeah that was a great one. I loved the
*  Star Trek one. I know it was very popular but that one was so well done.
*  Very good. Very creepy man. Very possible. Right? Like all of it.
*  Look at the Trump one. There's so many. They had the. It was a
*  bad episode but it was. It came true. Basically. I didn't see the Trump one.
*  It was like Waldo. It was like this puppet. It was like this
*  cartoon. It was like this mascot who became president. And he was just
*  saying all this outlandish shit. I haven't seen them all. I haven't seen them.
*  He hardly. The problem is he said outlandish
*  shit over the course of X amount of years. And if you like dissect
*  it it's like he's just spouting it out all day long. The way they do it is they
*  take you out of context and then they change what you are. Right?
*  Because if you're a guy like Trump who does say ridiculous shit sometimes. Particularly before he was
*  ever president. Oh yeah. But a lot of people do. You know it's called
*  talking shit. Yeah. And it's what a lot of people do. Right? But you can't do that if you ever plan on being president.
*  But if you just take all of those talking shit moments and condense
*  them together and go this is him. You're like oh my god. This is a monster.
*  But nobody's like that all day. And people vacillate.
*  They vary. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There is someone. You know sometimes the
*  internet really does some great work. And yesterday I saw
*  somebody splice together that great sound bite of him suggesting that they
*  inject humans with Clorox.
*  Yeah. Lysol. Maybe. I'm not a scientist but maybe we do that. And then there's this great
*  clip with Jim Downey and Billy Madison. I don't know if you remember that movie real well.
*  Yes. I saw that really recently. So funny. So he's talking all this shit about
*  maybe we can inject it into people. I'm not a scientist but I don't know.
*  Maybe something there. And then it cuts to Jim Downey and he's like
*  nowhere in your incoherent ramblings have you said anything
*  that makes any sort of sense. Everyone in this room is now
*  infinitely dumber for having listened to it. I award you no
*  points. And may god have mercy on your soul.
*  It was well done. Beautiful videos that people will post up as a
*  response to things. And it's just like you can't say shit when someone says that.
*  They had a great one with Hannah Gadsby cut with like audience.
*  I guess I shouldn't talk about that. Oh I know what you're talking about.
*  The Apollo. Night at the Apollo. Yeah whoops. That one, that is crazy.
*  Yeah. That video is hilarious. The internet is undefeated.
*  Yeah man I miss the Comedy Store too. For people who don't know, who's this Adam guy?
*  You are the man who got me to come back to the Comedy Store. You came to the improv.
*  I mean I appreciate that. It's true. You came to the improv. It was my number one goal.
*  Two things had happened. The first one was you coming to the improv and talking
*  to me and explaining to me things are different and all the
*  people. We know each other for a long time. But we knew each other from Tempe.
*  Yeah and then the second thing that got me to do it was Ari.
*  When Ari was having his special there. Dude that was the hardest I ever
*  worked to get them to green light that special. It was so important to me because
*  we love, we love Ari to death. Ari is to me, I mean
*  I've known Ari since he was a doorman at the Comedy Store.
*  We became friends when he was a doorman. He was just starting out.
*  And to see him go from being a doorman to
*  filming his special at the Comedy Store. I was like I have to be there.
*  Even if I have to swallow my pride, I have to be there.
*  So he was filming on a Wednesday. So I went on Tuesday just so it wouldn't shock my system.
*  And I could just appreciate his filming. Nice. So I came down
*  Tuesday and it was Roast Battle. And I was like holy shit. And Jeff Ross
*  gave me this crazy introduction at Roast Battle. And you know that
*  was the first time I was at the Comedy Store in seven years. And you know.
*  And then I was seeing how creative everybody was. Like the Roast Battle
*  thing was so, so different. Because it's obviously like
*  jokes that these guys had to write about each other.
*  So it's like it forces you into writing jokes. It takes away the one thing
*  that fucks most comedians is that they don't write. So when you're
*  forced into a battle. Like you're going to have to do battle next Tuesday with this girl.
*  And this girl's vicious. Like you've got to come up with some mean shit to say about her.
*  And it's going to be really funny. And she's writing some mean shit about you. Yeah you already know that she's going to have some shit to do.
*  It's not my style. I don't do comedy like that. It's a different muscle.
*  Yeah it's a different, it's just a different, I'm too mean in real life.
*  Like I don't want to turn that on for comedy. I don't like that part of me.
*  I like to keep that part locked away. So when people get real mean and nasty
*  with each other I'm like Jesus. Like it makes me uncomfortable but
*  I can't laugh at the same time. But it's just not, I don't have that thing in me. I'm not interested in that.
*  But that style is, even though it's brutal
*  and it's everyone agrees. Like everyone knows what they're doing to each other.
*  And then I love how Brian has everybody hug it out. It's great. It's amazing.
*  He's the perfect host for it too. You know he's
*  so friendly. He's just so likeable. He's charismatic.
*  He is the perfect host for that. Yeah and it's just like the whole
*  thing. When I was there I was like man this is just so different.
*  It's a wildly different club when the old talent
*  coordinator left. It was like, it was just a complete
*  180. Everything just started. You were the catalyst for the truly great
*  years that we were able to experience before this epidemic
*  or pandemic. But it was
*  you could see everything starting to shift a little
*  bit with roast battle. And then when Tommy left
*  it was like the floodgates opened and we were able to get rid of some of the old blood
*  and some of the people that were weighing the lineups down. But
*  you coming back was everything. I mean that was so baffling
*  to me when I first came to the Comedy Store about 10 years ago.
*  Because I remember hearing about the Mencia beef and everything and then I'm like where, what
*  happened? And when I heard about what happened I was like
*  how is this allowed? How did this happen? So I knew when I took over
*  I was like I don't care what I have to do. And you made the decision
*  all on your own. All I did was say hey give it a shot. Come down at least
*  just for a visit and thank God Ferrari is special. It seemed like a different world back then.
*  It was just a different world. And then after the old guard
*  was kicked out it was like an exorcism. The moment I came back
*  to the place I was like this is a different place. It's not even the old Comedy Store.
*  Because in the 70 years it had kind of gone through a new rebirth.
*  I think that place goes through cycles. When I came there in the 90s it was dog shit.
*  It was terrible. Tell me about it. Oh my God it was terrible.
*  It was terrible. Except for when the greats would show up.
*  Like every now and then Martin Lawrence would show up. Every now and then Damon
*  Waynes would show up. In their prime. Yeah in their prime. Murderers.
*  Dude I've never bombed harder in my life than following Marlon.
*  Or excuse me following Martin or following Damon.
*  Following either one of them. Or Marlon. Shit.
*  Or Tommy Davidson back then. Oh he was great. Oh my God dude.
*  Dude Tommy Davidson used to murder. Everybody murdered. But there was only
*  like a few. And they wouldn't come that often. So it was like when
*  Martin would come the main room would be flooded with people.
*  Just pawling out into the hallways. People forgot how big
*  Martin Lawrence was. In those days this was the leather jumpsuit days.
*  Sure. The you so crazy days. Bro he was on top of the world. Yeah he was king of the world.
*  For sure. He was on top of the world. People forgot. They forgot how hard he
*  murdered too. He was so good. The hardest decision I ever had to make
*  was one day Martin Lawrence and Chris Rock showed up at the same exact time and they
*  both wanted to go up. And I had to decide who was going to go on.
*  That was a tough one. How long ago was this?
*  This was about a year ago. Yeah. A year and a half ago.
*  That's a hard one. Yeah. But they should work that out.
*  Yeah right. That shouldn't be on you. That's too hard for you. Yeah that was a tough one.
*  I would go ahead man. I'll go after you. I want you to do. Exactly. Yeah.
*  I don't want any beef. And with those two guys they're both legends.
*  They're both legends. When I used to follow Martin Lawrence man
*  I developed this ability to
*  accept the fact that I was going to eat shit and
*  not be so scared because I had gotten beaten down a bunch of times by those crowds.
*  And that was the brilliance of Mitzi. Mitzi. She knew
*  that it was a tough spot. She just put me on
*  after Martin Lawrence every time dude. If she was on the line up.
*  It'd be like Martin Lawrence. He'd do 45 minutes and then it'd be Joe Rogan. I'm like death.
*  You ever seen that video online where there's these Nigerian guys or these African
*  guys rather and it's at a funeral and when the music starts playing they go
*  to these guys and then there's a guy getting knocked out. And then when
*  the guy gets knocked out like you go back to the guys dancing with the coffin
*  it's a funny meme in MMA circles. You know what I'm talking about?
*  I just saw it. I think Donald Trump's account posted it.
*  With the clip of Biden saying that stuff to Charlamagne. Oh no.
*  Does the Biden account going into the coffin. Please please see if you can find that.
*  Who posted it? Donald Trump himself? I think it was on his
*  Donald Trump Snapchat. So whoever's controlling that.
*  So that's you in the coffin every time you had to do a set after Martin. I would eat shit.
*  I would eat shit. And everybody would leave. I love that about Mitzi. That she would do that.
*  And if you ever once said anything about having to do it she would
*  put you on 10 times more right after the same spot. Oh she put you on at one in the morning.
*  She'd be like oh you don't want that spot? Oh okay I'll put you on at one in the morning you fuck.
*  And she would yell at you too. And people that have beef she would always put you one after the other.
*  Or people that were dating and break up. Yep.
*  I love that about her. Fucking love that. What a legend.
*  That's how you treat it as a real gym. Cause like that's where you would get that real workout in.
*  Is the emotional pangs. But it's also like as a comic
*  you gotta learn how to come out of the gate. When people don't know who you are and you have a lot to prove
*  and you're going on after someone who is a legend. So it's like you
*  have to develop that ability to follow those folks cause
*  in a normal club you would get a chance. You'd go on stage and it would be easy.
*  No one killed before you. You just easy. You stroll out there. How's everybody doing?
*  Good looking crowd. Let me tell you something about my day. And you can kinda go into it.
*  Like you know ease into it. But after Martin Lawrence crushes bro you gotta come with
*  some strong shit. Right out of the gate. There's only like 25
*  people gonna stay no matter what. Exactly. No matter what you do. I always watch
*  masses of people just lift off their chairs and leave the room.
*  Just no one stayed. Yeah and I'll bet 50% of your set is just
*  resetting the room. I mean how do you even. Good god the first 5 minutes is
*  You learn how to eat shit. This is Donald Trump. This is actually Donald Trump's
*  Snapchat. And he put this. This is. These guys right here
*  and it comes with this fucking music. There's so many
*  knockouts. Here it is.
*  This is for Mayor Trump and you ain't black.
*  And it's them carrying a coffin. This is Biden for president on the
*  coffin. The president tweeted that. Yes
*  of course he did. Look dude he knows how to use the internet man.
*  His son knows how to use the internet. Donald Trump Jr. They use him for all the wild
*  shit. When they need to post something really wild they go to
*  Don Jr.'s Instagram. That's fucking great. Listen man.
*  Everybody's playing dirty. Everybody's playing dirty. Yeah. The world's playing dirty. Different worlds.
*  They're all pretending you're someone who's not. Lying about this. No one's going to be honest.
*  It's just about creating impressions and memes and getting these
*  short attention span motherfuckers to hold on to a narrative
*  as hard as possible. Russia. Russia game. Russia. Whatever it is.
*  Ask people they're upset. They don't even know what happened.
*  That's 90% of the people out there man. We live in the
*  And now it's going to be even weirder because everybody's going to be so stressed out because the economy's in the shit.
*  Yeah. And it's not going to get out of there any quick anytime soon.
*  It's going to take some time. And what's going to happen. I mean this is like is this going to be class
*  war because the people that can afford to stay home.
*  They want everyone to go out and get the economy going.
*  Like they're super rich. They don't give a fuck about people dying. They can stay in
*  their mansions. There's that aspect of it. There's also the those are the ones
*  that I don't think are looking at it correctly in terms of like the actual
*  danger of the virus. But then there's other people that are like hey I don't want to lose
*  my business. Why don't you restart the economy so I can take a chance. I'd rather take a fucking
*  chance. I'm losing everything. I'm 99.99999999% sure I'm going to fucking survive this.
*  Right. You know and I'm going to I'm going to know it's coming. I'm going to
*  take a lot of vitamins like let me do what I have to do. And
*  let's let's quarantine the people that are in danger. Let's quarantine old people. Let's keep them
*  away until it goes away. Yeah that's reason. Quarantine sick people. And
*  this is what we need to do. This is what needs to be done. Not lock the whole fucking country
*  down. And once they do that man they don't want to undo that. I don't know when
*  reason left the world but in so many different aspects of the world. Is that what it
*  was Twitter. I mean with there's just no reason almost anywhere.
*  Well I think the reason is to save lives. It's just not it doesn't make sense.
*  Doesn't work right. Because you're losing lives. You need balance with everything. Dude there's an article that
*  I can't find out if this is true. There's an article that I was reading in the Washington
*  Examiner. One of those is a weird newspaper.
*  And it's like it's it's one of those ones like what is
*  what kind of is this a bias. Like what what is the bias of the Washington Examiner.
*  But it's basically saying that there's more people dead from suicide in
*  Northern California than there were from coronavirus deaths.
*  During the like during the lockdown. Because people are fully
*  in despair. They're losing everything. They're going bankrupt and they don't see any way out of it.
*  Well if it wasn't for Korean baseball I would be fucking
*  blowing my fucking head off. I've watched so many movies. Yeah what
*  I mean. I've watched everything. Just everything. Everything.
*  Not really everything. I still haven't seen the new Adam Sandler movie. The Diamond movie.
*  Oh yeah. Oh that was my favorite. That and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood were my two
*  favorites that year. I have you know two young girls and I can't really watch
*  fucked up movies with them. Sure. I got yelled at for watching Alien with one of them.
*  Which the first or second? The first one. I could well
*  yeah maybe. Maybe the first with John Hurt. I was like come on.
*  I'd watch it. My mother had me watch those movies when I was really little.
*  She watched scary movies with me. The first scary movie I ever saw was
*  The Shining. So it is a true statistic. Bay Area doctors seeing more suicides during
*  coronavirus stay at home order. It's that one hospital though.
*  So they reported it and said it's the whole area. See that good for you Jamie.
*  That's real news. That's real news folks. That's how you're supposed to do it.
*  You're not supposed to lie and read the statistic all fucked up.
*  Sometimes people do things like that and you're like oh you can't do that.
*  I just saw I feel like maybe it was something you said.
*  Ah fuck I can't remember. There's no weed in this? No.
*  Zero. This is just 25 milligrams of CBD and some delicious kill cliff mango goodness.
*  Well then I'm just fucked hearted. It happens bro.
*  When do you think we'll be able to start up shows again?
*  I'm really hoping in July. I feel like I know but realistically I think July.
*  What would you think about opening up a comedy store in Austin Texas?
*  I mean that would do really well. I think it would. I think it really would.
*  The conversations I've been having on the phone lately. I did reconnaissance this weekend.
*  I flew to Texas. Oh shit. Do you know Charlie?
*  Do you know Charlie? The guy who runs South by Southwest Comedy Division?
*  He'd be a good guy to talk to probably.
*  Well I just talk to comedians. That's great.
*  I don't need to talk to anybody but the comics.
*  I just feel like there's a lot of people in Austin. There's a million people.
*  They have two good comedy clubs right now. Cap City is a great room.
*  And then they have the Velveeta room which I've never done but I hear really good things about.
*  And I don't know if they have anything else. I think that's it.
*  I've been to South by Southwest a couple different times for comedy week and it's just been insane.
*  It's a great town. I just think there's a real problem with first of all the volume of humans here is unmanageable.
*  And there's a real problem with the government telling us what to do here.
*  There's things that don't make sense. And here's the best example.
*  They recently decided to open it back up for movies. For movies and television production.
*  But not for churches. What?
*  Like wait a minute. What are you saying?
*  Like you can't be in a church. How about give a church 25% capacity just like you would other businesses.
*  And that's what we're talking about. Some reason. Balance.
*  Have more than one service in the day. Like you don't have to just.
*  It doesn't make sense if some things can do their job and you call them essential businesses and some can't.
*  If you're saying that film production is okay.
*  But here's a weird one. You can't have alcoholics anonymous meetings but liquor stores are essential businesses.
*  That's insane. It's so fucked up.
*  That's fucking crazy. It's so fucked up.
*  Adam Curry told me that. And when I read it I was like oh no.
*  And there's logic to the essential business part of the liquor store thing.
*  Because look man. People are freaked out. They need something to calm them down.
*  If they can't get any booze at all shit could get really bad.
*  And the hospitals need the beds. So when people detox off alcohol it's very dangerous.
*  That's actually how Amy Winehouse died. She died from detoxing from alcohol.
*  It's a hard fucking fall too. So they need the hospital beds.
*  They can't have people detox while everybody's dying of COVID.
*  So they just. Makes sense to me.
*  They deemed it an essential business. But fucking alcoholics anonymous man you've got to keep that open.
*  You've got to keep that open.
*  I do an alcoholics anonymous zoom call once a week.
*  And most of them are fucking terrible man.
*  You've got to have. That doesn't make sense. That could really help.
*  The same as kids. You know my kids are going to zoom school.
*  You've got to be in person. It's not you know.
*  It's not the way to do it. You've got to be in person with people.
*  I'm telling you it's the fucking worst.
*  Have you seen some of the stand up zooms?
*  Fuck them. That is ridiculous.
*  That's like pretending you're in a swimming race in your living room.
*  I'm swimming look I'm on the floor I'm swimming.
*  But you're not swimming. You're not doing comedy.
*  You're fucking doing something weird man because you wish you could do comedy.
*  It's so bad. It's so painful to watch. Timing is everything.
*  And it kills the timing. You have no energy no audience.
*  No it's not. It's not stand up.
*  No it's not stand up.
*  Phoenix is holding shows again.
*  Wow. Phoenix has full nightclubs again.
*  Jesus. Yeah.
*  Floyd Mayweather was spotted at this Phoenix nightclub.
*  No masks on in the whole place.
*  Bumper to bumper with people. Really?
*  Again balance. I feel like maybe.
*  Let them do it. Let them do it. That's what I say.
*  Let them do it. Listen man this is not what we thought it was going to be.
*  It's not killing people at the rate we thought it was going to.
*  We would have never signed up for this if we thought it was really going to kill 0.1% of the population that catch it.
*  And you realize how many people catch it and don't even know they had it.
*  And then you look at the average age that people are dying from it.
*  It's literally older than the average age people die.
*  Oh well then what the fuck.
*  This is no sense. This is not something you should shut the economy down for.
*  We thought it was. We thought it was going to be a terrible thing that was going to wreak havoc.
*  And they'll point out like individual cases of people that are really young or healthy and something goes wrong with them.
*  100%. Yeah that's terrible.
*  But we should just be careful.
*  It doesn't mean we should keep everything shut down.
*  It's rare that these people exist.
*  These young people that get sick that you hear about. This is not normal.
*  Why aren't we reassessing the situation then?
*  I don't know man.
*  Are they going to see how these other cities that have opened up do and how that goes and then reevaluate?
*  This is a very conservative state in that regard.
*  It means very liberal but it's very conservative in the regard of how they're approaching this thing.
*  They're doing it very slowly and very deliberately.
*  You know I don't agree with it.
*  I just think at a certain point in time you have to adjust.
*  It is not what we thought it was going to be.
*  We thought there were going to be hundreds of thousands of people dead.
*  In this state there's only 2,000 people dead.
*  But people are dying from all kinds of shit all the time.
*  We can't just focus on one thing.
*  Of course.
*  While this is happening people are dying in this state of tuberculosis, lung cancer, liver cancer.
*  They're dying.
*  So do you think this is a political thing?
*  I don't know man.
*  To try and keep the economy shitty?
*  No I don't think so. I don't think that.
*  I've heard that crazy conspiracy theory. I don't think that.
*  I think it's a matter of first of all there's a lot of people that are legitimately scared.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean I've talked to kids, parents, that don't want the kids going back to school in September.
*  These people are legitimately scared.
*  They think it's going to get worse.
*  Oh my god if I had kids at home.
*  Bro.
*  Open it up. Open the fucking schools immediately.
*  For children it's very rare that it's fatal.
*  Very rare that it's fatal.
*  But the flu is far more fatal.
*  The flu is far more fatal for children.
*  And during flu season we willingly let kids go to school and we don't even think about it.
*  Yeah right.
*  Yeah you have to think about it.
*  If you're really worried about children the flu is far more deadly.
*  Now this is not dismissing the deadliness of this disease.
*  This is a terrible disease.
*  Michael Yeoh got it and he almost died.
*  But a lot of things happened to Michael Yeoh.
*  He flew all the way to fucking New York with no sleep.
*  He did radio. He did all these kinds of shit.
*  He did shows there. No sleep. Flies back.
*  And then drives from his house to Vegas and then back with his family in the same day.
*  Then he has two days of auditions.
*  Plus he's vitamin D deficient.
*  Oh well there you go.
*  I was thinking all this. I was like well Michael Yeoh is a strong guy.
*  He's healthy and vibrant.
*  Like if that guy got sick from it. Oh my god this is scary.
*  Vitamin D. No vitamin D.
*  Vitamin D deficiency is something that exists in like 70 percent of the population.
*  70 percent of the people in this country are vitamin D deficient.
*  First thing I did when I saw that we were going to be quarantined I ordered a shit ton of vitamin D online.
*  So I take some every day.
*  I try and go out in the sun every day because yeah I don't want this fucking thing.
*  I think I had it. I think I had it in January.
*  Everybody thinks they had it.
*  I really did. I've never had a cough like this in my life where I was wheezing.
*  I could barely breathe and the doctors were baffled.
*  They took chest x-rays. Had it for three weeks.
*  But who fucking knows. I don't know.
*  You might have had it. I thought I had it too.
*  I'll get an antibody test and figure it out.
*  I thought I had it. Didn't even feel it.
*  That makes sense.
*  If there's anybody I could think of that would have it and not be able to feel it it would be for sure.
*  I'm pretty sensitive to that kind of shit.
*  Congrats by the way on fucking Spotify.
*  Thank you.
*  Holy shit.
*  I know. Crazy right?
*  So well deserved man.
*  Thank you.
*  God damn.
*  Great to see you.
*  Sorry I didn't want to forget.
*  No worries.
*  I didn't want to fucking forget.
*  Yeah dude I've been ultra paying attention to my health while this is all going on.
*  That's one thing that's helped a lot.
*  You're always paying attention to that.
*  Like while this is going on I'm in the sauna every day.
*  25 minutes every day. No excuses.
*  Like super regular workout routine.
*  Super regular with my vitamins.
*  Super regular with everything.
*  Just being really on the ball.
*  Because it made me...
*  You can't take your health for granted.
*  And that's a simple statement that sort of just bounces around a room.
*  Like a beach ball doesn't mean anything.
*  This puts it in perspective.
*  Yes this puts it in perspective.
*  There's no doubt about it.
*  And in the beginning people were less cunty too.
*  I don't know if you noticed.
*  Because they were really worried they were going to die.
*  So things meant something.
*  You know what it reminded me of?
*  It was like the week after 9-11.
*  Everyone was real friendly with each other.
*  Yes exactly.
*  Super neighborly.
*  And now it's like I go out in traffic.
*  People are cutting each other off.
*  But it's worse than 9-11 because after 9-11 people went back to normal.
*  Now they're going to go back from all this niceness.
*  They're going to go back to being a cunt.
*  And there's no work.
*  And then they're angry.
*  And you were saying something important earlier.
*  You said we could fall into some sort of a class warfare type situation.
*  It's terrifying.
*  Yes it is terrifying.
*  And I don't think it had to be this way.
*  And I don't think it has to stay this way.
*  And they're talking about not even opening up LA until July 4th.
*  Fourth of July weekend.
*  Like hey man why?
*  This is so arbitrary.
*  And there's no talk whatsoever about strengthening your immune system.
*  None.
*  Yeah what the fuck?
*  Like the most important things are just falling by the wayside.
*  I don't understand that.
*  It's poor government.
*  It's just poor leadership.
*  It's poor leadership.
*  That's what it is.
*  It's leading only looking at one perspective.
*  And that's the perspective that enhances fear.
*  This is wear a mask.
*  Wear your gloves.
*  Use hand sanitizer.
*  Don't touch anything.
*  Stay apart from each other.
*  And then the other perspective is get out in the sun.
*  Get your vitamin D.
*  Drink lots of water.
*  Stop drinking soda.
*  Check your vitamin levels if you can.
*  But give yourself X amount of vitamin C a day.
*  X amount of D.
*  Take zinc.
*  Zinc has been shown to have a very positive effect on people with high zinc levels or
*  sufficient zinc levels that have this virus also have a much better outcome.
*  That's all I take.
*  Every morning I take one zinc, one vitamin D, and two Airborne.
*  But you won't hear any of this shit.
*  No.
*  That's what's so crazy.
*  I had to look it up.
*  I mean people fucking, they should be pumping this into our fucking bloodstream via the news.
*  But it's all bullshit.
*  It's all bullshit.
*  When Ron Patrick was talking about the vitamin D levels in people that are in ICU, it's
*  like if you were a scientist, you'd be like, hold on.
*  We found it.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  86% of the people in the ICU are deficient in vitamin D and then 4% have sufficient levels
*  of vitamin D.
*  4%.
*  That's insane.
*  It's 80 something percent versus 4%.
*  Like, holy fuck.
*  Holy fuck.
*  I don't understand where the last.
*  Dude, it makes zero sense.
*  It makes zero sense.
*  I wish that we could open the store tomorrow.
*  Yes.
*  Like, we should be able to open the original room at, it start out at 25% capacity, you
*  know?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, just what does it usually fit?
*  A hundred and 150 people?
*  Yeah.
*  Just 75 people.
*  Yeah.
*  Fucks.
*  We can space it out.
*  How about just get everybody to sign a waiver?
*  Right.
*  Just sign a fucking waiver.
*  Let's do this.
*  Oh, I mean.
*  And if you have a sick mom at home or if you have someone vulnerable at home, don't go
*  out to these places.
*  You're the one who should make the sacrifice.
*  Shouldn't be the whole world sacrificing.
*  Exactly.
*  But we can't rely on these fucking assholes.
*  So can you take a temp?
*  Yes.
*  They did it in the restaurant I went to in Texas.
*  I went to a real restaurant.
*  So we'll just get one of those fucking.
*  Shout out to the Lonesome Dove.
*  Adith is Lonesome Dove restaurant in Austin.
*  They take a fucking thermostat.
*  They put it to your forehead.
*  Right.
*  And they read you like you're all good.
*  And then you write on this thing, have you been in contact with anybody who has COVID?
*  Have you had a fever?
*  If you have any cold like symptoms?
*  And as long as you're clear on all that stuff, we should be doing that and call it a day.
*  They wear a mask.
*  They stay away from you.
*  I mean, mostly except you're taking your meal or drop it off your meal because we've already
*  gone over the game plan ad nauseam.
*  We know exactly how we're going to do it.
*  You know how to have access to the bathrooms, social distancing in the room, where the comics
*  can enter the stage.
*  So they're not fucking in the thick of it.
*  Yeah, we're ready to go.
*  All we need is the green light.
*  I don't know how.
*  The problem is they're never going to want to give that green light.
*  I mean, they're going to have to give the I think I really feel like early July.
*  We'll get it.
*  We'll get a percentage green light for one of the rooms.
*  I really think so.
*  You have half the belly room.
*  I think now I think which 30 people I'll take whatever I know.
*  I mean, goddamn.
*  I never thought I'd miss that place that much.
*  Yeah, eventually.
*  Like it got to a point where I'm like, I just want to fucking hide there because everybody
*  wants something and I don't know.
*  I didn't have shit to give.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  You know.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's a weird position as a talent coordinator for a comedy club where all the best comedians
*  go to.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like everyone who's in town, whether it's Chappelle or Bill Burr, they're all there.
*  They're all there.
*  There's no spots.
*  And then there's the one and then there's you and Joey Diaz and everybody else and Whitney
*  Cummings and all the A plus comics are there every single night when they're in town.
*  They're in town.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, and then that leaves you, you know, and then from 11 to 12, that's all the Andrew
*  Santino's and the Eric Griffin's and the Fahim Anwar's and all these other beasts that aren't
*  filling fucking arenas.
*  But they're still the next ones up, you know.
*  So if you're some new guy or gal that comes off the line.
*  Yeah.
*  That leaves like five spots a night at the end of the lineup.
*  Yeah.
*  And you got 250 comics calling in every week just that fit into that paradigm.
*  So it's like, sorry, you know, it's not nothing personal.
*  Yeah.
*  There's there's no club like it.
*  You know, no club ever been like it either, where there's no shortage of people in the
*  audience.
*  I mean, those years that I from when I came back to when the pandemic hit, where the craziest
*  years I've ever seen standup comedy at that place by far, like like a whole new dimension,
*  like a whole world had shifted.
*  It's been so fucking cool to watch, you know, and to see that shift.
*  There's some comics that are coming up right now.
*  Some of the ones that I passed in the last year or two, I'm so excited about like this
*  guy, Brian Simpson is you got it next when we reopen again, I'm telling you, this guy's
*  a beast.
*  He Segura, he opens up for Segura.
*  He's fantastic.
*  Laura Bytes, you know, is fantastic.
*  Lars, she's hilarious.
*  Chrysler and I were in the back of the room watching her on stage like it was like the
*  end of the night.
*  There's maybe like 20 people or something in the crowd and more people were in the crowd
*  by the end of her set than were there in the beginning because people were coming in because
*  she was slaying.
*  That's so cool.
*  Dude, she's killing us.
*  We had been around all night.
*  We've been hanging there all night and it was late.
*  Those are always the best sets.
*  Holtzman closing out the main room when it's like nine people in the audience and 20 comics
*  in the back of the room.
*  That's where Kinnison used to do the spots.
*  I mean, that's the least to say like people would come to see him.
*  They would start showing up at 12 o'clock.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's where I put Brody.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I see my trunk is still filled with all of this shit.
*  Really?
*  I had to clean out his whole apartment.
*  Do you have his kettlebell?
*  I might.
*  You want it?
*  Yeah.
*  All right.
*  If I have the kettlebell, I definitely have some drumsticks.
*  Whatever you want.
*  We'll go out there afterwards.
*  We'll have a Brody garage sale.
*  We worked together in Tempe and he was doing cleans and presses in the parking lot.
*  Staying fit.
*  I remember that.
*  That's when he used to do it.
*  But he's like, you might remember me from the made for TV Vlad A. Dvok movie.
*  Yes.
*  He was the best.
*  Push.
*  Positive.
*  We went to Little League together.
*  Did you really?
*  I grew up in Tarzana.
*  He grew up in Tarzana.
*  Wow.
*  He was one of the older students.
*  But yeah, Joe Torre, little baseball camp.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  I miss that motherfucker every day.
*  I miss that motherfucker too.
*  He was another thing about that place.
*  Like the special quality of that place.
*  Like you weren't going to run into Brody Stevens in any other walk of life.
*  You had to meet that kind of comedy guy.
*  Especially to get to know him like the way we got to know Brody.
*  Yeah.
*  You know?
*  I took it for granted, you know?
*  Yeah.
*  I really do.
*  Well, you really do.
*  And you really know you do now.
*  Like I kind of knew I took it for granted too.
*  I'd leave that place some nights and I'd be like, how lucky are we that we have this place
*  now because this place never existed.
*  And for me, it was like, you know, we're talking about the pandemic and coming back from the
*  pandemic.
*  For me, it was like when I was gone and then I came back, it made me realize like, oh,
*  this is a very valuable thing for your comedy.
*  You can't just go to random comedy clubs and just jump in and do sets.
*  Like having a home base and having a home base filled with like, jeselnik and all these
*  fucking assassins.
*  It's like you just be around murderers just all day long slaying.
*  And it just makes everybody's level higher.
*  I felt like the level of comedy that I was experiencing there was higher than I'd ever
*  seen it before.
*  Like you know, there was always the murderers like Martin Lawrence and Damon Wayans, but
*  there was a lot of bullshit in there, a lot of fucking boat acts and a lot of dudes who
*  were doing literally the same act, no bullshit for 25 years.
*  I know I had to get rid of a lot of those, dude.
*  It was weird.
*  Like you would you would see a guy and you'd not see him for 10, 15 years and you'd see
*  the same act in the same order of verbatim with old like Ronald Reagan as president references
*  and shit and like, whoa.
*  That was when I came here in 94.
*  There was a lot of that going on.
*  I believe it.
*  So it was like nothing, murderers and then nothing and then the occasional murder.
*  But it was like you get one murder a night maybe.
*  It wasn't nothing like now.
*  I mean, I'm so fortunate to have the people calling in every week that they could call
*  in because from nine o'clock till literally 12, 15, it's just wall-to-wall killers.
*  Yeah, we need to get the president involved in this.
*  Tell him that he'll get the support of all the comedians if he just has a federal mandate
*  to open up all comedy clubs.
*  We need it.
*  It's an essential business.
*  It really is, though.
*  I mean, we need that's going to do wonders for everybody's mental health for sure.
*  It will.
*  And for all the mental patients that do stand up.
*  I mean, what are they doing right now?
*  They're bouncing off the walls.
*  All these fucking people.
*  They're losing their minds so hard.
*  They're doing Zoom comedy.
*  Dude, somebody talked them into it.
*  I'm in my studio apartment.
*  I'm Jack Torrance over there.
*  It's like my little overlook hotel.
*  I don't think that's good for you.
*  No, very social guy.
*  I don't think that's a good thing to be locked up like that for two months at a time.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, I can't wait to get out.
*  Just take a chance at the bug.
*  Just go wander around.
*  Out on the beach, lick some faces.
*  Out on the beach, hold some hands.
*  I've been talking to Norm MacDonald a lot lately.
*  I think we're going to start the podcast up again.
*  So thank God for that.
*  Just get tested.
*  We can bring him in here and get tested, too.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what?
*  I think we would kill for you to be the first guest.
*  I would love to do it.
*  I'm 100% in.
*  Oh, thank God.
*  Yeah, we have some good guests lined up.
*  So now we're just going to figure it out.
*  Yeah, so you're all set to get tested today, too.
*  Oh, perfect.
*  I know you don't have it because you haven't gone anywhere, but you...
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  When you sit in your house like that for all those days at a time, that's got to be so
*  depressing.
*  It's not great.
*  It's not great.
*  It's really not.
*  My depression and anxiety is through the fucking roof.
*  Do you do any kind of exercise videos?
*  Yeah, I got a rowing machine.
*  So I do a lot of rowing, and then I go on a long walk.
*  I go on like a five-mile walk every day.
*  Oh, that's very good.
*  But that's it.
*  Yeah, but other than that.
*  But you're by yourself most of the time.
*  But I'm by myself in my apartment.
*  Yeah, shit, that ain't good.
*  Being by yourself that often is not good.
*  No, it certainly isn't.
*  All the single people.
*  This is a fucking weird one for single people.
*  Well, it's kind of choose your poison.
*  I feel like I would fucking want to kill somebody if I was stuck in a single room.
*  That can happen for sure.
*  Oh, absolutely.
*  Yeah, that can happen for sure.
*  It either brings you closer together or it drifts you further apart.
*  Yeah, if you have a strong foundation, you truly like each other.
*  You know what I mean?
*  You get to know each other better.
*  You've already accepted each other for everything, warts and all.
*  And also you both realize, like you're saying, you appreciate the store.
*  You also appreciate your family.
*  You appreciate your friends.
*  I appreciate my friends and my family and just everybody in my life way more now than
*  I guess I guess I always appreciated them.
*  But there's like a another 10 percent bump in all that stuff when the pandemic was happening
*  because like one started happening in the beginning.
*  I was like genuinely scared.
*  I was genuinely thinking this could be something that kills 10 percent of the people I know.
*  I was genuinely thinking like, oh, my God, this could be way worse.
*  China could be lying about how bad it is.
*  Yeah, way worse.
*  I remember talking to you about it right when you were in that state of mind.
*  Yeah.
*  And it was terrifying.
*  But what made me it made me think in that state of mind, like I'm so thankful that I
*  have such an amazing group of friends.
*  So thankful to have an amazing family.
*  So thankful that I have friends that I love that we can fuck with each other and talk
*  shit to each other.
*  You know, it's like that my song of the my the greatest joys of my day.
*  I'm in a group thread with with a bunch of comics.
*  And those are the those are my favorite moments of the day, just cracking each other up and
*  I'm in this thread with Whitney and Nick Swartz and and Delia.
*  It's the most ridiculous thread.
*  It's been going on for years, man.
*  For years.
*  I call it the bitch group.
*  Just bitching about shit.
*  It's really funny.
*  I'm in a great one with with Spade and Whitney.
*  It's just the best.
*  I think Whitney's just in a bunch of group texts all day long talking shit.
*  It's funny, man.
*  It's so fun.
*  I love her with all of my heart.
*  She's a great human being.
*  She really is a special one.
*  Very, very words into.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  He's amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  And delete.
*  We're so lucky.
*  Yeah, we're very, very, very lucky.
*  There's just a bunch of people that we know that are just some of the most fun people
*  to be around.
*  Yeah.
*  And Ari Shaffir.
*  Yeah, that.
*  No, I mean, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, Jerry Sloan just died.
*  I hopefully learned his lesson and keeps his fucking mouth shut this time.
*  You know, Jerry.
*  The coach of the Utah Jazz.
*  Don't even mention it to Ari.
*  He probably doesn't know yet.
*  No, he knows now that sort of a prank, that prank.
*  The idea of that prank.
*  It's like, OK, he's just fully committed to being the wrestling heel.
*  Exactly.
*  All the time.
*  He loves it.
*  Did I was reading that wrestling might go under.
*  No.
*  How?
*  They're saying that wrestling is they're firing wrestlers.
*  I know they got rid of Cain Velasquez and he only did like one match with them.
*  They're releasing a bunch of people off their roster and they're hurting, apparently, because
*  they're not getting any live gate.
*  You got to think pro wrestling when they tour around the country.
*  The I mean, they're doing hundreds of shows.
*  Yes, giant places.
*  You imagine the amount of money just from the live gate of all these places and then
*  merch, all that different stuff.
*  All that stuff's cut off.
*  So they have the same amount of expenses.
*  But then through no fault of their own, boom, profit stop.
*  I'm I'm genuinely ignorant about so many things in this world, except for maybe music, movies
*  and comedy.
*  But here's what I don't understand.
*  They've made a shit ton of money, haven't they?
*  Yeah, but they've been balling.
*  They're not saving.
*  What are they?
*  Boy Scout?
*  I thought Vince McMahon was like, oh yeah, he's on Jews and he's 90.
*  He's the guy who started the XFL.
*  Do you think he's saving money?
*  Yeah, no.
*  Come on, man.
*  I just watched the 30 for 30 on the XFL.
*  It was great.
*  That guy's doing squats and shooting fucking steroids and making billions of dollars.
*  He doesn't have any time for this nonsense.
*  Yeah, I guess that's true.
*  Come on, man.
*  He's an animal.
*  He's not saving any money.
*  The guy probably has 50 bucks in the bank.
*  He probably spends everything he makes.
*  Probably makes a hundred million dollars a year, spends it all like it's going out of
*  style.
*  He's a fucking animal.
*  And you look at his business, though, like you've got, I believe the way they have, you
*  would be able to know this, the app, their app, you get everything through that.
*  Right.
*  BW network.
*  I think it's right.
*  So when you sign up, you pay a monthly fee and you get all the events.
*  There's no pay per view.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Whereas the UFC, not the case, the UFC, like if you get ESPN plus, you got to pay for ESPN
*  plus.
*  But when like Conor McGregor fights or John Jones fights, you got to pay for that.
*  Yeah.
*  I found out the hardware.
*  I'm about, what was that?
*  Like three weeks ago.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That's, that's just how it is, man.
*  That's just how it is.
*  That's that's how it is.
*  And they don't, they don't have the same model.
*  And a lot of people like WWE used to have that model.
*  They used to have you'd pay for pay per views.
*  They have their regular shows and they have the big time pay per views.
*  Yeah.
*  I remember that with like SummerSlam and even the WWE.
*  I remember these days.
*  Yeah.
*  They used to advertise those all the time on cable.
*  If you could imagine though, if like Tuesday night, Rochester, New York, Conor McGregor
*  would just fight a championship fight and then you see him again on Saturday.
*  That's a good point.
*  You heard what Ronda Rousey said about that.
*  You know, she was like, you fucking dorks.
*  Listen, this is fake fighting and they do it 200 times a year.
*  She goes, you know what happens if you fought 200 times a year, you'd be dead.
*  She's a star in the WWE.
*  The end of the day, she was like the original great famous women's mixed martial arts fighter.
*  She's not taking your nonsense.
*  She's not listening to any of that stupid shit.
*  Shut the fuck up.
*  You know, I mean, she got knocked out by Cyborg and Amanda Nunes, or not Cyborg, by Amanda
*  Nunes and Holly Holm back to back.
*  The idea that she's going to listen to some fucking wrestling dork give her shit.
*  That business though, what I was going to say is I think because of the app, the WWE,
*  the way they have it set up, they don't have the live gate anymore.
*  So all that money from those, they do these giant arenas.
*  They're selling out like crazy all over the country.
*  200 plus a year.
*  All that money is gone.
*  They can't just hit the fucking pause button.
*  No, Vince McMahon's got pills, son.
*  He's got 80 jets, fucking 100 houses.
*  He's got no time.
*  He's just, I don't know.
*  I don't know what they do.
*  I mean, I think when the business drops, you got to act accordingly, I guess.
*  I guess when the business comes back, they'll rehire people.
*  It's a hard time for everybody, man.
*  But the people that I feel the most for are people who are dying and people who lost people.
*  But next, people who are losing their business and their family's falling apart because of
*  this and through no fault of their own.
*  Yeah.
*  And then the employees that are just forced to go out of work and how do they, they have
*  to go on food.
*  I don't understand how they're supposed to just quarantine for months with no money.
*  And again, no $1200.
*  And no talk at all about health, taking care of your health.
*  No talk.
*  That's just shocking.
*  No talk.
*  Yeah, that should be number one, two and three on the list.
*  Yeah, it's fucking, it's crazy.
*  What is going on?
*  I wonder if other countries, I'd be fascinated to see how they're handling this in other
*  countries on their news over there.
*  Well, some countries aren't handling it badly at all.
*  Some countries are like Germany had a crazy low death rate.
*  Right.
*  There's a bunch of countries that are really low death rates.
*  I wonder if on their news programs, they're focused on here's what you need to do to protect
*  yourself.
*  Take a lot of vitamin D. Take this.
*  Do this.
*  Get in the sun.
*  Yeah.
*  I think it's probably their health care system and it's probably their diet.
*  You know, there's a real issue in this country with sugar.
*  And that's a giant part of what's happening here.
*  When you talk about people that are getting diabetes and people that are overweight, those
*  are two big factors in this disease.
*  And they're both connected, not the genetic form of diabetes, but type two is connected
*  to sugar consumption.
*  Right.
*  It's directly connected to your diet.
*  You can also look at, ask Dean Del Ray.
*  Dean Del Ray had fucking diabetes because he was eating sugar all day.
*  He was doing Jamba juice once a day.
*  Yeah, he was eating candy.
*  He realized it when they gave him that wake up call, that diabetes wake up call.
*  That's a hell of a wake up call.
*  But now you look at him, he's healthy and fit.
*  He looks better than he ever has.
*  He lost a ton of weight.
*  And he said he feels so good.
*  He looks killer.
*  He looks great.
*  Yeah.
*  And now, like his Instagram posts, like you'll see quite a few of them every now and then
*  will talk about sugar and what he used to look like.
*  He'll put up fat Dean pictures to remind everybody.
*  Yeah, like fat Dean.
*  Dude, I got fat Adam.
*  I got fathom photos.
*  Oh, no.
*  That's right.
*  You showed me those.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Those are solid.
*  I was chubby at the improv.
*  What was that?
*  I'm not 2005.
*  I'm not judgey.
*  I didn't even notice.
*  No, you probably did know me when I was fathom.
*  Those were good days.
*  Maybe a little bit.
*  I let it go.
*  Yeah, good.
*  Thank you.
*  I appreciate that.
*  But Dean is a perfect example.
*  I mean, he was he had all sorts of health problems because of that sugar consumption.
*  Look at this fat Dean with his name.
*  Yeah, he got his name on the store at the wall.
*  I remember that.
*  The store rather.
*  Yeah, look at that fat Dean Tuesday.
*  He did.
*  He looks like Bobby Hill.
*  He used to do a bit about that.
*  Wow.
*  That's crazy how fat he was.
*  God damn.
*  And now he's healthy and young.
*  Yeah, sugar is a killer.
*  He's going back in time.
*  It's a killer.
*  He's getting younger.
*  He looks younger.
*  He does look way younger.
*  Way younger.
*  He looks healthier.
*  He looks so much better.
*  And that's my problem.
*  I eat too much ice cream.
*  Again, we're not hearing any of this stuff from people.
*  We're not hearing any of this stuff from Fauci or all these health experts.
*  We're not hearing any of it.
*  No, it's crazy.
*  Inject yourself with fucking Clorox.
*  And if you talk to people like, well, you don't want to shame people for, you know,
*  for having a poor diet or for being overweight.
*  Like, OK, do you care if people die or not?
*  Yeah.
*  What do you care about?
*  Is it hurting people's feelings or saving their lives?
*  Everything's backwards now.
*  Everyone's too sensitive.
*  They're worried about people's feelings too much.
*  It's going to be real weird when we come back to doing comedy and you hear all the COVID
*  jokes.
*  It's going to be.
*  Yeah, that's going to be the new.
*  Yeah, it's going to be the new airplane food.
*  I'm avoiding them.
*  I'm not writing anything about who's going to build the wall.
*  It's going to be the new fucking.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  We get it.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  But.
*  Wait, fuck.
*  You're sure there's no weed in this?
*  100 percent.
*  You probably get contact types from being in the room.
*  No, there was something specific I was going to ask you.
*  You had like 30 days.
*  How many days? 90 days off.
*  90 days.
*  Yeah, I got sober on March 1st.
*  You can't be in a room with someone like me.
*  That's what I was going to ask you.
*  Do you think?
*  It's probably catching you.
*  No, no, I don't think so.
*  Do you think that.
*  Contact.
*  Social distance from weed smoke.
*  Do you think all the PC bullshit and the social justice warrior shit is going to be tempered
*  after we?
*  No.
*  No.
*  No, I think it was tempered because of the real danger.
*  I think the real threat and the real fear tempered it.
*  And now that that's gone away, the real fear is going to give way to a new level of anger
*  because of this level of despair people are going to be experiencing financially over
*  the next few months.
*  So there's going to be a heightened, it's almost going to be like it has a slingshot
*  effect.
*  Like people got less Conti and they're going to get more Conti and more self-righteous.
*  Yeah, more self-righteous, more people chastising, criticizing people.
*  And on Twitter you really see it because people are literally forced to be at home.
*  So if you're forced to be at home and you don't have the discipline to stay off Twitter
*  and you happen to comment something and someone comments on your comment and then you start
*  talking shit to each other, that's your day.
*  Not only is that your day, but you're going to be crazy.
*  Like you're going to be thinking about it the middle of the night, what the fuck did
*  they write?
*  You get up to pee, I'm not going to check my phone.
*  Let me check my phone real quick.
*  Fuck.
*  And they said something that's pretty good.
*  You're like, God damn it.
*  Now I got to come up with something to say back.
*  And so you start Googling statistics.
*  Yeah, man.
*  Yeah, man.
*  I mean, this is what a lot of people are doing.
*  It's making people sicker and sicker.
*  I have almost completely avoided Twitter other than I'll check my DMs occasionally and occasionally
*  I'll check what other people have posted that I'm friends with or that I follow.
*  Check a little bit, but I might give it five minutes a day.
*  I deleted my Twitter icon about a year ago and then I just reinstalled it maybe about
*  a week or two ago.
*  And I'm already starting to see like, what am I doing?
*  Why am I even looking?
*  It's just getting me pissed off.
*  It's just too many people are angry.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just too many.
*  About nonsense.
*  Well, maybe it's to them it's important, right?
*  It's like when you post it, it's important.
*  But when you're dealing with whatever the fuck it is, a hundred million people that
*  are on Twitter or more, probably more that are posting on a regular basis.
*  And then most of what they want to say is angry.
*  Most of what they want to say is negative.
*  Most of it is complaining.
*  It might be like 60 percent complaining.
*  So when you tune into that, you're getting all the problems of all these people.
*  It's just too many people.
*  You're supposed to deal with the problems of the people that are around you.
*  So if there's like 10 people around you and Tommy's got a problem, what's wrong with Tommy?
*  Let's go talk to Tommy.
*  It's not supposed to be 10 million people.
*  And then there's hundreds of thousands of Thomas just flooding your fucking your feed
*  with bullshit.
*  My fucking girls lying about this and they say we can't vote in November.
*  Fuck that.
*  I say we sue and whoa.
*  All this craziness.
*  And it's like you just deal with the worst aspects of everyone's day or everyone's thoughts
*  or everyone's opinions.
*  You're just dealing with all this negativity.
*  And it's so rare that it is really very much appreciated when you do find it like a really
*  well structured conversation or disagreement about something where people don't get shitty
*  at all.
*  Wow, that's beautiful.
*  That's pleasant to see.
*  Or there's people that want to dox people because they don't like this politician that
*  they support or they don't like they want you to not have to wear a mask.
*  If you want to dox you like there's so many people that are so fucking angry and weird
*  online and then you add this pandemic to it and you just got this boiling pot of shitty
*  thinking and anger and meanness.
*  Just mean.
*  Yeah, there's a lot of that.
*  Where's the love?
*  Where's the love?
*  Where's the camaraderie?
*  Where's the hugs?
*  Isn't that the best part of your day?
*  Wouldn't you rather be friends with people?
*  Like I know you can have disagreements and not be shitty.
*  It's possible.
*  And that's what I loved about the comedy stores.
*  People that didn't disagree but they're still the camaraderie and they're at the end of
*  the day they're in the same boat.
*  Pretty much.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a lack of conservative comedians I would say.
*  If there's anything that's odd.
*  Yeah, that is.
*  I think that's very true.
*  There's a few that you know of but it's pretty rare.
*  I think there's probably more than we know that they're just not on stage.
*  They're avoiding it.
*  Maybe.
*  Yeah, maybe.
*  In acting it's like fucking 99% or something.
*  It's crazy.
*  Which makes me think that can't be real.
*  It makes me think that it's probably a lot of it is people shaping their opinions so
*  that they're more accepted and loved by the community that they've chosen to try to excel
*  in.
*  Definitely.
*  All business decisions.
*  I remember I had this conversation with this dude once.
*  I was on a TV set when I first started acting.
*  In Newsrater?
*  Yeah, no before that.
*  Hardball.
*  Oh, okay.
*  This is early in my acting career.
*  I was quite crazy.
*  I was talking to this dude about a movie.
*  Actually, it might have been Newsradio Days because I think that's when this movie came
*  out.
*  It was as good as it gets.
*  Sure, with Jack Nicholson?
*  Which I thought was the most fucking depressing movie.
*  I'm like, here's this lady and she's so nice and she keeps accepting this guy for fucking
*  up over and over again.
*  The end, the solution is he takes a pill and the pill keeps him from being an asshole.
*  There's no pill for that.
*  That's so crazy.
*  He's an asshole.
*  He's a major asshole.
*  He's a fucking asshole.
*  We're supposed to say, oh no, no, no, he just needed a pill.
*  Once he gets this non-asshole medium inside of his body, it cancels out all the asshole-ishness
*  and he's actually a good guy.
*  She found a good guy.
*  This poor lady was a single mom who was living with this fucking mean piece of shit and a
*  pill fix it.
*  I was like, that movie depressed the fuck out of me.
*  I was talking to this actor and he goes, actually, I think he had a lot to offer her.
*  I go, what?
*  Because it was a popular movie.
*  He was spouting.
*  I go, it was a terrible movie.
*  If that lady was your sister, wouldn't you want to grab her and go, Helen, come on, you're
*  awesome.
*  This guy's a dickhead.
*  This guy's so mean.
*  He says racist shit.
*  He's mean.
*  He's cracking jokes.
*  He was yelling at people.
*  He did a lot of weird shit.
*  He was a writer, right?
*  They said, how do you write women so well?
*  I think of a regular woman and then I take away reason and accountability.
*  Well, it's not just that.
*  It was like-
*  No, he was misogynist.
*  He was an asshole, always a dick.
*  But there was no nice.
*  No, he had no redeeming qualities whatsoever.
*  He had crippling OCD.
*  I haven't seen it in many years.
*  Didn't make any sense.
*  I'm like, oh, it was depressing.
*  I go, look, it's a work of art, right?
*  It doesn't have to be warm and fuzzy.
*  But it made me feel bad.
*  But he was like sticking up for the relationship.
*  Oh, that does.
*  I can understand sticking up for the movie, but not-
*  Yeah, that's insane.
*  But I realized in the middle of the conversation, I'm like, oh, people do shit like that because
*  they think they're supposed to like a movie.
*  Oh, God, yes.
*  So they say shit-
*  Of course that's what he was doing.
*  Oh, it was 100%.
*  Yes, definitely.
*  Because I was, look, I was dumb.
*  I'm dumb now.
*  But back then, I was like four years removed from fighting.
*  If you're fucking dumb now, then I'm fucked.
*  I was much dumber than them.
*  But my instincts were always to challenge people on things.
*  Like, what?
*  What are you saying?
*  Love that.
*  I wanted to find out why he could ever possibly think that that was a good idea for that lady
*  to date that fucking asshole, that mean guy who just needed a pill.
*  That's so crazy.
*  That's the craziest movie.
*  I remember that.
*  I remember when The English Patient came out and everybody was all over, it was like this
*  is the best thing ever.
*  And I was like, that movie fucking sucked.
*  But I wouldn't say, today, if it came out today, I would have no problem being like,
*  no, you're wrong.
*  That movie bored the shit out of me.
*  It was weird.
*  But my point was not that it was a good movie or a bad movie.
*  He was staying up for the relationship to-
*  He was just, this is what my point was.
*  I could tell he wasn't really saying it because he thought it.
*  He was saying it because he thought it was the thing that he should say.
*  And in talking to this guy, I found this, it was like one of those fake houses where
*  they film a TV show where there's nothing behind it.
*  It's propped up on sticks.
*  And I'm looking at this guy and I look behind the sign.
*  I was like, you're a fake personality.
*  You don't even have a real personality.
*  Who are you?
*  You're a fucking weirdo.
*  And this is one way you could tell these people.
*  They would always say, good to see you, even if they just met you.
*  They'd say, good to see you.
*  It was like you're in a cult.
*  You're saying the things that everyone says.
*  And bless be with you.
*  And bless be with you, brother.
*  Like you pass each other in the hallway.
*  Good to see you.
*  Good to see you.
*  And everyone was full of shit.
*  This is the most disingenuous, good to see you.
*  Instead of saying, hey, what's up?
*  Nice to meet you.
*  That's such a perfect analogy.
*  That is because I was in a cult.
*  I know what it's like to fucking experience that.
*  That's why I'm bringing this up.
*  I want to get to that.
*  I know your cult story.
*  So that is 99% of the industry.
*  That's why it's such a sad place.
*  That's why it's so sad.
*  So lonely.
*  And you get all that attention.
*  And believe me, that's what I wanted.
*  That's why I came here.
*  I mean, I just figured out along the way what was wrong.
*  I figured out along the way, like, oh, this is a bad motivation.
*  This is not a good motivation.
*  Like but the best, this is not going to fix you.
*  You have to fix you and then treat what you're doing as an art form and enjoy it instead
*  of treat what you're doing as like a method of extracting attention.
*  Because that's the difference between someone who's an artist, right?
*  Like Gary Clark Jr. versus someone who's just doing a lot of dumb shit to try to get attention
*  and doesn't really have any thought to it.
*  I know exactly what you mean.
*  And there were a lot of comics that were like that at the Comedy Store that were doing it
*  to get women and they didn't have any real love for the art form.
*  They just wanted to be famous.
*  They weren't working on their craft.
*  They had the same set like you talked about earlier that they've been doing for a decade.
*  And they were just doing it to try and get women.
*  They wanted to get famous.
*  It's just you got to somewhere along the line, fix what's wrong with you.
*  And you can do that and keep growing as a person and keep just fixing what's wrong with
*  you and concentrate on positive things that are about this thing.
*  There's a way to be healthy and still approach it.
*  And the way to be healthy and approach it is to approach it as an art form.
*  Don't approach it as a method for getting you attention.
*  And the problem is it's like set up to chase the attention.
*  It's set up to chase the sitcom role or the record that you put out or whatever the big
*  thing is.
*  Right.
*  The next shiny thing.
*  The movie that you get into.
*  The big thing that's supposed to elevate you and define you.
*  Instead of that, I think if you can, as you're evolving as an artist, reach a point where
*  you're just trying to do your best work.
*  And that must feel so fucking good to reach that point.
*  You're never really there.
*  But to be adjacent at least.
*  You're chasing it always.
*  You're like right, you're running right alongside it, but you can never jump on its back.
*  If you're adjacent to that.
*  You just keep trying.
*  It's really a numbers thing in a lot of ways and an attention thing and a focus thing.
*  People want to say it's a talent thing.
*  Talent is a weird thing.
*  A lot of like for stand up, you've developed a personality long before you ever thought
*  that it was an asset in a career.
*  Joey Diaz was just a personality.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  But if you are a regular guy who works in an accounting office.
*  Can you imagine Joey Diaz in an accounting office?
*  No, impossible.
*  You're like a real calm guy who's like I've always enjoyed stand up comedy.
*  I want to give it a try.
*  And you go to like these open mic nights and the weeknets and you meet that savage.
*  You're like oh my god, that guy's a real person?
*  Like this guy exists too?
*  Like I gotta quit now.
*  You know like he's that's a different like that advantage.
*  He's like done some cross training.
*  Like life like getting arrested and kidnapping people and all the coke he did.
*  Solid cross training.
*  Comedy cross training like Joey Diaz like he'll have such a massive advantage over any normie.
*  Yeah, like even if a normie's got really good jokes like he's just always lived in it.
*  That personality element is something you can't teach right?
*  And you got to figure that one out.
*  That's I think that's one of the most important things in stand up is authenticity to me.
*  I feel like that's a huge thing.
*  Yeah, I feel like it's hypnotism.
*  I really do.
*  I could see that.
*  Yeah, I've always had this idea before I was ever hypnotized.
*  Then my friend Vinny Shorman, he's a hypnotist.
*  He hypnotizes fighters and he hypnotizes people and gets them to work on their game plan,
*  their mindset and it's very strange.
*  I did it once.
*  Very strange state.
*  Very strange.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, you're there.
*  Like you're aware that it's happening.
*  It's not like you know like I've seen hypnotism shows.
*  There was a guy in Rhode Island named Frank Santos.
*  He was a comedy hypnotist.
*  He would do these gigs in Boston.
*  He was amazing.
*  I've met a couple that came through Tempe every year.
*  Some of them are good.
*  Yeah, sure.
*  Some of those guys and it's certain.
*  There's a certain level of dummy that you can just that dummy will be convinced he's
*  in Game of Thrones riding a dragon.
*  There's a certain level of dummy and it really it look for me as a person who's met people
*  like like John Carmack who is the lead programmer of id games.
*  Okay.
*  Doom and Quake.
*  Oh yeah, sure.
*  Super super genius like Elon of course meeting someone like him super super genius and then
*  knowing how dumb some of my friends are and I'm dumb too.
*  But it's like I'm around him and I go okay there's I don't think I wonder what is life
*  like to that guy.
*  I guarantee you he's not looking at shit the way I'm looking at it.
*  You know he's looking at he's looking into the matrix.
*  Yeah.
*  I think there's levels lower than us and you get to this level where you can talk a guy
*  and he's having sex with Christy Tegan.
*  You could he'll really believe that him and Kim Kardashian are having sex.
*  You can you can convince those people and they even come in their pants.
*  This guy's Frank Santos used to make guys nuts.
*  No no no no 100 percent.
*  What are you talking about?
*  He would he would back then was Madonna.
*  I'm not kidding man.
*  First of all the guy was a wizard.
*  What's his number?
*  Well he's dead.
*  Unfortunately rest his soul.
*  His son is doing stand up and his son is or his son is doing hypnotism shows.
*  Son is the same name.
*  But anyway he was he would have this show weekly at Stitches.
*  Stitches was a big comedy club in Boston and all the comics like Fitzsimmons and me we
*  would go to the back of the room and watch the Frank Santos show all the time.
*  I was dating a waitress there at the time and I would so I'd be there all the time.
*  So even if I didn't have a set we'd come down and watch Frank Santos show because it was
*  so ridiculous.
*  They were always my favorite shows to watch too except for obviously the greatest comics
*  that would come through.
*  But yeah those were always a fun show.
*  They were ridiculous.
*  When Pete when he gets people to do things and tells them you're on a bus and the bus
*  is about to go off the cliff and into the ocean and you don't know how to swim.
*  My favorite were the midnight ones where it was the dirty one.
*  They would always do the dirty show.
*  One time I saw it was a couple and this guy he convinced this girl she was in a porno
*  and she they gave her a banana and he started she started deep throat in the banana and
*  the whole crowd was going insane.
*  And then they got in like he like sadly he beat her up in the parking lot.
*  But but yeah yeah it wasn't it wasn't a great ending.
*  But yeah but those shows were always wild.
*  The guy not the hypnotist her boyfriend.
*  Boyfriend because he was in the audience.
*  Oh no.
*  Yeah because he was with her.
*  So it wasn't his fault but we that was the last time.
*  But that was the last time we did the midnight hypnotist show.
*  But what you do here you can't get mad at a woman for expressing her inner home.
*  Of course not.
*  You just got to respect it.
*  But really who she really is.
*  You sort of you're you do hypnosis.
*  No.
*  I was terrified.
*  I was really nervous coming in here.
*  I've been thinking about it ever since you invited me.
*  I'm like I'm going to puke all over the studio.
*  It makes me it.
*  I lost so much sleep over it.
*  But I you put people at like you're you and like I've seen it with Stern and now with
*  you where I don't know what it is.
*  You're like you do hypnosis.
*  So now you put everyone at ease.
*  No Adam.
*  We're actually friends.
*  I know that if we were at dinner we would talk like this.
*  Yeah but you have a large audience like it's different man.
*  But you got to not think about that.
*  All right.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the thing.
*  If you think about that that right.
*  Right.
*  Don't think about that.
*  OK.
*  Just think about the fact that this is how we would talk no matter what.
*  This is true.
*  Right.
*  If we were hanging out in the back bar at the comedy store and you and me just hanging
*  out in the back there.
*  Thank God.
*  Thank God for Eric creating that back.
*  You know that bar is the best part of the comedy club.
*  It's amazing and it has the bar that's actually from Mitzi Shores house.
*  I love that.
*  Yeah.
*  How cool is that.
*  It's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  That bar is perfect.
*  That's my one little like place to go for solace.
*  Yeah it's a it's a sweet spot when it doesn't get overrun.
*  Sometimes I bring that up on a weekly basis.
*  We got to figure that'll be number one on the agenda.
*  We were even comedians.
*  I know it's a nightmare.
*  What is this.
*  I almost prefer them to the to the open micers.
*  Yeah.
*  Because then they're they're like asking bugging people to be on their podcasts.
*  Exactly.
*  The open micers are tricky because you know they all me included.
*  Like I said about Ari we all started as open micers.
*  Ari is basically I think just starting to do sets like paid sets probably when he got
*  here.
*  I wonder when he first started getting paid.
*  But I started taking him on the road with me.
*  2004 or five.
*  Something like that.
*  He was a couple of years into his career and he was you know coming up from being a door
*  guy to getting fairly regular spots and he just kept getting better and working at it.
*  So that that day that he was doing his specials like I have to be there.
*  I have to.
*  I have to.
*  Right.
*  I'm like even if I have to fight like all my horrible instincts to run away and fucking
*  just I had to.
*  Thank God you fucking did.
*  And thank God they they allowed allowed him to film that special.
*  Thank God.
*  Because they at first it took a lot of took a lot of convincing to me.
*  I was born that was when I pulled into the parking lot that Tuesday night the night before
*  I was nervous like nervous to be driving in the back park.
*  You took seven years off and that was weird.
*  It's like like going back to your old high school or something.
*  I don't know.
*  I can't imagine what that was like going back home from from a long long time away.
*  What do you do?
*  Contact high.
*  You can't be in this room.
*  You're 90 days.
*  It's like it's like if you went.
*  Yeah.
*  If you had hadn't returned home for many years.
*  Yeah.
*  Family and I'm worried that we're going to lose clubs.
*  You know.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm worried we're going to lose restaurants.
*  I'm worried we're going to lose clubs.
*  I'm worried we're going to lose everything.
*  Yeah it's it's terrifying.
*  I try not to think about it.
*  But I think the comedy store is going to thank God.
*  I think that the comedy store will be OK.
*  I don't know man.
*  I just don't fucking know.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know either.
*  Plus, it's coming soon because it's not even June.
*  You know talking about July 4th.
*  Like what?
*  What is going to happen over the next month?
*  I don't know.
*  Yeah, we got to open.
*  I can't I can't anymore.
*  I'm nervous about.
*  The way it's going to reboot.
*  Like what's going to happen?
*  What's it going to be like?
*  You mean in terms of the capacity in terms of what?
*  What's going to society.
*  Society.
*  Oh yeah.
*  No, like it's the the streets are so empty right now
*  They're ominous and this is like ominous feeling when you're driving around of like this is just the beginnings of a volcano
*  But that's what it feels like look eventually it seems like they're gonna have a vaccine for sure
*  I know nothing's definite and what are you doctor? No, I
*  Sounds like it sounds like they had some some progress and some yeah, maybe very positive. Okay, I don't know
*  Maybe it was ready. They would give it to us, right? No. Yeah, it's not ready and there's there's talk about it
*  There's also talk about something find out what the fucking m
*  Rna virus is we were talking about this with a fucking me. Do I even want to know this is a new kind of
*  Not virus. Excuse me vaccine. Oh, mr. N a vaccine
*  So this is some shit that Alex Jones told me about and he said it's something that we all have to be very concerned with
*  So it's something that it's a vaccine that's gonna be able to it's like uses your own body to
*  Create proteins, right? Isn't that how it works?
*  something along those lines, I know I'm butchering this but instead of like having a
*  Here does it say?
*  Okay scientists produce a synthetic version of the mRNA that a virus uses to build its infectious proteins click on that
*  Yeah, see I'm clearly butchering it but that's this the idea of it is that it makes your body produce something that
*  protects you from the virus
*  Maybe it turns us all into fucking spider-man
*  Right. I'm in I mean, yeah
*  Is one of these things right not kill us but turn us into superheroes. When do we get to be exactly?
*  You obviously you want to be Dr. Man
*  Mars
*  Fuck and travel through the universe and have no emotions and be blue and Jack
*  I was gonna say like cuz out of all the superheroes that's the one that you would resemble the most currently
*  Well, he's the only superhero if you're gonna be a superhero
*  Everyone else is basically like a person with some extra extra things. They do bullshit. He's a god
*  Dr. Manhattan is like he's like one level below a god who was fucking galactic. What was galactica?
*  Galacticus I don't know man. He was like a planet. I don't fucking know all those
*  Superhero movies man people who don't enjoy those superhero movies lose my number
*  How could you be that sad?
*  All of them, but most of them there's a lot of good ones man. Yeah, they're fun. Here's galactus galactic galactus galactus
*  Originally Galan before his transformation. Oh, you had a transformation and turned into something a single survivor of the universe
*  Proceeding the Big Bang of the main universe of the Marvel Comics universe what?
*  With these traits and his appointment of powerful beings as his heralds
*  Formerly the Silver Surfer. Oh, he used to run the Silver Surfer
*  That's right. Okay, that's right. I just remember him being a big but look he's holding a fucking planet
*  He's gonna be the next guy that they fight. I'm gonna start up the movies. Oh, no way really
*  I'm making a guess. Okay
*  But bro, they should bring back the Silver Surfer man fucking love
*  They did it once but it was kind of weird Fantastic Four those were those weren't yeah
*  There was one Silver Surfer movie though wasn't there I think it was
*  Fantastic four I think it was a fantasy for
*  Silver Surfer I think there was a so an actual rise of the Silver Surfer for 2007. Oh, so it was a specific
*  episode of the
*  They gotta keep everybody together can't leave the Silver Surfer have his own shit
*  Have some fun
*  See but see there's four four people the Silver Surfer is five motherfucker give him his own show
*  Yeah, Silver Surfer was so dope. He was dope as fuck. Yeah. Yeah, Michael chickless. Is that Captain America?
*  Was he see
*  Who the fuck is mr. Fantastic Michael chickless was a good thing too you ever watch that guys that cop show that guy was
*  The one after was shield
*  Was great she was excellent. Yeah, that was an excellent
*  That was a really good cop. Yeah, like really good. I think it was complicated and
*  Wait, what's on an episode of is he?
*  He's jerking off on people of course he is. All right good sounds right. It sounds like what do you get arrested for?
*  Yeah, those those movies are fun man like that like now more than ever when when chick it's really hard
*  That's when people want to scape ism. Yeah, that's when something like a comic book movies the most fun
*  I went through and I just started watching all the ones I missed cuz I'm a shield here. Oh, no way
*  I'm gonna rest him for that
*  Someone's window is people Tom
*  Is that a funny thing that they get you for oh
*  Look how easy that's hilarious. Do you try to push that cop one cop so just that's outstanding
*  I love it silly burn is that who he was looking at that guy fucking
*  Maybe both of them
*  He's gonna make him address her with his hands cuffed behind his back and look they don't even put their clothes on
*  So like we're gonna go back to fucking real quick. So what do you have to do here?
*  Look at her. She doesn't have clothes on the TV show. It's hilarious
*  But you imagine like you have to answer the door so quickly you can't even put your clothes on
*  You just hold a t-shirt over your tits
*  Super normal everybody does that when there's a whole group of people outside your room. I say hold on
*  I need to get dressed fucking get dressed the lady's an animal seer. She's got a talent
*  She doesn't want to tie it on. She's like I'm gonna let this go cuz I'm gonna fuck soon
*  She's not going anywhere now shouldn't have time for that shit. She's not gonna press charges
*  No, you could see it in her eyes. Get out of here you creep
*  That's a weird one though, right?
*  Like peeping into people's windows is illegal
*  But they're glass
*  That's true. They are
*  Yeah, seems weird
*  Bert took it a little too far. Maybe for sure. He was beaten off
*  Yeah
*  But like if you have a window that's facing an alley and someone walks in that alley and they stare in your window
*  Who's the asshole?
*  Yeah, that's a good point. I think there's a time limit maybe
*  He should count 10 Mississippi
*  Five
*  We're rear window is
*  Yeah, it's a fucking great. Mmm. Yeah
*  That's right, he spent the whole fucking movie staring into that guy's apartment with binoculars across the way
*  brace Kelly
*  Five I think I barely remembered I watched a little bit of it recently a psycho. It's great
*  I mean the beginning is great, especially. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I just saw I watched I just watched the shower scene
*  The the crazy okay, he puts the wig on stabs chicks bro spoiled alerts from 1940
*  But it's um, it's so
*  Whatever it was that what it was. I think so. Yeah, whatever was um, it was it was such an it was so different than any movie
*  You'd ever see today. Yeah, it's like it was so
*  Just the pacing and the suspense. Love it. It's just different. It's a I used to watch all the old like
*  Twilight Zone or the old Hitchcock present alpha or Alfred Hitchcock presents around the same time
*  Women back then one he he actually with Janet Lee
*  He made sure that it was a ice cold water
*  So that the scream like he would turn it to make sure that the water was ice cold right when she was getting stabbed
*  So those screams are like actual fucking primal scream. Oh, wow
*  That sounds like very hitchcockian, but dude this was such a crazy thing a naked lady
*  Right washing herself off. Look at her in ecstasy. This was like erotica
*  Yeah, and then and then this and there's two different like shot. Yeah, this is why it's so scary
*  Groundbreaking because you're in love with her. You're like, I wish I was there to wash your hair fuck
*  Yeah, you know what I mean? Like if you're a guy and you're sad this
*  Justin saying
*  Oh, and then that shot yeah, you like see here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
*  This is such a crazy movie. This scene was so insane
*  Whoa, oh, it's so insane, dude. Oh
*  Wow. Yeah, it still holds up like a motherfucker. Yeah, it holds up
*  It's it's it's masterful in that you don't see anything gory, but you're still horrified and frightened
*  Anything gory but you're still horrified and flinching while it's happening
*  Yeah, like reservoir dogs when when mr. Blonde cuts off the cops ear
*  Yeah, but even more fucked up because you were in love with her and you were just here. It's 1960
*  Yeah, you wanted to wash your hair you want to know you guys are saying this holds up
*  I this is like this ice when I saw the exorcist in the theater when they re-released it after like the 25th anniversary
*  I mean my friends were
*  Hilariously laughing at some of the scenes because people had built it up so long our whole lives
*  Oh, yeah, it's the scariest thing ever and she's running down the stairs backwards and she's like pees on herself
*  We just thought it was
*  hilarious
*  Just wasn't I mean we've seen scream. I know it's aren't scary either
*  But like that's what like our generation scary movies were
*  It was just wild how funny this stuff. I remember that the first one
*  I ever saw as a kid was the shining and that's still
*  That's
*  That's an interesting one right because Stephen King didn't like it
*  Yeah, that makes sense because it is wildly different from it. It's a it's a huge departure from the novel
*  so I can imagine if you're an artist and then someone takes your artwork and they
*  Completely change it in many different ways they will you know they changed it a bunch of ways
*  But they kept it a bunch of ways to it became like a collaboration between him and Kubrick
*  Because it was clearly his original idea, but yeah, he wanted I believe Stephen King wanted that character to go crazy
*  He didn't want to have this fucking edge like right from the beginning
*  Like Jack Nicholson had an edge like right from the beginning and then became insane and then you know
*  Well, I know what it's like
*  Yeah to be an alcoholic who just stopped drinking and I think you have that edge almost from the get-go
*  Yeah, a little bit, but I mean Jack's Jack
*  That movie was so good. It was top top ten all-time favor. That's what's crazy. It's like someone needed to tell Stephen King like I know
*  It was so good
*  When those little girls are in the hallway and the fuck hair coming out of the elevator, holy shit
*  That's a good movie. So many great moments
*  And back then when it came out like people don't understand like the shining is like what is that 82 or something?
*  I think is it think so that is that is yeah, so 1980 people you've got to understand
*  We're talking about a whole different world. Yeah, there's no there's no special effects if there are there. They're not very good
*  They're all like yeah, yeah and Empire Strikes Back. Yeah, but it's it's clunky
*  Yeah, the special effects are clunky. I guess Empire Strikes Back's pretty fucking dope and then alien was 79. That's right
*  All right, but that's it but falling apart and Blade Runner was 82. So there's really not much else though
*  but there's a lot of clunky so they did this movie with
*  just
*  Just that mean just all of the yeah all of the different crazy
*  Moments like that bathroom moment with the ass coming through the door
*  There was so many of those moments the moment with the old lady because Kubrick was a fucking master at
*  creating suspense and and using the sets and the color contrast like just the the the color patterns are
*  Unsettling and the fact that he used those twins weren't exactly they weren't twins. There were just little differences that makes it unsettling
*  There's so many different ways. Do you know he used to do complex mathematics for fun? That's how
*  Genius he was a trippy dude by far. I think the greatest director of all time
*  Well, he definitely is one of them and one of the most unique ones
*  They said, you know, there's a crazy conspiracy theory connected to the shining in the moon landing. Yeah
*  Yeah, it's all about the number on the doors exact same amount of thousands of miles two three seven and it's
*  237,000 miles away
*  By the way, it varies see that's the problem with that argument is that like the the the distance between the earth and the moon is
*  Not constant. I think it moves a little bit
*  So I think it goes as far as two hundred sixty five thousand feet out if I'm interest from our miles route rather
*  265,000 miles out and it goes
*  To 237, but I think it varies. I think it goes like this
*  I think it has like an elliptical orbit around the earth a little bit. I made that up. Is that true?
*  Yeah, sounds like it so I was in the middle of reading the 237 stuff
*  Yeah, I heard it was also possibly about Native Americans how the hotel is built on an ancient Indian burial ground
*  And even Shelley DeVos sort of looked Native American you can hear Native American music playing in the opening credits
*  I wouldn't be surprised if there's many layers. Yeah. Yeah, he's just brilliant man. He was a brilliant brilliant
*  The little kid did have an Apollo 11 sweat. Yeah, that's true. He did have an Apollo 11. That's pretty on the nose. I
*  Just remember in the back room in the stock room. There was like a can of a product with a giant
*  It was like Geronimo's head on the on the on there. I'm sure there's so much to that
*  Yeah, there's probably many layers the Kubrick is not gonna operate on one layer. No, it's probably gonna have a bunch of weird shit in there
*  I mean look at 2001 what a mind fuck God what a mind fuck
*  Yeah, well there was so much of his work, you know
*  And he's the guy that the the conspiracy theorists when they get the most crazy
*  When they when they really want to dive into who did it they think it was all Kubrick the Kubrick
*  Literally filmed the fake moonland right right uploaded it to the American TV satellites
*  If anyone could do it, it'd be him. He'd be the guy I would get to do it
*  You imagine if that was that was really what happened. I've heard all these years. I
*  remember hearing all the fucking conspiracy theorists about the
*  Illuminati killing him because he made yeah. Yeah. Well, they were worried
*  He was gonna open his fucking mouth
*  Landing. Oh, no, that's what it was
*  That's who those his last one they like enough this guy's getting too close because I think he died like
*  Like a week after that movie course he did that's fucked. That's how they roll meet people
*  This is how they roll. He was think nobody really rolled that way until this Jeffrey Epstein shit
*  And they're like
*  What's shocking? This is the first really truly eye-opening one like yes
*  Well, that's an Alex Jones one to Alex Jones was talking about that way
*  Before anybody was when he called it way before and he said there's this
*  Service and they take these elites and they bring them to this place and they have sex with underage girls
*  And everybody was like no fucking way that sounds like science fiction and then you realize like
*  Well, this is a hundred percent true and nobody was talking about it
*  100% true that's crazy. It's insane. It's insane
*  It's so weird and then the guy gets suicided the guys in jail
*  Going to trial and they like well Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide today. Like we're also we're in the 1940s again
*  Breaking news that's just in
*  Jeffrey Epstein
*  Today
*  100% convinced it was not fishy business. I
*  Remember Diaz told me in the parking lot like a week before that means like this guy's not going to try these kill
*  These they're killing this fucking authorities do not suspect foul play
*  Jeffrey Epstein filthy rich. What is that new documentary comes out?
*  Based off of James Patterson spoke. It's came out a couple years ago, dude. I've been a lot of views
*  I've been into these Jack Carr books these
*  Have you have you ever read any Jack Carr Jack Carr has
*  Three books he's working on his fourth one now and it's all about it's like they're thrillers
*  But like there's espionage and political shit going on in there and the the main
*  Protagonist I don't know no red Clancy
*  But the main guy is a Navy SEAL and there's all this crazy shit that happens in all these stories
*  But in a lot of them you go wow like
*  This I used to think that something like this is preposterous that people just making up this idea that you know that
*  People would conspire to do evil creepy shit all over the world and do it to make money and sacrifice people's lives
*  But as I've gotten older, I'm like, oh, that's probably way closer to what's really going on
*  Probably like that's probably way closer. Yep. That's probably it's probably
*  Is like that and then
*  Gets arrested and then gets suicided and then everybody's like well
*  Too bad
*  There's no
*  Senate hearings you're not standing in front of the TV every day going what happened?
*  How could one of the most important witnesses ever? How could the cameras not be working?
*  You didn't check when Tim Dillon did that. Oh, he's so good at that Tim
*  He's he's at all the young wild guys coming up. He's the most wild definitely
*  He's the most wild and consistently. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah fucking funny shit. Yeah, Shultz very wild to
*  Very well impresses me. Yeah goes for it. He goes for it. I wish she lived in LA take some risky turns
*  He takes some risky. Yeah, sure does Tim Dillon does to that fucking Megan McCain thing is the same
*  That's still the funniest thing I've ever seen
*  I love the way he says what's her name? Oh, oh, oh now he's dressed as a coronavirus
*  He did a rant about cruise ships on this part was great
*  Great rant today or yesterday a fucking solid one every time there's something going on with cruise ships
*  I sent it to him now. We just we have like this back and forth on just cruise ship shit
*  I still say the most dangerous comic right now who will say whatever the fuck he wants is still Holtzman. Oh, yeah that guy
*  He's always been buck wild
*  Holtzman's thing about there's a lady who drowned her kids back in the day
*  Ladies and gentlemen, I heard those are bad kids
*  I mean he's doing this like a week after these this fucking lady drowned her babies like they sat that close to the TV
*  Didn't put away that blocks those kids will not be missed they spilt their milk
*  Like oh no after 9-eleven midsy wouldn't put him up. Oh, I mean like you can't go up yet
*  Let me out Mitzi like no
*  He was so funny at Mitzi's memorial
*  He would just say the most fucking horrible shit and then list off a bunch of random tour dates
*  Like August 3rd August 4th, I'll be at the yuck yucks in Montreal
*  I'm here at the in-and-out burger. Thank God. It's Wednesday
*  People some sketch with some lady at a Thai food place. Oh so funny
*  Vietnamese and he's and he's like interpreting
*  You know wouldn't exist any other place like there's something about the the crazy darkness of the store that helps a guy like that
*  We're putting him a lot in the documentary. So hopefully we get some good. We got a lot of eyes on him
*  I'm really excited about that. I said the way to do a special with him was just to film him for like a month
*  Oh, yeah, let him do all of his sets. We a month. Yeah piece it together
*  We filmed a lot of we let him go for an hour and we got a lot of good material with Holtzman
*  There's a thing where you like it's the end of the night
*  It did your show and then you're leaving the back bar and you gotta go take a leak
*  You go take a leak and then you hear what the fuck did I just say to you?
*  And you're like, oh my god Holtzman's and you walk in there. There's like eight other people you sit down
*  Holtzman embarrassed at the end of the night. It's a staple microphone always in the stand. Oh
*  So funny. He's my god, and he's always
*  He's so danger field very like Rodney when he well his look to is very old-timey
*  I guess from another era tucked in shirt and he behaves like that too like these fucking kids today
*  Yeah, I love it yeah, there's nothing better than late night at the store when you get with Don Barrett's Holtzman used to be Brody
*  you know what I always say about that place that there's I
*  think there's a real argument for
*  Objects collecting energy put on your woo-woo
*  Hold on your crystals cuz we're gonna talk sister
*  I think there's some real power in objects and I think when you're around objects and you
*  You have fun like if you are
*  You're in that room that comic store. That's that room is like a it's like an encasing. It's like a vessel
*  Yeah, and there's an encasing of these moments
*  Like there's something in the walls like there's so many laughs have been had in that room. There's something in the wall
*  Yeah, I remember
*  Psychological you're thinking about it here. I am I'm thinking about you know this is but it's part of it's the seasoning
*  It's like a frying pan you've used a bunch of times. It's like there's seasoning in that place
*  I've never seen that's a perfect way to describe the seasoning
*  I've never seen any ghosts. I'm very skeptical that kind of thing sure skeptical
*  But I'm telling you I would close up that club by myself every night at three or four in the morning
*  and for five years and I
*  Didn't feel great about closing up by myself and I like going up to the belly room and shutting off all the fucking lights
*  Yes, fuck that shit. That's the very outlook. It's like the overlook hotel
*  It's like the shining the the belly room for me is the one that freaks me out and also it's because it's connected to all
*  These corridors yeah this room there and the mirrors
*  There's there yeah, and then over there is the little green room
*  So yeah, it's like a haunted house what's gonna jump out and then over there's a stairway to get downstairs the hallway
*  That fuck and then there's the doorway to the outside exactly slam. Yeah, so many different entrances and exits
*  I feel like I don't know how many people can kill in that building
*  I don't know how many people been killed in that building many
*  But I think they killed a fuck hole in that room upstairs
*  Yeah, I'll bet that room upstairs where they did all the murder that gets me. I'm like, huh?
*  I would think I think they did the murder probably in the basement. No, I guess that makes sense
*  Yeah, that would make sense. I heard that I heard that as well about the basement
*  Yeah, but that move that room gives me the creeps the basement gives me the creeps a little bit, too
*  It used to before they fucking converted it into a podcast studio. No, no, it's more the creeps
*  Argus show down there super creeps
*  Very well about Argus man that guy
*  He always kills right? He's constantly writing new material. It's always it's always solid, dude
*  I fucking good and he's very good and I also like his style with a dark room the spotlight like yeah, we did spots together
*  Which we're I'm usually not in the same time as him like right right before him or after him
*  But we did him back to back once and I was like damn. It's really good material
*  It's tight and it was all a lot of it is like things that are happening right now
*  Like like things that are current in the news and had great bits on them
*  He's great like a really really sharp writer. He's perfect to go up right there second second on the line
*  Yeah, he gets everything pop a tone for them. I just love the fact that he loves it so much
*  Yeah, he fucking he can't get enough of it. He's been doing it forever, but he's five years. They still loves it
*  Yeah, you ever see him jogging
*  Yes, I have super addicted to jog you can't get enough of that either. Yes seven miles a day twice a day
*  I heard yes, that's that's insane. I saw one time outside and a
*  Grocery store. It's like seeing your teacher out of school. It was it was off-putting and he jogs in Hollywood, which is even weird
*  Yeah, you know, I mean he like he's like fuck a gym. I'm just gonna use the road
*  There's something about those people right when you're in your neighborhood and someone just is using your neighborhood like a like a gym
*  Yeah, it's like something weird about that. Shouldn't you go run where people run like why you run when people drive? Yeah
*  But it's the thing that people do man
*  Like in New York City, there's always people that are using the city as their gym
*  Yeah, they're just running like everybody else is walking and these people are exercising
*  You know, it's fucking Argus has a Argus even has a bit about that. Yeah
*  He says you see a guy on a bicycle in LA that guy's working out
*  You see a guy on a bicycle and in Dallas, Texas, he's got DUI
*  It's true it's a pretty good Argus impression too. It's okay. It's not bad
*  Oklahoma oh, there you go
*  Yeah, I've heard some great Argus stories over the years like, you know, just him and all the history with Mitzi and the shores. Yeah
*  I
*  Love Argus. We all love Argus. No, it's a great placement. Argus is a great guy. It's a great place
*  There's so many so many good people there. Yeah, just when
*  When I say July, I think July will we do if this fuck says no, what if he says January 1st?
*  Do we I think we then I think we we all moved off now. We all become Trump fans
*  Just his ass
*  We all fucking shoot up we all shoot up with some fucking Lysol
*  Yeah, and had and walked down to Austin. We don't require much mr. Trump
*  Yeah, and just open the fucking comedy store, please
*  Just do what you got to open comedy clubs up
*  You got our support
*  Why is this such a business?
*  It seems like it's it should be it's certainly more essential than some of the other fucking businesses
*  Think about how much different is the contact the close proximity contact that you get?
*  If you were in a comedy show
*  Versus if you were in line at a store and you're handing a cashier your money and they're giving you money back and you're looking
*  At it. You're touching hands. Yeah, exactly inches away from each other. Yeah, you're face to face
*  The guy with those bagging your shit. He gets these bagging it inches from you. He's putting it in the thing
*  Hands to you. Thank you. You pass by someone here. You pass by someone there as you're leaving
*  You're doing that shit all the time seems pretty simple to me you get you take the forehead temperature. Make sure everybody enforce the masks
*  Separate by tape, you know take out half the fucking tables and call this what's crazy
*  People don't even want you talking about this Adam. I know this is what's weird about it
*  They get mad if you talk about it
*  Come up with solutions if you even have a perspective other than what's we what's going on right now exactly
*  That's not good no, it's not great that's not good
*  We need we know it needs with no one knows what the fuck is the right thing to do here, right?
*  Yeah, look as much as I love Korean baseball. I want to go to work. I want to go back to work exactly fuck this
*  Come on Garcetti
*  Just keep if people want to be quarantine let them be quarantine, but don't make everybody be quarantine. Yeah
*  Everything everybody's worked for in terms of their businesses that's hard
*  And every day that it goes on it gets more and more severe
*  I'm more for safety and health and all that shit, but but I think just like everything else in the world
*  We need balance
*  We need to really think about this and come up with some solutions and not just say no
*  I don't like the narrative particularly in this case because it's not what we thought it was gonna be in terms of the fatality
*  Right. I don't like the narrative that they that you're protecting people
*  That you have to listen to them because it's protecting other people. I don't like that narrative
*  I don't think there's only one way to protect people
*  The way to another way to protect people would be isolate those people
*  And don't pretend that you can't do that because if you can shut down the whole world you can isolate the vulnerable
*  Right you can you you did a monumental thing already the most monumental thing really ever
*  Told people to stop working and they did most of the world stopped working for a couple months. It's pretty crazy wild
*  But then you're saying you can do that, but you can't figure out how to isolate
*  People that are vulnerable. Yeah and give people the opportunity to make their own decisions
*  You let them fucking go dirt bike riding right you let them do backflips with motorcycles
*  People do a lot of wild shit. Nobody has a problem with that
*  Yeah
*  but if you tell them that they can't go out and
*  Possibly get them self-infected because they'll infect somebody else
*  Like educate people educate people and if they do do it anyway that fucking piece of shit
*  They were probably gonna put people in danger in some other way. They're probably drunk drive with their mom. Yeah, you know, it's probably an asshole
*  Like you gotta be you gotta be
*  Cognizant of the vulnerable people for sure, but you also have to give people the opportunity to earn a living
*  You gotta be not be homeless and fucking if they're willing to risk being sick
*  You've got to give them the opportunity to do that
*  I'm gonna give them the education to help them get over that cold to help them keep that virus
*  From getting to them with all the precautions that everybody's using every day sure to make sure that they're as safe as possible
*  Impossible exactly. Yeah, that's it. People don't even like that. You're talking about it. Oh my god
*  They're angry. They're so angry at me personally and specifically. Yeah you right now cuz you already talked about it
*  Yeah, you talked about it with me. You definitely got a secondhand high. So I probably did. Yeah you did. How do you know I?
*  Could tell oh, that's not you got it. Just a touch
*  It's the perfect amount yeah, like if you're an alcoholic and you hang out with people who drink it doesn't do a goddamn thing for no
*  Nothing, but if you're a smoker you decide to take a little time off and you're around people that smoke weed you catch
*  That's why you catch a breeze I
*  Remember I did a show with Tripoli in Toronto they have
*  Liz are people
*  We did the show with that
*  That underground place in Toronto, okay, that's all weed
*  Do you know that about that place is the most preposterous show you've ever done in your life and tripple
*  Is your boxing a fucking hot box?
*  Everybody they had bongs on the table. It was insane. I was I mean
*  I was just looking out at a cloud
*  There was a cloud in front of you you could barely see with the spotlight and then all the smoke in the room
*  You barely saw what was going on and you were so high. There was no air. It was all weed
*  There was no air left like the candles were running on weed smoke. There was no air in the room fuck that
*  It was all just weed smoke. Yeah, well, so Tripoli didn't even smoke anything but ten minutes into his
*  Yeah, you did forgot where he was of course he was on another planet
*  Yeah, that's a problem with Texas they don't let you have the weed oh, oh really in Austin, I think you're just statewide thing
*  What is the is you have to have AIDS
*  They
*  They have some CBD laws, I think yeah, they let you have CBD. Right? I just like was googling earlier. They have some talk of
*  Potentially passing laws for recovery from like lost money
*  legalizing it what I found out of doing my Texas studies because I have been doing research is
*  it's a real like often in particular is a very interesting combination of liberal folks and
*  Conservative folks like conservative tech like red Texas and then blue Austin and then a lot of like blue stuff
*  That's going on and then the governor doesn't want them to do certain things
*  Like so the governor doesn't want them shutting down construction sites, but like the city of Austin is like the blue
*  Yeah, it's like a lot of black sheep. Austin police will stop arrest tickets in most
*  A
*  K most I like that word most low-level marijuana cases after unanimous City Council vote. What does that mean though? Maybe we'll let you go
*  Most we'll let it go most low-level cases most of them most of them. What kind of a law is that?
*  What I mean, how do you have that even open to interpretation most?
*  Yeah, do you let people go if they only have a joint most of the time?
*  sometimes
*  I
*  What does that mean?
*  Most just let go say it's just weed you fucks
*  Jesus I love awesome
*  But the problem is like you don't get a place is like fiercely independent as Texas as like buck wild as Texas without
*  All that other stuff too Austin. It's like the artist colony. Yes
*  But the people that are like right-wing Texas think Austin's gonna fuck it up for everybody
*  The mayor's fucking up yeah, it's interesting
*  It's interesting to see like that's the little battle that's going on because people want to keep it the way it is
*  They don't want it
*  They know it's special and they're worried that the liberals are gonna fuck it up and the liberals are worried that the Trumpers are gonna fuck
*  It up right and it's like Austin sing isn't there saying mono keep Austin weird no
*  That's only losers who sell t-shirts at the airport well
*  That's all I really hang out with when I go to us. It's not just saying out the airport
*  Those keep something weird are the baby on board of t-shirts
*  You know fuck out of here with that
*  so ridiculous
*  Keep Austin weird
*  Shut up. You're not weird has a TM at the bottom of it's the last thing you're giving Austin a bad name
*  No Austin's great the t-shirts no, I'm saying that the keep Austin weird people are
*  So oh we didn't even talk about your cult all right. Yeah, we forgot we have time fuck yeah
*  All right good plenty time right here. I don't even know where to fucking begin so
*  When when did you first become part of the cult so I got sent away to this cult it was like a cult boarding school
*  I was 14. I just turned 14 and did your parents know what was going on or did they think?
*  No, they had no idea. What did they think it was they heard it was for a place for troubled kids to get some help and then
*  Yeah, they had no idea was a cult wow no what was it it was
*  Yeah, it's called see do it's a CEDU
*  And they called it that because you could see yourself how you want to be and then you do something about it
*  That sounds like something that like
*  Tony Robbins would say yeah it used to be I think it was created from originally from something called synonym
*  Which I think is more well known, but it's yeah
*  That sounds like some cheesy not not Tony Robbins, but like a low level like a
*  Less motivational guy yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah exactly
*  Thanks for being here at the Hilton in Alhambra, so this is pre-internet you're 14 years old yeah
*  1993 I
*  Was a cutter I was living in Tarzana. I grew up in Tarzana. Yeah, ooh big cutter
*  Was that about I don't know
*  We friends doing it no no I was doing it
*  I don't I my dad left and then I started cutting I kind of got and then I was getting into fights at school
*  You know was punching holes in my wall. I was an angry kid and so it was sort of an outlet
*  I guess and then they kept sending me up to the Northridge psych ward
*  So I got sent away up to Northridge in the youth psych ward and then they say about you
*  They I don't remember specifically what they said I think they just told my parents they they didn't tell me anything
*  I think they told my parents probably any parents didn't like have a sit down with you and say hey psycho after the third
*  My mom didn't know what to do with me, but after the third time they said after the third time
*  I got sent up to the psych ward they said
*  If you do this one more time you know anything else we're gonna have to send you away somewhere
*  You know more serious probably whoa and so I did it again
*  And then we took a tour up to they said they were we were just gonna go up to take a tour of the school
*  That I could be sent away to that was it they said if you do it one more time
*  We're going up and we're gonna tour this school
*  And if you do this one more time, then we're gonna bring you back here and drop you off
*  You're gonna stay there
*  And so we went up to the San Bernardino Mountains, and we got a we got out of the car
*  I toured the campus. It's a beautiful campus
*  It was like this giant cabin up near Lake Arrowhead, and it used to be owned by the Houston's
*  you know all Walter and Angelica and John Houston and
*  and
*  They were telling me you know
*  Just about the school and stuff and all the rules there were a lot of rules
*  They called them agreements, and then my parents
*  I came back and went and talked to my parents
*  And they told me that uh I was staying there, and I just said well fuck you and then I left and
*  and they strip searched me and then
*  And that was it then I went into what they call a rap and raps are intense so what they the rap was this three hour
*  long
*  Kind of like a group therapy session, but everyone is just sort of oh
*  My god, it was so bizarre so I had only been at the school to two hours
*  I just been strip searched and I put into one of these three hour raps and
*  The the girl next to me was like rocking back and forth on the chair sort of like sobbing quietly
*  And then the kid next to me got up walked across the room and switched seats with someone because you weren't allowed to talk
*  To someone next to you you had to be across the room and that kid started screaming at the kid
*  Right next to me over here, and then this one just started screaming at the floor and like
*  Started like screaming at the floor like I hate you mom
*  I hate you dad and then someone started putting all the like this Kleenex all these tissues to and I'm like
*  Why are they putting all these fucking tissues here?
*  And then you just see all this snot and spit and like mucus empty out of this this girl's body
*  Because she's just screaming and like blood vessels are popping and her fucking and she's crying and screaming
*  And it was the most disgusting thing you've ever seen
*  Fuck and I was like oh my god
*  I'm gonna be here for two and a half years, and this is half. This is gonna happen three times a week
*  There was a lot of sleep deprivation
*  they had
*  What did your parents think it was they thought it they were told by the counselors at the psych ward that it was like a
*  place for
*  Troubled kids when you didn't know what else to do with them, so the site ward was in on it. Yeah
*  Yeah, it's weird and so I think you think they were fooled or do you think that they knew what was going on that maybe they were
*  Fooled I think they were probably fooled. I don't think I don't think this is pre-internet, right?
*  Yeah, this is all people you can't do a wiki on them. Yeah, I mean the
*  Government finally shut them down so they were accredited though or something. Yeah, I think proved by yeah
*  It had been you know around Cedar was there for I think since the 70s I want so maybe even earlier maybe the late 60s
*  That's the scary ones. Yeah ones with legs
*  You know, but it was a really weird mix of students
*  It was like I think Paris Hilton went there at one point and then there was like just a lot of kids there on court orders
*  You know, it's just a real mix weird mix of people
*  But they had these 24-hour what they called profits and they were all named after a different chapter of
*  The book called the prophet by Khalil Gibran, dude. I have to pee so bad
*  We'll go stop you right here cuz I can't I was like I'm gonna hang on to this
*  I'll be fine, but I drank three cups of coffee before I got here
*  Whole please. I'm sorry. We'll be right back folks. Okay. Sorry. We're back
*  Um, you were saying something about the prophet based on the Khalil Gibran. How do you say that Khalil?
*  Gibran, yeah
*  They they have these things called profit so you you come you go through the program with a peer group
*  So everybody that was enrolled at the same time as you in the same like two months
*  You go through these almost like these rites of passages called profits and there were these 24 hour long workshops
*  And they're all based around each chapter of this book called the prophet
*  And the first one was called the truth and it was like the truth will set you free so you
*  Basically tell everything you've ever done that you felt bad about
*  And it's like confession almost
*  Hmm, and what was odd is that all the staff members?
*  Were there were a lot of there were like two or three staff members who were the counselors at the school?
*  They had no real credentials. They weren't like therapists, but they acted as therapists
*  But they all had fucked up lives too and so and some of them
*  Yeah
*  and so some of them like there were people that really got off on the power like any cult leaders do and then there were some
*  That were former students there that were sent away for being bad kids. So there were staff members like
*  confessing to
*  Heard one guy said he claimed that he set a homeless guy on fire
*  Another one would strangle cats
*  And they're like these are the fucking people that are
*  No, you couldn't fall asleep in the in the profeets
*  Yeah, it was pretty wild they all have that element in them that's a Scientology element too, right and then also Catholicism
*  You have to confess right?
*  That's there's a thing that Scientology does where they they go over all sorts of aspects of your life
*  Mmm, and they they like save that yeah
*  I say all those recordings and then when you want to talk shit they're like, oh, well you think about leaving
*  Fascinating yeah, we're gonna tell everybody about that thing that you do with clowns
*  I wonder why they would do it here then because we had no power to look we're all underage
*  We they you know, well, that's different different organization. Yeah, you know what they're doing is probably
*  getting power over you I
*  Mean it seems like that's what those things are always about
*  They're always about power and then it's usually the main dudes banging everybody's wife
*  The teachers there were teachers that were for sure banging the students there's no doubt about it is if some look if a guy
*  Can lie about what he does for a living right and get laid they'll do it
*  Oh, yeah
*  There's a certain percentage of guys that will do it if they can lie and control people they'll do that too
*  Like it's just different levels of douchebaggery, right? You get to that
*  Yeah, right, okay, it's like level there's levels of where people can
*  you know, they could control people in the strangest ways and get people like the
*  Hailbop comet people. Oh, yeah, exactly. They cut their balls off. That was a big part of it
*  Like I releasing your don't remember that part of the fucking story. Yeah, holy shit
*  Yeah
*  the main guy cut his balls off and he
*  Encouraged others to cut their balls off as well to free themselves from the confines of sexual lust walk
*  Yeah, yeah, you had it. He remember that guy remember? I remember exactly what he looked like. He almost looked like mr. Magoo
*  Without the glass
*  You don't have to have a good
*  Hustle to start a cult like that's not a good hustle
*  That's a terrible hustle, but you need to have a hustle that works good on dumb people, right?
*  And that's the difference just like the guy when Frank Santos used to do his hypnotism acts of stitches
*  There was a guy that would come in his pants every hour, you know, he wouldn't he would do different things different times
*  He'd make things up. He had a bunch of different things he would do but I remember one of them
*  He's like this was a Madonna was hot. Oh sure this he was telling this guy that he's having sex with Madonna
*  It might have been Janet Jackson someone like that. So I'm very popular time
*  Some hot and popular and then he's like you're gonna oh my goodness, you're gonna pop and the kids like oh the kid comes
*  And you're like, I don't believe this we're all looking at each other and Greg was like for sure he came
*  I'm like for sure that guy just came
*  The guy came and you like looks all embarrassed he's like looking around confused. He's not a good actor. He's just a moron
*  There's certain things that some guys can do to really dumb people where they can sink into their brain, but
*  Stand up is similar to that but not not not really it's similar to hypnosis
*  That kind of hypnosis is weird hypnosis. It only works on really moronic people very susceptible. Yeah, this vulnerable people man
*  Maybe it might not even be dumb it might be just you got programmed poorly
*  Look, I know a lady who's Mormon her whole life's Mormon and one of things she said that was kind of shocking
*  She was like I'm more because she left that religion and she's like but I'm very susceptible
*  To bullshit like I'm very susceptible to like gurus and cults
*  it's like there's a part when you develop your whole life 35 45 years of
*  Thinking a certain way and then all sudden it's shut off and you're like, okay that all that stuff you believe that was all bullshit
*  So don't go there anymore now. Good luck
*  Who's got the answer?
*  Those are the ones and right for the picking so it might not even be dumb
*  It's a more lost there need they need some direction. They need yeah something
*  Something program probably yeah. Well, I would wasn't I I don't think there is there's Frank Sano
*  This is when he this is the comedy connection. This is when they moved to a stitches
*  This is the larger room that was in Faneuil Hall. He did a little bit a little bit. See you got any volume on this?
*  He's making them all think they just watch a sad movie in this clip. Yes, either all crime
*  These people are all freaking out
*  These people are all freaking out
*  Did you had to see in real life this is not doing the justice like the guy who was there was certain people that would
*  Faking it or you can tell when you're faking it. It would walk up to you. Come on, man
*  You know, yeah, get out of here and he kicked those guys out loves there was other guys that just hook line and sinker
*  Yeah, they believe they want it. Yeah, they believe they're having sex with a mermaid or something
*  They believe they were in a sword fight. It's just that's so fascinating
*  Yeah, it is and that's who gets caught to the Hale-Bopp comment gets their balls cut off balls. Yeah
*  Either way, it's pretty intense. It's an intense commitment to your fake God
*  Well, I went along with it because I didn't want to extend my sentence
*  If you got in trouble and you didn't play along and you didn't follow the rules and you had six months to your sentence
*  So you drop a peer group?
*  Going in that it was a cult when I think you figured it out until I was like until like a fucking two years after I
*  had graduated
*  So two years after it's all over you sit around going hey
*  I think I started talking something like didn't you think that was a little weird when they did this or this or that or and I
*  Should mention it
*  Yeah, we had to do a
*  14 days through Joshua tree, which was beautiful, which was great
*  But then a four day solo
*  Where they give you like a bag of trail mix and some water and a whistle and they say all right
*  We'll come back in four days. But as a 14 year old, it's like what the fuck what the fuck? Yeah, it was intense
*  But the worst where was this where the woods in Joshua tree? That's a fucking sketchy area
*  Yeah, 14 years in the desert. Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah, where we supposed to get your water
*  They had a big bag of water that was in a bag of water for four days for four days
*  How big is this bag? I?
*  Don't know you have your own bag. Yeah. Yeah, you were alone
*  They give you an area about half the size of this room the studio and they say alright
*  We'll come get you in four days
*  Four
*  Bag of trail mix and a bag of water and a whistle in case you get bit by a rattlesnake
*  And then where are they with this is happening?
*  No, they said they were they were around and they monitor they I think they monitor you so they probably saw a lot of beating off
*  14 years old
*  If I was a 14 year old and I came up with a cult that would be one of the rules
*  What was the rule no beating off no no I feel like you're gonna all be by yourself for four days
*  Four granola bars in a bag of water like it sounds like something a 14 year old come up with
*  Sounds like an episode of fucking fear fact and here's a whistle if you get bit by a rattler
*  I'll be over the top of the hill you won't see me
*  I'll never forget to when we came out they told us a Kurt Cobain had just killed himself
*  It was so as 94
*  But I remember if you get in trouble they put you on something called a full-time
*  and that was never fun because it was like
*  You had no it was the amount of time of the full time was in the turn
*  So it was based on the staff member it was either you ran away or you had sex with another student
*  Not me in between snotty screams
*  A lot of primal screen therapy
*  But but on a full-time like you wake up and you have to like try and dig out a stump
*  That's been there since the 70s. No one was ever gonna fucking take it out the biggest stump you've ever fucking seen
*  I remember when I got enrolled the first thing I saw was a kid and a pickaxe and I'm like what the fuck
*  That's why they have dynamite. Yeah
*  They used it for full times, but you're not allowed to laugh or sing or no human contact
*  You can't talk to anybody for three weeks. Oh my god. They're mine. Yeah, they mind fucked you
*  There was something called smushing where everybody it was like you walk into this giant house at the every night
*  And everyone is telling each other their life stories
*  But it looked like you remember Jonestown when like the 909 people had just drank the Kool-Aid
*  Yeah, it was just body on top of body. That's what it looked like. Everyone's just cuddling with each other
*  It's like all the staff members are fucking rubbing hair
*  You're like this seems highly inappropriate with like girls 13 year old girls head in their lap
*  Yeah, it was fucking it was trippy
*  But yeah, I've my buddy our buddy Jeff Garland put me in touch with this fantastic writer
*  Who writes a lot of episodes of Better Call Saul and we're almost done with our pilot. We're gonna
*  Pitch it in about a month. I feel like
*  That's one that's gonna be
*  Fascinating to see how they play that narrative out like whether they will show that kind of shit like a 13 year old girl
*  And a guy's lap like that seems like you can't even do that. We'll say you can't even do that in fiction
*  You know, I mean you'd have to imply it
*  That's a good point. Well, you know
*  Closed the problem is it really happened right so it's not like it's fiction
*  So if you were creating this kind of fiction, you're putting it out people be like what you sick fuck
*  Why did you think of that? But you're not doing that. That's true
*  Yeah, you're relaying some crazy shit that you actually experienced and how many years are there for almost three?
*  Yeah, some of the exercises were crazy. They did this one called lifeboat where they choose two students
*  I was one of the students they chose
*  And you're on a chair and you can only save two people and all your best friends and shit are sobbing and they're like
*  And you have to look each person in the eye and tell them why they they die
*  What the fuck and then they and then everyone had to write their own eulogy
*  Fucking weird a girl slid her own throat. Oh, yeah
*  And another kid jumped off a cliff see this is where I'm with the FBI
*  I get it. I know why you have to investigate these people
*  I understand why you're so wary of people starting cults because I was saying this to my friend
*  I'm like, how come no one has ever started a good cult, you know
*  Bridgett Feticey and I were talking about this the other day
*  I said we should just call it the cult like, you know in homage to the band. What about the squad?
*  But it's not a cult
*  I'm saying a real cult like no one can start a good one like right like a real solid one with like good morals
*  They're all
*  But I think you're on to something
*  Forced to jump in because it's almost like a thing that's 99% done by assholes
*  1% looking for that needle in a haystack. I'm looking for that piece of gold and the pile of shit
*  I know it's in there one of those cults is someone who really just has good intentions
*  Do you know where Alex Gray is? Oh, yes. I love fucking Alex
*  Psychedelic he might be one he is
*  Absolutely, right. He's the real deal because he actually started a religion and the religion is based on art
*  It's not based on prophet and he's building the most insane beautiful artistic
*  Structure like I love this shit the thing that they're building to do their worship in I mean
*  I don't what you call it a cathedrals. You call a cathedral. What does he call it?
*  Chapel chapel of sacred marriage, right? Isn't that what he calls it? I heard about this fucking no
*  That's I think that's what he called the place in New York. I think he calls this something different
*  This but you've seen it right? Have you seen the images? I've seen I have I have a couple of I have one art book
*  I think it's in there. Maybe no, I don't think so. It's new but it's some of the images
*  From that from his heart in the in the cathedral. The whole thing is like this gigantic work of art
*  I don't know if they're 3d printing the outside or
*  Cosm is
*  That's right place that's right making and the on is the place up in upstate New York
*  I think Duncan said he was there he belongs there. He's gonna move there that makes sense
*  Yeah, he's totally Duncan. Good. Good. Fuck. It's okay. We'll be a
*  Stunning dude, it's dope. It's basically his art, but his art in a building
*  Like he made a building out of his art. It's cool. Where it seems like it would be in like Sedona or something
*  Yeah, and they're like good taxpayers and shit they like and it's a real religion
*  So I think they have actually they're not good taxpayers. They have tax exempt status. I think that's the whole deal
*  Oh shit. Yeah, I think that's what I'm saying. I think they're a real religion. Yeah, there it is
*  He's a guy that I believe. Yeah, he seems like a good dude. Oh, he's not trying to know
*  Take everybody's money and bang everybody's wife. Yeah, he's really just this guy
*  He's a really sweetheart guy and an amazing people like that, you know him and Ronda's yeah
*  Yeah, Ronda's is a great example. Yeah, there's people that really do exist or did yes, they really are pure
*  This is really what they want to do. Yeah, that's true. I don't know if this guy started out that way. Who knows
*  Yeah
*  Most of them get to that spot and they just you know, it's like
*  When when they get into it in the first place are they doing it because they've it's been done to them like some of them
*  Clearly right some of them seems like they were a
*  Members for sure. That's why I know the one who likes set the homeless guy on fire. I know that for sure
*  That's why he did it. He got put through this bullshit. He was gonna inflict it on somebody else. Yeah
*  garbage garbage people and
*  Then the craziest thing was maybe about seven or eight years after I graduated a lot of kids would split I split
*  You run away
*  But then you get caught or you walk or you come back to the school once you find out your parents aren't gonna take you
*  out but a lot of kids never came back and we just
*  That's it. That was just the fact to the kids. We don't know what the fuck happened to them
*  They would always tell us that the parents pulled them out of the school
*  That's some of the kids that ran away and never came back
*  Oh
*  but it was on the side of this giant like almost like a cliff this backside of a mountain and
*  some kids would walk down into town through the road and some kids they said would run away and
*  Go down the backside of the mountain and they said some kids died going down the backside
*  some kids got kidnapped who fucking knows but
*  I found out about seven or eight years after the club was closed
*  They found out that there was actually a serial killer that was working at the school. He was like
*  like the night janitor kind of guy and confessed to murdering like a handful of kids that we thought ran away and
*  He got caught for something else and then confessed to all these murders
*  He had committed over the last decade and and four of them were kids while he was working up at the campus
*  Holy crazy
*  That was while I was there, yeah
*  Bonkers fuck pretty wild. So it took you a few years
*  Was it a relationship that you were in where a girl was explaining to you?
*  No, it was while I was talking to a former students. Oh
*  Started opening my eyes and I was like, oh, yeah
*  So wasn't talking to someone who wasn't in it, right? It was talking to someone who wasn't together
*  You were like going hey, I've talked to some other people and exactly that's not what 14 year olds do right?
*  Fuck man, and then when Facebook it was even longer than that because I think then when Facebook came out
*  Then it was like there were all these groups and everyone's like the yeah, we were in a cult
*  There was a lot of them I think in the 60s in the 70s
*  Yeah
*  I think there was a lot of them where there was a lot of people that were experimenting with different lifestyles
*  They're experimenting with drugs and then there was a lot of people whenever you do drugs around people there's always people that have answers
*  Right
*  Annoying people that have answers. I'm one of those people. Well, it's like Charles Manson. That's what I got, right?
*  He gave everybody acid sure new true crime podcast the lost kids exposes the twisted troubled teen industry
*  Oh, oh, wow. Wow
*  Schools
*  The new podcast investigates missing teen Daniel you win I think what I say that you think you you win
*  When when yeah, maybe when when?
*  Sorry, sorry Daniel in the controversial see do schools
*  Interesting episodes. Wow. Wow fascinating. I'll definitely be checking that out
*  Yeah, man, there was a whole time where people were you know
*  regularly getting together groups of people and
*  Getting them to do things and telling them things and telling them, you know
*  I got to drink the Kool-Aid and telling them you got to come with me
*  We got to kill that pregnant lady and write pig on the wall
*  I call that shit came out of cults all of it, you know
*  And the Manson one fit Simmons turned me on to this guy that wrote this guy that wrote the book. Yes
*  Yeah, dude. Did you you heard of it?
*  Um, I I've heard all about this guy's name Tom O'Neill and his book is called
*  Chaos
*  Says chaos. Oh that for sure
*  Manson and the CIA's mind control
*  In the CIA and the secret history of the 60s. Yeah, we wanted norm wanted to interview him on our podcast so many things
*  It's he's amazing. You should have a month cuz he lived it for 20 fucking years
*  So he can talk to you about it in a depth and with a with a
*  Without even looking at notes man. He knows everything about the Manson case. It was his his life for 20 fucking years, dude
*  It's crazy. Yeah, that's your books amazing. It was all the CIA was giving the mass it
*  Manson they kept releasing from jail. He kept violating parole. They'd let him go. They let him go. They knew he was doing crazy shit
*  Let him go. Let him go. They wanted him to get these hippies to do fucked up things because it would disgrace the anti-war
*  Get people to be against hippies, right? So he literally like let
*  Charles Manson have carte blanche and they think even experimented on him with acid while he was in jail
*  That's why I get and then we was out of jail
*  There was a fucking clinic a free clinic in Haydn Ashbury that operated until Tom's book came out
*  It had been an operation for 30 or 40 fucking years Tom no more
*  50 years from the 60s Tom's book comes out and they close it they close down
*  This free clinic a couple of months after his book comes out
*  showing that that free clinic was being used in the 1960s by the CIA to dose up hippies and
*  Follow them around to do studies on them and then dose up John's in whorehouses
*  They set up fake whorehouses with two-way mirrors and let these guys take acid
*  They were getting a drink and they're gonna have sex with the prostitute and they would pour acid into their mouth and follow them and fucking
*  Run studies on them
*  All that was real it's called operation midnight climax a real thing
*  Bro, this Tom O'Neill book blows the lid off of it. You're like, this is insane. It's insane
*  That's why Fitz Timmon's told me about it Fitzsimmons doesn't recommend anybody but he just goes you have to get this guy on your podcast
*  He goes it's right up your alley and it's fucking crazy and when you you hear the whole story like oh my god, of course
*  Like holy shit, of course
*  That's fucking of course bonkers. They fucking expect. Here's the thing. I was gonna talk about
*  I watched over this past weekend the entire Netflix special on the Unabomber
*  there's a four-part special on the Unabomber and
*  It mentions a lot of fucked up things about the Unabomber that I don't want to spoil alert anybody
*  But one thing it kind of leaves out was that he was a part and pretty sure this has been documented of the CIA
*  LSD Harvard drug studies really? Yeah. Yeah that he was he was a part of some sort of psychological study in
*  Harvard for three years, by the way, he was he graduated from school early. So he was at Harvard when he was 17 17 year old kid
*  They're putting him through this
*  psychological study where they humiliate you and
*  Break down your ideas and call you a fool and there's recordings of it of of him talking to an adult
*  17 year old kid talking to an adult who's just openly mocking him and his ideas and shitting on him and they think they gave
*  These kids the fucking Unabomber they think they gave these kids acid to Wow
*  And they think they made any one of the things he said it was purpose because they were they're being sadistic
*  They're being sadistic. There was it was just like a cult you give people too much power
*  They do whatever the fuck they want in this case. He gave people too much power and said, you know what?
*  Let's find out what acid does do to people
*  Let's find out what happens when you humiliate a kid and break them down and give them acid
*  Let's try and so they would just ruin people's lives and they did it to a ton of people man. That's so
*  Dude, they just experiment they didn't know what acid really was
*  There wasn't weren't exactly sure what it would do or what it could do
*  They thought it was gonna be a true serum then it turns out it's not that like what is it?
*  So they do all kinds of experiments with people and the best way to do them initially was get volunteers
*  But after the volunteers were fucking going crazy and losing their marbles and and like staring in the corner like Blair Witch project
*  Notting back and forth they ran out of volunteers
*  So then they started using prisoners and they started using students
*  They started using a bunch of different people using people that weren't gonna say anything about it like John's at a brothel
*  Yeah, bro
*  It's bonkers. So what was crazy is they didn't mention none of that in the Kaczynski Netflix thing
*  And I thought that was fascinating because there was another
*  Documentary called the net I believe it was a German documentary
*  It's in subtitles and it was explaining that as well, but it was going into depth more about the
*  LSD studies that they did on them people were just starting to understand like there was there really was a time
*  Where they were experimenting on people that that's a real thing. I mean it was going on for a while
*  They were taking people and running experiments on innocent people. That's this is a part of our history
*  50 years ago
*  The only studies I've seen is like the famous videos like when they give it to like a housewife
*  There's all this stuff called MK ultra and MK ultra was a real project where they were really
*  Experimenting on people to find out what would happen to them
*  This is also look there's there's people that are experts on how to extract information out of people
*  You know, there's people that are excellent. How do you think they get to be those experts?
*  What do they do? Well, they experiment. What are they? What are they experimenting on? Probably prisoners. They probably do with prisoners
*  That's what they did with Charles Manson
*  They experimented on him with acid and they taught him how to manipulate others with acid how to use acid to break down
*  Societal norms and break down all the structure they had in terms of what was okay and not okay in
*  Relationships and their relationship to society how society was fucking them over
*  He would force them to have orgies and go you're gonna have sex with her and he's gonna have sex with him and put
*  Everybody together and they all do gays straight all acid all fucked up and literally he would pretend to take acid and then like guide
*  Them right and guide their thoughts and program them and he did it every night and and everybody was like well
*  Where'd he get the acid? Where's he getting all that acid? He's getting it from the fucking government Wow
*  Dude, that's fucking do anchors dude, dude
*  I got to read this and he was emboldened first of all
*  He was a fucking psychopath from with a terrible childhood
*  Right his childhood was just just he was just destroyed by the time
*  He was a grown man lived half of his life in federal institutions
*  Half of his life from the time he got out before helter-skelter half his life. He had been in federal prison Jesus crazy
*  Let's say he spent almost his entire life in prison. He was and most likely
*  He's they're pretty sure they were involved in acid studies during that time at least towards the end before they release
*  So they release him and he's been in jail a ton of times for everything fucking stealing cars all kinds of shit
*  Right and they release him and he just getting away with things like when he does things like they think he murdered a guy
*  They think a murder to guy at the ranch the guy disappeared and he confessed to it later
*  Just never found that guy and then he talks these kids into killing people
*  Talks these kids and stabbing people and robbing people and bro
*  I mean, it's it's and he keeps getting out they arrest him for stuff and they keep letting him go and
*  No one could understand it dude. It's nuts
*  It's when you when you read the book. I listen to the audiobook
*  Hardly ever read anymore, but when you when you listen to the story, it's at the end of it
*  You're like, whoa. Well that makes sense
*  That's what they were probably doing back then
*  They probably did stuff like that back then and he connects it to sir Hans or hon. Yeah the guy
*  Okay, sure Kennedy. Yeah, he connects it to Jack Ruby the guy who shot Lee Harvey Oswald
*  Yeah, Jack Ruby after this one doctor this dr. Jolly this famous LSD doctor from
*  Went to visit Lee Harvey Oswald
*  Excuse me went to visit Jack Ruby after he shot Lee Harvey Oswald when he leaves Jack Ruby's crawling off the ceiling
*  Screaming and yelling he's delusional demented
*  He thinks that there's a new Holocaust happening right now and they're lighting Jewish babies on fire in the street
*  He loses his mind completely loses his mind after this guy visits him after this LSD doctor who worked with Manson
*  Dude
*  It's the craziest book need that
*  Chaos chaos, I think back in the 50s and 60s. They just tried things
*  He just tried things they're like, let's let's see what happens when we do this. Did you see anything about
*  Anything about the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski and LSD experiments at Harvard there he
*  He
*  Digging through there's a book that came out called
*  Harvard the Harvard and the Unabomber
*  Digging through here
*  It doesn't specifically say that those tests had LSD in them
*  But they were psychological tests that happened at Harvard to undergraduate students in the late 60s
*  Or maybe even yeah, they brush it over it right in the documentary the Netflix thing about how they would use drugs on
*  Patients, but they didn't they were talking about a variety of methods and they sort of glossed over the fact and drugs
*  But LSD was a critical part of that because if they dosed him up all the time
*  They could just rewire him right like you could rewire someone's brain
*  Yeah, you're just starting from scratch kind of but the book will blow your mind
*  It already has and as it gets further along it builds I mean it's a masterpiece the guy did it over 20 years
*  He literally gave up his life
*  Searching this thing and then gave birth this 20 year old baby
*  It's amazing. I can't wait to see this fucking baby
*  But I think like when I'm watching the Unabomber thing and I'm thinking how many people like that aren't so murderous but
*  Lost their fucking mind. Yeah, exactly because of some crazy experiments. Oh because of someone doing something back in the 60s
*  But it's how is that different than a cult I mean it's different in that I
*  Guess it's different in that they're not taking you to a place and making you be but but but it's not in terms of
*  One person with an extraordinary amount of power is using and abusing that power in a way that no one would ever consent to and they
*  Don't understand it. Mm-hmm. They don't understand that they can't understand it
*  Yeah, cuz you know in your case when you're 14 you're a fucking little kid
*  In this case when you're on acid like they're doctoring your neurochemistry
*  They're changing the way your fucking brain interfaces with reality and then programming you talking to you
*  Anybody who doesn't think that that is insane that that and when you find out that that actually went on like whoa
*  Has anybody been held accountable for that? Like?
*  What happened there people still deny it to this day apparently but
*  There's been some Freedom of Information Act
*  Documents and some other documents they found that were in CIA storage that confirmed the existence of this program and some of the things that
*  They were trying to do
*  That's so fucking fascinating and they shut it all down once this one guy who was running it died. They're like that's it
*  Wrap it up. We're out you imagine coming on board
*  The CIA like a year later not having any idea and everybody's mad like what I'm here to I'm looking for terrorists
*  Fuck you talking about acid and hookers
*  Who was doing what sign it up?
*  There's no documentation of that like readily available to new recruits
*  You know, they don't tell you you know, you sign up for the CIA
*  You think you're a good guy is here to save the world from bad people, right?
*  And meanwhile you're coming in right on the heels of the regime that was literally operating whorehouses with two-way mirrors
*  dosing plumbers up with acid
*  Fucking poor guys
*  You imagine just going to have some sex pay someone to touch your body
*  They give you acid they build cosby you with some fucking acid and then study you and that's the government and your taxes are
*  All paying for that
*  whoa
*  That's called shit, but that's like that's what people do man
*  if they have that kind of power if you get give people just
*  first of all also if you give people that are in the position of like any government agency or
*  Police officer that's seen a lot of violence. They've seen a lot of crazy shit
*  They seem like the worst side of people and then you give them this like super secret
*  Power where no one could know what they're doing and they could literally ghost people that can make people vanish
*  You just shoot somebody in the head and throw them in the ocean. No one's gonna say anything. Everybody's on your side
*  You're one of the good guys
*  That people would just do stuff like that. Yeah for sure. They need to be held accountable
*  Definitely, that's what the rules are for the rules are for to keep people from being people. Yeah accountability is very important
*  Yeah, you got a key people giving into the the primal people nature
*  Like that primal people nature seems like that's what those cults are man. It's like
*  There's a combination of stupid uninformed
*  Narcissism and that weird primal nature to tell people what to do
*  Yeah, and you bang it all together with some delusional person with some good
*  Vocabulary and some wild stories of what's waiting for them after the hellbop comment passes overhead and you cut your balls off
*  It's fucked up yeah, it's all fucked up
*  How did it affect you once you got out and you realize you were out and you talked to all the other people that were?
*  Out too and you all realize that you were out. How did it affect the what did you have to like?
*  remap
*  Those years in your head. Did you have to kind of think about?
*  What life is really like it was it was interesting because I got out when I was 16
*  So I had to go out as soon as I got out. I had two more years of high school
*  So I got thrown at down the street at Taft. I went to Taft High School Wow and Woodland Hills and then
*  Yeah, did a couple more years there, but it was it was tough to get reacclimated
*  And then yeah, I didn't know I had to retrain my brain like I felt like I I knew
*  It was almost like I knew what they were trying to do
*  I almost felt like I was being brainwashed and we were taught to self-police each other and and I
*  North Korea style
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, otherwise, you know
*  They would put you on a full-time and you'd have to fucking dig out a stump for so when you say we were forced to self-police
*  Each other we you so forced to self-police yourself or other guys ourselves and others. Okay, so yeah
*  Okay
*  Yeah, you'd have to write a dirt list every week which is basically every rule
*  Here's another way the government's fucking kind of culty. They were doing that in LA
*  They were asking people to find people who weren't social distancing
*  Yeah
*  And report them and then and then report businesses that were operating during quarantine you get a reward call this hotline
*  Call this number be a rat be a bitch. Yeah be a bitch
*  Should be a number if you
*  But when they call those numbers they should have your phone number and then when you go to vote they should go oh look
*  Turns out you're a bitch
*  You did stupid this guy was barbecuing his backyard without a mask on you called the fucking feds
*  you creeps
*  People are so crazy
*  They're so absolute and so angry. Yeah, that's insane
*  Yeah, I don't know man and then
*  So how do you out?
*  Yeah, how do you recover how do you let go hey, this is all bullshit
*  I think it took some time and took it took years, but I was one of the lucky ones
*  I was like, you know what I did it. I took I took the positives. I was like, you know what?
*  It wasn't all bad. I learned some tools and if I didn't go through that
*  I wouldn't be the person I am today and I'm not the you know, I'm not the worst fucking guy in the world. So I
*  Made it out. I survived fuck it, right? I'm not gonna there were a lot of people that wouldn't let go
*  They would just hold on and to this very day
*  They hold on so tight to this bitterness and this anger and they they can't sleep at night
*  And all they think about is what they went through. They lost three years of their life. I do hate that
*  I do bummed out that I missed out those three years of
*  Yeah, that's true come on man, that's true that's earned
*  Character exactly. That's like, you know, we're talking about with Joey Diaz like you earned this
*  I totally I not only do I not regret it
*  There's many many many days more days than not that I wish I could go back and do it all over again
*  I swear to God why I don't know cuz I still know that it was there was there was a camaraderie there was
*  it was like
*  There was something about it
*  I I didn't have to I had all that other bullshit to worry about but I didn't have to worry about a roof over
*  My head job, you know all the other bullshit that you have to worry about
*  Yeah, you get institutionalized exactly. Yeah, I heard stories
*  About people even in the Holocaust
*  Because you know what they and you know what the reason I think it's a very small percentage of people that
*  Would have wanted to go back to that but they said it's because they felt alive
*  A lot of people said that about war in general
*  During war they feel like the stakes are so high and everything's turned up to 11, you know
*  I think that's what we're talking about when we're talking about the
*  Pandemic the early days of the pandemic. I felt like this is gonna be good for people
*  It's gonna be a little bit of a lesson, but I'm much more cynical now
*  Yes, because now I see that this is everyone's gonna survive but they're gonna be broke and they're gonna be I mean
*  It's gonna harden people's differences instead of force people to
*  Abandon a lot of the foolish stuff and concentrate on what's important keeping our loved ones and our family alive
*  Keeping each other alive and doing the right thing and protecting ourselves from this
*  Invasion of demons invisible demons that can kill your grandpa. Yeah, but then when we realized it wasn't that
*  Then everybody sort of settled into this boredom
*  Everybody settled into like watching TV all day and eating too much and then the shit talking on Twitter got to the point where
*  I'm like, I don't even want to read you guys anymore
*  This is everyone so angry there's so much anger and
*  Until things bounce back to a steady place. I don't think that's gonna resolve itself. Well, it's a very divisive issue
*  You know, but I do hope that some of us the wise amongst us
*  Some of us that are that like to think about things are gonna look at this and go
*  Maybe my priorities were out of whack. Yeah, maybe I was working too much
*  Maybe I should have just tried to enjoy life and had more adventures and just
*  Appreciated people and just more dinners with wine, you know
*  you're laughing and hugging each other and just more having fun because there's so much of
*  So much of life is really horseshit. Yeah, really like it's it's hard to
*  It's hard to recognize it when it's right in front of you and it's it demands your attention
*  But it's not the same thing as losing your life and when that virus came along like post 9-eleven everybody kind of
*  Became nicer for a little bit. Yep. I'm hoping that more of us than not will be able to recapture that
*  I hope so just just hold on to what is
*  Actually important and I hope that's sooner rather than later
*  I also hope that people have been thinking about doing something but they've been held back by this idea that you're gonna play it safe
*  You realize there's no safe. Yeah, so good. So write that book start stand up make that album
*  Fucking start sculpting whatever the fuck you're thinking about doing man. Just go and do it go and do it get out there, man
*  I want to kidnap a bunch of people and give them acid. I
*  Think that's been done
*  Shit um, when are you gonna do your thing with norm again? You're gonna
*  We've been planning for a while now
*  so now we're just going to
*  We just need to put all the nuts and bolts into place and then get a studio get a camera
*  And and just do it, but you're gonna be the first guest. I'm in all right good
*  So just tell me when so I can I could plan ahead we're shooting the first one in the fall. So
*  You're gonna plan it out. You're gonna map it out in advance. Nice. I can't wait and we're still yeah, you know
*  I mean, I'd listen I love normed pieces
*  Human beings that have ever lived I have a great story about norm me and him on a plane and
*  Randomly, this is crazy. But true randomly twice. I sat next to him on planes just random. Oh, wow. Yeah, totally randomly
*  Like what's up norm? What's up norm like crazy? This is happening again and both times
*  It was a blast but one time we're we're flying back and he's like, yeah, I used to smoke
*  How to give it up. It's fucking terrible for you, but sometimes I miss it, but glad I quit
*  I'm like a hell. Well, you know, how long has it been? He's telling me all these months. He stopped smoking this now
*  We're talking as soon as he land
*  He walks right into the fucking store buys a carton of cigarettes and he's opening this cigarette
*  He's alighting it before he gets out the door and I go what are you doing?
*  He was all that talk about smoke and I had a half one
