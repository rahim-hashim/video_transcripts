*  I told you about the hey, we're up. We're up. We're up. We're up [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=0.0s)]
*  It's not a good sign that the fights are still going on for the prelims [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4.12s)]
*  That must mean there's a lot of decisions a lot of pretty loose a lot of prelims [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8.68s)]
*  But also a lot of decisions like usually they time it out better because it's like 304 now [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12.52s)]
*  And this is 137 to go in the third round of Jai Herbert not ideal now, but you know [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=16.72s)]
*  Shit happens should at least they're not doing it at 5 o'clock in the morning true. That was that was fucking ridiculous [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=23.82s)]

*  Are they six hours ahead or seven hours? I thought it was seven something like that [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  But either way it's nighttime there [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=44.8s)]
*  So have you seen any of those guys yeah, Jai Herbert's the guy that head kicked Ilya to poria he dropped him out [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=48.0s)]
*  He dropped no he dropped the vicious head game and Ilya fucking starched him in the next round. He has great striking [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=53.68s)]
*  Yeah, very very good kicks big prospect real tall long lanky, dude [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=60.04s)]
*  But you know Ilya that guy he connects on anybody they're going night night [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=64.64s)]
*  Oh Joe you if you knew I know you can't probably talk about it, but do you see Ilya's tweet? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=68.16s)]
*  Where's like I'm gonna have big news you guys aren't expecting it. Yeah, I don't know the news you have no clue [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=73.04s)]
*  No, I don't know if I had a guess he's probably fighting a top contender at 55 [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=77.72s)]
*  I don't think but that wouldn't be on expect you know I'm saying he's like you won't see this coming [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  It's not Mark chef because we all assume that much is not finding much just going to 70 [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=86.17999999999999s)]
*  Billy walk around at 186 he's big Connor [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=91.89999999999999s)]
*  That's crazy Connor had to have to be in the testing pool for a long time [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=96.46s)]
*  Isn't he doing bear knuckle Connor? Well, he's running bear knuckle. He's like one of the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=100.94s)]
*  Fucking a fire. No, he may get on for the fucking margin powder [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=106.69999999999999s)]
*  And I was a fucking dude [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=112.1s)]
*  He's also running for fucking fight bad knuckle he might he might I mean I could see him [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=113.9s)]
*  I would blow bear knuckle right. Oh, yeah, I mean they'd have to pay [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=119.4s)]
*  Him first Jeremy Stevens, oh my goodness Jeremy would have to win a couple more times, but Jeremy's back in the UFC [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=125.5s)]
*  No, no Jeremy's undefeated and Bellamata doors been my always changes his nickname [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=131.24s)]
*  But let's get a new identity when we announce it you won't believe it get ready [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=135.3s)]
*  See when you say you won't believe it you got to come with some shit now. Yeah, you got it [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=138.82s)]
*  But that was a while ago. That's March 6th, you know, what is today? There's 22nd, but that's the UFC being like don't announce it yet [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=142.74s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. You know, I don't know like if I a [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=148.42000000000002s)]
*  Perfect matchup is Gagey. I think Charles Olivera. Oh, that's a that's a motherfucker. That's a great matchup [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=153.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great and now remember he tweeted that before Gagey's fight. I don't think it's [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=159.58s)]
*  Horrible place to oh boy, but this is the last round. I think the fight the fights over might be over. Yeah [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=167.70000000000002s)]
*  Yeah [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=172.34s)]
*  Dustin Poirier [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=175.46s)]
*  No, Dustin's fighting Max. He is I think so for the BMF shit really I think double check that's a great fight [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=177.1s)]
*  Do I'm crazy the third go around? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=184.52s)]
*  At 55 and it's max proper. See I think max should fight more at 55. I don't like [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=187.5s)]
*  45 I think it's too much of a stroke. He got pretty big when he got up to fight Gagey [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=193.38s)]
*  He put the weight on right fantastic fantastic [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=197.54s)]
*  We all remember the knockout of Gagey in the last seconds there, but he was mollywapping him before that [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=200.1s)]
*  He was beating his ass and it all started off with that jump-spinning back kick to the face in the first round fucked up [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=205.18s)]
*  Gagey's already fixed nose. So that max hallway the true max. Oh at 55 [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=209.76s)]
*  I'm just fucking Dustin for Dustin's last fight in New Orleans [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=213.9s)]
*  Sure [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=217.98s)]
*  Take my money [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=218.26s)]
*  The thing is you got to wonder like how much did that Ilya to poor you knockout take out of max? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=218.98s)]
*  True cuz that was a beating true. Ilya is just so fucking dangerous [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=223.42000000000002s)]
*  He's so technical like his striking though, he's like bobbing in and moving he's so comfortable with his head movement [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=227.82s)]
*  He sees like a step ahead of everybody. He's good at everything and then people like oh, he's too small for 55 [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=233.78s)]
*  Like he's actually that that native don't work. He's a big fucking boy. Well, I think the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=239.26s)]
*  45 pound cut is look man. They should all stop cutting weight. That's the reality cutting weight is bullshit [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=244.45999999999998s)]
*  It's terrible for you. They need more weight classes and they need to stop cutting weight [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=250.14s)]
*  They need to figure out a way to check hydration levels and put people in a weight class and say this way still do that [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=254.38s)]
*  in one [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=260.54s)]
*  One's backed off MMA like they have a big Muay Thai fight tonight [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=263.54s)]
*  Yeah, they're really focused on kickboxing Muay Thai [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=268.38s)]
*  I think in Asia that gets a lot of numbers big time and they put on fucking shows man [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=270.7s)]
*  Yeah, there's a huge one tonight huge one kickboxing and Muay Thai fights [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=276.3s)]
*  I think the UFC fucked up when they went with slap fighting [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=280.2s)]
*  I've been telling them forever you guys should get into kickboxing if you only like stand-up fights [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=283.78000000000003s)]
*  There's it's not like the old days of kickboxing where they're boring like no karate [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=289.42s)]
*  There's characters man and the knockouts are fucking crazy. Also all your champs are coming from kickboxing [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=294.38s)]
*  Yeah, Alex is he I get some monsters kickboxing with MMA gloves in a cage would be giant [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=300.06s)]
*  We just have a striking only [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=306.98s)]
*  Segment of the UFC and glories coming back lores doing a heavyweight competition soon. Glory's got some elite fighters, man [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=309.7s)]
*  I watch Gloria all the time. It's fucking exciting, but nobody was watching it [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=315.86s)]
*  Nobody knows who these people are. You just got to educate the crowd put the same [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=320.42s)]
*  Amount of resources you're in the slap fight right into kickboxing is she cooking right? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=323.90000000000003s)]
*  And then I'm gonna just sue right right they're doing they put how many millions dollars in the jitsu and they even have more of a [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=328.9s)]
*  budget for it [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=335.78000000000003s)]
*  Lot of its Eddie, you know, they put a lot of it in the jitsu. Yeah, Mikey [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=337.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it is what you see fight know with USC fight [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=342.98s)]
*  No, I'm saying as far as making it popular like you have five all that shit like that's you were the one [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=345.62s)]
*  You know, I know we're boys, but you were really the one to navigate all that with fight pass. That was huge [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=350.7s)]
*  Yeah, it was a big deal having the UFC get involved heavily and jujitsu is huge. Are you still doing stuff with them? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=355.06s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I have a great relationship with them [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=361.21999999999997s)]
*  I think they're trying to put together some kind of like a tough show now like an ultimate fighter show for grappling [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=363.9s)]
*  Which would be which would be cool because then you can like build a star from scratch [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=369.82s)]
*  Yeah, and get to know the guys exactly. Yeah, you can get people emotionally involved [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=373.67999999999995s)]
*  Because they they exclusively signed Mikey Moushameshi, right? Yeah, it's hard to get people to watch those reality shows these days [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=378.5s)]
*  I think people kind of burned out on reality shows, you know DC and jailers shooting one right now [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=384.58s)]
*  They're shooting the ultimate fight. They gotta give up on that bro [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=388.94s)]
*  I [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=391.3s)]
*  Don't know where you watch it's on ESPN plus is it I haven't watched it in forever [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=393.66s)]
*  No, I watched the finals. I watched the finals to see how good guys are sure and you know and see where they're at [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=399.14s)]
*  You know, I watched Dana White's contender series probably more [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=404.7s)]
*  That's the best thing in combat sports far as I'm talent like it's the best because they're super hyped [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=407.42s)]
*  They have insane motivation [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=413.82s)]
*  They have this unbelievable opportunity if they do that they get skyrocketed into the end [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=415.86s)]
*  It's not like ultimate fighter like where you can win based off grappling and you know and just hold guys down [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=420.06s)]
*  They become champion you see contract could Dana White contender series. There's dudes who win and he's like nah not excited enough [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=424.48s)]
*  Yeah, so dudes go for bro. Yeah sugar Sean came from there [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=430.36s)]
*  I mean, there's so many champs a lot of people came from our tomorrow [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=434.8s)]
*  Is it illegal to have a finish bonus in the UFC like you get paid whatever? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=437.26s)]
*  80,000 to show [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=443.22s)]
*  80,000 a win and then another 80,000 if you finish the fight [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=446.22s)]
*  Legal no, no, no definitely not illegal. No, they do it now. We're performance bonus [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=451.14s)]
*  There's a performance. I think yeah a little bit or or or go gangster and go [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=455.5s)]
*  You know, you have show money and then you get extra money like, you know double but you have to knock them out or submit [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=460.46000000000004s)]
*  See you just get your show money. Ufl does that I know everyone say it the ufl does that really? Yeah [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=466.74s)]
*  Okay, I think that's a good idea. What's ufl now? What do you mean pfl? No ufl? What's ufl? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=471.78000000000003s)]
*  Ufls were like Tony Ferguson Dillon dances fighting. I thought there was GFL [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=478.5s)]
*  Yeah, GFL. Oh, yeah. Yeah GFL. Sorry. Yeah, there's PFL. There's GFL you have something else [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=482.94s)]
*  But we're talking about the one fight that I'm interested. Yo Romero and Musasi. That's a great fight. That's a great fight [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=488.78000000000003s)]
*  That's fine one fight that GFL is putting together my oh, I watch that are they both over 40? They're a hundred years old [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=494.14000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, you're both a hundred else 79 years old [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=500.5s)]
*  I don't care. He looks fucking amazing. Well, he's fighting in bare knuckle [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=503.46s)]
*  Yeah, too. Like he that's also in promo with some giant duties fighting. Do you see him box that slap fight guy, bro? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=508.0s)]
*  That's slap fight guy when he jumped up there was like, oh I fucked up [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=514.42s)]
*  Right before he decided to beat his ass he just jumped straight up in the air and just some sloppy white guy [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=522.14s)]
*  If the UFC does kickboxing they might as well just come out with a bang and go bare knuckle kickboxing [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=530.14s)]
*  It's not a bad idea take my money and that'll that'll you know, that'll get people to check it out [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=537.42s)]
*  It's more do it separate from UFC events [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=542.42s)]
*  Or would you do it like would look would do it like one or you have like MMA fights and kickboxing mix it up [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=545.34s)]
*  I think you could do whatever you wanted, but you could definitely could have a stand-up only show and it would be huge [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=549.98s)]
*  Yeah, where they break them up if they clinch against the cage, you know [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=554.78s)]
*  You don't allow them to clinch do it just like kickboxing does separate them, you know, like there's no ground fighting [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=558.5s)]
*  That's all backwards. It's out of the truth. Like really you think we had kickboxing. No one watched it [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=563.6999999999999s)]
*  We already had it [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=568.86s)]
*  No, but when the UFC came out people all of a sudden people were into martial arts again [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=570.06s)]
*  And if we go that's going back, I think I don't know I see what you're saying [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=575.3399999999999s)]
*  But look the UFC does grappling events, right? The grappling events are pure grappling [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=579.12s)]
*  Why not do pure striking events too? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=582.86s)]
*  Well [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=585.0600000000001s)]
*  MMA is always the best well it was when the UFC blew up it was UFC to correct [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=585.7s)]
*  Yeah, nobody watched UFC one. They didn't know if it was real. There was no b-roll, right? Everyone watched UFC to and [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=590.86s)]
*  Did they get blown away and get hooked by it because of the striking or because of the jiu-jitsu? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=597.86s)]
*  Well, it was because it was hoist. It was the jiu-jitsu. Yeah people didn't realize that you could fight on the ground [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=604.4200000000001s)]
*  I thought fighting on the grounds was for puts but then I went mainstream [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=609.9000000000001s)]
*  For a tough one with stand-up with Stefan and Forrest. But listen, let's imagine [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=613.1s)]
*  that [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=618.42s)]
*  Ankolyev and Pereira fight an only kickboxing fight. Are you telling me that's gonna be boring? That would be fucking insane [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=619.82s)]
*  Yeah, they already had that. Kickboxing with little gloves. Oh with MMA gloves. If they're gonna do it [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=627.54s)]
*  I'd go bare-knuckle if it was up to me. The thing about bare-knuckle though is your face gets obliterated [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=631.5s)]
*  Yeah, the slices and cuts. People watch that. People want to see the blood. The hands break. People want to see it. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=636.44s)]
*  I'd come date for game bread where it's bare-knuckle MMA and seeing JDS and Alan Belcher and Roy [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=642.7s)]
*  They don't punch the same right the little cautious because they don't want to break. It's more real. It's not it's more realistic [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=649.86s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, which is it is it's just a different product. What happened? This starts in an hour [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=656.02s)]
*  But wait a minute. It's not Hilton. No, I know this is the bare-knuckle. That's the dirty body. Oh my goodness [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=661.3s)]
*  That's our boy Mike position [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=667.38s)]
*  Is this bare-knuckle it's bare-knuckle and this Hilton is tall with a giant jaw this starts in an hour [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=669.58s)]
*  Fuckin throw that bitch on [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=678.26s)]
*  Let's go [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=681.38s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=683.06s)]
*  Arlovski man takes a look and it keeps on ticking better than Andrei Arlovski. Tell me about it. That dude's still around [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=684.42s)]
*  He was the UFC champion in 2005 son. Wow, dude [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=690.5s)]
*  2005 that's 20 fucking years ago of hardcore combat sports in MMA [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=695.06s)]
*  That is not dude and remember how hard it was for the UFC even to cut them because they kept giving these young lines [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=700.3399999999999s)]
*  He kept beating him. Yeah, you can't do just get out of here. He's like, nah, he's such a veteran [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=705.38s)]
*  He's such a savvy. He sees everything coming. Yeah. Oh, yeah, man. He's been been there done that forever [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=710.4599999999999s)]
*  Yon Bojovich, so you were saying the Bojovich got both of his shoulders reconstructed both of them been out two years [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=716.74s)]
*  One shoulders bad enough, but what's impressive about him is he was fighting with bad shoulders when he beat all these boys really? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=722.78s)]
*  Yeah, I mean how bad were they? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=729.66s)]
*  They get worse. Yeah, did they get worse injury? It's a bad injury because it's such a complicated joint. I had [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=732.06s)]
*  Full-blown surgery. It was uh, how's it now? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=738.42s)]
*  It's good now step cells. How's your back your lower back? My lower back's good, man [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=741.38s)]

*  I do that every day that changed everything for you [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=750.54s)]
*  It makes it so that I don't need surgery because I'm supposed to go back for more back surgery [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=752.8199999999999s)]
*  I was supposed to do that two years ago for another disc. Yeah another one, but I'm [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=757.14s)]
*  Delaying that as long as possible and you know doing these stretches man [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=763.62s)]
*  It takes about an hour and a half to do these stretches every day, but it makes it manageable where I could [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=766.9399999999999s)]
*  You know tie my shoelaces without pain, you know [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=772.02s)]
*  Lower backs are a motherfucker. Yeah. Yeah, so whatever we can do to avoid surgery man [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=775.58s)]
*  It's amazing. I'll get it yawn first shoulder operate on unfortunately [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=781.0200000000001s)]

*  But he hasn't really beat any of the top guys to get to this so him versus yawns fun [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=850.86s)]
*  And there's also his first fight like his first fight with Kennedy Kennedy and Zichaku [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=855.7s)]
*  Yeah, who beat him down like he was beating Kennedy up and then he gassed out and he fucked him up [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=860.0600000000001s)]

*  You know over amped in the beginning of the fight burned off too much fuel just experience experience [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=870.08s)]
*  It's like Sean Brady in the main event like when they gave him bala [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=874.58s)]
*  He just wasn't ready and then loses that and then goes on a tear. Yeah, and like now he's ready now. He's ready [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=877.7800000000001s)]

*  Yeah, right. I got shit. Yeah, he's [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1006.6s)]

*  Yeah, I take it it's it's like a what do we say a nootropics? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1018.5600000000001s)]
*  Wow, it's basically an MAO inhibitor and it also has something that does something for your mitochondria [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1022.6s)]
*  I'm not the guy to describe it, but Gary Brekha told me to take it and quite a few other people told me to take it [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1030.08s)]
*  Yeah, I just stumbled because I take creatine for [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1035.8400000000001s)]
*  Neurological reasons and for muscle recovery. Yeah, and then I'm taking so many nootropics [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1039.2s)]
*  I feel like I leveled out and then someone recommend this [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1043.8s)]
*  Methanol blue methylene methylene blue. Yeah, and that took you to another level, bro. Yeah, I mean three four times a day [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1048.48s)]
*  Let's go three or four times a day. Yeah, I was just do it one a day, bro [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1054.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, this is great from diesel subs feeling a test rat yeah, yeah, yeah when they go does it work I think so probably [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1065.24s)]
*  Yeah [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1072.96s)]
*  Combos work one of them is gonna work now with the UFC being involved in grappling [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1075.68s)]
*  They're not thinking about drug testing anybody are they I don't think so as far as I know no [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1080.36s)]
*  Because none of the other organizations test right? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1086.04s)]
*  It's like unless you're gonna sign which is starting to happen now because there's a little bit more money IBJJF tests [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1088.6s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. Yeah, okay. That's it [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1094.3999999999999s)]
*  You know, they're starting to sign people exclusive now because there's a little bit more money [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1097.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, but unless you're gonna test across every organization is gonna test and it doesn't make sense because any guys who are guys who? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1101.4399999999998s)]
*  Are tested in the UFC who are fighting on flow or at one or other events who are fighting guys who are juiced anyway [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1108.76s)]
*  So right the whole reason to have testing is to have guys who are not on steroids compete against one another [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1114.12s)]
*  They came up with an organization that came up with the most money and said but here's the rules. We're gonna go usada [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1119.8s)]
*  Yeah, that would that would work [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1125.6s)]
*  But don't is that you need a business model where you can make that amount of money back, right? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1127.48s)]
*  Like just just to pay for testing like most of the guys so competing on like the undercard or like not even the main event [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1131.96s)]
*  Guys, you would actually be losing money testing them regularly [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1138.8s)]
*  Dulls down the sport, but also when when the UFC signs [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1142.84s)]
*  Like say Mikey Musa Meshie. Is it exclusive? Can you not compete anywhere else? So usually when they do exclusive [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1147.16s)]
*  I don't know what his contract is obviously [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1153.62s)]
*  But usually they're usually it's exclusive but they have cutouts for things like a DCC you're like big world championships [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1155.48s)]
*  Otherwise, it's hard to sign the guys completely [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1161.96s)]
*  Say you'd have to pay my salary like for example if if you have see signed Mikey exclusive [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1163.96s)]
*  Then he wanted to do a DCC but it's on flow like a lot of times the guys have cutouts for that like big [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1169.84s)]
*  Bro, she makes it ornaments. That's cool because it helps everybody. Yeah, it's cool [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1175.72s)]
*  Just build the brand you want to be stuck there [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1178.72s)]
*  Like a guy for a guy exclusive to flow or to UFC wouldn't be able to compete for like flow grappling or one normally [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1181.56s)]
*  Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, so is one still doing a lot of grappling. I know they got the rotolo's [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1188.04s)]
*  Mikey's gone. I think Cade's doing MMA now. Okay. Yeah, he's to know he looks like a demon out there [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1194.48s)]
*  Oh, okay looks like a sad [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1200.6s)]
*  He's fucking people up strutting. Yeah, right, right. Yeah, it's like having a guy like that [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1203.52s)]
*  That's the that elite with grappling and also young enough to learn striking and get rid and just wild dude [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1208.68s)]
*  They get all aggressive dudes great work [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1214.9s)]
*  I think they gave him like a tough matchup to a second fight in one championship like a tough fucking wrestler [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1216.6200000000001s)]
*  He fucking annihilated this dude. Is Gary Tone and still in one [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1221.46s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, he was his contract ended. He was doing some negotiations [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1226.68s)]
*  But as far as I know, I I think he's going back to one but I'm not a hundred hundred percent sure be great to see [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1230.5s)]
*  Jimmy can you bring up the one champ? One championship has a big [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1236.76s)]
*  More tight fight like huge Muay Thai fight like one of the biggest ever [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1240.24s)]
*  So wait to it there everybody watching at home Rod first fight is right about to start and [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1244.44s)]
*  we are [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1251.36s)]
*  Mark Goddard is waiting to kick it off. He's moving to the center of the octagon now and [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1253.24s)]
*  It goes and the time is 457 456 455 454 453 [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1259.4s)]
*  We're off [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1266.76s)]
*  How do you say that dude's name Shari Shari? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1268.68s)]
*  Shari Shari Shari [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1272.36s)]
*  This is in London, yes, sir [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1277.64s)]
*  A little bit about these guys. I don't know much. I didn't study this [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1281.96s)]
*  Brendan I wish I wish you don't know. Oh my god. No, I know some weight. I got some things [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1286.84s)]
*  Who is he five eight first round finishes? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1291.84s)]
*  The that's really good [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1294.6s)]
*  Man Brendan got stung. Yeah, it gets crispy off this but what I was gonna say is I wish we were seeing John Jones Aspinall in London [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1297.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's what they should be saying [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1305.4399999999998s)]
*  But I think John's gonna hold out as long as he can to make the most money and then which you can't be mad at [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1307.32s)]
*  But also, you know Tom Aspinall I think soon he'll be the interim champ for the longest ever over 500 days [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1312.1599999999999s)]
*  That's not good. No, that's kind of crazy 500 days. It's not my days as well [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1318.1999999999998s)]
*  It's kind of crazy and John said he wants six months to train which is that's just negotiation tactics [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1322.24s)]
*  Like dude, he's been on your radar for three years and you took two years to get ready for heavyweight. What are we doing? [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1327.8s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean John's get your soul meticulous in his preparation [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1332.52s)]
*  Like you've worked with John you trained with him when he was getting ready for steep a yeah [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1337.08s)]
*  We did the first camp I was with them for like a couple weeks and then the [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1340.92s)]
*  Then steep they got hurt and then the second camp. Oh, oh, here we go. Someone got hurt [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1345.76s)]
*  He dropped them I didn't see with what but he definitely dropped them [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1352.52s)]
*  So but yeah the second camp I was with him for like a full like six or seven weeks [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1357.52s)]
*  So that was a and do you think Tom Aspinall is like John's gonna get him down if you got him down [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1362.28s)]
*  John as far as being an Aspinall's guard you think it'd be an issue for John at all [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1368.16s)]
*  No, I think that I think Tom would probably be trying to stand up [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1373.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't and Tom also has pretty good like fast takedowns. So yeah, they could both take one another down. Yeah [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1377.64s)]
*  But I don't think that Tom is gonna be able to like really do anything besides try to get up on John [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1384.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I try and get that mounted guillotine. He's been doing jitsu since he was a kid, you know, it's rare [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1391.16s)]
*  You have a big guy with good hips dogfight. Oh, he's so fast to [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1397.0600000000002s)]
*  Aspinall like as a heavyweight, there's no one like him. The only knock-on we really haven't seen just his defense [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1401.2s)]
*  Yeah, his head is [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1406.88s)]
*  Fight I did see him lose. He got heel hooked and it was a pretty shitty heel lock that he tapped to so [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1409.2s)]
*  Aspinall. Yeah, when was that? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1414.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you got a heel hook yeah, yeah interesting he's undefeated there was a then it was a it means a long time ago [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1420.24s)]
*  He's obviously gotten much better, but it was a pretty shitty heel look. No kidding [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1426.6000000000001s)]
*  Was it an amateur fighter was it a pro fight? It's a pro fight [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1430.2s)]
*  Here's something to think about think of whatever reason John decides he doesn't want to fight Aspinall [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1433.4199999999998s)]
*  What the fuck do you do with Aspinall right? There's no heavyweight divisions never been worse. It's never been worse [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1437.78s)]
*  It's awful. Like there's Cyril gone. I go right here. Oh [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1444.4199999999998s)]
*  Pull that head down he sticks to the head just concentrates on the head [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1448.1399999999999s)]
*  You might be able to get it if he would ask me a few weeks ago [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1453.26s)]
*  I would say have Alex move up, but Alex just lost. Yeah, that was the bummer [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1456.46s)]
*  I heard that Alex fought with a broken here. It is. Here's a heel hook [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1460.46s)]
*  It's actually a heeled kneebar [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1466.18s)]
*  So here it is [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1468.66s)]
*  Who's this guy? So you see he just scoops the leg from half guard Tom [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1470.3400000000001s)]
*  Tom was whooping his ass Tom turns away instead of trying to face him [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1474.9s)]
*  So it exposes the heel and it turns into a heel kneebar. Oh weird [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1478.54s)]
*  There's a heel hook, but it's a knee bar [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1482.8600000000001s)]
*  But with the heel hook gripping so he can't turn back into the lock that dudes in some pub right now gonna [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1484.94s)]
*  Beat that guy. I beat the fucking champ. I beat that fucking champ. This guy keeps trying [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1489.14s)]
*  He's got a creating angle. Oh, he's got both arms shoulders in. Yeah [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1494.8200000000002s)]
*  It's gonna go with a dead orchard right in [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1500.18s)]
*  Doesn't work [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1504.98s)]
*  Never working MMA's anybody pulled it off and yeah Elvis Siniseq. Oh, that's he was the first one [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1507.14s)]
*  He was the first one. That's why I'll know it [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1512.46s)]
*  That's when no one really thought it was like no one really even noticed it because you're taught [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1514.82s)]
*  You only triangle your legs when there's one arm in one arm out now when there's two arms in right, but his legs are so long [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1519.5s)]
*  He arm bar Jeremy Horn and then when you look at it, you're like, yo [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1525.9s)]
*  He has a he's triangling his legs and he has both arms in whoa. That's kind of a freak thing [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1529.74s)]
*  Yeah, we just thought it was a freak thing and then [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1534.54s)]
*  Nathan orchard and Brian Debs [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1539.18s)]
*  To my guys they just started doing it all the time they go you do we do this all the time [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1541.42s)]
*  I really you're doing triangle like you got to have long legs. Mm-hmm [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1545.22s)]
*  You gotta have long live you have short legs. You got to do a Mexican dead orchard. That's what I do [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1548.7s)]
*  You got to do a lot of extra labor [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1552.92s)]
*  There's a lot of extra stuff you got to do to put on the Mexican dead orchard. How's it work? [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1555.3400000000001s)]
*  You got to do a lot of stuff. You got to go invisible collar to muddy waters and then Mexican dead [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1559.14s)]
*  There's a lot of stuff because if you have long hair or long long [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1563.38s)]
*  Your heavy metal dude if you have long legs you can you're on the bottom [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1567.16s)]
*  Depending on how you match up with the guy [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1572.56s)]
*  He can get dead orchard [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1574.8s)]
*  He could you could triangle your legs with his arms in a perfect defensive position and they get that a lot of times people [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1576.52s)]
*  Get surprised like what the fuck happened? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1581.28s)]
*  I want how did he triangle his legs that they don't understand but if you have short legs and the guys like this or just [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1582.8400000000001s)]
*  Regular legs there's no way you're gonna be able to triangle your legs with both arms in you need one arm in one arm out [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1588.76s)]
*  so with both arms in [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1593.64s)]
*  The only way a Mexican or a Chinese guy could do a dead orchard is you got to have this arm down and [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1596.3200000000002s)]
*  This arm like this [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1602.2800000000002s)]
*  Like this now I could now I could triangle my legs [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1603.88s)]
*  You got to do a lot of work you got to get the hand of the mat and then you got to get his elbow [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1606.48s)]
*  And there's a lot of stuff. It's super complicated [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1610.5200000000002s)]
*  Dead orchards are not the greatest thing for and you got to be super flexible super flexible and you got to put a lot [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1613.16s)]
*  Of time into it, but if you have long legs [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1619.16s)]
*  You should be doing dead orchards [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1621.96s)]
*  It's by far the number one arm bar in the guard no gee and there's not even a close second [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1623.52s)]
*  There's a minute I got one of my black belt has 84 dead orchards and his students a purple [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1629.76s)]
*  But as 34 dead orchards in competition who has that many orchards Chris Vickers 10th Planet Walnut Creek [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1634.8s)]
*  and dead or [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1642.04s)]
*  There's they happen all the goddamn time Ben Eddie got [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1643.52s)]
*  A [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1647.08s)]
*  Wilson Hays in in a combat jujitsu match he got him in a dead orchard [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1648.28s)]
*  Wilson Hays is high level black but he just fought Mighty Mouse for the title a month before [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1652.64s)]
*  That's high level shit. Yeah, you know, but you know, but for girls [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1657.84s)]
*  girls [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1662.68s)]
*  Proportionally have longer legs than guys and more narrow shoulders [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1663.8s)]
*  So if you're a girl out there and you're fighting MMA and you don't have a dead orchard in your game [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1667.2s)]
*  You're missing out [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1671.76s)]
*  Girl girls can do dead orchards at a higher level or a higher rate than guys [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1673.28s)]
*  Who's sure who just because of the body type who you think has the best guard in MMA? Is it Olivera or Paul Craig? [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1677.7s)]
*  Paul Craig's got a fucking pretty nasty guard Paul Craig so dangerous Bo Nicodemus take him down [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1685.68s)]
*  Yeah, right. There's so few fighters with dangerous guards in MMA. Right? So Fabrizio was one [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1691.3600000000001s)]
*  Felt it for ratios for Rizio over doom is the overlooked goat heavyweight. I would say Paul Craig. Yeah [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1698.6s)]
*  Uncle I have in Jamal Hill. He's got two world champions [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1705.84s)]
*  Arm-barred both of them triangle them arm-barred them. That's very impressive [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1709.32s)]
*  We got gutter else malls arm remember drum. Jamal's arms flopping all over the place [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1714.04s)]
*  He's beating on him as far as jitsu eyes you got gutter Nelson on the card tonight and then Sean Brady's no punk either [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1718.1999999999998s)]
*  He's working Philadelphia gorilla and I'm sure Gordon like to point out that he beat Craig Jones in competition he did be Craig Jones [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1724.28s)]
*  That was one of them deals where you couldn't do heel hooks though, right? Yeah, I think I believe leg locks were illegal [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1734.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's a little sauce. But I mean still he's an MMA guy who fights at 170. Well, he's a fucking beast [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1740.04s)]
*  No, yeah, no doubt. He's got like a turtle shell for a back. No, he's a great [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1745.84s)]
*  Grappler which is why I'm excited to watch this. Yeah, his back is like triple thick. He's got like you John. My son Brady [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1750.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, his back is like extra muscles. You see what he's do and Leon Edwards in the way and he's like [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1756.28s)]
*  I don't realize how small he is. I'm just gonna have a strength advantage like oh yeah, but yeah, you're like, oh buddy [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1761.6000000000001s)]
*  Oh boy, you got to educate yourself. Well, Leon was saying at the way and he's too small [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1766.92s)]
*  I'm gonna take him out like he might be shorter than you but [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1771.26s)]
*  He's a fucking chimp. Yeah, you get to hold you you got real problems [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1775.3600000000001s)]
*  Know what he did to Kelvin? Yeah, there's manhandled Kelvin Gilbert burns a hell of a wrestler. Yeah. Hell yeah hell of a wrestler [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1778.8s)]
*  No, anyone who fights on Braves like he's the strongest guy we were yeah. All of them say it. Yeah, Joe Piper says yeah [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1785.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and Joe Piper is fucking huge huge. That's a guy. We're collared hands [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1792.04s)]
*  That's a guy. We're like, how the fuck do you make 85? Wow. How do you make 85 Gordon in your opinion? [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1796.22s)]
*  What's the best leg lock for MMA? [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1801.58s)]
*  best leg lock position [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1803.82s)]
*  You're training someone he wants to learn leg locks. What do you think? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1805.82s)]
*  Well for you guys to be called the honey hole but for us cross-ashigarami or insights and Goku. Yeah insights and kakua [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1810.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's the best one you think [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1816.8799999999999s)]
*  One of them and then what do you think about putting it on the outside and go on Z lock? That's great, too [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1819.32s)]
*  So it seems like anything on the outside it turns the guy and he really can't hit you because really it's about being [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1824.2s)]
*  Safe from strike. Yeah, and 50-50. I think everyone agrees [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1830.36s)]
*  If you see 50-50 in MMA and it works, but you can still reach the guy's face [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1834.3999999999999s)]
*  But you can't really hit him that hard 50-50 50-50 you can get hit [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1838.24s)]
*  Outside ashigarami or you guys call that's the worst one. You get hit [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1842.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's the worst but any like insights in kaku or if you pass leg across so we call it inside [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1846.04s)]
*  Ashigarami where you have the that's how I finished Nicky Rod where you have the legs triangle to inside but the legs pass [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1850.9199999999998s)]
*  To the outside so you have an outside heel hook [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1856.6s)]
*  That's great, but because everyone's breaking mechanics are not up to par on outside heel hooks [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1859.92s)]
*  It's harder to get catastrophic brakes on outside heel hooks [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1866.26s)]
*  so for MMA if you have good breaking mechanics like Paul Horace finished a lot of [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1869.22s)]
*  Outside heel hooks, but his breaking mechanics were pretty good. Yeah [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1874.54s)]
*  The legs inside with the foot outside is best [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1878.3400000000001s)]
*  Otherwise just keep the foot on the other side and go for the inverted. So if this leg was reaping [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1881.46s)]
*  This foot would be on the outside right like this. Yeah, so you have an outside heel. We call that the Indian. Yeah [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1888.04s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. That's Gary heel hooking on the inside. Yeah [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1893.28s)]
*  But so yeah, so so it's a it's hard for the guy to the guy can't hit you from here [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1897.24s)]
*  He can't really throw any punches to your basically anything that anytime you reap like which which which is that left leg going on the inside [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1901.24s)]
*  Makes it hard for the guy to hit so most people think all leg locks don't work in MMA. You're gonna get smashed [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1908.76s)]
*  That's not true some leg locks will save your ass. That was a fight in the UFC some Brazilian guy [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1914.74s)]
*  I forget it was in the ultimate fighter [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1919.26s)]
*  He was on his back getting walloped and the guy was like had a horse stance on top of him against the cage and was [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1920.58s)]
*  Throwing down and that Brazilian just jumped jumped on a on a kneebar a kneebar attempt and that saved him [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1926.54s)]
*  Cuz now you can't now [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1933.86s)]
*  Punching his ass and then from the kneebar [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1936.1799999999998s)]
*  He got knocked down on his back on his butt and then I turned around jumped on his back and choked him out [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1939.34s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think you're seeing a lot of heel hooks because a lot of guys just aren't very efficient [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1944.76s)]
*  They're like they're not focusing on it. Ryan Hall was one of the first to come in and really do some damage with leg locks [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1948.72s)]
*  Yeah, he got BJ Penn pretty quick. Mm-hmm. The number one determining factor of with with leg locking is [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1953.8799999999999s)]
*  and so far as getting hit is [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1960.12s)]
*  In order for the person to actually hit you they have to come up on top of you and put weight onto you [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1963.6s)]
*  So the number one determining factor is can I keep this guy's head? [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1968.04s)]
*  If I can get if you're attacking and you're trying to punch the guy if you can get your head over his head [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1971.34s)]
*  You can hit with power. Yeah, so any leg locking position [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1976.7s)]
*  Which doesn't allow your opponent to get head overhead is what's gonna keep you safe. So basically double outside [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1979.68s)]
*  Ah, she what do you guys call double outside? That's the worst one [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1984.92s)]
*  That's because the guy can come forward into you and get head overhead [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1988.34s)]
*  Yeah, you you either get that heel hook quick or you're gonna take some damage [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1990.94s)]
*  But anything where you're reaping which doesn't allow him to come forward into you [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1996.58s)]
*  He's gonna break his own leg if he stacks you yeah, and he can't get head overhead [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2000.12s)]
*  This is what you should be looking for [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2003.5s)]
*  But if the guy can get head overhead then he can hit you easy. Yeah, you going over [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2005.1399999999999s)]
*  Leg locks with John Jones. Is he is he pretty good at him now? Yeah [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2009.3s)]
*  We he kind of just bounces around from thing to thing like he'll like I want to go over some leg locks [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2012.4399999999998s)]
*  I don't like you'll teach him a move. You're like so Darcy's like a question on Darcy [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2016.82s)]
*  And it's just like that. It's like just ADHD just bound [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2020.1799999999998s)]
*  But that's how we learned like he just bounces from move to move [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2022.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah the first time I met him it was his first fight when he fought Stefan Bonner [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2025.1399999999999s)]
*  And we were at it was in Boston and we were at a boxing gym [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2029.98s)]
*  And I was just hanging out with you because you were taking a private with [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2034.22s)]
*  Who was the guy from Amsterdam that you were taking privates? [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2037.58s)]
*  It was either Shooky or Rob came in it was one of them [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2041.62s)]
*  We were in some random boxing gym in Boston [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2045.0s)]
*  And I was just sitting at on the on the ring [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2048.02s)]
*  Must have been Rob if we're in Boston waiting waiting for you to be done and then no one knew who John Jones was [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2050.28s)]
*  it was his first fight he's sitting there and [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2055.26s)]
*  He comes up to me and he and he asked for advice he goes [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2057.92s)]
*  What do you think you know you got any advice for me? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2060.92s)]
*  And I like I didn't know and he was fighting Stefan Bonner and I thought oh, they're feeding Stefan Bonner some [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2064.0400000000004s)]
*  Like I felt bad [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2069.88s)]
*  So what I told him is is there's two kinds of wrestlers that [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2072.0800000000004s)]
*  Come into MMA wrestlers that love jujitsu and wrestlers that want to beat jujitsu [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2076.4s)]
*  I go don't be one of those wrestlers that wants to beat jujitsu fall in love with it fall in love with [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2081.28s)]
*  Submissions because the guys the guys that want to beat it they never last they're eventually gonna get taken out [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2087.26s)]
*  Also wrestlers have such an advantage of being able to manipulate bodies this [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2092.84s)]
*  Scariest jujitsu guys for the most part are guys that wrestle their whole life [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2097.4s)]
*  And then they fall in love with jujitsu and they love pulling guard and all that like oh scary think about the guys John Jones submitted [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2102.86s)]
*  Oh, yeah, Lee Liotto. Yeah [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2109.0600000000004s)]
*  Stefan Bonner fight wasn't he like to beat the shit out of him [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2114.26s)]
*  Spinning elbow beat the shit. Yeah, you remember when we talked him we talked him into going to a big camp [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2118.82s)]
*  Do you remember that conversation? We're [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2124.46s)]
*  We're at the roof of the [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2127.26s)]
*  Hangin out and he was saying what do you think I should do? [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2130.1400000000003s)]
*  I said you're too good. You need to be at a big camp. You need to be around killers [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2132.6600000000003s)]
*  You can't you're so good. You're gonna get by a long way on your own [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2136.84s)]
*  I go but you need like high-level coaching like you're you're a world champion. Did you recommend Jackson's to him? [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2141.0200000000004s)]
*  I did not he found Jackson's. Yeah. Well Jackson's was huge at the time, you know, so many SP. It's such a great gym [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2147.1000000000004s)]
*  I mean you can't go wrong with those guys and Greg is just such a great mind for [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2153.82s)]
*  Yeah, not a slimy guy [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2159.6200000000003s)]
*  Legit kickboxer would you say Winkle Jones? Yeah, shit kick. He fought Johnny Vterio. Oh, yeah [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2163.9s)]
*  He was he was legit [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2169.38s)]
*  Winkle John's a legit striker and then you got all those other people over there, too [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2171.5400000000004s)]
*  It's like such a killer lineup. I was there during John's heyday man. Yeah, you were yeah. Yeah [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2175.5s)]
*  I think his heyday is still going on man. You see Ashley at heavyweight. We just don't know he's not active enough [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2180.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's really there's one fight man. There's one fight and then after that after that [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2186.94s)]

*  So it was like an easier and I'm sitting there and I'm roughing and I'm like [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2570.64s)]

*  So he's not getting pay-per-view points. It's his idea. Well, cuz the weight cuts too tough. Is that what it is? Yeah [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2638.56s)]

*  What is he waiting? You're not gonna give up the pay-per-view points and just dip out and then just go into the queue at 55 [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2653.16s)]

*  Fabricio's in GFL GFL's got everybody there Chris Wyman's like I'm retired and the GFL called him [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2881.02s)]
*  I was like, I'm unretired back in like they're fighting its end of May [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2886.3s)]
*  But the arena by the USC down there its end of May in LA. What kind of testing got multiple choice? Don't be a hater [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2891.7400000000002s)]
*  What's this testing you speak of but do they get old guys don't don't be cool [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2898.02s)]
*  Ww yeah, let's go back to the old day. We got Dylan Dillon Danis Tony Ferguson like I like it done. That's good [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2906.74s)]
*  That's a good fight. That's I saw that poster [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2912.96s)]
*  It's gotta be fake because there's zero chance that deal. It was that lightweight. Here it is no chance [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2915.8199999999997s)]
*  But remember the way they're different their weight cuts different [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2920.8999999999996s)]
*  So they can agree to fight out a weight that they're both comfortable a legendary lightweight matchup [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2924.64s)]
*  Yeah, but like that could be 65. Yeah, there's no way you make 65 [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2929.56s)]
*  He could like barely make 70 when he was like 170 when he was in shape for ADCC [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2933.64s)]
*  What is their weight classes are different? We pulled it up the other day like middleweight is 200 pounds. Uh-huh. So maybe [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2937.9199999999996s)]
*  Oh look, I posted right there. I'm gonna comment deal of making lightweight [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2943.64s)]
*  Let's see good pull up GFL weight classes Jamie. I think they are they're definitely different [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2947.7599999999998s)]
*  They're different. So if Tony goes hey, man, I feel good at whatever 168 170 and and Dylan agrees like yeah [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2953.64s)]
*  I'll fight you at 170 [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2960.3199999999997s)]
*  Don't even make it 170 when he fought in Bellator [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2961.68s)]
*  5050 revenue share he would fight a catchweight [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2964.56s)]
*  Athletes gonna fair share the revenue generated from events ensuring the success is directly linked to the league success. Dang [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2967.12s)]
*  How do they determine that 5050 5050 at once once they get over, you know once they get in the positive [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2972.68s)]
*  But then also like let's how do they know who's moving the needle they all get it [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2978.6s)]
*  Yeah, they all get it [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2983.2799999999997s)]
*  Google GFL's weight classes and see if a website explains it [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2985.7999999999997s)]
*  I know but I don't think they have it on their website another it's different if they split the profit [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2989.44s)]
*  What if that'll make any profit then nobody gets it? [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2994.64s)]
*  Okay, but then what's dope is like let's say Gordon was gonna fight and has and brought in a sponsor and then they want to [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2996.56s)]
*  sponsor the entire thing he gets [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3003.7999999999997s)]
*  20% of anything you bring so featherweight goes up to 55 lightweight is 65 Walter weights 80 [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3006.68s)]
*  So how's Dylan dance make it so I'm saying there's zero chance. He's big [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3012.64s)]
*  When he fought in Bellator, he would fight a catchweight. It was 175. I like their light heavyweight 225 [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3017.56s)]
*  That I wish they had that when I was fighting. They should have that shape of his life. Maybe maybe [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3023.5s)]
*  Any fighting KSI in boxing so should I just pulled out? All right. Well, that's I'm telling you [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3028.96s)]
*  There's no way don't make his KSI pull out against Dylan Dennis like Dylan's on a boxer. KSI is a pretty good boxer [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3033.52s)]
*  Well, he's legit like for those kind of guys. Yes, you know, he's a good boxer for that class [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3040.4s)]
*  Did he fight Tommy Shuri or was he going to he was going to then something happened, right? [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3046.6800000000003s)]
*  I think but KSI looks legit to me like out of those guys though the influencers. Yeah, he's legit [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3051.6800000000003s)]
*  He's he's got hands. Yeah, and Logan but Dylan is not a boxer. So it's crazy that he would [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3058.04s)]
*  You think he could be not even at his best to take that fight? [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3064.96s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I maybe got hurt I'm not sure I just saw I just saw something that he pulled that I don't even [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3068.8399999999997s)]

*  And that's when he decided to run for everything because he thought he was saved by God [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3231.46s)]
*  Cuz you know, it's the craziest thing about the gas thing the guy who invented [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3235.58s)]
*  Zyklon a which became zyklon B, which they killed the Jews with that guy Fritz Haber who was a Jew himself [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3240.18s)]
*  He originally when when he invented this he also invented the Haber method for extracting nitrogen [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3247.7s)]
*  From the atmosphere the Haber method is responsible for 50% of the nitrogen in most people's bodies [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3255.34s)]
*  Because the Haber method of extracting nitrogen made it so they could fertilize all kinds of soil [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3262.0600000000004s)]
*  So he invents that and he also invents this gas that kills everybody at the same time [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3267.34s)]
*  And there's no odor, right? Well zyklon B. There's no odor. Yeah, zyklon a was invented [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3274.98s)]
*  I think it was a pesticide and [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3281.2999999999997s)]
*  The idea was the smell was so awful so that you would recognize when it was there and you'd get the fuck away from it [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3283.54s)]
*  Then zyklon B. They got rid of the smell [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3289.94s)]
*  But when they were gassing the troops he was being wanted for crimes against humanity [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3292.66s)]
*  For war crimes at the same time. He was gonna win the Nobel Prize for inventing the Haber method [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3298.3399999999997s)]
*  Wild and then when Hitler takes over the Jews all get kicked out of Germany and he's kind of sort of privileged because [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3304.7799999999997s)]
*  He's a part of the administration [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3312.7799999999997s)]
*  But then he gets ostracized and he winds up having to be here and winds up being exiled and he dies on the run [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3314.8599999999997s)]
*  He died on the run died on the run died running away from the Nazis Jesus man. Yeah, why crazy story, dude? [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3321.58s)]
*  Have we talked about the JFA fuck JFK files? Not yet. No one has no [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3328.62s)]
*  I mean we talked about a little bit yesterday, but there's I don't know anything like groundbreaking nothing [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3333.14s)]
*  Right nothing that I've seen so far default that a that page on Instagram is called real news. No bullshit [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3339.4s)]
*  Yes, they posted something about it. Oh, yeah, they put it was like I think it was like 2,000 pages or something [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3345.62s)]
*  And they posted like the key takeaways. I read a little bit about it, but I kind of just it's kind of like confirmation [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3350.54s)]

*  Even if it only has 250 horsepower, it's so fun. That's different. It's so it's so different [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4149.92s)]
*  It's like a you're an amusement park ride, you know [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4155.28s)]
*  It's just like it feels like you could die at any point but then you look down to doing like 35 balls [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4159.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, like my hummer is not the fastest but fuck it's cool. Yeah. Fuck. There's nothing like I forgot [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4165.52s)]
*  You got a Hummer what's in that thing? [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4171.52s)]
*  6-0 power stroke fully built gas turbo aren't there electric Hummers now? Yeah, those are great man [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4173.52s)]
*  The new GMC's those are fucking great red band has one of those it's fucking awesome [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4179.62s)]
*  They crab or crab walk a parallel park like this [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4183.88s)]
*  I heard the charging some has some they've had a lot of issues with me. I'm not having any problems [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4188.16s)]
*  Don't figure those out though. Yeah, he loves it though. It's fast as shit too for a big-ass fucking truck [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4192.52s)]
*  They're so fast. So easy so fast, but huge. It's an enormous truck [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4197.76s)]
*  I think they're gonna start making less electric vehicles now that trumps in there already doing it [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4202.4400000000005s)]
*  Here's the problem with electric vehicles is the number one problem resale terrible to Porsche tie cans [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4206.64s)]
*  They sell them for like, you know, what is a like a tie can turbo s 160 [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4212.46s)]
*  They sell them like a year later for like 70 200 they lose so much value. I lost my crazy value [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4218.28s)]
*  Why is that because nobody wants to buy a used electric car because the range drops off [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4225.94s)]
*  So like say if you buy a car fat, right you buy like a 2000 you can buy [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4230.44s)]
*  2017 Corvette like a ZR one. They're still really expensive [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4234.96s)]
*  Is ZR wanna manual from like 2017 it's like yeah [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4239.08s)]
*  300 grand right now right now, but you'll think about a better [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4244.32s)]
*  Comparison would be think about like your your 4 GT a 2006 right there 500 grand minimum now, right? [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4248.28s)]
*  But that's the different because that's like a classic. It's 20 years old [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4254.92s)]
*  Sure, but a new car say like say if you get like a new AMG GT and you know, it's a 2025 [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4258.8s)]
*  You sell it next year. You're not gonna lose much money [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4266.32s)]
*  If you sell like a Ferrari you lose no money [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4268.4s)]
*  Like if you buy a Ferrari today and you sell it in a year and you got a thousand miles on you'll make money [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4271.799999999999s)]
*  Porsche make money you'll make sure the best but if you have a fucking electric car like Audi's those e-tron's those are [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4276.92s)]
*  Even Tesla plaid sick cards. I need a friend of mine [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4283.599999999999s)]

*  And [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4292.92s)]
*  Brand-new it's like 150 or something like that. It's crazy. Why not just get like a new battery or something [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4294.120000000001s)]
*  Well, that's expensive big problem [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4298.820000000001s)]
*  expensive [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4300.92s)]
*  Batteries and they still have battery like for the most part like you're not driving [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4301.88s)]
*  250 miles if you have a plug at home if you plug it in at home [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4306.76s)]
*  You have a supercharger at your house, which I do for my car. It's great. I just get it home plug it in [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4310.360000000001s)]

*  I think my car gets like 350 miles if you drive like a grandma, but [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4318.5599999999995s)]
*  For normal day to day you just stick it in there. You never go to the gas station. It's awesome [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4323.28s)]
*  See but fuck all that road tripping it [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4327.379999999999s)]

*  Stations like my hummer out of a 55 gallon diesel tank in the back. I fill that bitch up [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4338.08s)]

*  Yeah, there's a bunch of videos from a few days ago that this is all just not all AI generated. That's interesting [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4618.4s)]
*  Wow that right there. That's what I saw yeah, that'd be a dope podcast to do to put a middle of nowhere [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4623.96s)]
*  Well what I'm not gonna say that that's necessarily fake, but that's not a it's not a house that someone could live in [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4628.76s)]

*  What I saw and it's like a little five-minute mini documentary commercial [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4641.16s)]
*  Get you man these AI things are nuts man. I've been fooled yet [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4647.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I've seen AI things with my own voice on I'm like wow this is crazy, and I know it's fake [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4651.599999999999s)]
*  Speaking speaking of fakery when you had Mel Gibson on your podcast the other day [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4657.76s)]
*  He brought up the shroud of Turin and I always thought that was fake like in the 80s [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4663.900000000001s)]
*  What is that the shroud? [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4668.24s)]
*  It's like the the cloth that Jesus was buried in and left an image of them and in the 80s like 1988 [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4669.4400000000005s)]
*  They did carbon dating on it. They go. It's fake see that [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4676.0s)]
*  Yeah, it literally has an image of Jesus burned into it somehow or another [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4681.92s)]
*  I never looked into it. I just figured it was fake, but listening to you and Mel Gibson talk about it [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4686.88s)]
*  It's real is there well apparently it's a lot older than they [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4691.64s)]
*  Assumed when they did the first testing and one of the problems is holy shit cross contamination [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4696.24s)]
*  There's also been repairs to it, but they did subsequent testing and they found that it was like [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4701.46s)]
*  2,000 plus years old yeah, and the one thing the one thing is the most it's the most studied [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4706.4800000000005s)]
*  Artifact ever like particle physicists nuclear engineers they all studied it and they some of them [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4712.68s)]
*  Some believe in it some don't believe in it, but they all agree on one thing no one knows [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4720.5199999999995s)]
*  How they did it right? There's no one else have made it. There's no paint. There's no die [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4726.22s)]
*  So dude all this week dude all day. I'm just watching documentary after after podcasts on this shit [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4730.04s)]
*  It's mind-blowing [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4736.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty crazy if it turns out that they can't figure out [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4738.36s)]
*  How anyone could ever do it like if no one has come up with a theory of how to do that today? [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4743.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's where it gets really interesting [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4749.44s)]
*  There's this new wasn't paint and it wasn't die and it was agree on that wasn't burn [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4751.54s)]
*  They all agree [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4755.92s)]
*  It's a mystery because but then the people the skeptics say just because we don't know how it was done doesn't make it real [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4756.5199999999995s)]
*  Which is which is a good point, but then the other side's like dude all these scientists have no idea [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4762.5199999999995s)]
*  How they faked it it's got to be real so it's all about how you look at it. I lean on the side [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4768.4s)]
*  There's a there's a nuclear engineer most fun. There's a nuclear engineer. You can go on YouTube [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4772.92s)]
*  His name is Roger Robert Rucker [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4777.62s)]
*  Watch his breakdown. This guy's a nuclear dude. He's breaking down the phone [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4780.5199999999995s)]
*  He it's it's insane because it's a negative image on a non photographic [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4784.24s)]
*  Material linen right and then it turns out like if you look at it with the naked eye [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4791.0s)]
*  It's white and then you see the image of the face is kind of like yellow [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4796.88s)]
*  you can barely see it but in like [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4799.68s)]
*  1898 some photographer took a picture of it and then flipped and then looked at the negative and then all of a sudden in the negative [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4802.2s)]
*  the whole body appears front and back because he was buried like with a [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4809.36s)]
*  He was buried with the sheet under him and it went around his head [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4815.56s)]
*  That's the back of him cuz he yeah, the right one's the back and the left one's the front. That's crazy [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4819.6s)]
*  No one knows how they did it and no no sign the holes where the wrist would be nailed [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4824.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's fucking crazy. That was the thing with with Jesus with me. It's very hard [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4829.52s)]
*  It was always very hard to believe in Jesus. I'm like do the resurrection like that's a hard one to wrap your brain around, right? [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4834.28s)]
*  I could believe that he existed I could I could believe that he got crucified a lot of people got crucified [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4840.14s)]
*  But the resurrection was always the thing that kept me from really believing in Jesus. I'm like there's no way that [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4844.76s)]
*  Resurrection was real but even this is real. It doesn't mean he was resurrected, right? [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4850.4s)]
*  It just means you was crucified and he was actual real man [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4854.04s)]
*  No, the thing is is how the image got on [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4856.36s)]
*  It's just the people that believe that it's real believe that when he was resurrected some kind of ultraviolet radiation [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4860.4s)]
*  Some kind of burst made that image because that's because that image has never been on any other shroud [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4867.36s)]
*  There people get buried in shrouds all the time. There's never an image like that [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4872.44s)]
*  Pretty crazy and the crazy thing is the blood there's no image under the blood [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4876.44s)]
*  So the blood was there first and then the image is after [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4881.46s)]
*  It's crazy shit [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4886.42s)]
*  Dude, I'm like I I went deep down a rabbit all week [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4888.18s)]
*  Just watching the skeptics the scientists particle physics [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4892.74s)]
*  They they have no idea how the fuck that image got on the front and back the back of them, too [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4896.58s)]
*  Pretty weird [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4904.48s)]
*  It's crazy, dude, it's crazy apparently there's some structures underneath the pyramid [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4907.4s)]
*  How they not like that that before well fuck they don't know whether or not that's legit or where these guys are jumping in [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4913.24s)]
*  conclusions a lot of people are calling bullshit and saying they jump to conclusions a lot of people are saying that it really [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4919.42s)]
*  You can't tell from those images like what they drew in the you know [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4925.32s)]
*  The 3d image where they drew everything and made a model of it. They're doing a lot of guessing [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4929.88s)]
*  So they're gonna they're gonna do more testing though. There's definitely something under there [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4935.2s)]
*  Something is under there something's under there and it's massive and if these guys are correct that it goes down two kilometers like [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4940.88s)]
*  Help me explain that explain that with any conventional wisdom [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4948.32s)]
*  That's more than a mile into the earth. That's fucking nuts [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4952.84s)]
*  Yeah, like what is what does that mean? [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4956.64s)]
*  Like what who did that and what was the purpose of it? [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4958.64s)]
*  Because there's a guy named Christopher Dunn that thinks that the entire Giza pyramid the big one the Great Pyramid was a power plant [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4961.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and he has this whole schematic that he mapped out like this is how you would generate hydrogen [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4967.84s)]
*  You would have something underneath the surface under the underneath the ground that was causing a vibration a pounding and then this [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4973.200000000001s)]
*  Reverberation this this vibration would go through the entire building because it was all made out of limestone and then they had these [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4982.16s)]
*  channels these paths that they would fill with chemicals and they would go into what's called the King's Chamber and this [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4989.639999999999s)]
*  Porous limestone that would allow the chemicals to leap through the leech through and that would create hydrogen. Yeah. Yeah, so I mean I'm doing I'm butchering it [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4995.599999999999s)]
*  I'm sorry, mr. Dunn [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5002.88s)]
*  But if you listen to his take on it, he's an engineer [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5004.24s)]
*  He explains why the pathways and everything this is exactly how you would do it if it was some sort of a power plant [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5007.92s)]
*  But whatever it is, it's like I don't think that it's a tomb [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5014.96s)]
*  I just I just don't think that makes any sense [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5017.8s)]
*  Remember your bit where you said I bet people used to be really smart [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5020.4400000000005s)]

*  There's there's a few of them in India, but there's one that's all carved out of stone [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5067.2s)]
*  They didn't bring any rocks there. They don't know where the stone went [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5072.28s)]
*  It's all insanely intricate and carved out of stone and fucking massive and they're everywhere, dude [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5076.84s)]
*  They're everywhere South America Asia China. Look at that. Look at that, bro. They carved that out of solid stone [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5083.5199999999995s)]

*  There's dude there's past civilizations that were super highly advanced. There's gotta be I mean, you know what? [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5163.759999999999s)]

*  All that shit well [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5178.0s)]
*  They're not I don't know about that because I think you need a lot more than Giants to move those fucking stones [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5179.28s)]
*  You need some kind of crazy technology because Giants don't explain the engineering [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5183.08s)]
*  It doesn't explain the the precision that was involved like whatever they did [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5187.24s)]
*  They were they were moving 80 tons stones from 500 miles away and through the mountains and there's no roads and no one knows how they [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5191.0s)]
*  Did it there's no explanation your Instagram algorithm fuck you up with the the giant AI videos. Oh, yeah [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5198.8s)]
*  Giant [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5205.92s)]
*  Huge pyramids 70 foot dudes carrying giant stones like jacks shredded, you know [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5207.12s)]
*  I there's a lot of reports throughout the ages of giant human beings, you know, and it look what's a giant? [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5212.88s)]
*  Nine feet tall ten feet tall a fucking giant like a race of nine foot ten feet tall people and there's all these stories about [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5220.08s)]
*  Like bones that were giant bones that got [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5225.64s)]
*  Transport this Masonian they covered it up and I assume they don't live long because they're so big so they probably [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5228.16s)]
*  Fell off I think it's Robert Wadlow was a 8 foot 11. He's like on record the tall right? [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5234.12s)]
*  He had like a serious disease. Yeah now imagine a foot taller than that guy jacked [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5240.5599999999995s)]
*  But just a different kind of human being. Oh, have you heard of the little season? [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5245.88s)]
*  It's in the in the Bible they talk about the little season. No, we get a coke [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5249.719999999999s)]
*  Well the in the Bible it didn't get you a cocoa [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5253.5199999999995s)]
*  I asked you when you were leaving and get a coke [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5257.52s)]
*  But no, I'm good in in the Bible apparently, you know [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5261.92s)]
*  Your average Christian thinks tribulation is coming right Jesus gonna is gonna eventually come right tribulation [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5266.280000000001s)]
*  We're gonna be judged right and then there's gonna be a one thousand year millennial where? [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5271.56s)]
*  Jesus returns and rules for a thousand years and all the resurrected [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5277.68s)]
*  Apostles are gonna be kings and they're gonna rule this realm that we're at that's what they tribulation [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5281.92s)]
*  Jesus returns a thousand year millennia. This is in the Bible and then after the thousand year and then during those thousand years [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5286.92s)]
*  There's a guy named Paul stops I had on my podcast he told me all about this you he's on the YouTube [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5295.88s)]
*  Understanding conspiracies on YouTube Paul stops. He's he's amazing. He's talking about so that that's what we're waiting for [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5301.4400000000005s)]
*  Jesus returned he rules for a thousand years. He's the king of this earth and [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5308.4800000000005s)]
*  Then after the and then while while those thousand years are going on Satan is chained to the lake of fire [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5314.24s)]
*  So there's no Satan. It's just Jesus and his Apostles ruling and then after the thousand years [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5321.04s)]
*  This called the little satanic season. It's in the Bible to I check doc the little season where Jesus on [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5327.44s)]
*  lets Satan go and then Satan rules this earth and he influences all the nations and it's called the little satanic season and [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5334.5599999999995s)]
*  that and the purpose of that is to to test people like work and [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5343.48s)]
*  There's a there's a theory. There's a theory that he [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5348.04s)]
*  Already ruled for he came back in the Apostles lifetime and ruled [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5352.599999999999s)]
*  They already did that a thousand year millennial and now we're in the little season right now [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5356.16s)]
*  Doesn't it seem like Satan is like influencing all the nations doesn't it seem like an evil world? [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5360.799999999999s)]
*  Well, it seems like evil has always been a part of the human race. There's always been people committing genocide [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5365.919999999999s)]
*  There's always been evil. There's always been people that justify murder for money [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5372.2s)]
*  Yeah, you know bombings of fucking apartment buildings. I sent them a link like a like a two-minute video [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5375.96s)]
*  Jamie can you play this real quick? This guy explains it's really and then you'll see all the structures so that explains [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5384.08s)]
*  So there's a theory is a theory that it explains all these structures that were built by angels [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5389.88s)]
*  well [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5396.36s)]
*  You gotta wonder when you get back to that Zechariah stitch and stuff because one of the things about this whole Anunnaki thing [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5396.92s)]
*  was that there were giants and [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5403.12s)]
*  The big theories of the Giants bred with human beings which probably means some sort of genetic engineering like taking [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5405.28s)]
*  Like existing primates and and turning them into human beings. Yeah. Yeah, I mean if you I [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5411.68s)]
*  Mean those are the most fun [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5419.12s)]
*  Those are the most fun the idea that we were visited by an alien and an alien race in this alien race is far superior [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5420.96s)]
*  And that they used us as slaves to mine for gold. Those are the most fun theories [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5427.2s)]
*  Did you get that link? Yes, it was 22 minutes long. No, just play like two minutes [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5432.68s)]
*  I know I'm trying to find a good spot. No right in the right. It's right. What is their mechanisms? [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5436.96s)]
*  In the beginning through space. Oh [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5441.72s)]
*  No, I like it right at one minute right at like one minute. You're right like one just showing videos though [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5443.92s)]
*  No, no, no, but there's talking over it is a narration over it. So try it now [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5450.02s)]
*  I'm like Paul why you're doing this just stop stop it isn't it's clearly like this is too much right now [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5453.740000000001s)]
*  You just kept pummeling me it's just kept hitting [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5460.9400000000005s)]
*  Thoroughly loved it. I've talked about it. He's about to start a hundred people [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5466.1s)]
*  You know everybody I know I'm like [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5471.580000000001s)]
*  You know, there's a theory out there and I didn't I have no clue what I'm talking about [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5474.540000000001s)]
*  So please [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5477.88s)]
*  This video is called the little season theory number one and the YouTube channels understanding conspiracies the little season theory number one [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5480.4800000000005s)]
*  It's so good [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5488.92s)]
*  Today to walk me through this here we go. Okay, I'll try and cover most spaces [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5496.36s)]
*  I'm not gonna be able to thoroughly explain every single nuance today in like two hours [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5501.68s)]
*  It's just it's just not going to happen. All right [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5506.34s)]
*  well, I'll try my best to do in this talk is give a [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5508.66s)]
*  Foundational overview of most of the talking points involved around this theory and it's a working theory. Let's bear that in mind [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5511.62s)]
*  We're still figuring things out [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5518.0s)]
*  There's multiple options for certain sections of this theory work work could have gone [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5519.5s)]
*  So I'll try my best to relay as much as I can [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5523.82s)]
*  But the basic premise to work off here is that what most modern Christians are waiting for [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5526.66s)]
*  Today is the return of Jesus Christ after the tribulation and we all have our eyes on the signs [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5532.46s)]
*  We'll trying to discern the signs around us trying to determine who the Antichrist will be what the mark of the beast will be [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5538.98s)]
*  All of those things we're kind of looking for them and waiting for those signs to happen [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5547.0199999999995s)]
*  Which will be the signs of the coming of the Son of Man in the clouds? [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5551.54s)]
*  okay, which would be tribulation judgments and then obviously a [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5554.94s)]
*  Millennial reign is what people are waiting for and we get to people get to live with Christ for a thousand years as it says in [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5559.62s)]
*  Revelation 20 [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5566.74s)]
*  So people are pretty adamant. We're living in that time. We're living in the time just before tribulation [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5568.179999999999s)]
*  It's just around the corner. It's just about to happen. Okay, that's what people are pretty adamant where we are [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5573.94s)]
*  That's the mainstream thought of not only conspiracy Christians, but just mainstream church anity [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5579.28s)]
*  That is the view of modern Christians we are in that time [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5584.78s)]
*  They've always been other views out there which say, you know, well, you know, it's a spiritual kingdom and we're living in it now [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5588.219999999999s)]
*  You know that goes on forever and ever and there's no physical kingdom and all these type of things [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5594.58s)]
*  You have a millennial lists who believe that type of thing and [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5599.08s)]
*  What this theory says kind of blows it all out of the water [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5603.66s)]
*  It's it's a completely new take on the situation and there has been a worldview called preterism [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5606.7s)]
*  Which was created a while ago and I think about that sixteen hundreds by [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5611.78s)]
*  Think it was people say it was a Jesuit, but it may have been a Jesuit but this [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5616.86s)]
*  Theory we have today is not preterism classically so-called [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5622.7s)]
*  it's kind of a something else and then a lot of people who don't like this idea will attack preterism and [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5626.3s)]
*  Think that's what we're talking about most preterists even they believe it's a spiritual kingdom and we're not saying that here [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5634.3s)]
*  This is talking about a real physical tangible thousand years were Christ reigned on earth [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5641.0199999999995s)]
*  This theory posits it's all already happened. We're not living in the times just before tribulation [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5647.139999999999s)]
*  We're living after the thousand-year reign of Christ [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5653.7s)]
*  He's already been on earth [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5657.66s)]
*  He has reigned for a thousand years on earth with his resurrected saints and the elect who survived through tribulation [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5658.94s)]
*  Wouldn't there be a record of that and? [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5666.299999999999s)]
*  Doesn't that make doesn't it make sense that Christians would document that [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5668.78s)]
*  Over like why why if there was a record and we knew then this wouldn't be a test [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5673.820000000001s)]
*  That wouldn't be a reason for the little season the little satanic season. He let Satan out he unchanged [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5679.58s)]

*  That's a fact to France lost like some insane percentage of their population in World War one some [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5897.18s)]
*  I think they lost 25% of their male population their 18 to 25 or 18 to 30 male [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5903.3s)]
*  Population in World War one and another 25% in World War two [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5909.74s)]
*  They paid heavy no one paid a heavy price in Russia Russia [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5913.62s)]

*  Mean Russia's been through so much just the amount of people that got starved by Stalin [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5923.74s)]
*  France provided crucial aid to the American colonists during the Revolutionary War including military support financial assistance and naval power ultimately contributing significantly [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5929.06s)]
*  To the American victory and independence. Yeah, they've helped us through everything [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5936.18s)]
*  Yeah [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5940.62s)]
*  So I think it's stupid that we hate France. I don't get it [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5941.78s)]
*  I think it's stupid that we hate Canada too. I don't get that Canada needs to get their shit together though [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5945.7s)]

*  Well, there's people that lost their bank account that don't only donated to the truckers. That's wild. That was crazy. They froze their money [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5993.0599999999995s)]
*  That was kind of the start of like them stopping all the crazy shit well, it's kind of a lot of people woke up the protest [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6000.34s)]
*  Yeah, once that once the truckers did that and they started shutting bank accounts [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6006.900000000001s)]

*  Hey, yeah, you know and then the next thing, you know, have you seen the DMT red laser light thing? [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6033.1s)]
*  I've heard about that. Yo, I heard it's nuts. Have you done it? [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6038.82s)]
*  No, but I've seen a bunch of videos on it. Apparently you do if you do DMT and you shoot a red laser [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6042.1s)]
*  I said Jamie a video you see no shoot a red laser. You see the matrix you see code [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6048.3s)]
*  Yeah, and everybody sees the same shit everybody not only that but if you like get above the laser and you look down [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6054.18s)]
*  Yes, you see layers of code. Yes. Yes. Check this out. I just saw a video of him saying he saw it too [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6060.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, this is on chase. He's the same thing. Is he a famous scientist or something? No, he was just on the podcast though [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6066.900000000001s)]
*  This guy was yeah, he's a mind control expert [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6072.14s)]
*  They explained psy ops and how he did on Instagram and I heard you and Danny talking about it. So you've done it [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6075.38s)]
*  Yeah, I saw it on Instagram and flew Danny to my house right away [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6081.22s)]
*  Like break this down for people because he's got shared amongst my group and it's like what the fuck [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6085.860000000001s)]
*  Exactly, and that's the only question you're still gonna have after you see it. It doesn't answer any questions. It just invites a lot more [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6094.5s)]
*  Yeah, nothing else. There's code [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6100.58s)]
*  Absolutely, there is code so the codes not like spinning there. It's like it's literally they kind of written out static [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6104.14s)]
*  It's static I can move the laser up and down and see all of the letters [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6110.74s)]
*  But it's like three-dimensional so I can get close to the wall. I [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6116.139999999999s)]
*  Can look down inside of the laser that way and I can look up in the laser that way [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6120.5s)]
*  But your best guess at explaining that I would be a fool. Okay, I love we can just leave it at that [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6126.299999999999s)]
*  Somebody like the code consciousness that we're projecting. They just discovered this [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6133.379999999999s)]
*  Well, I bet some eggheads probably I know I know the guy discovered it will have really I don't know him personally [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6138.16s)]
*  But Brandon McCaffer and one of my black belts [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6143.639999999999s)]

*  Let's pay attention to this fight. Is there a great fight? [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6150.799999999999s)]
*  That was seeing the matrix when you're on DMT with a red laser, yeah, how crazy any laser [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6154.96s)]
*  It's like a red laser. There's a bunch of videos on YouTube [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6161.5599999999995s)]
*  Like a specific laser or one of you do with a green laser, I don't know [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6165.02s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know but there's video of a bunch of people that's just one dude [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6168.14s)]
*  That's like the most you know, all the other guys are like stoner dudes [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6172.5s)]

*  Ability, you know, but [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6184.46s)]
*  Everybody sees the same shit. They see the fucking matrix the numbers the code isn't that fucking [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6186.820000000001s)]
*  Life-changing did you you saw that Tom Campbell interview that I did right? Yeah, I love that was one of my favorite ones [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6194.02s)]
*  Yeah, yeah when he's explaining to you that consciousness creates reality [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6200.5s)]
*  I you know what I never really took the simulation theory seriously, but [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6205.12s)]
*  You know, I I've always believed like Jesus a new thing for me like the the Shroud of Turin that that [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6211.34s)]
*  I'm all in now with the Shroud of Turin, but before that I was like, I don't know about Jesus [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6217.26s)]
*  Maybe but I believe in God and I believe in a creator like whoever created this shit is God [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6221.7s)]
*  Here we go, right gonna Nelson [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6226.9s)]
*  Kevin home and there must be code on how God created this yeah, so that that you know [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6228.62s)]
*  I think science like the simulation guys they're finding [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6234.4s)]
*  What God created like who else could put this simulation together, but a God who else here's the craziest theory [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6238.1s)]
*  You know AI is about to become sentient and then they're gonna do quantum computers with AI [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6245.78s)]
*  What if that's how Jesus comes back? What if Jesus? [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6251.139999999999s)]
*  re-emerges [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6255.0199999999995s)]
*  And he's just this voice created consciousness and he's on an app. Yeah [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6256.74s)]
*  By that time it probably would have to communicate to your fucking head [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6262.299999999999s)]
*  You mean they they've already figured out how to put signals into people's heads put voices in people's heads [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6266.54s)]
*  They can have they can literally have things [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6272.139999999999s)]
*  Say things to you or you hear voices in your head. Yeah, they have that technology [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6274.62s)]
*  And if quantum computing gets attached to AI and then it figures out how to make better versions of itself [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6280.94s)]
*  Like what does that mean? But isn't that similar like MK ultra what we're doing to compromise people [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6286.259999999999s)]
*  Well, that's right. How's it different though? [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6291.46s)]
*  Because MK ultra they were just trying to manipulate people with [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6293.66s)]
*  Acids and they were doing all sorts of different psychedelic drugs and doing it [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6296.78s)]
*  Yeah, but also try to get them to manipulate them so they can get them to do things like try to kill the putt the president [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6302.299999999999s)]
*  Like which they still do yeah, they have to still do there's no way they stop doing that [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6309.1s)]
*  And I guarantee if you could if there is a conspiracy theory about that kid in Pennsylvania tried to kill Trump [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6313.34s)]
*  Oh went to the ground gunner got him down [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6319.22s)]
*  Kevin's lost for his last five [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6322.700000000001s)]
*  Is a black belt but not gonna Nelson black got it else is so legit [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6326.22s)]

*  He's got to put a grip together around that arm right there. Just if he put a crime in our around army. Oh [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6337.62s)]
*  Oh my god, he's hanging on that arm. That can't be good for the shoulder. It's over now [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6343.78s)]
*  He's not gonna be able to hold on all he had to do was just grip s grip under the armpit [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6347.34s)]
*  And that was I rap. This is a tiring position though for gunner. He's holding his entire body [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6351.54s)]
*  It's time for Kevin to though. His legs are gassing out here for sure [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6355.7s)]
*  Yeah, and now he's out Gunner's weird one cuz he's not active [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6359.3s)]

*  What was last time you was there? Oh look at that another try I think Joe may it might be two but maybe three [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6366.38s)]
*  It's me. That's better. He's getting in there. Yeah gunner's not scared to get in there [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6370.54s)]
*  No, he's not scared and eventually you gave Kevin Hall on his black belt Travis Luthor. Oh shit. Okay [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6374.9800000000005s)]

*  His jiu-jitsu was off. Yeah considered one of the best jiu-jitsu players be Jeff Monson. Remember that I forgot Monson was fucking huge [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6392.5s)]
*  Yeah MMA wise he just never got over that hill like the top contenders [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6401.58s)]
*  Well, he's just not active enough and his striking is just not the same level as the elite guy [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6405.58s)]
*  Yeah, although he does have a good style that sort of karate. That was cool. Robert Whitaker type style. Hmm [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6410.38s)]

*  Oh, it's gonna start on the feet gunners in trouble. Yeah [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6535.44s)]
*  Yeah, he's good for Kevin. He needs a win man. He does it's been a while. He just for like five often [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6540.24s)]

*  I know he doesn't like the weight cut but so much better so tall and long and dangerous [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6555.16s)]

*  I'm gonna freak the fuck out. Yeah, but I was so impressed with what that guy did to Holland [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6579.72s)]
*  I was like that's impressive because he just already I handled him. Yeah man. He's grappling is good. He can't yeah [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6583.72s)]

*  Seven times since gunner Nelson's last fight, that's crazy. Oh [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6601.72s)]
*  Upper cut you got him with that uppercut. He also had a good grappling. Oh nasty punches to the body by Holland [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6605.52s)]
*  He also won set I went against Kate in one championship. Great just straight grappler if gunner can't take yeah [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6611.6s)]
*  I think yeah, yeah, yeah submitted. I think [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6616.8s)]
*  In trouble I didn't see that one. Yeah [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6622.28s)]
*  Gunner is not able to take Kevin down this round. He's gonna be in trouble [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6626.0s)]
*  And [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6631.360000000001s)]
*  Also, you got to think Kevin Hollins hungry right now, you know, cuz he still wants to be a champion [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6634.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's tough [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6641.0s)]
*  That's 70 though. He could do it. He could do it at 70 [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6642.4800000000005s)]
*  He's just got to be super focused and stay at 70 this hopping up and down and you know getting losses at 85 against [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6645.400000000001s)]
*  Doritos like 220 he's a but also being that active. It's tough to compete with the biggest guys that [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6653.6s)]
*  It's just tough to be that active right and be a tough guy. He thought comes out at 85 [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6658.639999999999s)]
*  Mm-hmm. Yeah, man [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6663.44s)]
*  Three hour notice. Yeah, man [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6665.16s)]
*  That was when Nate Diaz and him were supposed to fight [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6667.04s)]
*  Yeah, but a hums are came in eight pounds heavy and Kevin Holland stepped up and said I'll take it [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6669.5599999999995s)]
*  And Kevin was supposed to fight [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6675.92s)]
*  D-rod, you remember? Yep [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6678.639999999999s)]
*  Which is a great fight [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6681.48s)]
*  Gunners trying real hard for this take down man burning off a lot of fuel [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6683.32s)]
*  Almost I almost I almost has it. Oh, he would have kept stepping inside. He he would have done it [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6688.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, if he cut a circle a little bit better, but he's gotta be fatigued right now [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6693.92s)]
*  You know two plus minutes into the second and got beat up at the end of the first which takes a lot out of you [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6698.0s)]
*  That's a had his hands lost such a big factor. You know, you think about [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6704.88s)]
*  perceived skills [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6709.5199999999995s)]
*  Come on gunner you think about perceived skills versus current level after a guy gets rocked [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6711.04s)]
*  You know, you think he's still the same guy that he was early in the fight, but we got rocked [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6717.16s)]
*  Yeah [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6722.64s)]
*  Well, look at Makachev and Olivera. Mm-hmm. He clipped him and then like immediately passes guard and finish him. Yep. Yeah. Yep [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6723.8s)]
*  Or even on Kalaev and Pereira second round he gets rocked and then he's kind of not the same after that [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6731.4400000000005s)]
*  Much shy. Yeah much more defensive after that forgot the game plan a little bit kept him his back to the cage, bro [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6738.96s)]
*  I saw a good breakdown of on Kalaev stand up against Pereira. It was very high level super impressive [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6745.04s)]
*  Especially taking away the front hand circle. He's doing this circular motion with his hand and taking away angles [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6750.68s)]
*  Apparently the run that rematch back. Oh, we got down almost they're gonna run it back. I'm sure [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6759.0s)]
*  He has to have to that's the big fight in that division and if Pereira can come in healthy [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6764.04s)]
*  He's oh, we got him down, but he's another one. He's too active too active [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6769.24s)]
*  But he's smart too because he's 36 37. He's like I'm gonna go man. I'm gonna make it much money as possible [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6774.0s)]
*  He's done that he's made become an all-time great in you know, three years, which is crazy [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6779.36s)]
*  He's give 10-8 first round gotta be 10-8, right? It's hard to say because Gunnar had him down for a while. Yeah [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6783.88s)]
*  You know, I mean judges I got him in Omaha plot. He did rock him at the end [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6790.96s)]
*  Yeah, I count those and unfortunately, they don't count like but near submissions. I think near submissions are big [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6795.84s)]
*  I'm with you close. It should be tonight like Olivera versus our monster [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6802.38s)]
*  Uki, and I feel like Olivera almost had him a couple times [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6807.46s)]
*  Yes, and what he had what did he have been a Darce and was ours guillotine? [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6811.34s)]
*  You know, it's a stop if you have something cinched up and that's a lot, you know the shame of that triangle [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6815.4800000000005s)]
*  Yes [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6820.8s)]
*  That should have been five rounds. That's five rounds. Charles probably wins that you but yeah, I think so too [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6822.54s)]
*  Maybe I mean who knows but he would have been a chance [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6827.46s)]
*  But if you count like near submissions as like much more point get no credit [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6830.14s)]
*  You don't get credit like you do if you rock a guy but it is it's it's you're close to finishing a fight [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6835.96s)]
*  But did it to that same point like with Alex Pierre defending 12 takedowns 12 for 12 [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6841.12s)]
*  You get no fucking credit right guy attempted 12 takedowns. You couldn't do it [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6845.900000000001s)]
*  That guy gets no who should get credit the guy defend the takedown. No [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6850.62s)]
*  You don't get credit you get credit for like not getting hit [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6855.22s)]
*  Well, you get a little bit a little bit a little bit [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6858.88s)]
*  I don't think you should get credit for defense the big credit is the submission attempts. Yeah [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6861.76s)]
*  For offense not defense. He's going to it again. Can you imagine you get points for escaping an arm bar? [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6867.68s)]
*  Like that would be retarded. That'd be dope [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6872.6s)]
*  See, this is interesting, right? [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6875.92s)]
*  Because Kevin was doing a lot of damage at the end of the first but a lot of it was on the back and then here [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6877.4400000000005s)]
*  You got Gunnar takes him down [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6883.8s)]
*  After unsuccessfully taking him down for like three minutes and he's doing something he's on top [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6886.2s)]
*  Oh, he was around right, but no nothing's happening. Did you know I'm saying? Yeah, you're gonna take down [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6891.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that one's you know, I'm saying like nothing's happening. She's not getting any damage heaven didn't do anything true. Yeah [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6896.84s)]
*  So so in that situation, yeah [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6902.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but it's not as good as like a guy rocking you I know right it's exactly there's a difference [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6907.52s)]
*  The whole score system is fucked it's both those rounds are not ten nines the second rounds at ten nine first round [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6914.5s)]
*  How is that at that night? He almost not? [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6921.22s)]
*  They should be able to stop right at the end saved by the bell like box [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6924.22s)]
*  How is that right when a guy gets dropped? It's automatically a ten eight. Yes. Yeah, I guys in trouble [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6927.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's a good move [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6932.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6934.700000000001s)]
*  When a guy gets dropped but then you got you know fights like where a guy gets dropped and gets up and drops the other [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6934.9800000000005s)]
*  Guy like, you know, evens out. Yeah, I guess I think even rounds are okay [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6940.54s)]
*  More comprehensive scoring system. Yes, I think the whole 10-9 is crazy because we just took it from boxing and we're like, okay [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6946.54s)]
*  That's a established point system for fighting but you're using it with something that has all these different elements take down submission [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6952.62s)]
*  octagon control [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6960.46s)]
*  There's so many more [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6962.0199999999995s)]
*  Factors and then you look at the people scoring it these judges half of know what the fuck they're looking at. That's a good fight [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6964.34s)]
*  Moreno and ursa that ursa guy almost beat pento. That's that we were doing EBI in Mexico City the next day [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6970.12s)]
*  Oh Saturday next day EBI 23 the featherweights with strikes. We're bringing back strikes in EBI [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6976.96s)]
*  Hell yeah strikes or there's enough so only jiu-jitsu combat jiu-jitsu. So slaps. Yeah [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6984.280000000001s)]
*  Can you punch the body you could punch to the you could strike to the body just you could strike anywhere punch not punch [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6991.240000000001s)]
*  The body yeah boss room style yeah as next Sunday guys UFC fight practicing their body strikes [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6997.72s)]
*  Are they like working on that? Oh Jesus they should [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7005.04s)]
*  Kevin's so dangerous the clay he's hitting him with a hard body shots man the clay. Oh elbow over the top. Oh knee good knee [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7010.280000000001s)]
*  Kevin's got to go for broke [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7020.04s)]
*  Because he probably won the first round. I think he won the first round for sure for second round [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7021.88s)]
*  No, so this is it and Kevin needs to win. He's landing some uppercuts [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7026.24s)]
*  Oh Gunners in deep Gunners in deep always out of it [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7031.58s)]
*  His hands locked anymore on the body [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7037.04s)]
*  Strength, oh we got him. He's just trying to get out of the cage. You got him full mount full mount. Oh shit here it is [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7040.28s)]
*  Kevin's in trouble [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7046.5599999999995s)]
*  Gonna announce him full mount third third round grapevine in the legs [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7048.04s)]
*  He rushed in the back taking the first round though. He should take his time from here. Yep [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7052.0s)]
*  I mean he's got time his feet off the fact that he's not feet off the cage the fact that he's not digging for underhooks [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7055.42s)]
*  Right now it's kind of scary. You should took his feet off like like why won't you immediately go for the underhook? [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7061.34s)]
*  Yeah, that's like what was your plan in the mount? [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7068.1s)]
*  There herks and at least take his feet off the cage. That's what got him out [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7071.82s)]
*  You shouldn't be you're not supposed to dig your toes in the face Gordon Gordon if you were in the mount right there [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7075.3s)]
*  You would immediately grab the underhook and under jack to like an arm triangle right? Yeah under her right under hook [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7080.14s)]
*  Well, the first thing is to circle his feet off the cage because that gives him you're saying circle him to the center of the octagon [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7085.42s)]
*  Yes, because the bridge off the cage just gives you a men's correct totally but but besides that that underhook that and under jack [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7091.26s)]
*  arm triangle, yeah, right oh [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7098.5s)]
*  Damn look at that. He's gonna come out. He should really not jocquery out from the bottom. Yep from garden [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7104.02s)]
*  How about Hanzo on old egg talk? Oh, yeah [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7109.82s)]
*  Upkicked that was the first time we saw like an effective upkick. Yeah, and then Jerry Bolander on [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7113.5199999999995s)]
*  He's gonna pass him here. No, uh [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7119.0s)]
*  Or Fabio Jurgel or pass him. He's got the back. He's got one hook. I [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7121.68s)]
*  Think there's probably like 10. Oh [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7127.5599999999995s)]
*  Triangle there it is [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7129.92s)]
*  Kevin's left hip he's got a mount him just [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7132.4s)]
*  He's got his left knee across [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7135.36s)]
*  Hit and they not my enough pressure [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7138.36s)]
*  Within half guard from half guard [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7140.759999999999s)]
*  It depends if he has a good lockdown or not if he had a good lockdown he would survive [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7142.679999999999s)]
*  But he just got it why he's not passing the guard here. I'm not sure [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7146.599999999999s)]
*  It's also hard for him to dismount from here because the cage is in the way [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7150.36s)]
*  He's got even if he does there it is [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7154.36s)]
*  Here it comes. Okay. So now he's gonna try to either mount him or slice that knee for [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7156.599999999999s)]
*  But he's kind of like he's kind of wedged in place by the cage [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7161.0s)]
*  You should be there it is here it goes here it comes. He's probably just he probably knows what's up. He's just [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7164.1s)]
*  waiting to [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7171.0599999999995s)]
*  Catches his breath. Oh should not take the back [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7173.0599999999995s)]
*  Nice by Kevin [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7177.42s)]
*  Gunner should have switched back to a tight waist when Kevin went to roll out should break free here [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7181.42s)]
*  She break free here and start eating off on him [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7185.38s)]
*  Got her held on to the trying arm triangle too long [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7188.86s)]
*  He should have mounted in my in my opinion like like all arm triangles in my opinion should be in the mount once you start [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7191.86s)]
*  Going side control. There's too many escapes that escapes are too easy [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7198.299999999999s)]
*  Well, you should have at least set it better for mount like it wasn't set like you should have mounted him [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7201.0599999999995s)]
*  Kevin's gonna come out of hard here. Yeah, he's got to [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7209.299999999999s)]
*  She can't get taken down. Oh [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7213.02s)]
*  Damn this is gonna be a hard one to score [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7215.9800000000005s)]
*  super hard to score [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7219.02s)]
*  Don't try to go for a Darce looks like it looked like you thought about it [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7222.06s)]
*  Yeah, he's looking for it for sure [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7227.42s)]
*  Disengage Kevin. I know right especially now. He's got his hands locked [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7230.62s)]
*  And [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7236.62s)]
*  He had times to disengage and he's got an advantage in the striking huge advantage [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7239.74s)]
*  But also like so exhausted at this point in the fight [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7245.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he's probably turning arrest [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7248.82s)]
*  Total strikes Kevin 130 gunner 20 [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7254.219999999999s)]
*  Gunners gonna win it you think less can't have Kevin catches him three seconds to go [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7260.94s)]
*  so [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7266.219999999999s)]
*  Ten nine ten nine gunner, but then ten eight in the first round. What is that a draw? [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7268.219999999999s)]
*  You do ten nine Holland first round. There's gonna be a draw ten nine if they gave him ten eight for the first round [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7274.0599999999995s)]
*  No, I agree, but the judges agree the judges are goofy [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7283.0599999999995s)]
*  Judges are goofy. It all depends. It depends. I don't think they had a ten eights enough [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7288.38s)]
*  They still have Adlai Bird does she still work I don't know it's good question she was awesome she was the best [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7293.219999999999s)]
*  That's a good question. What is this movie? [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7300.46s)]

*  He did a damn done it didn't arm triangle. Yeah, and he did take him down [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7391.46s)]

*  But then but let's see in Ryan Hall was he ripped through some people with leg locks, but then BJ. Yeah, which is crazy [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7545.620000000001s)]

*  That was a sometimes you're gonna run into guys that you cannot leg lock and when it's all greasy [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7575.62s)]
*  But also you get to a certain level where guys can stop your game at leg lots [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7581.9800000000005s)]
*  And if you don't have striking you get exposed. It's why I'm gonna find it was well versed in [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7587.42s)]

*  Tight rope was actually allergic to the hardware. They put in me somewhere somehow [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7664.820000000001s)]
*  Had to have that redone. It's been interesting but back on the end of it [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7670.18s)]
*  On the back end of it rather Wow [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7675.06s)]
*  That's crazy [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7677.820000000001s)]
*  Boy, wow, it's a shame no idea. That's so many surgeries. I thought he retired [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7679.26s)]
*  That's crazy. How many surgeries have you had? [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7685.1s)]
*  One just one. Yeah my LCL. Yeah, I've been injured a lot, but just one surgery. Yeah, was that from a leg lock [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7688.34s)]
*  Any communes? No [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7694.9400000000005s)]
*  Eddie broke my ankles a bunch of times, but uh, I was when I competed against you out Rocha [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7696.9800000000005s)]
*  I was going for a leg lock entry and he was like 270. That's right jump towards my head. What happened Eddie, dude [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7701.62s)]
*  I don't know. He just like disappeared one day and then apparently he was like training like pretty recently at Enzo's and unity [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7707.68s)]
*  But he just like stopped [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7715.14s)]
*  Training should see forever got a real job. I think and then that guy was vicious man. So good [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7717.3s)]
*  Smart I was I was [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7723.9800000000005s)]
*  Standing over him as he ripped through everybody with leg locks my god [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7725.900000000001s)]
*  Damn he was on he was on some other shit. You know what I mean? He was vicious and then you hear from [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7729.9s)]
*  His training partners that man he he went hard right in the training room. He went after legs. They get they dig it hard. Yeah [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7737.26s)]
*  It's weird when guys would get that good and just stop [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7746.0199999999995s)]
*  When after he retired he still put out a couple like videos a little short instructionals on Instagram and [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7749.66s)]
*  This one he put out for the z-lock that to me is the best like in my opinion the z-lock the one he showed [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7757.099999999999s)]
*  That's the best. It's not a sad story if you want to do something cool. They just want to do it's kind of dope [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7764.26s)]
*  They's like fucking I'm over it if he went on to make money. He's doing well, you know, yeah [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7768.9s)]
*  Depends what he's doing. What do you think is the best leg lock one leg lock? [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7773.9s)]
*  You're gonna teach your students just one leg lock entry and one [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7777.58s)]
*  Heel hook what's it gonna be? [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7782.46s)]
*  Well, and so far as breaking mechanics or no like they say they got the breaking mechanics down and just which where's or your the legs [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7785.46s)]
*  Gonna be which leg entanglement are you gonna choose? [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7793.1s)]
*  Which one's the best? [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7796.46s)]
*  Obviously, it's not DOA. It's not outside. Ah, she [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7797.9800000000005s)]
*  And not just regular ah, she either that one's no basic [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7802.18s)]
*  backside 5050 is pretty good [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7807.38s)]
*  Right when you go go because I hear from backside 5050 coming in from kegar right? Yeah, I hear like from my guys [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7810.38s)]
*  I'm not like the biggest leg locker [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7817.54s)]
*  But I pay attention to my guys and they're saying that the entry into backside 5050 is awesome [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7818.7s)]
*  But you don't really generally get the tap there [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7824.62s)]
*  There's gonna be some kind of scramble and some kind of you can but the guy can [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7827.78s)]
*  High leg over if you trap the far leg the secondary leg then you can get finishes Billy down with it [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7831.34s)]
*  Which is why it's a good position, but a good guy is always gonna is always gonna limp leg and strip the grip [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7836.3s)]
*  Which is why I believe that probably the best position [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7841.780000000001s)]
*  In terms of not having a guy come forward and crush you or hit you and strong catastrophic breaking mechanics is probably [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7846.58s)]
*  Cross-octagon army your guys's honey hole. So that's still the best [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7853.9800000000005s)]
*  Double trouble. Yeah, so you feel you feed the one leg across the legs are split [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7858.18s)]
*  So you have Achilles lock here and I think for the heel and then you go in okay and lock up [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7862.0199999999995s)]
*  It's still the best. Okay, but my highest percentage finish [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7866.98s)]
*  is [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7870.58s)]
*  That position but with the leg fit on the outside for the outside heel hook. That's like z lock ish, right? [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7872.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, kind of yeah, so cuz z lock is basically double trouble with the outside heel hook correct and and instead of [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7877.74s)]
*  Triangling your legs [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7884.74s)]
*  Stomping on the inside. Yeah, you can get foot to foot. What is that what you guys call it foot to foot? Yeah, that's you [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7886.259999999999s)]
*  That's like game changer right there and that right there [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7890.58s)]
*  Just a straight ankle lock is the most powerful straight ankle lock from that position right there with it with it on the outside [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7893.7s)]
*  Oh, no, the secondary leg. Yeah, that's straight ankle lock and the aoki. Yeah, he's strong as well [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7898.82s)]
*  How crazy are you a okies a okies are a lot like dead orchards where in the what the first time I seen a aoki [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7904.62s)]
*  Is it's from Shinya aoki it seemed like he was going for just a straight ankle lock [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7910.94s)]
*  But dude, I forget his opponent was but his foot almost slipped out [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7916.46s)]
*  So it was a straight it looked like a straight ankle lock that he almost pulled his foot out [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7921.06s)]
*  But it got caught and twisted. Yeah, yeah, yeah, and everyone thought maybe not everyone but I thought oh, that's one of those [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7924.4800000000005s)]
*  You know freak things that you don't actually plan for it or set up for it [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7931.3s)]
*  It just happens sometimes they pull out of ankle locks and sometimes like [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7935.5s)]
*  An omoplata sometimes when they try to pull out their own with omoplata it gets caught and they tap an arm bar [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7940.1s)]
*  It's not like you set it up. It's like a freak thing [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7945.18s)]
*  They try to get out, but it got caught and then they tap [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7948.34s)]
*  So that's what I thought the aoki was but it turns out fuck [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7950.66s)]
*  No, that's it seems like the aoki is top two leg lock finishes in the grappling world today [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7954.3s)]
*  It's just people get because it's so good to counter with them, correct? Yeah [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7961.22s)]
*  No, you get you get you get good finishes with aoki's what's an okie? [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7965.14s)]
*  It's a lock but when they slip their their their heel out [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7968.5s)]
*  It's still like it's like you're going for an ankle lock and they almost pull out the leg and then it turns into a heel [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7972.26s)]
*  Hook, so it's half ankle lock half heel hook huge. It's like the most powerful shit [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7976.320000000001s)]
*  It's not mechanically as strong as a heel hook though, because when you go for your hooks [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7980.74s)]
*  You're physically bridging your hip into the knee. Yeah, whereas with Ioke's the knee is turned out [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7984.14s)]
*  So you're bridging you're not bridging into the knee in a way to break it [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7988.46s)]
*  Yeah, whereas what's like an inverted heel hook? For example, you have a good strong connection [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7991.38s)]
*  You have a good strong connection, but when you go to bridge you see like you see how you see [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7997.1s)]
*  You say he's not bridging into the hip. Yeah, so with a heel hook you're bridging directly into the hip [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8001.780000000001s)]
*  So it's the it's a full extension of your body into the knee [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8006.5s)]
*  So the upper leg is pinned through the leg position and then your dripping position is what's manipulating the foot [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8010.26s)]
*  And and scroll down a little bit Jamie and look at the guy on the [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8016.14s)]
*  That one on the right the one you had the big one on the right that now we can't see it on the right [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8018.860000000001s)]
*  That one right there. Can you blow that up? [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8023.34s)]
*  And [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8025.34s)]
*  The dude doing the aoke lock his right leg the way I think people are calling that a shadow hook or whatever [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8026.18s)]
*  Silverado he's a catch wrestler Brazilian catch wrestler showed me that when I was a white belt [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8033.06s)]
*  I'm a straight ankle remember he used to do that. He used to do that and I thought like oh this thing [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8038.26s)]
*  This is nothing so I always I never really fucked with it. But now it's back [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8042.82s)]
*  Strong like Helena Crevara is doing this exact thing. This is like her main [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8048.34s)]
*  Move Silverado had a lot of Jean Lebel stuff. Yeah, it was a catch wrestling [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8052.98s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of that. This is a great position because [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8056.139999999999s)]
*  Like with the guy who's attacking his right leg. Usually the guy's trying to peel it off the hip [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8060.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, so when you peel it off the hip that butterfly hook comes in and then normally you would throw that left leg [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8064.86s)]
*  Over so now you can't step over the you can't disengage the legs as easy and [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8071.58s)]
*  Dude putting his right leg there if he put it traditionally you'd put it on the hip [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8075.98s)]
*  That you could get countered with a hooks or a naoki [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8080.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, so that's huge like a regular ashi everyone's like I got guys that just let dudes put them in ashi [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8082.74s)]
*  So they could take that foot and and it's a whole it's a game changer [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8087.86s)]
*  And also because the right foot is on the inside position. It makes it hard for the guy in defense the [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8091.259999999999s)]
*  Defensive guy. Yeah to push forward into you [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8097.259999999999s)]
*  Yes, it's hard for him to come forward because the Ioki you have to push into the lock [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8099.62s)]
*  You put your foot deeper to boot it [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8103.459999999999s)]
*  But the butterfly hook stops [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8105.459999999999s)]
*  It stops you from pushing the foot in deeper. Yeah the guy who [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8107.46s)]
*  There was I don't know. I think the first guy to really really master it was the Polish guy, so we're [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8112.18s)]
*  What's his name he's he he arm barred Gary Tonan that guy what's his name Mattias [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8121.06s)]
*  Shazinski yeah, Shazinski that guy [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8127.14s)]
*  Yeah, everyone talks about him. I've never trained with him, but apparently he was like he was the [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8130.58s)]
*  I've never trained with him, but apparently he was like he was the right button. He just been breaking everybody exactly [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8134.58s)]
*  So we're and he was doing his legs just like that. You know it was a Ioki with that leg entanglement [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8139.78s)]
*  We were calling it the Polish a Ioki. Yeah, you know and he's a bad [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8145.1s)]
*  Well, it's difficult because the butterfly hook doesn't allow you to stack [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8149.98s)]
*  He doesn't know you come forward and push your foot deeper [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8152.82s)]
*  I'd never forget silverado showing me that as a wipeout and I'm thinking really [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8155.36s)]
*  Ken Shamrock puts his leg up here [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8161.3s)]
*  Like learning shit off Ken Shamrock [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8165.14s)]
*  I learned I got into toll holes as a white belt because Ken Shamrock had this instructional where he's in [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8167.5s)]
*  Jeans and no shirt. He's all tanned and yoke [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8173.66s)]
*  He looked like a Chippendales guy and he's with some Japanese guy and then he's going over told like [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8177.74s)]
*  Standing over a guy's guard and grabbing the foot and doing a toe hold. I'm like whoa [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8182.78s)]
*  What is he doing with the foot and I could never get on top of anybody? [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8187.46s)]
*  I was always I pulled I've taken down one person my whole life and that was in wrestling. I had one wrestling take [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8191.18s)]
*  I had one rest. I'd wrestled two years got one takedown because I was afraid to break my teeth. Everyone's missing teeth [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8198.14s)]
*  I didn't want to shoot. I go you shooting off sprawl. I'm like you shoot off sprawl. I got a good front headlock [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8205.300000000001s)]
*  I got a good front headlock, but I can't zero takedowns unless [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8210.14s)]
*  It's a dude that doesn't wrestle like when I would I got in a couple street fights here [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8214.74s)]
*  I was never I was always a pussy growing up [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8219.04s)]
*  I was never a tough guy [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8221.06s)]
*  But every now and then you know I wrestled and I never looked at wrestling as a martial art [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8222.04s)]
*  I looked at his pussy fighting. I go dude. I'm not a fighter. No one thinks I'm a fighter [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8226.96s)]
*  I don't have a reputation to uphold but if anybody fucks with me [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8230.44s)]
*  I'm gonna double like him and just hold them until the principal breaks us up [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8233.46s)]
*  You know, I was like dude. I was grounded and pounding in ninth grade. I [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8237.04s)]
*  Would take dudes out. I fought this one soccer player his name was Cesar [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8241.52s)]
*  He was talking a lot of shit and I go dude [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8245.16s)]
*  He'll probably kick my ass [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8247.0s)]
*  But he can't stop my takedown because this dude don't wrestle so I take him down and I would just like get side control [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8248.0s)]
*  And I barely punch the his stomach and wait for someone to pull me off [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8253.16s)]
*  I survived [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8257.64s)]
*  Fight UFC to I'm like you can fight on the ground and not be a pussy. That's why I joined you Jitson like oh my god [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8260.32s)]

*  Okay [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8272.48s)]

*  That's that older old school fight. So if you're a polish 42, I think they you're older younger [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8304.84s)]
*  What do you say? I don't know those shoulders are every bit of 42. Yeah, well, who see we'll see we'll see like look [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8311.119999999999s)]

*  So if a guy mauls you and just comes at you with a lot of combinations and hits you with a pace [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9058.84s)]
*  Yeah, you're kind of sorry. Yeah, they catch up here. You get a grappler can avoid the big shot. Mm-hmm [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9063.400000000001s)]
*  Third round you're fucked and obviously that weight class is filled with talent. There's so much talent there [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9068.44s)]
*  I was discussing guy won't say who it is. He's coming back to UFC and his buddies like [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9074.28s)]
*  He's like man. What matchup do you think? He's like we just need to give him an easy matchup for his first one [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9079.72s)]
*  I'm like buddy. It's 2025 in the UFC. There's no cakewalks [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9084.44s)]
*  Yeah, there used to be cakewalks. There was guys like thank God they gave me him [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9088.24s)]
*  Really not that with the contender series like this it's just full of these young fucking lions [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9091.92s)]
*  Yeah, the guy is there zero fights in the UFC are super fucking dangerous. That's what's crazy [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9097.36s)]
*  Zero fights and they come in at a world-class level and they're like well-rounded everything actually these motherfuckers from Russia [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9103.28s)]
*  Yeah, there's so many Dagestan guys that are coming in and like good lord. They're so dangerous [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9110.08s)]
*  There's no gimme fights anymore. No [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9116.12s)]
*  Oh [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9118.18s)]
*  Burke seems to be out pointing them here a little more active. Yeah, I read there. We're still speed advantage. Mm-hmm [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9120.64s)]
*  And yawn hasn't landed any big shots to the head like the big one [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9128.220000000001s)]
*  It's gonna really change the course of the fight. No, he looks a little slower, but he's just dealing with a very tall fast, dude [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9132.42s)]
*  It's gonna get weird for yawn. He loses this one. You're off two years. Mm-hmm [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9139.42s)]
*  The division state it's in it's tough, man [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9144.18s)]
*  Well, we'll see there's still three minutes fucking crazy is MMA. It's like Alka Volkovsky before he lost those two [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9148.82s)]
*  He was like there's arguing the pound-for-pound number one. He was on the like number two and then three months later [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9154.800000000001s)]
*  He's not even on the list. Yep, yeah on Edwards [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9161.2s)]
*  Yep, before he lost below was I think number five pound-for-pound. He's not not even on the list crazy this one. You're kind of fucked [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9163.7s)]
*  MMA is wild man [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9171.66s)]
*  Yeah, I'm with another good strong low kick [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9173.42s)]
*  But he needs more than that it needs some headshots. Mm-hmm. He needs to get the judge's attention. I [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9176.06s)]
*  Wonder what the live odds are right now. Oh Berg for sure gotta be over right? [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9183.26s)]
*  Just from a volume perspective, yeah, just active [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9190.58s)]
*  He looks like he's gonna spin that was close he's a heavily bladed [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9198.06s)]
*  Good left hook right hand. We're starting to sit down on sponges now [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9205.78s)]
*  Is it interesting? [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9210.02s)]
*  But yeah, 160 [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9213.94s)]
*  But still old Burke's favorite [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9217.460000000001s)]
*  It's just Yon is having a hard time connecting [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9221.460000000001s)]
*  And over an issue is not slowing down over done such a much better job of pacing himself now [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9224.66s)]
*  Yeah, and he obviously is in better condition to yes, and it's distance. I look he's never stopped hopping around [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9230.26s)]
*  It's fucking tough take two years off. Then you jump in with a killer's ranked number six, man. It's not easy [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9235.54s)]
*  Especially a young dude all hungry beyond still trying. It's like gutter Nelson taking two years off and jumping back in it's fucking tough, man [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9242.1s)]
*  Good kick Sean Brady's favored is he yeah Sean Brady's favorite over four and a half rounds is also favorite. Yes interesting [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9252.66s)]
*  Yes, this card has a potential to be you know, if you're looking for knockouts this might not be the one card for you [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9260.380000000001s)]
*  It's tough for Brady to stop Leon, yeah [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9270.06s)]
*  Very tough. It's gonna be interesting to see how he fares on the feet because Leon's such a technician on the feet [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9273.5s)]
*  He's such a sniper, but he's also gonna be super wary about the takedown [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9279.9s)]
*  But he's been trying to take people down to kind of like prove a point like he did with Camaro [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9283.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I hope he doesn't try to do that with Sean bad idea [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9288.3s)]
*  Yeah, it's a different level and Brady just it's just like in the fifth round you look at that Gilbert fight [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9292.74s)]
*  It's like you had more takedowns in the fifth round like his cardio is insane. Yeah, he's very fit [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9298.38s)]
*  Olberg seems to be walking away from it [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9306.259999999998s)]
*  Over again getting a title shot after this one though. No [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9310.42s)]
*  But it puts him in the top for sure heat. Yeah top five [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9314.06s)]
*  He just hasn't done anything like real spectacular [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9319.179999999998s)]
*  over just aware of round tree and [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9323.82s)]
*  Jamal Hill would be fun [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9326.9s)]
*  John still pushing though, man. He's going after him good low kicks. Oh, oh, oh, oh, we clipped him with that left hand [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9328.9s)]
*  Yeah, John can't get his range [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9336.42s)]
*  Mmm good fight solid fight [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9340.179999999998s)]
*  There's she on each other [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9344.66s)]
*  Warriors [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9347.46s)]
*  Guys being guys. Yeah, just a couple of bros a couple bros [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9349.539999999999s)]
*  Just fighting shadow at each other. Yeah, I think over probably got that decision. Yeah slight decision [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9354.22s)]
*  I'm very interested to see how Sean deals with the stand-up [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9359.1s)]
*  You know because Sean stand-up has come a long way, but there's levels big big difference [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9363.5s)]
*  Yeah, he's got there's a big difference on the feet too, right? [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9368.94s)]
*  So it's all about who and will their will right, right? [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9371.539999999999s)]
*  Well, if Sean can get him down early like balala did it would be a big thing and balala set the blueprint [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9375.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah, constant pressure. Yep, but I do think you have to take into consideration the fact that that was a 5 a.m. [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9381.58s)]
*  Fight which is just nuts. I mean sucks, but if this but your pros [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9386.86s)]
*  I know but like you gotta go man. How crazy is that like everybody in the audience has been drunk since 2 in the morning [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9391.86s)]
*  They're like, yeah, it's tough [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9397.56s)]
*  They're all exhausted. They're fucking filled with beer, you know [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9399.5s)]
*  There's people sleeping they were sleeping they were sleeping it was so they must be so exhausted [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9404.06s)]
*  I can't imagine going to see a fight. That's the main event starts at 5 in the morning [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9410.1s)]
*  I think a main event was like 6 in the morning. Yes, that's rough. It's ridiculous. It's terrible [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9415.22s)]
*  Why don't just do it this way just have the fights on early, you know, that was a pay-per-view, right? [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9420.18s)]
*  Yeah, that's why yeah, but still have a pay-per-view of 3 in the afternoon. Who cares? I prefer it [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9425.62s)]
*  Yeah, who cares my night Saturday people will still buy it they watch football in the day true [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9431.1s)]
*  Why wouldn't they watch a big fight during the day? Just let them know in advance. It's 3 p.m. Start [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9436.66s)]
*  Don't only complain. Here we go. I'm Aspen all [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9441.66s)]

*  two years off [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9463.52s)]
*  Not really a tune-up fight tough fight [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9465.04s)]
*  There's no tune-up fights. There's that that's what I'm saying the UFC. There's there's not much they can do for you [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9467.6s)]
*  That's what's crazy cuz boxing I think has it right when a guy hasn't been fighting for a while [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9472.2s)]
*  Give him some fucking shake off the dust. Okay, you don't know number 30 guy right out of Tijuana [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9476.32s)]

*  Yeah, and they don't have managers that like set their fighter up for victory either like on the under cards like now [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9486.2s)]
*  You're gonna face a brawler now. You're gonna face a short guy. Oh Bob's and we's now you're gonna face a tall guy [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9492.68s)]
*  Yeah, they you know, they by the time a guy gets to a championship level in boxing. They've been tried [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9498.720000000001s)]
*  It's very systematic. Yes. He's not like that. I know [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9504.480000000001s)]
*  Did you see the Lamont Roach? [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9508.800000000001s)]
*  Javante Davis fight. Yes. Oh [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9511.24s)]
*  I'd love my own roach denture. Yeah, well, especially with that knockdown. Yeah, that's a real lock down while you take a knee [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9513.359999999999s)]
*  That's 10-8 round and they did Javante's and I had something in my eye. I'm like, I don't give fuck you took a knee [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9520.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know the rules. That's the rules [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9525.519999999999s)]
*  That's the rule dim the rules and they didn't have the replay ready. So the they didn't look at the so crop, dude [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9527.48s)]
*  Dana get involved in it might help it perhaps. Yeah. Yeah [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9536.0s)]
*  You know, you know can't change the tiger stripes. Well, it's gonna you see their pace structure [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9541.08s)]
*  It's also far away out from getting done because guys are in a concert structure legit though. Yeah, was it legit? Yeah [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9547.32s)]
*  That's the I mean the pretty sure it's legit, but that actually helps boxing overall [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9553.48s)]
*  Nice so that the top dogs aren't gonna eat like they are now with 40 50 million dollar paydays [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9558.679999999998s)]
*  But the middle guys that can grow box and that's where that's what what it's gonna do [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9563.48s)]
*  But if you want to get the top guys you're gonna have to pay [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9567.42s)]
*  Them correct on that pay structure ain't getting any of the big. Yeah, you're not [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9569.82s)]
*  Obviously they got Canelo to get away from the Jake Paul fight, right? [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9574.5s)]
*  The Canelo was gonna fight Jake Paul, which would have been crazy Wow, and then they said no, no, no, no, no [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9578.14s)]
*  Turkey came along and said listen open up the fucking case from Pulp Fiction. Yeah [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9585.460000000001s)]

*  They could just throw money at the sport. It's good and bad. We get the fight to want to see but that's also you know [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9597.6s)]
*  It's good [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9602.92s)]
*  There's some darkness that the fights you want to see is what's most important for the fans and they're putting shit together [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9603.52s)]
*  You know, they made Jared Anderson fight for Cole. Yeah, there's a lot of fights that people didn't want [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9608.2s)]
*  you know, which is like Jared Anderson that was another example like young undefeated heavyweight on his way up and [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9613.92s)]
*  Everyone was like don't take that fight. Yeah, you're not ready for that fight. And then they offered him a pile of loot [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9620.6s)]
*  He's all say less and he got beat up [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9626.28s)]
*  Yeah, and then Bacoli getting stopped by Joseph Parker coming in fat with no no notice at all nothing [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9628.92s)]
*  Look, he was totally out of shape or notice like something crazy. Yeah. Yeah, cool. Like super short notice. Yeah crazy crazy fight. I [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9634.68s)]

*  Well, he probably wants revenge after that below fight, you know, that was a bad fight for him [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10036.039999999999s)]
*  That was a tough night. He just didn't seem into it either right like something was off [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10041.359999999999s)]

*  How can you fight it your best when you're up all night? [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10049.76s)]
*  But also he's the champ like why wouldn't you set up so the champs in ideal conditions? [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10052.199999999999s)]

*  But that's me at 5 a.m. That makes sense when you're the champ in your hometown. Why the fuck we don't have 5 a.m [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10060.640000000001s)]
*  I don't know. The whole thing is crazy though [[02:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10065.76s)]
*  Just the idea of getting people to fight at that time, but there's also a lot of X-factor [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10068.300000000001s)]
*  We don't know behind the scenes like UFC's like first of all TV right deal only time we could do it with the broadcast [[02:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10072.0s)]

*  I bet there's some other X factors like it has to be there has to be bias in America or bigger than everywhere else [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10085.36s)]
*  It has to be that and they it has to be the people used to buying it. Yeah, you know seven o'clock at night [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10090.12s)]

*  He's losing and John Anik with the perfect call like John Anik said that is not the club like he could quit right now [[02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10292.359999999999s)]
*  But that is not the cloth from which he was cut bro [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10298.24s)]
*  Headkick and his coach was like come on. Come on rocky [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10301.38s)]
*  Don't let him bully your son fuck don't let him bully you ever heard it with the rocky music [[02:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10306.779999999999s)]

*  Oh [[02:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10322.54s)]
*  So many tattoos yeah, he's got no room left Sean looks way stronger [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10324.54s)]
*  Oh, he's gonna be physically Leon's gonna be in for a surprise cuz he like oh, he's so short [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10329.86s)]
*  I'm like if that happens, but I mean you gotta close that distance of danger with this fuck [[02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10334.380000000001s)]
*  It's also tough on them cuz remember he's supposed to fight JDM a straight striker. Mm-hmm, right? [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10340.160000000002s)]
*  I Jack and they switch it well, they gave him some time, right? [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10344.900000000001s)]
*  How much time do they give him before they switched it four weeks? That's it. Yeah [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10348.54s)]
*  Yeah, that is different stuff again in the ball all fight with Sean [[02:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10352.04s)]
*  They got beat up. We just got beat up. You couldn't get him down [[02:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10356.08s)]
*  You know, you couldn't get him down couldn't get him down below just beat the brakes off him [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10359.04s)]
*  Just defend the takedown fucked his face up Sean looking to put a lot of pressure on just like Bilal did I [[02:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10362.44s)]
*  Mean Bilal really gave the game plan. Uh-huh. Oh good. You're setting done the on [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10368.76s)]
*  Especially when you're Orthodox and you're fighting Leon and he's got that powerful left kick that's opened up and he has a breach advantage [[02:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10374.12s)]
*  And he gets that kick to the body a few times. You're not the same [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10380.72s)]
*  left hand of the body [[02:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10384.32s)]
*  Look he's got his distance down. He's got his distance down. This is that Philly fade [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10387.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, this is the diff the difference is the management of the striking distance like Leon is so good [[02:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10391.52s)]
*  Yeah, but he has to be super careful in here [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10398.0s)]
*  Yeah, because all right there fuck dude counters. They're so crisp and they're so there's no fat in them [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10400.0s)]
*  No wasted movement straight down the pipe [[02:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10406.8s)]
*  If you're Brady can't go for the takedown too early because we just got it expecting he's got to open something up [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10410.44s)]
*  Yeah, but he can't stay on the outside [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10415.48s)]
*  You know what? [[02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10417.64s)]
*  The difference is is blog got his respect on the feet and then started laying take down [[02:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10418.08s)]
*  Well, you remember Sean just landed a left hook there and now they're in a clinch [[02:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10422.039999999999s)]
*  It's gonna be tough to beat Leon if you're just straight grapple [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10425.88s)]
*  This is interesting that Leon's choosing to clinch with him. Nice to need the body by Leon [[02:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10429.16s)]
*  Well, it's good he is man I was surprised when he took tomorrow down like his grappling is no fucking joke [[02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10434.26s)]
*  And remember in the last round he got on top of below was smashing them with elbows remember that yep cut him open [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10442.820000000002s)]
*  Yeah, just a little too little too late [[02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10448.740000000002s)]
*  But if you if you remember that blow off I've watched a few times blow was landing like a motherfucker on the feet [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10451.1s)]
*  Yes [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10456.02s)]
*  And constant pressure a lot of pressure constant got his respect on the feet and then opened up the takedown [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10456.26s)]
*  Sean's already cut you cut on the left eye [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10461.939999999999s)]
*  It's just interesting that Leon is allowing the clinch I'm surprised well he's stuffing that underhook. Mm-hmm pretty good with that thigh pry [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10472.019999999999s)]
*  I just would think that oh [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10479.5s)]
*  Nice combination. You got to do you gotta earn the respect and then the takedown would be there. Yeah, yeah [[02:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10481.859999999999s)]
*  It's too good. It's taking offense too good just to shoot [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10487.419999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's a nice combination. That's right [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10490.38s)]
*  And this is five rounds on yes, sir. Oh [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10493.9s)]
*  Another good combination by Sean [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10499.82s)]
*  They usually have Patty on these London cards, but he's on that man Miami card same Miami [[02:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10512.9s)]
*  Bro, that's a crazy fight him and Chandler so interesting. That should be bananas. I [[02:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10519.74s)]
*  Love Patty. I love Chandler, too [[02:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10524.1s)]
*  I'm surprised at how big Patty is like when he fought Bobby green. I was like he's massive dude [[02:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10526.1s)]
*  He's so big for 55 [[02:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10531.08s)]
*  The UFC brought him up right they did right way Oh Leon caught him a left hand there he did [[02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10534.5s)]
*  Hmm [[02:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10544.46s)]
*  Leon's making it hard in the clinch. Mm-hmm. He's putting that hand super deep in the thigh [[02:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10546.619999999999s)]
*  So pretty's underhook doesn't really have the ability to do anything. Yeah, and those knees to the body are nice [[02:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10550.919999999998s)]
*  There's a nice straight left. Oh [[02:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10556.14s)]
*  Like Brady's got to get him in the clinch and get the underhook and immediately move them around with it [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10559.179999999998s)]
*  Otherwise, he's not gonna make anything happen with it and so far no attempt at all at shooting [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10563.099999999999s)]
*  Like even in these positions, he's not okay now he is [[02:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10570.019999999999s)]
*  This is where strength is gonna be the difference [[02:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10574.42s)]
*  Yeah, let's see if he can do something here [[02:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10578.1s)]
*  Yeah, cuz this strength is fucking but now basically yes, we look back on that motherfucker. I mean Jesus Christ [[02:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10583.74s)]
*  It's like he's got a tumor [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10592.1s)]
*  And what is he he's like five seven five ten [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10598.58s)]
*  Five seven five ten [[02:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10601.22s)]
*  No, yeah, yeah [[02:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10603.939999999999s)]

*  Really said five ten in the Leon six foot [[02:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10621.42s)]
*  That's a UFC five [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10625.0s)]
*  But you Sean Brady's definitely said six two for Leon. Yeah, it's ready in person five eight five six four in my basketball programs, too [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10627.400000000001s)]

*  Depends if you can get off some shots [[02:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10645.960000000001s)]
*  It's definitely could be the most action really any landed on the feet a little more. Mm-hmm [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10648.400000000001s)]
*  This is probably one round for Brady [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10653.3s)]
*  Man, I would like to see that take down landed earlier to see him set that up. But at least we got a [[02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10656.539999999999s)]

*  Yeah, if these guys could just figure out how to trap hands from the back, they'd be so much more effective [[03:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10901.76s)]
*  So he talked loves on. Oh, look at this. Look at this. He's gonna get up. He's gonna at least get up to turtle [[03:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10906.68s)]

*  With tights are so much better because they can't grab you way better [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10948.4s)]
*  Leon should be inserting a butterfly hook here and looking to off balance them out of that Kimora with his right foot [[03:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10951.34s)]

*  Starting from his ass. Yes exhausted from beating the shit out of them domination by Sean [[03:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11400.1s)]
*  I mean Leon's got a probably stop him or get some 10-8 rounds. That was a crazy bad [[03:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11405.14s)]
*  Get some 10-8 round that was a crazy bad [[03:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11410.480000000001s)]
*  And just not a good decision to make against this early in the round and then he's eaten just [[03:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11413.6s)]
*  hours [[03:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11420.12s)]
*  Don't let him bully a rock I mean if you're the corner, I don't get taken down. I don't know what the fuck to tell you man [[03:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11426.28s)]
*  I [[03:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11432.84s)]
*  Was doing a job stopping the takedowns in the clench yes [[03:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11435.84s)]
*  But when he gets when he gets shot on then ran to the cage [[03:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11439.52s)]
*  Yeah, Dean Thomas in the fucking house loved Dean Thomas. He's awesome [[03:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11443.88s)]
*  If Leon didn't pull off that last second KO against tomorrow you would never think he has a fucking shot [[03:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11453.92s)]
*  But because he's done that we're all like you never know dude [[03:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11459.96s)]
*  Well, you never know start standing and he landed shots in the second and the third [[03:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11462.72s)]
*  He just got to not let him take him down. He looks good though. He doesn't look he's off. Yeah, I know [[03:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11467.759999999998s)]
*  But even tomorrow didn't beat him up like this. No [[03:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11472.439999999999s)]
*  Nor did below no, I think Sean's on another level now, you know [[03:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11475.72s)]
*  Yeah, lossy really like you really talked heavily with me about his mental coaching and how much I'm an effect it had on [[03:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11480.32s)]
*  Oh, did you have him in here? Mm-hmm. Yeah, I forget his his coach [[03:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11485.32s)]
*  Remember his coach his mental coach. Yeah [[03:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11490.08s)]
*  Jamie can find it cuz that guy's very good. I've watched some of the stuff online. What's the guy's background? [[03:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11492.88s)]
*  You know, I do not. Oh good elbow by Sean Oh Sean's teeing him up on the feet now. That's trouble [[03:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11498.48s)]
*  Oh my goodness Sean just can't get oh, there you go. There's a shot good shot. What kind of mental coaching did he do? [[03:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11504.24s)]
*  Well, you know, I'd have to have him explain it. I don't want to butcher it [[03:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11510.32s)]
*  But it was all about strategies to keep him focused and on track [[03:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11514.119999999999s)]
*  Brian Kane as his mental coach [[03:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11518.58s)]
*  Brian Kane peak performance [[03:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11522.900000000001s)]
*  Affirmation training developing custom affirmations to enforce positive talk build confidence mind control techniques [[03:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11529.220000000001s)]
*  I mean sometimes fighters just need a framework that they keep with them in a fight [[03:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11534.78s)]
*  So if something goes sideways, they can get back on track. Yeah something to get you back to home base [[03:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11539.54s)]
*  Yeah, because sometimes fighters just lose their their train of thought they lose their focus [[03:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11544.02s)]
*  They get into a downward spiral in their head and then they find themselves not completely going for the guillotine [[03:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11549.26s)]
*  Well, especially after this look at this one hand one arm guillotine. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness [[03:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11555.5s)]
*  Oh my goodness. They'll need to mount him. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness [[03:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11562.5s)]
*  Oh, he's about to oh my goodness. He's about to tap. Oh, oh, oh [[03:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11567.380000000001s)]
*  He's got the hands now, oh no, he's fucked he's tapped he tapped Wow [[03:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11571.619999999999s)]
*  Sean fucking Brady [[03:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11577.619999999999s)]
*  Whoo? [[03:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11580.58s)]
*  Holy shit. What a performance dude shut out. What a performance. I think shut out [[03:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11582.06s)]
*  Against one of the best of all time in the division [[03:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11589.22s)]
*  former champion [[03:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11592.58s)]
*  Beats his ass and submits him. What are these asking Dana for here? Wow [[03:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11594.38s)]
*  But it makes sense Brady would hire a mental coach of that cuz remember he's undefeated never lost and when you like your ass [[03:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11600.98s)]
*  Handed to you like oh fuck. I'm not the end. I'll be when is Bilal fighting Jack [[03:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11607.02s)]
*  That two months is that two months yeah, where's that at I [[03:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11614.02s)]
*  Don't know see if Jamie you could find it [[03:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11619.66s)]
*  Fucking unbelievable, man. I'm super impressed. Oh, you have seen 315 May 10th [[03:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11622.4s)]
*  Wow, I won't be that I don't go to Canada anymore I [[03:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11627.98s)]
*  Don't know nor should you no discipline. Yeah, I'd rather go to Russia. Yeah [[03:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11632.539999999999s)]
*  When they become the US they never know that's never gonna happen [[03:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11640.419999999998s)]
*  That's so crazy to ask them to be the 51st date. I had a conversation with Trump about it [[03:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11644.5s)]
*  He goes I first I started calling them governor Trudeau just for fun [[03:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11649.679999999998s)]
*  Then a lot of people were saying it's a good idea [[03:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11652.099999999999s)]
*  Maybe it is a good idea a lot of people say look at this fucking squeeze man [[03:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11653.94s)]
*  Did you ever work with a mental coach Gordon? You seem pretty mentally fucking strong? [[03:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11659.42s)]
*  No, I believe that confidence is built in the gym training [[03:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11663.66s)]
*  Yeah from doing like if you hit an arm bar ten times out of ten times in training [[03:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11667.76s)]
*  You're pretty confident that it's gonna work, but if you don't hit it in training. Why would you be confident? Do you have? [[03:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11672.32s)]
*  Moments in your past where you had a lap lapse of concentration, and then you realized never do that again [[03:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11677.98s)]
*  Yes, like I'm pretty good at like analyzing mistakes [[03:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11686.019999999999s)]
*  And then like fixing them like you know coming up [[03:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11689.9s)]
*  I would be like super hot and cold like I would beat a lot of guys [[03:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11692.96s)]
*  Then I'd have like one like disastrous match at like purple belt or something or a brown belt [[03:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11696.42s)]
*  and then I was like [[03:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11700.82s)]
*  You know everyone was always like your Tom or you know friends were like how you beat everyone up in the gym [[03:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11703.380000000001s)]
*  you can't translate it to the mat and [[03:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11709.0s)]
*  I was like I don't know man. I just I [[03:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11712.34s)]
*  Feel like eventually I'm gonna get like good [[03:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11715.18s)]
*  And then you know be good everywhere and no no one will be able to beat me in any in any position [[03:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11717.54s)]
*  And then kind of just like going through the reps in the gym [[03:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11722.98s)]
*  And you know got to a point where I was beating everyone from every position so so just you accelerated your skill set so far beyond [[03:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11726.2s)]
*  You just were so confident that you didn't need to [[03:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11733.54s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean there is there definitely is like the it factor that you can't really like put your finger on like [[03:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11737.300000000001s)]
*  Like most guys even at the highest levels like if you give them the reason to quit they'll quit [[03:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11743.34s)]
*  It's like you can be as technically sound as you want [[03:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11749.02s)]
*  Like even guys who are like super good technically you see a lot of jiu-jitsu who are super good technically [[03:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11753.62s)]
*  If they just get pushed hard, and they don't have like success early on they either like crush a guy [[03:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11758.26s)]
*  In like the first five minutes or like or they lose the match well [[03:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11763.02s)]
*  That's why you like those no time limit fights right like the Felipe fight [[03:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11766.82s)]
*  Yeah, I think I'm a lot stronger mentally than everyone I compete against but also [[03:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11770.18s)]
*  Is a big physical factor because of the fact that when you have like a 30 minute match for example [[03:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11775.78s)]
*  The most important thing is the work rate [[03:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11780.78s)]
*  So if it doesn't matter how good your cardio is like how high your vo2 max is if you're working twice as hard as I am [[03:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11782.86s)]
*  You're gonna get tired faster than I am it's just so [[03:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11789.9s)]
*  Because I'm so much more technical because the gap in skill is so big between being the next best guy [[03:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11793.18s)]
*  Their work rate is always three four or five times as high as mine. They have to explode [[03:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11798.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, move quickly doesn't matter how good your cardio is like if I ran a mile [[03:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11802.58s)]
*  It wouldn't be impressive [[03:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11806.26s)]
*  But because I'm so much more efficient the work rate is so much higher for my opponents that they just fatigue a lot faster [[03:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11807.220000000001s)]
*  Gangster crazy yeah crazy. It's it's and it's crazy too that you lay out the blueprint of what to do [[03:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11813.74s)]
*  Train 365 days a year constantly study [[03:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11821.220000000001s)]
*  constantly go over positions constantly drill things constantly improve upon techniques and [[03:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11824.62s)]
*  Then you put the techniques out. Yeah, you put them out in instructionals and people still can't well [[03:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11829.300000000001s)]
*  That's what everyone everyone always talks about everybody always talks about hard work [[03:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11834.54s)]
*  But the hardest work is mental work like there's a reason why guys on Wall Street make more money than guys who dig ditches [[03:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11837.42s)]
*  Because they work harder like it's it's not just physical like everyone is [[03:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11842.66s)]
*  Everyone has no problem coming in getting a sweat going home being sore stuff like that [[03:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11847.86s)]
*  But if you ask them to sit down and watch an hour's worth of instruction every night from it [[03:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11852.58s)]
*  Like a Gordon Ryan instructional what you is proven to work in competition. Nobody wants to do that. Can't do it [[03:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11858.26s)]
*  Hmm interesting. Well, you can give them the tools, but they won't build the house [[03:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11863.86s)]
*  All of my like I have like 40 instructionals like hundreds of hours worth of [[03:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11869.74s)]
*  Instructionals that I do and I've referenced matches that I hit this and the exact technique in in competition at world level and [[03:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11874.5s)]
*  Just no one's picked up on it. No one not no one at all [[03:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11881.26s)]
*  They kind of just like grab stuff like they see me do [[03:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11884.42s)]
*  Like a move and they kind of just like get the basics of it [[03:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11887.3s)]
*  But no one's really like in-depth studied it and like been able to perform the moves in competition [[03:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11890.460000000001s)]
*  It's like embarrassing for the sport. That's so crazy [[03:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11895.18s)]
*  It's so interesting that the thing that you would need is just a work ethic like everyone's just like oh [[03:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11898.539999999999s)]
*  It's just like a big juice head and I'm just like, okay guys, but this makes my job easier [[03:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11904.46s)]
*  I'm glad that we all are agreeing on this because it just makes my job so much easier [[03:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11908.46s)]
*  The stuff he's talking about it also is an exciting, you know, right? Yeah, be super disciplined. Yeah [[03:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11912.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing but like it like what wins wars is technology and information [[03:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11918.82s)]
*  Like the usually the like a country with more technology more access to technology and information is going to be able to win a war [[03:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11924.66s)]
*  Mm-hmm. It's the same thing for fighting [[03:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11931.740000000002s)]
*  Like if you know more most of the time you're gonna be able to to win more like I'm beating these guys because I know [[03:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11933.54s)]
*  more than they do [[03:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11939.18s)]
*  Everybody's tough. Everybody's [[03:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11940.5s)]
*  strong everybody like it's you know, there's [[03:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11943.1s)]
*  Guys are even the best guys in the world. They're super inconsistent like they'll win two they'll lose one [[03:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11946.86s)]
*  They'll win four they'll lose two [[03:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11952.1s)]
*  But what do you know more than everyone in every given position it's like pretty easy what's going on you were telling me your stomach's [[03:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11955.14s)]
*  Getting better now. I can eat a little bit more [[03:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11961.779999999999s)]
*  Like I'm eating like better meals, but uh training is training hard [[03:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11964.939999999999s)]
*  It's still tough like whenever my heart rate gets super high and start to get like tired from like a hard session [[03:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11968.96s)]
*  I still get super nauseous. So I can't believe no one has found a solution to that. That's wild [[03:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11973.42s)]
*  Have you run your blood work through chat GPT? Are you done any of that or the [[03:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11978.74s)]
*  GPT thing I gotta do that you talked to me about that the other day. Yeah [[03:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11983.78s)]
*  But doctors know more about space or we know more about space than we do the stomach like that [[03:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11988.26s)]
*  and my issues in the small intestine which is like the hardest one to treat because [[03:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11993.22s)]
*  Like they can look at your stomach with an endoscopy and they can look at your large intestine intestine with the colonoscopy [[03:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11997.26s)]
*  But to like figure out what the fuck's going on in your small intestine is like a completely [[03:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12002.78s)]
*  Like they just can't they can't scope it so it's hard. It's crazy that it all comes from antibiotics. Oh, yeah [[03:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12006.74s)]
*  antibiotics [[03:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12014.38s)]
*  Fuck my life up way more than [[03:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12015.779999999999s)]
*  Anything else I've ever done to myself [[03:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12018.46s)]
*  Yeah, but you're not supposed to do them the way you did them, right? You're not supposed to take antibiotics for a year [[03:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12021.22s)]
*  well, so it was like [[03:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12026.14s)]
*  If you get staff and you don't treat it you die spreads and you die [[03:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12028.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so it was like I got caught in this like cycle where it was like I got staff [[03:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12032.18s)]
*  I took antibiotics and then I'd be good for two days got staff took antibiotics got staff took antibiotics got staffed [[03:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12036.14s)]
*  so it was just like I'd have like three days of training and then I would just get staff again because [[03:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12042.94s)]
*  Once my stomach started to get affected and my immune system wasn't as strong [[03:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12048.18s)]
*  my stomach was trying to my body was trying to fix my stomach and [[03:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12053.4s)]
*  Then I would get staff because my immune system wasn't as strong. So then I take antibiotics [[03:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12056.82s)]
*  And then that would destroy my stomach make my immune system weaker and then I get staff again [[03:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12062.18s)]
*  So I just got caught in this cycle and I'm sitting there like I'm not a pussy [[03:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12066.14s)]
*  I'm not gonna stop training [[03:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12069.7s)]
*  So it's just me training the whole time regardless of what was going on [[03:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12070.86s)]
*  Like I would not train when I had to staff but I wasn't gonna like take time off and like try to deal with my stomach [[03:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12074.220000000001s)]
*  I was just like fucking [[03:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12080.220000000001s)]
*  Damn mental toughness can sometimes fuck you up. Yeah, give you ever thought about trying like a long fast [[03:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12082.62s)]
*  I mean, I've been forced into like two-week fasts like like like two weeks [[03:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12090.74s)]
*  Yeah, like yeah, like pretty much like not eating hardly anything [[03:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12096.22s)]
*  I was actually before I fought Roberto Jim as the one time I called the arm bar [[03:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12100.06s)]
*  I was in the hospital like two days before that getting IVs because I just hadn't eaten in like a week and a half two weeks [[03:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12103.38s)]
*  Well, I couldn't eat anything [[03:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12108.82s)]
*  That's crazy [[03:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12111.34s)]
*  So obviously then that's not gonna cure it. No [[03:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12113.42s)]
*  And the problem is it's like everything is trial and error so it's a go try this for eight weeks [[03:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12118.34s)]
*  Fucking eight weeks is a long times and you can try it and you can't like do everything at one time [[03:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12123.02s)]
*  Because then you don't know like like you said like I'm sure I just threw everything at it [[03:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12128.06s)]
*  Yeah, I know what's actually making me feel good. So it's like you have to add one thing and take away one thing at a time [[03:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12132.86s)]
*  What about your diet? Is anything helped in that we're on? [[03:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12137.78s)]
*  Oh, I couldn't eat I couldn't even eat red meat for a long time [[03:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12140.58s)]
*  Like everyone's who's suggesting carnivore, but my stomach just wouldn't digest it [[03:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12143.86s)]
*  like that fast food screws me up [[03:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12148.58s)]
*  Steaks sometimes still mess me up spicy food. I can't do like light chicken and rice eggs [[03:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12152.5s)]
*  Land crazy fucking disaster crazy. You're still able to operate at such a high level with such a giant fucking problem [[03:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12158.86s)]
*  That would really end most people's careers [[03:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12165.460000000001s)]
*  That's what it is [[03:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12168.220000000001s)]
*  Everybody's got their I know but I just can't imagine that with all the resources of the world that someone hasn't reached out just a [[03:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12170.02s)]
*  solution [[03:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12176.38s)]
*  You know, I mean isn't it kind of crazy that you think that no one there's not one guy out there in Australia or some shit [[03:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12179.939999999999s)]
*  Let's figure it out. I mean that same issue. Yeah. Well, I mean there was one the first time I came on this show [[03:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12185.82s)]
*  A ton of people reached out. I finally found that guy [[03:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12191.939999999999s)]
*  Who like first of all when you go to a normal GI doctor? [[03:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12195.779999999999s)]
*  Like the guy in California did tests that none of the other GI doctors even know exist [[03:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12199.699999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't know how that's like if you ask me a question in jujitsu [[03:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12205.42s)]
*  It's like XYZ [[03:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12208.3s)]
*  Whereas like you go to one doctor and there's no idea what the other tests were that I got ran on me by another doctor [[03:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12210.1s)]
*  Which is just so insane. So there's one guy actually ran tests [[03:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12215.9s)]
*  He was like, oh all these things are wrong with you [[03:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12219.66s)]
*  And now it's a question of how can we treat them? [[03:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12221.699999999999s)]
*  But like most of the doctors I went to like all the best doctors in the US [[03:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12223.539999999999s)]
*  Just did like an endoscopy like some basic blood work and they're like, oh you're fine. Like I'm definitely not fine [[03:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12226.78s)]
*  So this other doctor that said this is what's wrong with you. This is what was his solution [[03:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12232.740000000002s)]
*  well, it's just a bunch of things like I mean I could sit here and list for five minutes of things that are wrong with me, but [[03:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12238.220000000001s)]
*  It was like, you know, we're gonna do a lot of holistic stuff like over-the-counter [[03:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12245.34s)]
*  Stuff like like binders to like deal with like mold poisoning talk toxic [[03:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12250.54s)]
*  Like [[03:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12256.02s)]
*  issues [[03:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12257.78s)]
*  And then a lot of like probiotics anti like prescription antifungals like just a combination of stuff like gluteus shields [[03:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12258.82s)]
*  Like you just drink it and like coats the lining of your esophagus in your in your stomach [[03:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12265.86s)]
*  because my big issue is with a small intestine burr the [[03:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12269.86s)]
*  Food and bile back up into the stomach and just sits there because it's something there's the small intestines are so that's amazing [[03:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12273.66s)]
*  Yeah, so it's like you eat food you get full fast and the food just sits in your stomach and just like rots in your [[03:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12281.14s)]
*  Stomach it doesn't filter down [[03:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12287.22s)]
*  It's great fun times. It's basically like being seasick 24-7. And what is your thoughts on competing again? [[03:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12290.34s)]
*  Well right now we're just trying to open up this school [[03:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12298.98s)]
*  So I've been trying to open up this damn school for like two years up in North Austin [[03:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12300.86s)]
*  So once I get we're like right at the tail end of getting that open [[03:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12305.3s)]
*  So once that once we get that open and up and running then I'll jump back in if I'm healthy [[03:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12308.44s)]
*  And there's nothing you can do differently than what you're doing now [[03:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12314.28s)]
*  I mean I have it I do follow-ups with the guy like so for example it keeps evolving [[03:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12317.0s)]
*  So like they they got that fungal issue. They think issue they think under control [[03:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12321.720000000001s)]
*  but [[03:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12327.16s)]
*  Because the fungal the fungal issue in the small intestines now is resolved or mostly resolved they think [[03:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12328.560000000001s)]
*  The lining of the intestines is so inflamed like a scar basically that you have mast cells underneath your [[03:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12334.12s)]
*  Underneath your intestinal wall, so they're like they're like garbage bags [[03:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12343.04s)]
*  So when the when food or stomach acid leaks through the intestinal wall and hits the mast cells [[03:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12347.12s)]
*  They shoot histamines back up to try to prevent it from leaking into your bloodstream [[03:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12352.52s)]
*  So every time I eat food [[03:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12357.32s)]
*  These my I just get like this [[03:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12359.68s)]
*  Like adrenaline like adrenal response because if they just shoot histamines back up into my intestine [[03:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12362.32s)]
*  Under from under my intestinal walls back into my intestines, and it just sends my body into like a state of shock [[03:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12368.48s)]
*  So like when it was really bad [[03:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12374.32s)]
*  I would like every time I eat a meal my heart rate would go up to like 150 [[03:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12375.64s)]
*  And just sit there for like 30 minutes [[03:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12379.24s)]
*  And then like your heart rate goes up and your digestive system just stops [[03:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12381.64s)]
*  It was like it would just send my body into like a full panic attack every time I ate a meal [[03:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12386.16s)]
*  And I'm like oh, this is sick [[03:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12390.4s)]
*  And now it's gotten like a little bit better because it's starting to heal a little bit, but it's still not a hundred percent [[03:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12392.880000000001s)]
*  So it's like one problem just like evolved into another problem [[03:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12397.800000000001s)]
*  and then like because the leaky gut was so bad like my kidneys were shutting down because I couldn't filter out all the [[03:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12400.68s)]
*  Like that's when I like took a leave of absence or retired whatever you want to call it with that after I fought back in [[03:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12407.12s)]
*  The one time when we first met like it was like leaky gut was so bad my kidneys started to shut down [[03:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12411.96s)]
*  Jesus and then [[03:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12417.759999999998s)]
*  Like my blood pressure is high have they ever tried oral BPC 157. I've been on that for like three years [[03:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12419.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, is that any effect a combination of like it definitely helps try the shop method [[03:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12424.88s)]
*  Whatever they tell you the dose is sink at it. Just do yeah [[03:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12430.919999999998s)]
*  Let's see what happens with a whole bottle Elon makes a cyborgs [[03:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12437.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'll be ready to go my flights at 730. All right, let's wrap this up. All right. Thank you everybody [[03:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12440.199999999999s)]
*  See you guys. Love you, too. See you. Bye [[03:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12447.679999999998s)]
