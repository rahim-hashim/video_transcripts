# Joe Rogan Experience #1947 - Chris Distefano
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6.0s)]
*  Hello, Chrissy. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10.0s)]
*  Hello. Good to see you, brother. Nice to see you. I like the shades. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=14.0s)]
*  I know. I feel like Jeffrey Dahmer. Are those Anthony Aiden's? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=17.0s)]
*  Anthony Aiden. Yeah. Dude, Anthony Aiden, St. Mark's Lower East Side. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=20.0s)]
*  I wanted to look like a 70s, 80s mobster look. That's what I wanted to go for. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=26.0s)]
*  And Anthony was like, I got you. Oh yeah, you nailed it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=36.0s)]
*  Anthony Aiden, and he's one of those guys, he's like an MMA guy. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=40.0s)]
*  So he's selling these nice glasses, but then he's got the cauliflower ear, and he's always got bruises on his face. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=43.0s)]
*  Yeah, I met him in New York. Very nice guy. He gave me a beautiful pair of sunglasses with rose-colored shades. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=49.0s)]
*  They're very nice. They're transition lenses. Yeah, mine too. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=55.0s)]
*  And the thing is with these is this is, you know, I'm going for it, right? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=58.0s)]
*  And I've went a little crazy. You're going for it? I'm just going for it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=61.0s)]
*  I've said, you know what, enough's enough. Enough's enough. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=66.0s)]
*  I said, I'm done. I'm putting on glasses. I'm wearing a watch. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=69.0s)]
*  Wow. What kind of watch you got? AP Royal Oak. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=73.0s)]
*  Ooh, that's a nice watch. I just came, I talked to Andrew Santino, and I said I want a watch. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=76.0s)]
*  And he sent me this link, and I said, but what about that price? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=80.0s)]
*  He said, if you're going to do it, just fucking do it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=83.0s)]
*  Wow. And so he, and then I did it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=85.0s)]
*  And then when I sent him a picture of it on, he was like, dude, I was kidding. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=87.0s)]
*  Like you, you just jumped like 10 steps. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=90.0s)]
*  And then he said, what is, you're like a different Chrissy with these glasses. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=95.0s)]
*  And I know I said to you before, I'm wearing them every day. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=98.0s)]
*  I haven't taken the watch or the glasses off in about two weeks. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=101.0s)]
*  And I feel good about it now. I feel centered with who I am. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=104.0s)]
*  But it does feel like, you know, month from now I'll look back and really regret this face. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=108.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=112.0s)]
*  Because I think that I, listen, I'm having fun. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=113.0s)]
*  Right now it's no regrets, but I'm just saying I know the way my mind works. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=118.0s)]
*  And I think I'm probably going too hard, too fast. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=121.0s)]
*  Like I just, you know, the glasses, the watch, you go, I got a tour manager. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=125.0s)]
*  I don't need any of this. I'm just going. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=128.0s)]
*  Just keep going. What are you worried about? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=130.0s)]
*  All right, then I'll do it then. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=132.0s)]
*  Yeah, you need a coach. You need someone in the corner going, keep going, kid. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=133.0s)]
*  Keep going. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=136.0s)]
*  Keep going. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=137.0s)]
*  I ate a bag of chicken skin in your green room. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=138.0s)]
*  Look at you. Look at the fucking look. I like the new look. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=140.0s)]
*  Dude, because you know what this is too. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=143.0s)]
*  You know what happened is I started. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=145.0s)]
*  It's a glow up. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=146.0s)]
*  It's a glow up. That's what it is. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=147.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're glowing up. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=149.0s)]
*  It's a glow up. I'm like Elliot Page, glowed up. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=150.0s)]
*  I think you look great. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=152.0s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=153.0s)]
*  You got a fucking bracelet on too? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=154.0s)]
*  Dude, I'm not, I've completely went insane. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=156.0s)]
*  Wow, that's not insane. You're making a little cash. You're doing well. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=158.0s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=161.0s)]
*  Netflix special's doing well. That's it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=162.0s)]
*  Everything's good. The kids touring. The kids making some shekels. Let's go. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=164.0s)]
*  The kids doing Radio City Musical, folks. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=167.0s)]
*  The kids doing Radio City Musical, folks. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=169.0s)]
*  September 22nd, I mean that's, see for a New Yorker, that's like, that's the thing. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=172.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the place. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=177.0s)]
*  You go to Radio City and it's been amazing. Yeah, and it's been amazing. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=178.0s)]
*  We sold 4,500 tickets the first week. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=183.0s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=185.0s)]
*  So that's, it's like mind blowing for me. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=186.0s)]
*  That place is so, didn't Roy Jones Jr. have a fight there once? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=188.0s)]
*  Probably. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=192.0s)]
*  I think when Roy Jones Jr. was just murking people, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=193.0s)]
*  Roy Jones Jr. put on a fight, I'm pretty sure he did it there. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=196.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=200.0s)]
*  He did it at some iconic venue in New York City and Radio City Musical is one of the peaks. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=201.0s)]
*  It's, when I started comedy, I've, and still. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=208.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=211.0s)]
*  There it is. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=212.0s)]
*  Yeah, Roy Jones Jr. produced a Radio City Spectacular. Who did he fight? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=213.0s)]
*  That was when, what's that? Oh, that's right. Even fighting one handed. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=217.0s)]
*  That was, yeah. Well, that was when Roy Jones Jr. was just the fucking king of the world. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=224.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=229.0s)]
*  People forgot. Like, he had to make a song called Y'all Must Have Forgot. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=230.0s)]
*  He did it literally, he made a song called Y'all Must Have Forgot because people forgot. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=233.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=238.0s)]
*  He was the fucking man. There was a period of time, and this is the thing about fighters, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=239.0s)]
*  you can't keep it up forever. It's impossible. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=244.0s)]
*  And a lot of times we think about fighters as who they were at the end of their career. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=247.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=252.0s)]
*  When their bodies were failing and they had too much mileage on the tank, it's like, on the odometer rather. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=253.0s)]
*  Roy Jones Jr., when he was in his peak and his prime, was as good as anybody that's ever laced on gloves. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=259.0s)]
*  Yeah. Did you watch the Paul Fury fight yesterday? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=265.0s)]
*  Yes, I did. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=267.0s)]
*  Yeah, what'd you think? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=268.0s)]
*  I thought it was a very good fight. It confirmed two things that I've been saying for a long time. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=269.0s)]
*  One, Jake Paul is 100% legit. People that think he's not legit, he's conning you. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=273.0s)]
*  He's conning you with his antics, he's conning you with his online persona and the shit talking and the marketing. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=278.0s)]
*  But if you didn't have any of that, and me as an analyst, that's one of my jobs. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=287.0s)]
*  I analyze mixed martial arts. I'm not a boxing analyst, but I understand it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=293.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=296.0s)]
*  When I watch him move around, it's 100% legit. When I saw him knock out Tyron Woodley, I'm like, that is a fucking dangerous man. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=297.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=303.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=304.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was watching it illegally on a phone. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=305.0s)]
*  Why don't you pay for it, you fucking piece of shit? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=308.0s)]
*  I didn't know, because I ran out of money. I bought too many glasses. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=310.0s)]
*  I spent it all on the watch. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=317.0s)]
*  No, because I didn't even know, I love sports and stuff, but not that I'm not into boxing, I just don't ever watch it that much. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=319.0s)]
*  And so the guy that I'm with, he was like, oh, the fight's happening now. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=327.0s)]
*  So he's like, I got a site and we started, I was eating ice cream yesterday in San Francisco in Little Italy. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=329.0s)]
*  And I only eat sweets once a week now. So yesterday was my sweets day. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=334.0s)]
*  Nice. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=338.0s)]
*  And I was eating, I got four scoops of gelato. So I was three and a half scoops in and the blood sugar, the way it hit, I was getting woozy, but it's like what I'd been waiting for. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=339.0s)]
*  And I'm watching the fight happen and then, you know, San Francisco, right outside, I see two homeless guys fighting, like legitimately fighting. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=349.0s)]
*  And it was kind of one of those things where I swear to God, even though amazing fighters that, you know, Paul and Fury, the fight outside was so much more entertaining. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=358.0s)]
*  I mean, I've never seen this. I saw a homeless man yesterday in front of, as the kid out in the green room, as my witness, roundhouse kick another, land a roundhouse kick to the chin. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=368.0s)]
*  The other homeless guy's face, the guy hit up against some outdoor dining was like shell shocked, like, you know, like woozy bleeding from his lip and then just scurried off. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=377.0s)]
*  And I was like, wow. And then I bought the homeless guy who won the fight ice cream. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=386.0s)]
*  I swear to God. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=390.0s)]
*  But did you know whether who instigated the fight? Maybe the homeless guy with the roundhouse kick is like a crackstealer. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=392.0s)]
*  I was going to say, I think most likely Fentanyl instigated the fight. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=398.0s)]
*  I feel like Fentanyl would calm it down. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=401.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's true, too. It was I don't know if one's lesson you've been to San Fran, but I mean, it it got, you know, it's pretty wild. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=403.0s)]
*  It was wild there in North Beach, you know, little Italy. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=409.0s)]
*  And I was like, man, this is next level. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=412.0s)]
*  But I thought my mother always instilled in me like always buy homeless people food if you see them buy them food. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=414.0s)]
*  And so that's just what I automatically do. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=420.0s)]
*  And I bought him ice cream. And you know what this guy says to me? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=422.0s)]
*  Granted, you just want to fight. But I came out with chocolate ice cream. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=424.0s)]
*  He goes, I don't like chocolate. I was like, Jesus Christ. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=427.0s)]
*  Well, that's probably why he's homeless. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=430.0s)]
*  Seriously, right? Because of the ego and like disagreeableness. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=431.0s)]
*  Yes. So I went and got a vanilla and he ate the vanilla. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=434.0s)]
*  Oh, you did that. Yeah. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=436.0s)]
*  Because, you know, it's my sweet day. I just had the chocolate. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=438.0s)]
*  Good for you. Thank you. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=440.0s)]
*  That's a lovely thing to do. Yeah. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=442.0s)]
*  I wish it was just, you know, that the people are down on their luck. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=443.0s)]
*  I wish it was just that. Yeah. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=447.0s)]
*  But there's like such a combination of factors that humans have to address. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=449.0s)]
*  If they really want to address homelessness, you really have to address kids that grow up in the foster care system. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=452.0s)]
*  You have to address childhood abuse. You have to adjust family history of drug addiction. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=458.0s)]
*  You have to address crime. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=464.0s)]
*  Like there's so many factors that lead into someone being homeless. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=466.0s)]
*  And the idea that you're just going to give them housing or you're just going to give them tents and everything's going to be fine. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=469.0s)]
*  It's like, no, like you can't just like ignore that as an issue. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=474.0s)]
*  Like if you're going to the amount of money that it costs to have massive populations of homeless people is extraordinary. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=478.0s)]
*  If they just put the same amount or maybe more to prepare for the future into some sort of like comprehensive program to try to help people that are fucked up like that and clean them up. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=485.0s)]
*  And it would probably have to involve psychedelic drugs. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=497.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I was. I think that you probably because because it's not a money thing, right? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=500.0s)]
*  People they have money to it's not a cure. It's not a financial cure. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=504.0s)]
*  It's these people, people that are so damaged by life. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=507.0s)]
*  Yes. In whether it's chemically damaged, psychologically damaged. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=510.0s)]
*  Maybe they don't have the right psych medications. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=514.0s)]
*  Maybe they're off their meds. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=516.0s)]
*  You know, a lot of them have gone through horrific abuse. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=518.0s)]
*  Like you don't wind up in a tent and skid row unless shit has gone. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=522.0s)]
*  It's literally the bottom of the country. Skid row is like the bottom of the country. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=526.0s)]
*  Right. But then I wonder if you get to talk to some people and they're like, this is where we want to be. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=530.0s)]
*  You think some people are willingly that? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=535.0s)]
*  Because they don't they don't know anything else. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=536.0s)]
*  Right. Right. They don't know love. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=539.0s)]
*  They don't know like the accomplishment of like doing a thing and getting better at it and like improving upon and realizing that's kind of a vehicle for improving yourself. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=541.0s)]
*  They have experienced like positive things like the life. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=553.0s)]
*  Life is like this is why it drives me fucking crazy when everybody says like whenever anyone says like pull them up by their own bootstraps like to tell people to go, you know, figure it out yourself. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=557.0s)]
*  You know, I did. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=568.0s)]
*  Or like these people, you're not dealing with the even starting line. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=569.0s)]
*  If everybody had an even starting line, that would make sense. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=574.0s)]
*  If everybody had a mom and a dad and they grew up in a house where no one smoked crack and fucking shot at each other. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=576.0s)]
*  You grew up in a place like that. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=582.0s)]
*  OK, if we all grew up like and we all like had a good school to go to with good education and nice teachers that cared. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=584.0s)]
*  But that's not everybody's experience. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=591.0s)]
*  And until we fucking fix that, you're never going to fix this homeless problem. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=593.0s)]
*  Like I was lucky to grow up, I grew up in New York City, great parents, whatever. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=598.0s)]
*  But then I just had a show in Fresno a couple of days ago and I said, if I grew up here, I'd be a little different. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=602.0s)]
*  You'd be a lot different. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=607.0s)]
*  Fresno is one of those places where I went a great time. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=608.0s)]
*  But I mean, those just just being there, just being in that city for 24 hours, I was like, I don't know if this is my every single day. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=611.0s)]
*  You might turn to drugs. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=619.0s)]
*  It's depressing. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=620.0s)]
*  It's depressing. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=621.0s)]
*  I drove from Fresno to San Jose and we were passing through Stockton and I thought I was in Switzerland because that's what an upgrade it was from Fresno. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=622.0s)]
*  I was like, what are we in the fucking Alps? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=629.0s)]
*  Bro, I was driving through a street in Fresno and people were walking out in the middle of the street like what the fuck are you doing driving here? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=631.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=637.0s)]
*  Like I went down a wrong area where it's like mostly homeless people. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=638.0s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, no, no. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=641.0s)]
*  That the the the Fresno skid row that I saw was the one I think the worst I've ever seen. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=642.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=647.0s)]
*  No, in a was it? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=648.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=649.0s)]
*  Was San Jose. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=650.0s)]
*  I should say San Jose was was really, really, really fucking bad. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=651.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=654.0s)]
*  Over there. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=655.0s)]
*  I was like, Jesus Christ. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=656.0s)]
*  You know, you and Vancouver. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=658.0s)]
*  I just went to Vancouver. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=660.0s)]
*  That was the one where I was like, I did not know that Vancouver had such a see. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=661.0s)]
*  I think what Vancouver and these cities are doing is they're just putting their homeless in one section because, you know, I live in New York. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=666.0s)]
*  I'm in New York every day. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=672.0s)]
*  There are homeless and they're spread out through the city, but you never see blocks of tents like you see in San Francisco and Vancouver. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=674.0s)]
*  So when I was there, I was like, this doesn't feel like the right move either, you know, to just put them in one corner because New York, they're spread out. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=682.0s)]
*  But you don't you don't feel them as much. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=691.0s)]
*  It's dangerous, but not really where San Francisco, Vancouver, they were like, you know, one of the local comics I was with in San Fran. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=694.0s)]
*  He was like, you cannot leave anything in your car around this theater. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=700.0s)]
*  You cannot. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=704.0s)]
*  They will break in. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=705.0s)]
*  And I saw about four or five windows busted out, which you never see that in New York. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=706.0s)]
*  And I think the police in Vancouver and San Fran, from what the people were telling me, they that's a district. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=709.0s)]
*  They don't care. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=714.0s)]
*  They don't even go into that district. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=715.0s)]
*  They just let it be a free for all, which I understand from the government's like, well, this is our last resort. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=716.0s)]
*  But I don't know that that's going to necessarily work. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=721.0s)]
*  But maybe you got to give them psychedelics. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=724.0s)]
*  Well, what they're doing right now is not working. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=725.0s)]
*  You can't just let people smash people's windows. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=728.0s)]
*  It's so it's so crazy. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=730.0s)]
*  And it's you know, it's a direct result of horrific police violence. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=732.0s)]
*  Yes. That's what it's from. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=738.0s)]
*  It's from you watch like the George Floyd video. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=739.0s)]
*  Right. You watch those five guys beat that man to death recently. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=742.0s)]
*  You see these videos, you see the Roddy King video. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=745.0s)]
*  You've seen so many videos. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=748.0s)]
*  So people like over time have decided that all police are bad and all police interactions are bad. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=749.0s)]
*  We need to defund the police. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=756.0s)]
*  And this is what that leads to. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=758.0s)]
*  It just leads to an increase in crime. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=760.0s)]
*  It's not perfect. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=762.0s)]
*  It's not a perfect system. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=763.0s)]
*  Right. Right. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=764.0s)]
*  But you need a system of law and order. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=765.0s)]
*  If you don't have a system of law and order, you have too many people that would just give in with no consequences to crime. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=767.0s)]
*  Right. And that's not their fault. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=773.0s)]
*  In a lot of cases, I mean, we can go through that and talk about determinism and what we've already talked about before about everybody doesn't have an even starting line. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=775.0s)]
*  Right. But you've got to address that. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=783.0s)]
*  It's a problem. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=785.0s)]
*  And you've got to address for peaceful people. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=786.0s)]
*  They have to be able to walk down the street and not worry about getting assaulted and robbed. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=788.0s)]
*  Yeah. If that happens all the time, you've got a fundamental breakdown of what your society in society is strong or supposed to protect the vulnerable. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=792.0s)]
*  Right. And if you're not doing that, then you don't have a society. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=801.0s)]
*  And then you also have this crazy gun laws and everything. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=804.0s)]
*  It's a little difficult to you're not allowed to concealed carry. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=807.0s)]
*  There's a lot of like so there's no consequence of people are coming after you. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=810.0s)]
*  It's not like it's like fucking the Wild West out there. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=814.0s)]
*  It's just the prevalence of crime has increased pretty noticeably. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=818.0s)]
*  Yeah. And like I said, New York was pre pandemic the safest city I thought in the world. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=822.0s)]
*  I grew up there. I was like, it's so safe. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=828.0s)]
*  It's insane. And I always would say the same thing about New York. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=830.0s)]
*  I would say New York is the only city that like any time of the day, any day of the week, you feel like the vibrance, you feel the people where I would go to a city like even though I love it like a city like Cleveland, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=833.0s)]
*  Cleveland would feel even though it's open, it felt closed. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=843.0s)]
*  Like that's just what the city always felt like. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=846.0s)]
*  And I was like, I never felt that once in New York. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=848.0s)]
*  But now over the last like year or two, New York, a lot of times, like 50 percent of the week feels closed even though it's open. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=851.0s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, snap, it hit New York, which I and then, you know, I talked to my father about that, you know, complain about New York. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=859.0s)]
*  He was like, Chris, shut up. He's like, I grew up in New York in the 70s and 80s. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=865.0s)]
*  Like it is nowhere near as violent and unsafe as it was in the 70s and 80s. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=869.0s)]
*  Like you just grew up in peacetime. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=874.0s)]
*  He was like, you know, you grew up in peacetime America. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=877.0s)]
*  Your generation are all peace kids. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=879.0s)]
*  You're born in the eye of the storm. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=881.0s)]
*  Yeah. He's like, so you didn't see any of this shit. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=882.0s)]
*  Yeah. He was like, so you what you just had the privilege of growing up in a New York city and in America that was at the top. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=884.0s)]
*  You were at the top of the Roman Empire. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=891.0s)]
*  He was like, and now what you're seeing is kind of a little bit more of the fabric society was like I my dad's like I grew up in the 60s, 70s and 80s. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=893.0s)]
*  This is just reminding me of old New York. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=901.0s)]
*  He's like, I kind of like this grittiness of this, but you grew up everybody safe. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=903.0s)]
*  That was never going to be real. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=907.0s)]
*  He was like, and you know, I don't it will probably come back at some point, but it's going to take a long, long time. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=909.0s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=914.0s)]
*  I feel like now like in my, you know, when I'm even like my mom won't take my daughter to Times Square to the American Girl Doll store. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=915.0s)]
*  And I just I couldn't believe it. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=923.0s)]
*  I was like, no, I can't I can't allow you to take her. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=924.0s)]
*  She's like, what? It's I'm your mom, your granddaughter. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=927.0s)]
*  We'll take we'll go on the train and I'll take her to the store and I'll be back. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=929.0s)]
*  I was like, no, I can't I won't be able to function. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=932.0s)]
*  My anxiety won't be able to function of thinking about you and my daughter on the train because if there's a homeless person down there that's crazy off his meds and he throws one of you in front of the tracks and something happens. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=935.0s)]
*  I won't be able to live with myself. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=944.0s)]
*  And those thoughts were never in my head ever. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=945.0s)]
*  They were never, ever, ever in my head. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=948.0s)]
*  But now they are. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=949.0s)]
*  And I don't know if it's because it's reality. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=950.0s)]
*  The media, something I don't know what it is. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=952.0s)]
*  I think it's a little bit of both. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=956.0s)]
*  It is reality. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=958.0s)]
*  It has happened. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=959.0s)]
*  So to deny that it's happened would be that's ridiculous. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=960.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's videos of people doing it. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=963.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=965.0s)]
*  The question is like how many of them, how much do you need to worry about it? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=966.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=969.0s)]
*  And how often is this happening? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=970.0s)]
*  It's not happening that often. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=971.0s)]
*  You consider how many people there are. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=972.0s)]
*  But the fact that it could be a possibility at all. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=974.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=976.0s)]
*  You know, it's really crazy. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=977.0s)]
*  It's like Giuliani cleaned New York City up. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=978.0s)]
*  He did. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=980.0s)]
*  He really did. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=981.0s)]
*  I mean, it was a lot of people said it was like great overreach and thuggish behavior by the police and all the horrible shit they did, the stop and frisk shit. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=982.0s)]
*  What would they do? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=991.0s)]
*  They would just stop you. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=992.0s)]
*  So I had a friend who's he's now a detective. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=994.0s)]
*  He was a beat cop. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=998.0s)]
*  Twenty one years old when Giuliani implemented this stop and frisk thing. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=999.0s)]
*  And he said, look, he was like, I'm being honest. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1003.0s)]
*  My friend, he's a Latino guy. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1005.0s)]
*  He's like, I promise you our sergeant would come in every morning, talk to us about stop and frisk. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1007.0s)]
*  And he said, you stop each race, ethnicity, religion. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1012.0s)]
*  You stop everybody equally. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1016.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1017.0s)]
*  He said, that's what you're looking for. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1018.0s)]
*  Everything is equal. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1019.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1021.0s)]
*  But his beat was Times Square. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1022.0s)]
*  He said, now, if I went in to Times Square and I grab a group of kids, pat them down, they have something. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1023.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1031.0s)]
*  But they're, you know, from a socioeconomic status that, you know, is a little impoverished, whatever. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1032.0s)]
*  What am I supposed to do? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1038.0s)]
*  Say, oh, you have a gun and a knife and drugs on you. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1039.0s)]
*  But, you know, I can't I'm not going to take this off you. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1042.0s)]
*  I'm just going to let you go back out into society. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1046.0s)]
*  He said, no, I would have to then arrest them. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1048.0s)]
*  He said, well, then I would take like another group of kids that wouldn't have anything and then you let them go. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1050.0s)]
*  He said, and then that became like they brought race and identity politics into that type of policing. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1054.0s)]
*  But we were stopping everybody equally. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1058.0s)]
*  It's just crime is in certain areas for certain reasons. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1060.0s)]
*  He was like, that's above my pay grade. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1063.0s)]
*  He said, but when they stop that stop and frisk, he said, the reason the thing what's happening, at least in New York now, he said, it's it's we'll know that somebody has a gun or a weapon. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1064.0s)]
*  We'll know that they're a career criminal. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1073.0s)]
*  We know. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1074.0s)]
*  He said, but we are not allowed to intervene at all unless they commit unless they act first. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1075.0s)]
*  He said, so that creates a lot of confidence for the criminal and it creates a lot of, you know, we're we are scared. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1080.0s)]
*  He was like, flat out, I'm scared to apprehend someone because the police union, if I make a mistake or if it looks like I made a mistake, it's not going to have my back and I'm going to get sued and lose my family and lose my life. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1087.0s)]
*  So you start to say, well, just we know you have shit, but just deal with it unless you're raping, murdering someone. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1097.0s)]
*  Then I'll intervene. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1103.0s)]
*  But that little petty shit, I'm not going to get involved in anymore. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1104.0s)]
*  Well, I think we could look at it both ways. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1107.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1108.0s)]
*  Right. This is one way to look at it. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1109.0s)]
*  The old way of stopping and frisking is easy to abuse. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1110.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1115.0s)]
*  And when you think about the power that you give someone where they could just walk up to anyone, some businessman they don't like, some some fucking guy who thinks he's hot shit, some guy who's with his friends is a little too loud. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1116.0s)]
*  You just walk up to him and go, come on, take, let me see all your shit. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1129.0s)]
*  I'm going to touch you in front of everybody, make you feel uncomfortable. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1132.0s)]
*  Like what shouldn't you have to commit a crime? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1135.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1139.0s)]
*  Before the police are allowed to frisk you and take your stuff. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1140.0s)]
*  Should you at least be accused of a crime? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1143.0s)]
*  Shouldn't there at least be some sort of criminal behavior where the police have to intervene? [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1145.0s)]
*  Because then they're like, people are going to self correct and you're going to act differently in order to try to stop the cops from doing this to you. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1148.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1157.0s)]
*  That's like a freedom issue. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1158.0s)]
*  That's a real egregious attack on freedom to just be able to point at someone and be able to just frisk them. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1161.0s)]
*  No crime, no nothing. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1167.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1169.0s)]
*  That's a weird power to give police. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1170.0s)]
*  And that's not good. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1172.0s)]
*  And the other thing's not good either. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1173.0s)]
*  It's not good to take away all their power either. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1175.0s)]
*  It's not good to make it so the cops are terrified to respond to a call. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1177.0s)]
*  That's not good either. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1182.0s)]
*  So there needs to be some sort of a logical recognition of what the issues are. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1183.0s)]
*  Right now I don't think that's happening. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1187.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know what it is. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1189.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, a guy lives with me, my girlfriend's uncle, transgender guy, T.T. Jerry, 20 years in prison. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1190.0s)]
*  Shout out to T.T. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1196.0s)]
*  Shout out to T.T. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1197.0s)]
*  Shout out to T.T. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1198.0s)]
*  Jerry's lived a fucking wild life. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1199.0s)]
*  On your podcast all the time. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1200.0s)]
*  On my podcast all the time. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1201.0s)]
*  Let's open that liquor, son. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1202.0s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1204.0s)]
*  This is Siesta Eligas Tequila. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1205.0s)]
*  Oh, but before you do that, I think you should have a whiff. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1207.0s)]
*  Okay, yeah. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1210.0s)]
*  Because you've been wanting to have a whiff. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1211.0s)]
*  So what is this, smelling salts? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1212.0s)]
*  So this is, is this Juju Mufu stuff? [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1214.0s)]
*  This dude Juju Mufu who's hilarious. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1217.0s)]
*  He's like a super power lifter, body builder type character. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1220.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1225.0s)]
*  And these are smelling salts. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1226.0s)]
*  So don't throw them away when you panic, because you will panic. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1229.0s)]
*  You're going to take a nice deep whiff with your nostrils. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1234.0s)]
*  I already smell it and I'm like hyperventilating. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1237.0s)]
*  Let it hit you. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1239.0s)]
*  So what do I do though? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1240.0s)]
*  Don't throw it anywhere. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1241.0s)]
*  Just take a whiff. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1242.0s)]
*  Just don't panic once you get hit. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1243.0s)]
*  Don't put your nose too far in there. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1245.0s)]
*  Get in there, bitch. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1246.0s)]
*  So, but I don't. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1247.0s)]
*  Breathe, just breathe. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1248.0s)]
*  You've got to take me through it though. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1249.0s)]
*  Take a smell. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1250.0s)]
*  Just take a sniff. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1251.0s)]

*  I've never experienced something like that. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1377.08s)]
*  Yeah, these guys take it before they lift. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1381.12s)]
*  I guess it just shocks the central nervous system, and then they fucking... [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1383.86s)]
*  Go wild, right? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1387.62s)]

*  Pull up a picture of Juju Mufo. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1390.62s)]
*  You gotta see this dude. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1391.62s)]
*  Well, you should watch actually video of him, because he's more impressive in video. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1392.62s)]
*  He's really a crazy athlete. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1394.9399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1396.58s)]
*  He's not just like a powerlifter. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1397.58s)]
*  He does like backflips. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1398.58s)]
*  I wonder if they have that stuff on the... [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1399.58s)]
*  Dude, by the way, I just saw... [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1401.06s)]
*  I don't know if you guys spoke about it on the show. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1402.62s)]
*  I just saw something when I was coming in today that one section of the war in Russia, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1404.2199999999998s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1411.1s)]
*  I was like, what the fuck? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1414.58s)]
*  Four hour life... [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1417.1399999999999s)]
*  I was like, is that even... [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1418.1399999999999s)]
*  How can that be real? [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1419.3s)]
*  Is that real? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1420.3s)]
*  I saw it in the news article, four hour lifespan, but that made me think of that. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1421.3s)]
*  I wonder if what these soldiers, like when the Nazis used to take crystal meth before [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1424.8999999999999s)]
*  and then just go crazy, they do shit like that. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1428.1799999999998s)]
*  I don't think they do shit like that, but they definitely take amphetamines. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1430.6599999999999s)]
*  You have to, right? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1433.02s)]
*  That's a common thing. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1434.62s)]
*  It helps them in war. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1436.3s)]
*  I mean, the Vikings took mushrooms. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1437.3s)]
*  Really? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1439.26s)]
*  Yeah, the berserkers. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1440.26s)]
*  What they would do is they'd get fucking high as fuck on psilocybin. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1441.26s)]
*  They would chew down psilocybin. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1445.6200000000001s)]
*  That's jujube. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1447.22s)]

*  that are dangling from rubber bands with a bamboo pole. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1455.5s)]
*  Do you know how unstable that is? [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1458.9s)]
*  I wouldn't even be able to hold that over my head, probably. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1462.22s)]
*  This dude is balancing on a full split in between two chairs. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1465.26s)]

*  He's a crazy human being. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1472.86s)]
*  It's a crazy human being. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1474.34s)]
*  But a positive crazy. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1475.34s)]
*  But it's fun. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1476.34s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1477.34s)]
*  He's a fun dude. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1478.34s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that guy, I'm sure he, I think he intermittent fast. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1479.34s)]
*  Do you think he's into intermittent fasting, a guy like that? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1481.7s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1483.82s)]
*  I would imagine he's into a lot of things. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1484.82s)]
*  Dude, that changed my whole life. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1486.54s)]
*  I dropped 35 pounds. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1488.1s)]
*  I stock out of social media and I started intermittent fasting. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1490.8999999999999s)]
*  Life changed, bro. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1494.62s)]
*  Good for you. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1495.62s)]
*  Life changed. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1496.62s)]
*  It's literally, I just said to myself, I can't give any more energy to things that are not [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1497.62s)]
*  helping me. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1503.82s)]
*  I can't give energy to strangers anymore. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1504.82s)]
*  So I have somebody who runs my social media, Brian Moore, and he's a big fan of yours. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1507.1s)]
*  He's got hair like- [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1510.02s)]
*  Shout out to Brian. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1511.02s)]
*  Shout out to Brian. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1512.02s)]
*  He's got hair like Lancelot, like medieval hair. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1513.02s)]
*  I've never seen a guy pull off a fucking medieval bob like this kid. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1514.02s)]
*  But he runs it for me now. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1517.1399999999999s)]
*  And dude, I got to a point where I was 255 pounds and I was fucking around. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1520.5s)]
*  I was 255 pounds, didn't even realize it, and I put on one of T.T. Jerry's wigs, just [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1525.38s)]
*  chilling, whatever. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1529.42s)]
*  And I got on the scale, just fucking, I don't know what I was doing. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1530.5s)]
*  And I looked, 255, and I said to the mirror, I said, you look like a fat Howard Stern right [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1533.5800000000002s)]
*  now. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1538.94s)]
*  And it was funny, like my family were all laughing, ha, fat Howard Stern running around [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1539.94s)]
*  my tits. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1543.3400000000001s)]
*  And my daughter, everybody's having fun. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1545.02s)]
*  And then, this was on my birthday, August. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1546.5800000000002s)]
*  So just a few months ago. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1549.3000000000002s)]
*  And then I go in the shower, right? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1550.34s)]
*  I'm not even thinking. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1552.4199999999998s)]
*  It's not even in my head. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1553.4199999999998s)]
*  Out of nowhere, hysterical crying, bawling, crying, like something hit me that I was suppressing, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1554.8999999999999s)]
*  like literally uncontrollable tears, like snot coming out of my nose like a seven-year-old [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1562.1s)]
*  could not stop. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1567.1799999999998s)]
*  And something broke inside of me. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1568.86s)]
*  And then I think this is where the universe comes in. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1571.3s)]
*  It's not that it happened, like I think I just had probably seen stuff like this before, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1572.8999999999999s)]
*  Now that my eyes were open to look, I started taking in information. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1577.94s)]
*  And I'm on Twitter, like two hours later, just mindlessly scrolling, dealing with the [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1581.7s)]
*  emotions, whatever. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1586.26s)]
*  And I see a tweet from Elon Musk. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1587.3799999999999s)]
*  And he just wasn't promoting this. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1590.1s)]
*  He just was, it was a genuine tweet. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1592.22s)]
*  He goes, the Zero Intermittent Fasting app is awesome. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1593.94s)]
*  That's all he wrote. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1598.66s)]
*  And I said, I'm going to download that app right now. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1599.66s)]
*  And I downloaded this app, Zero Fasting app. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1602.06s)]
*  And I was just like, I'm just going to do this for two weeks. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1605.32s)]
*  I'm just going to stay in an eight-hour, six or eight-hour feeding window. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1607.38s)]
*  Don't worry about not eating sweets or pizza. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1612.0600000000002s)]
*  Just eat all the food you want to eat, but just eat it in that window. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1614.2600000000002s)]
*  And let's see what happens for two weeks. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1616.98s)]
*  What does the app do? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1618.3400000000001s)]
*  So the app, pretty much, I mean, Joe DeRosa makes fun of me. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1619.74s)]
*  He's like, dude, all it is is a fucking timer. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1622.7s)]
*  The app is just a timer? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1624.5s)]
*  He's like, you're an asshole, dude. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1626.6200000000001s)]
*  You're making it like this is from the Mayans. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1629.0200000000002s)]
*  It's a timer on your phone, you jerk off. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1631.0600000000002s)]
*  The Mayans? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1633.5s)]
*  So basically, when I start eating, like let's say I start eating my first meal is at 10am. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1636.66s)]
*  I'm eating from 10 to 6. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1641.18s)]
*  And at 6pm, I press the button, start fasting. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1644.14s)]
*  And then it starts to go. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1647.26s)]
*  And then at 10am, I'll get a notification the next day, feeding window over, congratulations. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1648.54s)]
*  And then the more time you stay in the fast, it'll say, now you're in the fat burning. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1654.26s)]
*  Now you're in the ketosis, whatever. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1657.76s)]
*  And so I just said to myself, I'm going to stay to this. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1659.6s)]
*  Dude, in those two weeks, even though I was eating bullshit, in two weeks, it's not that [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1663.3s)]
*  the weight dropped, but the composition of my body was starting to change. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1668.8999999999999s)]
*  And I noticed I was like, oh, I ran like half a mile more. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1673.36s)]
*  I had 10 more pounds on the end of the bench press. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1676.8999999999999s)]
*  And then it just became like, this is what I do now. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1679.3799999999999s)]
*  Now I'm Chrissy Interman fasting. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1681.78s)]
*  But then I think the glasses and the watches from the fasting. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1683.02s)]
*  Well, it's a full glow up. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1686.5s)]
*  You're doing the body glow up too. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1688.7s)]
*  Yeah, and Jazz, my girlfriend hates it. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1690.58s)]
*  Why does she hate it? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1693.7s)]
*  Because she's like, glasses, the watch, the body, what the fuck are you doing? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1694.7s)]
*  She doesn't like it? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1698.58s)]
*  I was like, I'm trying to be healthy, babe. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1699.58s)]
*  She wants to keep you fat. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1700.58s)]
*  She wants to keep me fat. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1701.58s)]
*  Wow. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1702.58s)]
*  Yeah, she wants to keep me fat. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1703.58s)]
*  And I told her. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1704.58s)]
*  Are you sure? [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1705.58s)]
*  Maybe not. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1706.58s)]
*  Maybe she just doesn't want to put pressure on you. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1707.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1710.06s)]
*  She's worried if you're going crazy with all the watch and the glasses and the fat that [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1711.06s)]
*  you might snap. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1714.46s)]
*  Well, she gets worried about me because I go harder go home. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1715.46s)]
*  And she's like, you go too fast with things. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1719.18s)]
*  She goes, you go from zero to 100. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1722.06s)]
*  And I just worry that you've lost all this weight in this good period, quick period of [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1724.06s)]
*  time. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1728.06s)]
*  And I just worry that there's a, you know, you go too hard and then something else happens [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1729.06s)]
*  because she reminded me. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1732.4199999999998s)]
*  She's like, remember the last time you lost all this weight this quick? [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1733.4199999999998s)]
*  It was 2018. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1736.3799999999999s)]
*  And I said, yeah. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1737.72s)]
*  And she's like, and then remember all of 2019 you thought you were gay? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1738.72s)]
*  She was like, that's what I, I just don't want that to happen. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1743.02s)]
*  And that's what happened. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1757.3799999999999s)]
*  And it's true. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1758.3799999999999s)]
*  It tipped my personality. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1759.3799999999999s)]
*  Go hard or go home. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1760.3799999999999s)]
*  I go hard or go home. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1761.3799999999999s)]
*  And that's the phase I'm in now with the glasses, with the one, with who I am, you know, like [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1762.56s)]
*  I just booked myself at the Four Seasons. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1766.5s)]
*  I said, I'm fucking living. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1768.22s)]
*  And by the way, you can't, you can't worry about things like that. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1769.54s)]
*  Like am I gay? [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1776.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1777.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1778.26s)]
*  Because I've made a commitment to say I'm not gay. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1779.26s)]
*  At least I have. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1781.42s)]
*  I've kind of said, cause I've been on the fence a while, but I've said, I'm not gay. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1782.42s)]
*  You know what? [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1785.58s)]
*  You're not gay. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1786.58s)]
*  And actually Tim Dillon, the great Tim Dillon told me, he convinced me I'm not gay because [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1787.58s)]
*  he said, you know, it's funny because a lot of people think Tim's not gay. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1791.3799999999999s)]
*  They think it's a scam. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1793.94s)]
*  They think Tim's not gay. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1795.34s)]
*  It's a scam. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1796.34s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1797.34s)]
*  It's a scam. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1798.34s)]
*  Well, so it's like gives them the get out of jail free pass. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1800.1399999999999s)]
*  It's a good point. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1803.1799999999998s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1804.74s)]
*  There's so many things that he can make fun of that we can't even touch. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1805.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1808.54s)]
*  Well, well, you know, that's smart. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1809.54s)]
*  So maybe I'm rethinking this gay thing. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1811.1s)]
*  If that is a scam, maybe that's the scam of the century. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1812.58s)]
*  But he said, but he said, interesting thing. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1815.54s)]
*  He said he knows I'm not gay because even though I play around and I'll be like, you [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1817.62s)]
*  know, I'll joke about guy, I don't need cock unless it's in my fasting window. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1820.8999999999999s)]
*  Like, you know, we'll joke around and whatever. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1824.58s)]
*  But then I asked him seriously once. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1826.6399999999999s)]
*  So I was like, do you think I'm like possibly gay? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1827.82s)]
*  And he was like, and he was like, and he said, no, he said, no, because you know why you're [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1830.02s)]
*  not gay? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1839.7s)]
*  He said, because you actually are insecure about your body. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1840.7s)]
*  He said, so there's times where like, you know, you'll be like, oh, my nipples are fat [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1844.6s)]
*  or like you said, a gay man usually lean in to body positivity, how sexy my body is, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1847.3799999999999s)]
*  whatever. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1854.1399999999999s)]
*  Since you don't, he's like, I just don't think like a gay guy would be more like, look at [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1855.26s)]
*  how look at how imperfectly perfect I am. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1860.5s)]
*  He said most gay, most gay men, not not Tim. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1863.18s)]
*  Tim is a different breed because it's a scam. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1866.3000000000002s)]
*  But but but but I I was like, interesting. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1868.5s)]
*  So that's he kind of gave me the confidence to move forward and say, you're not gay. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1871.18s)]
*  Well, I'm glad he did that for you. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1875.26s)]
*  That's a true friend. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1878.1000000000001s)]
*  Because Jasmine has brought up that she thinks I'm gay multiple times. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1880.18s)]
*  She thought I'm gay right after sex. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1882.98s)]
*  She's just something and I thought I laid it on her. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1885.26s)]
*  We had great powerful sex and she'd be like, honey, like, you know, rubbing my chest. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1887.5s)]
*  She's like, it's OK if you're gay. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1890.9s)]
*  Like it's everything is OK. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1892.5s)]
*  And I'm like, what do you think? [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1894.54s)]
*  And then she'll never give me an answer. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1896.26s)]
*  So maybe that's what she wants. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1898.46s)]
*  Maybe that's what she wants. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1900.38s)]
*  You know what? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1901.38s)]
*  That's what she wants. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1902.38s)]
*  Because I think if I was gay, then there would be less worry from her because she's because [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1903.38s)]
*  I don't think I don't think I think her walking in on me with a woman is a lot harder than [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1907.24s)]
*  her walking in on me with Tim Dillon. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1913.3600000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1915.3600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1916.3600000000001s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1917.3600000000001s)]
*  She would be able to accept that. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1918.3600000000001s)]
*  But I'm not gay. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1919.64s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1920.9s)]
*  That's what I'm trying to say. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1921.9s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1922.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1923.9s)]
*  And and if I was, by the way, I'd be supportive of it. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1924.9s)]
*  And I would be supportive of it as well. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1926.88s)]
*  I'll say this. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1928.48s)]
*  Please do. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1929.48s)]
*  I'm going to commit to not being gay at least to New Year's Eve of 2023. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1930.48s)]
*  And that's and 2024. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1934.26s)]
*  We start over, Jamie. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1936.34s)]
*  Well, the New Year's Eve of 2023. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1937.66s)]
*  How many months is that? [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1939.78s)]
*  Where are we at? [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1940.78s)]
*  Ten months. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1941.78s)]
*  Ten months. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1942.78s)]
*  You can do it. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1943.78s)]
*  I can do it. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1944.78s)]
*  Listen, if I can keep my fasting window in six hours, if you can keep that watch and [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1945.78s)]
*  those glasses on for two weeks, I haven't taken them off once. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1949.7s)]
*  Anthony Aiden specifically told me don't go in the shower with them. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1952.3799999999999s)]
*  I shower with them every day. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1954.9s)]
*  Same thing with the watch. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1955.9s)]
*  He said when I went and got this watch from a shout out my guy, Yanni from material goods, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1958.46s)]
*  it sounds like a guy would sell you a watch. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1962.14s)]
*  He was wearing these glasses. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1963.86s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1964.86s)]
*  We had matching glasses on. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1965.86s)]
*  And he's a great guy. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1968.3799999999999s)]
*  Great guy. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1969.3799999999999s)]
*  And he was like, do you know, he's an awesome guy. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1970.3799999999999s)]
*  He's like, do you know anything about watches? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1971.3799999999999s)]
*  I was like, not a thing. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1972.9799999999998s)]
*  He was like, OK. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1973.9799999999998s)]
*  So he goes, why don't you go around the store and just pick out five watches that you really [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1974.9799999999998s)]
*  like, don't know, you don't even know what the price is. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1979.6999999999998s)]
*  Just pick out what you want. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1981.9399999999998s)]
*  So I pick out five watches and he goes, hmm, interesting. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1983.9399999999998s)]
*  He was like, how much do you think these are? [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1986.9399999999998s)]
*  Total. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1989.1399999999999s)]
*  I was like, I have no idea. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1990.1399999999999s)]
*  I was like, 20 grand. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1991.1399999999999s)]
*  He was like, you just picked out one million dollars worth of watches. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1992.94s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1995.7s)]
*  I was like, whoa, whoa, we were. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1996.7s)]
*  He was like, so obviously, let's scale it back. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=1998.3400000000001s)]
*  He started explaining to me the AP. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2000.68s)]
*  I was a lunatic. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2002.98s)]
*  He started explaining to me the AP, the Rolex, the paddock, all that. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2004.5800000000002s)]
*  And then he brought out this, the Royal Oak. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2008.5400000000002s)]
*  And you know, Santino had shown it to me and I said, it's a sign from God. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2011.3000000000002s)]
*  Santino sent me a link to that. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2016.46s)]
*  Santino has one of those. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2017.46s)]
*  Santino has one of these. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2018.46s)]
*  They're beautiful watches. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2019.46s)]
*  Beautiful watches. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2020.74s)]
*  The price was wild, but I said, you know, I spoke to my accountant. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2022.34s)]
*  I, you know, I got a family to run, so I try to be responsible financially. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2025.34s)]
*  I spoke to my accountant. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2029.18s)]
*  I said, you know, is it okay to buy this watch? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2030.18s)]
*  He said, this is a new Chrissie, huh? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2032.46s)]
*  I said, yeah, I want to live in this. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2034.06s)]
*  He goes, you sure this is not a spur of the moment decision? [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2036.5s)]
*  I said, I said to my accountant, I said, fucking, do I have the green light or what? [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2038.54s)]
*  I'm ready to go. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2041.9s)]
*  And he was like, you can do it. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2043.16s)]
*  It's an appreciating asset. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2044.42s)]
*  So that's why I don't mind you doing it. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2045.58s)]
*  You can do it. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2047.28s)]
*  It appreciates. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2048.28s)]
*  Fine. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2049.28s)]
*  Do it. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2050.28s)]
*  And I got to be honest, when I put this on, there was a part of me that was like, what [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2051.32s)]
*  are you doing, Chris? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2054.36s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2055.36s)]
*  This is not you. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2056.36s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2057.36s)]
*  But now that I've had it on, it kind of, you know what happened? [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2058.36s)]
*  It's like I instantly put it on. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2060.36s)]
*  What a beautiful watch. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2061.76s)]
*  Beautiful watch. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2063.1200000000003s)]
*  I instantly put it on and it took me back to 2010 to March of 2010. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2064.1200000000003s)]
*  And I hadn't even thought about this when I made the decision to do comedy. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2069.48s)]
*  I was on the elliptical at Force Fitness in Ridgewood, Queens. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2072.36s)]
*  Shout out Force Fitness. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2074.84s)]
*  I was on the elliptical working out like a stepmom and I was hitting those calories and [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2076.0s)]
*  I was going hard. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2079.6000000000004s)]

*  That's always been who I am. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2081.6s)]
*  And I was on the elliptical and I had been thinking about the idea of doing comedy for [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2082.88s)]
*  years but I didn't have the balls to do it. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2086.24s)]
*  And I said, Chris, something popped in my head. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2088.7999999999997s)]
*  I was listening to Fallout Boy on my headphone. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2090.44s)]
*  It was at an iPod back then. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2093.48s)]
*  I was listening to Fallout Boy and something about the beat and the song gave me this adrenaline [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2095.08s)]
*  rush and I started thinking about being on stage trying stand up. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2100.48s)]
*  And I said, once you get off this elliptical, once you hit your 45 minutes, you're going [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2105.88s)]
*  to get off, you're going to go back to your mother's house where you live, you're going [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2109.12s)]
*  to take a shower and you're going to go find an open mic and you're going to do this now. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2111.88s)]
*  And I said, I'm doing it. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2115.42s)]
*  And I did it. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2116.6s)]
*  I went and found the creek in the cave when it was Long Island City, Queens. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2117.6s)]
*  Shout out Rebecca Trent. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2119.92s)]
*  First open mic and I walked into that open mic in 2010 and I saw a young Mark Normand, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2121.2799999999997s)]
*  a young Sam Morrill, a young Michael Che, all open micers. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2126.24s)]
*  And I knew they had already been doing it and I was like, these guys are great. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2130.0s)]
*  And I went in there, did my five minutes, absolutely bombed. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2133.4s)]
*  But I said, I'm not turning back and I'm going to go on this journey of comedy. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2136.76s)]
*  And when I put this watch on, something like teleported me back there and was like, dude, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2139.6800000000003s)]

*  Yeah. It's silly. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2193.04s)]
*  And people somehow or another think like that [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2195.32s)]
*  you should give all of your money away because people are starving. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2198.8s)]

*  She shared a wall with the son of Sam and [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2716.68s)]
*  Ronald DeFeo from the Amityville Horror House, the man who killed all those people [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2719.7599999999998s)]
*  in the movie, the Amityville Horror, who was really based off Ronald DeFeo. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2724.24s)]
*  She was in prison with both of them at the same time and the prisoners from [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2727.12s)]
*  Escape from Dannemora, who liked that Showtime show that they made. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2730.6s)]
*  So she was in like real deal prisoners. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2734.4399999999996s)]
*  But she said the son of Sam. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2736.64s)]
*  Now, this was months before the Netflix documentary came out. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2738.7999999999997s)]
*  T.T. Jerry said, she's like, you know, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2741.64s)]
*  the son of Sam, David, did not did not kill all those people. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2743.48s)]
*  He was involved in a cult. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2747.52s)]
*  There were other murderers, but they the city pinned it all on him. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2749.0s)]
*  And then a few months later, this Netflix [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2752.96s)]
*  documentary comes out, came out a couple of years ago, basically saying [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2755.68s)]
*  that most likely son of Sam did not kill all those people. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2759.3599999999997s)]
*  He killed maybe one or two. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2763.3199999999997s)]
*  But there was other murderers that just got away with it. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2765.12s)]
*  Do you know the Henry Lee Lucas story? [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2767.68s)]
*  Henry Lee Lucas. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2769.84s)]
*  Henry Lee Lucas, they made a film about him called Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2771.04s)]
*  OK, and it's a guy who got arrested for 62 murders. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2775.48s)]
*  And he was basically a drifter and he was [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2779.96s)]
*  traveling across the country murdering people. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2781.96s)]
*  OK, but they think that what really happened was they came up to him and they said, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2784.16s)]
*  you know, hey, Henry, you know, there was a few people that were killed behind [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2790.6s)]
*  the bushes in Indianapolis in 76, which sure loved to solve that crime. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2794.08s)]
*  Was that you? [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2799.4s)]
*  That's me. I killed them too. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2800.2s)]
*  Well, did you do it with a knife? [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2802.16s)]
*  Because we found a knife. Yep. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2803.92s)]
*  Knife killed him with a knife. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2805.4s)]
*  Yeah. And this guy was basically a dullard and may may have killed people like, you [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2806.92s)]
*  know, a lot of drifters have killed people. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2812.32s)]
*  But it seems like Google that. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2814.16s)]
*  Make sure I'm correct on this. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2816.64s)]
*  I think now they think that they attributed a bunch of crimes to him that [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2817.84s)]
*  he couldn't possibly have committed. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2822.4s)]
*  It's a wild thing. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2823.76s)]
*  The depraved serial killer who confessed to hundreds of murders. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2825.1600000000003s)]
*  This is it. So it was more than 62, which is what he was. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2828.5600000000004s)]
*  I think he was originally charged with 600 people. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2832.4s)]
*  OK, drawn together by shared childhood trauma, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2834.8s)]
*  Henry Lee Lucas and Otis Toole became lovers, then serial killers who terrorized [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2837.48s)]
*  America in the 1970s. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2842.5600000000004s)]
*  So it's but he confessed to hundreds of murders. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2844.32s)]
*  But they think that some of them he couldn't possibly have done. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2848.4s)]
*  But did he stay in prison for the rest of his life because of it? [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2851.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, he they might have killed him in prison. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2856.12s)]
*  I don't know what happened. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2858.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't know if I don't know if he's still alive. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2859.7999999999997s)]
*  But see if he got if that's a story that they got him to confess to a bunch of [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2861.9199999999996s)]
*  murders that he couldn't have actually done. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2866.96s)]
*  That's a common thing, though, right? [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2868.8399999999997s)]
*  People confess to stuff all the time. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2870.52s)]
*  You know, I there's a show on Apple TV was called Blackbird. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2872.7599999999998s)]
*  It just came out last year. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2876.04s)]
*  It's about a real story about a guy who what his tactic would be. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2877.16s)]
*  Is he murdered a lot of people? [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2881.04s)]
*  But he would he would say to the police, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2883.4s)]
*  oh, I murdered that girl in that county, confessing to it. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2886.12s)]
*  But then they would go through the research and be like, no, you couldn't have [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2889.4s)]
*  possibly. But he would cop to it. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2891.92s)]
*  And then the cops would be like he did that like five times. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2893.7200000000003s)]
*  They'd be like every county he was investigating. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2896.28s)]
*  They'd be like, that's what he does. He confesses to murders. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2898.6s)]
*  He's a bullshitter. But he really was killing people. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2900.6400000000003s)]
*  He was using he was confessing to false [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2902.92s)]
*  ones so he could get away with the real ones. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2905.08s)]
*  Holy wild, right? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2906.8s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2908.8799999999997s)]
*  So it's like some of these guys are so smart. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2910.24s)]
*  Do the show. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2913.12s)]
*  This guy, this actor, I think is William Hauser. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2914.16s)]
*  Something. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2917.2799999999997s)]
*  This is one of the best actors in my generation. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2918.0s)]
*  No, Joe, I don't know if you know this guy. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2920.9199999999996s)]
*  This guy's acting is like Daniel Day Lewis level. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2922.8799999999997s)]
*  He is a phenomenal actor. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2926.4399999999996s)]
*  When you watch the show Blackbird, you cannot believe it. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2927.9599999999996s)]
*  Where I'm like, and this is on Apple Plus, Apple TV. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2931.04s)]
*  This is one of the best shows I've seen. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2934.0s)]
*  Came out last summer. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2935.9599999999996s)]
*  No shit. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2937.12s)]
*  This kid is literally like phenomenal. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2938.28s)]
*  And then and then I'm watching 101 Dalmatians a day later with my kids. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2940.68s)]
*  And he's in that. I'm like, look, he's fucking lunatic. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2944.0s)]
*  He plays Richard Jule. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2946.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2948.48s)]
*  The movie about the Olympic Park bombing. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2949.44s)]
*  Yep. Wow. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2952.16s)]
*  Unbelievable actor. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2952.92s)]
*  He was also in that in that sketch show. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2954.0s)]
*  I think you should leave on Netflix, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2955.44s)]
*  which is one of the funniest sketch shows I've ever seen in my life. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2956.76s)]
*  He's got great sketches in that that guy. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2959.32s)]
*  But that show Blackbird was it's unbelievable. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2961.64s)]
*  So basically what happens is this guy who who's from he's from a bunch of movies. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2965.04s)]
*  This kid is ripped, by the way. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2969.48s)]
*  This kid has to be intermittent fasting. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2970.64s)]
*  He's in the watch. Not the watchman. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2974.72s)]
*  The the with with, yeah, Samuel L. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2976.56s)]
*  Jackson's in it. It's it's a famous movie and he's excellent. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2980.28s)]
*  But basically the premise of it is based on a true story. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2984.04s)]
*  This guy, the guy, the hottie with the body, he gets convicted 10 years in prison [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2986.8s)]
*  for gun charges. I think he's a guy out of Massachusetts. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2991.72s)]
*  So and he was a good con man. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2994.48s)]
*  Right. This is all real. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2996.32s)]
*  Good con man could gift a gab, whatever. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=2997.6000000000004s)]
*  So the FBI wants to pin the the guy with the mutton chops, Hauser. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3000.28s)]
*  They want to pin Larry Hall is his name in real life. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3004.92s)]
*  They want to pin murders on him. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3007.0400000000004s)]
*  They know that they've kind of caught up to his game now. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3008.28s)]
*  They know that he lies about murders here to commit murders here. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3010.88s)]
*  They know it. But they got to convict. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3014.0800000000004s)]
*  They got to get him to confess to one of these murders because they found the [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3015.6000000000004s)]
*  girl's body because he's killing kids like 14 year old girls, like brutal shit, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3018.5600000000004s)]
*  raping them. Horrific. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3022.08s)]
*  So they say to this kid, to the to the jacked guy, they say, look, [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3023.88s)]
*  you got the gift of gab. You got 10 years in federal prison. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3027.2799999999997s)]
*  OK, you're three months into your sentence. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3029.92s)]
*  We're going to transfer you to this maximum security prison where Larry Hall is. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3032.2s)]
*  If you can get him to confess to the murder of this girl that we have evidence on [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3036.84s)]
*  and you can get that your sentence is commuted immediately and you're out of prison. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3043.84s)]
*  That's all you got to do. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3047.6s)]
*  But he was in a minimum security prison. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3048.92s)]
*  So he would be able to either coast through 10 years or take a chance and go [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3050.7599999999998s)]
*  to the prison with murderers, rapists and potentially be murdered in the shower [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3055.24s)]
*  stall. But if he can get this guy gift of gab and get him to confess, [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3058.7999999999997s)]
*  then he'll get out. And that's what the show is about. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3063.9599999999996s)]
*  And it was, dude, amazing show like Edge of My Seat. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3066.64s)]
*  It was one of the best shows I've seen in a long time. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3069.72s)]
*  That's all I want to watch. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3072.2799999999997s)]

*  Thank you for bringing that up. I'm fucking pumped about that. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3076.12s)]
*  I've been looking for a new show. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3078.68s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, and by the way, before let me just finish the thought about Jerry. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3080.08s)]
*  What I want to say is the son of Sam thing. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3082.68s)]
*  He said, you know, he was a serial killer. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3084.2s)]
*  Yes. And don't get me wrong, murderer deserves to be in prison. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3086.16s)]
*  He said the biggest fucking lunatic, like he was like the only person who I met. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3089.52s)]
*  I was like, this guy needs to be like either put to death or kept like in a cage, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3093.36s)]
*  like under the jail. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3098.48s)]
*  He said was Ronald DeFeo, who the Amityville horror house guy, [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3099.88s)]
*  because he said he would cook for him all the time around the phone. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3103.04s)]
*  He would like let Ronald DeFeo like jerk off to me. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3105.84s)]
*  They put like a prison mirror and he would like [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3107.92s)]
*  because he was trans, Jerry's, he would shake his ass a little bit [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3109.7599999999998s)]
*  and let Ronald like get his rocks off, whatever. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3112.2s)]
*  He didn't care. He said. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3114.24s)]
*  But every morning he would make Ronald DeFeo Jr. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3115.2799999999997s)]
*  like little breakfast and his little, you know, they had like little [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3117.68s)]
*  hot hot stoves in there. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3121.2s)]
*  They would let prisoners like Jerry after you did enough time, give you some stuff. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3122.4s)]
*  He'd make a little bacon and stuff for him. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3125.96s)]
*  And he said every morning, like clockwork, seven days a week, every morning, [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3127.12s)]
*  bring Ronald his food and say, how was your how was your night, Ronald? [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3130.7999999999997s)]
*  How are you feeling? He was like, good. I feel good. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3133.48s)]
*  I just I didn't kill my grandma. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3135.12s)]
*  It's the only thing I just I killed everyone in that house, [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3137.4s)]
*  but I did not get my grandma. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3139.76s)]
*  So but everything else other than that, it's good. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3141.4s)]
*  And Jerry, OK. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3143.4s)]
*  And then keep. So he's like, still, he's in prison for the. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3144.84s)]
*  And that is true. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3148.0s)]
*  The only one he didn't kill in that house, the grandma either got out [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3148.7200000000003s)]
*  or wasn't there. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3151.88s)]
*  But he was he was like, there's no rehabilitation for that man. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3152.7200000000003s)]
*  He genuinely believes if he does not kill his. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3155.8s)]
*  He would say to him, if I don't kill my grandma, I'm not getting into heaven. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3158.28s)]
*  So he had it warped. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3161.44s)]
*  He killed his entire family. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3162.96s)]
*  He's like, that's how I get to heaven. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3164.2400000000002s)]
*  But I got to get the grandma. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3166.28s)]
*  And then he died in prison recently. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3167.84s)]
*  But I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3169.32s)]
*  I know it's it's it's wild. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3171.88s)]
*  Yeah, there's people that are just not wired correctly. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3173.6000000000004s)]
*  Dude, why? That's that's that's a real problem with this homeless situation. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3177.76s)]
*  It's a real problem with like this guy in Idaho. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3182.32s)]
*  Yeah, there's people that are just pedophiles. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3185.84s)]
*  By the way, shout out to the FBI for finding that guy. Thank you. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3187.76s)]
*  Thank you. Because the FBI takes a lot of shit justifiably for, you know, [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3191.2000000000003s)]
*  like agent provocateur accusations at the capitals riot. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3195.2s)]
*  But the fact they caught this fucking psycho, it shows you how necessary they are. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3200.3999999999996s)]
*  The FBI is the FBI. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3205.0s)]
*  They need to be there. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3206.56s)]
*  Like, you can't say let's disband the FBI. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3207.72s)]
*  Jesus fucking Christ. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3210.24s)]
*  Listen, here's the people. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3211.3599999999997s)]
*  But people think like that. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3212.4399999999996s)]
*  It's the same as defund the police, defund this, defund the military. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3213.64s)]
*  Like, settle the fuck down. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3217.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, you know, when you hear people go off, [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3218.48s)]
*  they're just regurgitating things they hear on social media. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3220.48s)]
*  It's like, what do you think? [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3222.64s)]
*  The American justice system is the best justice system in the world. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3223.8399999999997s)]
*  The FBI is the top. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3226.52s)]
*  The U.S. military is the top of the top. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3227.6s)]
*  Like, what are we talking about here? [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3230.0s)]
*  You know, like it's not perfect. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3231.8399999999997s)]
*  No, no one's saying it's perfect. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3233.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. But the defunding thing, I don't just don't agree. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3234.96s)]
*  I see what the results are when it comes to police. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3239.08s)]
*  Yeah. It's not a good result. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3242.56s)]
*  And if they don't change course, this is bad. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3244.24s)]
*  No, dude, I've been yelling refund. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3246.96s)]
*  I yell refund the police. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3248.3599999999997s)]
*  I mean, I love the police. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3249.7599999999998s)]
*  It needs to be trained and it needs to be a position [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3251.36s)]
*  that's difficult to acquire that gets respected. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3254.6000000000004s)]
*  Now, how you make that shift? [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3257.0800000000004s)]
*  But it's got to be like, you know, people are terrified [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3258.48s)]
*  of this concept of militarizing the police and rightly so. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3262.04s)]
*  You don't want tanks rolling down the street and martial law [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3265.6400000000003s)]
*  and dictators who are essentially, you know, they used to be governors. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3268.6800000000003s)]
*  Now they're dictators and they're controlling populations. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3272.2400000000002s)]
*  You don't want that. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3274.2400000000002s)]
*  But you don't want untrained people in that role. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3275.28s)]
*  And you don't want people that don't have a real clear understanding [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3278.56s)]
*  of what to do in any scenario. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3283.24s)]
*  So they have to run drills the same way they do it in the military. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3284.88s)]
*  In the military, they're constantly training. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3287.88s)]
*  If you're in a special operations group like my friends that have been the SEALs, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3290.68s)]
*  they fucking constantly train for any scenario they're trying to do. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3294.7599999999998s)]
*  Any any like breach, they're trying to get into a house. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3299.48s)]
*  They train. They have. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3302.4s)]
*  That's a thing that police should be doing to all the time. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3303.88s)]
*  Jaco Willink, who was a Navy SEAL commander, of course, the fucking he's the man. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3306.8799999999997s)]
*  I love that guy to death. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3311.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. But one of the things that he said is like, you have to train people [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3312.8799999999997s)]
*  in order for them to be able to respond in high pressure situations. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3317.04s)]
*  You have to train them of all the possible scenarios. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3320.56s)]
*  And by the way, you should be able to have some sort of physical confrontation. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3323.64s)]
*  You cannot be completely unskilled physically [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3329.08s)]
*  and be a police officer and be 100 percent effective. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3331.8799999999997s)]
*  No. When you see those people, when they get tackled and guys get on top of them, [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3334.7599999999998s)]
*  they don't know what to do. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3339.04s)]
*  Right. How do you not have any understanding of grappling? [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3340.12s)]
*  And you're engaged in these physical altercations with people like Andrew Yang [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3343.7599999999998s)]
*  said, you should be at least a purple belt in jujitsu. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3348.0s)]
*  I agree with that, which is a great concept. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3350.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. The purple belt is a very proficient level of jujitsu. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3353.24s)]
*  Yes, 100 percent. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3356.12s)]
*  You should know how to defend yourself, but you should also be like well funded [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3357.68s)]
*  and well trained. It should be a more prestigious position. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3361.68s)]
*  I think we put cops in the same category that we put like teachers sometimes. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3365.2s)]
*  Right. We need them. We know we need them, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3369.7999999999997s)]
*  but we don't like really care and support them. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3371.24s)]
*  Right. And we only look at them when they do terrible things. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3373.44s)]
*  Yeah, I think too. I think it's in Germany. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3375.92s)]
*  They have to go through two years of schooling and training to become a police officer. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3378.92s)]
*  I think it was NYPD. I think it's only six months. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3382.72s)]
*  Germany went through some shit. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3384.96s)]
*  Oh, no. Yeah, Germany. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3386.24s)]
*  They had a hard time with some bad policing. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3388.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Germany, they as the kids say, came out the pocket. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3389.92s)]
*  Germany, they went a little wild for a little. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3393.6800000000003s)]
*  Can you imagine living in Germany now? [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3396.2000000000003s)]
*  And wait a minute, what did we do? [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3398.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Like how long ago was that? [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3399.64s)]
*  Yeah. 80 years ago. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3401.04s)]
*  Yeah. What the fuck? [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3402.28s)]
*  Dude, how about this? [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3403.48s)]
*  I'm from a place in New York, Ridgewood, Queens, right? [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3404.2000000000003s)]
*  It's like Queens, Brooklyn, but Ridgewood, right? [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3406.64s)]
*  Big time German neighborhood. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3408.52s)]
*  When I grew up like my mom's German, you know, hardcore German. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3409.76s)]
*  When I grew up, it was the Germans were like fading away, but still somewhat there. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3412.88s)]
*  There was a German man who lived across the street from me, like 98 year old guy. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3416.56s)]
*  So 1937, 1937 or 38, [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3420.08s)]
*  the Nazis sold out Madison Square Garden. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3425.76s)]
*  Yes, they seen the rally, right? [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3428.92s)]
*  The bakery that's still there in my neighborhood was the one that catered it [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3431.4s)]
*  for the Nazis, because this is before this is pre Holocaust. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3436.08s)]
*  No one knew what the Nazis were going to be. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3439.2000000000003s)]
*  Right. So that so then when I asked, look at that. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3441.6s)]
*  Yeah. The bakery in my neighborhood. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3445.12s)]
*  What did they stand for then? [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3446.8s)]
*  Did what they stand for alter over time? [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3448.76s)]
*  Like were the Nazis always anti Jew and about the Aryan race? [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3451.44s)]
*  Or did that become that? [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3456.36s)]
*  No, it became that it was just pro Germany. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3457.84s)]
*  It was we were ravaged by Germany was ravaged World War One, high inflation. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3460.0800000000004s)]
*  So all all Hitler and the Nazi party did was say, we're going back pro German. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3464.96s)]
*  This everything's coming through Germany, jobs coming through Germany, Germany, [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3470.5600000000004s)]
*  Germany, Germany. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3473.88s)]
*  So people looked at that and saw patriotism and nationalism in the United States [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3474.6800000000003s)]
*  and said, I fuck with that. I support that. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3478.56s)]
*  The Holocaust and all that came very quickly a couple of years later. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3481.0s)]
*  But that was not the message. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3484.2s)]
*  That's why people are so scared of nationalism. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3485.2799999999997s)]
*  That's why people are so scared of powerful, charismatic leaders, [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3487.72s)]
*  because like that is that's a piece of history that's repeated over and over [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3492.4s)]
*  and over again. I mean, how many times in history has genocide been committed? [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3496.7999999999997s)]
*  If you told a 1935 German that, hey, in six years, you're going to be gassing [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3500.7599999999998s)]
*  and exterminating fellow German citizens that are Jewish, they would say, [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3507.0s)]
*  not possible. That's not going to happen. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3511.36s)]
*  But then it did. Just like the same. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3513.36s)]
*  If you told someone in 1855, hey, six years from now, [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3514.8s)]
*  you're going to be a civil war brothers are going to be killed. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3518.76s)]
*  They would say, no, no, that's not going to happen. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3520.84s)]
*  And then, boom, it happens. Look at this. Yep. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3522.76s)]
*  Madison Square Garden pro American rally. Yep. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3524.8s)]
*  And let me tell you something. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3528.4s)]
*  So the Nazi was a pro American rally, pro American rally [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3529.64s)]
*  catered by the bakery in my neighborhood. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3532.92s)]
*  So I know one thing for sure at this rally. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3534.6s)]
*  They had excellent Linzer tarts, the Linzer tarts in that bakery. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3536.48s)]
*  I mean, unbelievable. How weird. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3539.96s)]
*  Yeah. Look at that. I mean, yes. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3542.68s)]
*  So that's the thing is like, you know, and I get it like today's society, [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3544.68s)]
*  like the kids, you know, they'll just get a five second clip on TikTok [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3548.0s)]
*  and think they know the history of the world. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3551.16s)]
*  They're not reading the books. They're not doing the research. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3552.56s)]
*  You know, I watch this stuff and it's it's it's, you know, [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3554.96s)]
*  no excuse for what the Germans did. It was horrifying. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3557.8s)]
*  Why are they beating this guy up? What's going on? [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3560.04s)]
*  He rushed the stage. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3563.28s)]
*  Yeah, he rushed. Yeah, he rushed the stage. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3564.48s)]
*  It's a, you know, climate change is real. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3566.08s)]
*  The big sign. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3568.88s)]
*  So there's always been like Antifa characters. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3569.56s)]
*  There's always been protesters. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3573.68s)]
*  Well, yeah, like radical ones like this. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3574.88s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3577.2400000000002s)]

*  When you start to get into history, you realize like everything happens. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3579.0s)]
*  It's just different characters. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3581.48s)]
*  You know, it's different reasons why, but it's the same mindset, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3583.2400000000002s)]
*  same personalities. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3585.6s)]
*  So interesting. Look how thin everyone is. Yeah. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3586.88s)]

*  Those are kids. No, those are kids. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3591.48s)]
*  They are kids. But look how thin the kids are. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3592.96s)]
*  If you had a group of kids like that today, what are the odds they're going to be thin? [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3594.88s)]
*  I know kids look so healthy back then. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3598.08s)]
*  Look, look, all the people. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3600.04s)]
*  If you look at all the people, like none of them are obese. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3601.12s)]
*  No, none of them are. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3603.04s)]

*  Yeah. Well, probably mentally ill, too. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3609.44s)]
*  And look, there's a picture. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3611.16s)]
*  And you see that George Washington in the back. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3612.36s)]
*  That was the background because they were honoring. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3614.52s)]
*  They the Germans and the Americans at that time believed, oh, you know, dude, [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3616.68s)]
*  I read a book called The Nazi Symbiosis that kind of said that [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3621.12s)]
*  the president, you know, [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3627.88s)]
*  Winston Churchill and FDR knew about the Holocaust stuff happening. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3629.48s)]
*  They knew about it. You know, they had their intelligence, right? [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3634.6s)]
*  Secret Service, whatever. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3636.96s)]
*  And they knew about it. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3638.3199999999997s)]
*  But the Holocaust in initial stages, horrific. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3639.24s)]
*  Can't state that enough, but was yielding medical results. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3643.3199999999997s)]
*  They were getting like what? [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3648.0s)]
*  Yeah, they were like different. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3649.56s)]
*  I don't know the exact ones, but there are different types of medications [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3650.88s)]
*  that we use today came out of the Holocaust, different types of lab results [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3653.28s)]
*  because they were just using them as guinea pigs, human beings. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3656.44s)]
*  So it was yielding results. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3659.48s)]
*  And so they were allowing it to happen. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3660.7200000000003s)]
*  It wasn't until Hitler crossed the line. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3662.4s)]
*  I mean, across the line from the beginning, but went, stopped yielding results [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3665.28s)]
*  and just started gassing everybody. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3668.1600000000003s)]
*  Did Churchill and everybody say, OK, now we got to go in. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3669.76s)]
*  So nobody's innocent. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3672.36s)]
*  You know what I mean? Nobody's innocent in the war. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3673.6400000000003s)]
*  You know, like I just did a whole I do a segment on. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3676.4s)]
*  I do a YouTube thing called Christy. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3678.88s)]
*  Where I do a history thing and I just did the rape of Nan King. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3680.88s)]
*  Oh, my God, I do know about that. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3683.6800000000003s)]
*  So I was getting so much shit on the Internet from Japanese people saying that [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3685.2400000000002s)]
*  what I am spewing is disinformation. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3689.1600000000003s)]
*  And I'm like, there's pictures in video. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3691.2400000000002s)]
*  There's pictures of Japanese soldiers bayoneting Chinese babies in front of their family. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3693.1600000000003s)]
*  So I'm not it's not disinformation. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3697.48s)]
*  It's just you have to accept history as it is. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3698.92s)]
*  Like every group, whoever has power will act in a certain way. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3701.44s)]
*  That's not right. It's a human thing. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3706.28s)]
*  Most groups do that. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3708.04s)]
*  And it's not just one thing. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3708.96s)]
*  Like I feel like we live in a society now where it's like only one group of people [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3710.96s)]
*  where the bad guys throughout history, it's like, no, no, no, no. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3714.44s)]
*  Everybody's been a bad guy at some point. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3716.6s)]
*  It's just who had power when? [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3718.32s)]
*  Well, I think we're just aware of human nature now in a different way. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3719.84s)]
*  You know, if you look at the work of like guys like Steven Pinker, [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3724.68s)]
*  they talk about like crime in history. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3728.24s)]
*  Yeah. And if you look at the trend, everything is going to a less violent, [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3729.92s)]

*  No way. No way for other people to find out. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3764.96s)]
*  No way. Unless the newspapers are reporting on it, [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3768.0s)]
*  unless you have boots on the ground, you have to have photographs, [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3770.88s)]
*  you have to have video. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3773.32s)]
*  It's so hard for the truth to get out. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3774.32s)]
*  So they could do whatever the fuck they wanted if they had the guns. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3777.2s)]
*  Yeah. They pulled it. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3780.84s)]
*  And people have it's almost like if you put us in that scenario, [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3781.76s)]
*  you put us in the scenario of war. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3786.76s)]
*  It's like a program that just gets activated in our minds. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3788.88s)]
*  And we can we can murder and other people very easily. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3792.84s)]
*  Yeah, there's programs that like one of the things you find out when you hunt. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3795.88s)]
*  All right. The first time I ever went hunting, I shot this deer. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3800.2000000000003s)]
*  I was like, oh, wow. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3803.2400000000002s)]
*  This is like a life program in the brain that we're going to eat this now. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3804.84s)]
*  Yeah. You go after something you do. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3808.92s)]
*  And when you're successful, it's like it recognizes that there's this area [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3810.5600000000004s)]
*  of your mind that has always existed. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3815.1600000000003s)]
*  Sure. Yeah. There's an area of your mind that's always existed. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3817.36s)]
*  It just hasn't been activated by action. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3820.28s)]
*  Right. And then once it hits there, it's like, oh, there's a historical precedent [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3822.4s)]
*  for this this this mindset. Right. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3825.7200000000003s)]
*  There's a historical precedent for this vibe. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3827.64s)]
*  This is the like hunter gatherer vibe. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3829.56s)]
*  Yeah. Like, wow. People get it when they catch a fish. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3832.1600000000003s)]
*  When you catch a fish, this is like feeling like, whoa, it's this exciting feeling. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3834.28s)]
*  Yeah. And it's like you're you're tapping into some human reward mechanisms [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3838.36s)]
*  that have always existed. Interesting. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3842.92s)]
*  Yeah. See, I've never went I've never went hunting and I've never done anything like that. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3844.8s)]
*  But I wonder if I start if I should, because I want to get I got one spin on this planet. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3849.52s)]
*  I want to experience it all. Yeah. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3854.32s)]
*  You know, I kind of I've never done a drug in my life. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3856.36s)]
*  I don't think you should go to war because we're talking about that. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3859.08s)]
*  Originally, don't tap into that one that I can't do because I have a neck issue. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3861.12s)]
*  So I but but like I start to think about like, you know, I want to do the ayahuasca. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3866.4s)]
*  I want to do things safely like, you know, what about like, [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3872.76s)]
*  would you ever think about micro dosing heroin? [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3876.08s)]
*  I think you would have to do it with someone like Dr. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3879.0s)]
*  Karl Hart, who actually knows what you know, what's real, what's not. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3882.68s)]
*  You'd have to test it. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3886.16s)]
*  And you have to be really wary about the idea that you could possibly get addicted to it. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3887.64s)]
*  Like, I don't know what I don't know why people get hooked on pain pills. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3892.16s)]
*  But I can't imagine that I'm above that. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3898.52s)]
*  I can't imagine that if I didn't get hurt and I started taking those things, [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3901.12s)]
*  they wouldn't get me. They get so many people. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3904.28s)]
*  I have so many friends that have had problems trying to get off those things [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3907.04s)]
*  after they have had surgery, been injured. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3909.7599999999998s)]
*  I would worry. I would worry about that. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3912.88s)]
*  I would worry. I would worry. I'd like it. Right. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3914.88s)]
*  I'd worry. I'd like it because it doesn't seem like it sucks. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3917.44s)]
*  Well, I think about that with, yeah, I've never been addicted to pain pills or drugs, [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3919.92s)]
*  but I have been addicted to Nutella. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3923.36s)]
*  I've been addicted to pizza. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3925.2s)]
*  No, but I love the right. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3926.52s)]
*  Because if you told me if you told me, Chris, you can never have Nutella [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3927.88s)]
*  or pizza again because it's going to cost you your family. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3932.68s)]
*  I'd be like, I don't know if I could do it. I'm going to get mad. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3935.36s)]
*  Well, I think painkillers and drugs is like that for certain people. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3937.76s)]
*  So whatever you're addicted to, even if it's positive, they it's their brain [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3940.6400000000003s)]
*  chemistry is attached to it in the same way that you need to eat elk [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3944.76s)]
*  or whatever it may be. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3949.1600000000003s)]
*  Well, you know, we're talking on a spectrum here because the Nutella [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3950.36s)]
*  spectrum is like the smallest measurement [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3953.48s)]
*  versus the heroin where you have bone aches and you're fucking shaking [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3957.48s)]
*  the leaf and sweating because you need to get your fix. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3962.3199999999997s)]
*  Somewhere in the middle of that is it. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3966.08s)]
*  But I think the addict, you know, is like, I think it's just like it's [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3969.3199999999997s)]
*  because we're just all different chemistry, right? [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3974.3199999999997s)]
*  Like, isn't it wild? Like, I don't your brain sees might even see the color [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3976.12s)]
*  red different than I see it. It's fucking nuts. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3980.68s)]
*  It's not you are having a totally different experience than me. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3982.96s)]
*  Right. You know, you clearly see that when you see what people are really [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3987.08s)]
*  interested in, you know, like people that watch darts all day. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3989.92s)]
*  Yeah. You know, it's like, you know, there's things that people love that [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3993.28s)]
*  I just don't understand why you're interested in that at all. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3996.36s)]
*  But that's OK. Like there's music that I'm not interested in. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=3998.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And I used to think it sucked. Yeah. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4002.16s)]
*  But now I realize, no, it doesn't suck. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4004.0s)]
*  It's just like it's not what I like. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4005.52s)]
*  And me thinking that it sucks, unless it actually does suck, unless [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4007.2400000000002s)]

*  That song specifically, I have no idea. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4181.36s)]
*  No rhyme or reason why. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4183.759999999999s)]
*  I just heard it and I said, this genuinely makes me feel better. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4185.16s)]

*  They're the only band that I've ever paid money to see. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4194.0s)]
*  I saw them at MSG. I was so excited. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4196.0s)]
*  Like I went with my girlfriend, Jasmine, and she was like, [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4198.0s)]

*  This is how much I love this band. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4204.16s)]
*  I found out that the lead singer saw the only comedy bit I've had [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4205.32s)]
*  that went viral is my Chris DiStefano 9-11 story. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4210.32s)]
*  He saw it. He said, not for me, just not his comedies, not for me. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4213.32s)]
*  Don't give a shit at all. Don't give a shit at all. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4218.04s)]
*  Even though I know the lead singer, the band doesn't think I'm funny at all. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4220.44s)]
*  I'm like, I still fuck with this band. Good for you. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4223.8s)]
*  And I don't care. And and my friends make fun of me all the time. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4226.4s)]

*  That band, the 1975 makes me happier than any other piece of music [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4230.96s)]
*  I've ever listened to in my life. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4235.28s)]
*  And I'm not afraid to say it. And you know what? Maybe I am gay. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4236.8s)]
*  Maybe I am. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4239.08s)]
*  Let that sit there for a little bit. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4240.08s)]
*  There was a lot. There was a lot happened there. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4242.32s)]
*  Maybe I am. You decided to that music that you were going to [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4245.08s)]
*  you needed a reason to pull yourself out of the dark. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4248.08s)]
*  And that music was like the catalyst. Yeah. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4250.08s)]
*  So you were looking for something. Yeah. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4252.08s)]
*  Could have been Barbra Streisand. It could have been anybody. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4254.08s)]
*  Could have been the way we were. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4256.08s)]
*  Two two two musicians have changed my life from from from [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4258.08s)]
*  have made me go from the light to the dark from the dark to the light. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4262.08s)]
*  It is the it is the night of the night. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4265.08s)]
*  It is the dark to the light. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4267.08s)]
*  It is the it is the 1975 and it is Whitney Houston. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4268.08s)]
*  Those are the two Whitney Houston's a wild story, man. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4273.08s)]
*  Did you ever see the documentary about her? [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4276.08s)]
*  Did you see that? Didn't Joey Diaz used to sell her coke? [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4278.08s)]
*  Yeah. Ricky Martin. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4282.08s)]
*  Yeah. Joey Diaz is a man I need to meet. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4284.08s)]
*  After the Grammys. You never met Joey. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4286.08s)]
*  I've never once in my life met Joey Diaz. I know he lives in Jersey now. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4288.08s)]
*  Doesn't want to. I want to try my friend Brian Morton. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4290.08s)]
*  Good friends with Joey Diaz. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4293.08s)]
*  I just want to go take Joey to lunch. I'm not looking to do content. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4295.08s)]
*  I just want to get to meet Joey Diaz. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4298.08s)]
*  We'll talk afterwards. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4300.08s)]
*  Okay. We're Joey's going to be coming out here when the club's opening up soon. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4301.08s)]
*  And when Joey comes out here, we'll have him come out here too. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4305.08s)]
*  Okay. I would love to. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4307.08s)]
*  The two of you guys together. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4308.08s)]
*  Because when I listen to him, I'm like, that sounds like my dad's friends. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4309.08s)]
*  You know, that is my father and his friends sitting around a barbecue telling stories. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4312.08s)]
*  They all love Joey Diaz. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4317.08s)]
*  He's the best. Yeah. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4319.08s)]
*  That's an original human being. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4321.08s)]
*  No, no. Original. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4322.08s)]
*  And so I don't know if you, that documentary, by the way, Whitney Houston, I think personally, [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4323.08s)]
*  one of the most beautiful women of all time. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4327.08s)]
*  To me, the most beautiful women of all time, Whitney Houston, Gwen Stefani, [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4329.08s)]
*  and I'm not trying to be funny, a young Barbara Walters. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4334.08s)]
*  That's a good list. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4338.08s)]
*  Yep. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4339.08s)]
*  If you're into Barbara Walters. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4340.08s)]
*  I like that. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4341.08s)]
*  But she, yeah, she was stunningly beautiful. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4342.08s)]
*  But what's crazy is that like drugs took her down. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4343.08s)]
*  Unfortunately. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4346.08s)]
*  Like someone that talented. That talented. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4347.08s)]
*  Isn't it eerie too? [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4349.08s)]
*  She died drowning death in the bathtub, then her daughter dies drowning death in the bathtub. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4350.08s)]
*  Isn't that eerie? [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4354.08s)]
*  It's horrible. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4355.08s)]
*  But I don't know if the documentary actually says that Whitney Houston was sexually molested by her aunt as a child, [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4356.08s)]
*  which you don't ever really hear a female child being molested by another female child. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4362.08s)]
*  It was Dionne Warwick's sister was her aunt who molested her. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4367.08s)]
*  And that they believe Whitney Houston has struggled with her drug abuses because she was a lesbian. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4370.08s)]
*  But then the scientists say, well, was she a lesbian or was she molested at a young age? [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4374.08s)]
*  She was molested at a young age by a woman and then warped her sexual kind of part of her brain. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4378.08s)]
*  And now she thinks she is, but she's not. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4384.08s)]
*  Very interesting. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4386.08s)]
*  But I personally think that the best voice of all time and that another, the 1975 I saw in an interview once said that they love, [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4387.08s)]
*  they were inspired by Whitney Houston. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4396.08s)]
*  I said, this is my fucking band, dude. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4398.08s)]
*  This is my band. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4400.08s)]
*  And then even meet and greets. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4401.08s)]
*  I would do meet and greets after shows. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4402.08s)]
*  And I would just feel I couldn't articulate it, but I would feel disgusting doing the meet and greets. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4404.08s)]
*  And I would feel like I'm doing these meet and greets and I'm stealing these people's money. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4409.08s)]
*  And I hate the way I feel in my skin doing these meet and greets. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4413.08s)]
*  And I've agreed to them and I hate them. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4417.08s)]
*  And I was counting down the shows to when they were gone because I said, I'm giving you my performance. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4418.08s)]
*  I'm proud of my comedy. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4423.08s)]
*  But to make you, you know, charge you twenty five dollars, take a picture with me, I feel disgusting. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4424.08s)]
*  I would take the picture with you for free, but it was something that I wanted to try out and I regretted it. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4430.08s)]
*  And then I saw an interview from Matty Healy of the 1975 talk about meet and greets and I felt like he was talking directly to me. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4434.08s)]
*  He said he articulated the way he articulate what I was feeling. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4441.08s)]
*  He said, here's the thing. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4444.08s)]
*  If you're an artist and you're doing meet and greets, right, whatever you want to do is fine. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4446.08s)]
*  But here's here's what it actually is. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4449.08s)]
*  He said, instead of going through a third party or ticket master for the add on fee of the meet and greet, [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4451.08s)]
*  you take the picture with the fan after the show and then ask them to give you twenty five dollars cash and see how that makes you feel. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4457.08s)]
*  Because that is exactly what you're doing. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4462.08s)]
*  And I was like, bro, you just said what I felt. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4464.08s)]
*  And I stopped the meet and greets immediately. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4469.08s)]
*  And I have profoundly less money and I do have to pay the loan back on this watch. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4470.08s)]
*  But I do feel better as a person. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4473.08s)]
*  Yeah, I've never did those. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4475.08s)]
*  You never did meet and greets. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4477.08s)]
*  I used to meet and greets for free. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4478.08s)]
*  Yeah, I would hang around and take pictures of people. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4479.08s)]
*  I would do it at the Chicago theater where it was hours long lines. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4482.08s)]
*  I'd take photos of everybody. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4485.08s)]
*  I did it. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4486.08s)]
*  But it was a different thing. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4487.08s)]
*  It was free. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4488.08s)]
*  I didn't. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4489.08s)]
*  I would never do that. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4490.08s)]
*  I just I get that people see it as an extra source of revenue and I get that they see it as something that people are willing to pay because they want to meet you and they want to take a photo with you. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4491.08s)]
*  I get it all. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4500.08s)]
*  And I'm not judging anyone. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4501.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4502.08s)]
*  It's just what it made me feel weird. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4503.08s)]
*  No, it's one of the most shameful parts of the last of my career so far. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4504.08s)]
*  I didn't know any. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4509.08s)]
*  I did. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4510.08s)]
*  OK. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4511.08s)]
*  But now you know. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4512.08s)]
*  I got out of it quick and I hated myself. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4513.08s)]
*  People talk you into it too. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4515.08s)]
*  They'll talk you into it. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4516.08s)]
*  They'll talk you into it because it's money for them. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4517.08s)]
*  And you know, it's one of those things is there's an industry around it. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4519.08s)]
*  And I'm not judging anybody who does it. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4522.08s)]
*  No, me either. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4524.08s)]
*  I just I can't think about stuff like that. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4525.08s)]
*  But I felt like now, you know, I feel like the you know, doing the show, having, you know, the fan I believe there, I give them the best show I can. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4527.08s)]
*  So that's hopefully worth the money for them. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4536.08s)]
*  But not doing the meet and greet, even though it's less money, I don't care. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4538.08s)]
*  I'm so much happier. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4541.08s)]
*  I've made a decision because I don't want to miss time in my daughter's lives. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4543.08s)]
*  I just don't. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4547.08s)]
*  I got my kids. I'm my stepson. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4548.08s)]
*  I just don't want to be away from them. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4549.08s)]
*  And I understand. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4551.08s)]
*  Well, that's going to come with sacrifice. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4552.08s)]
*  And you may not ever be the best comedian of all time or do arenas. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4554.08s)]
*  All that's fine to me. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4558.08s)]
*  Not missing their jujitsu and getting to do homework with them is worth it for me at this point in my life. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4560.08s)]
*  And so I'm OK with it. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4566.08s)]
*  I just think worry about being the best you can on stage when you're up there. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4567.08s)]
*  You don't have to go out as much as some people do. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4572.08s)]
*  They get crazy. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4575.08s)]
*  And one of the beautiful things about living in New York City or one of the beautiful things about being in L.A. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4576.08s)]
*  You can always get on stage. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4580.08s)]
*  Always. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4581.08s)]
*  It's like there's a thing that some guys do where they, you know, you'll go on tour for like a month. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4582.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4591.08s)]
*  You know, and I get it. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4592.08s)]
*  It's a lot of money and a lot of my friends do it. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4593.08s)]
*  And it's great because it's like you just get it over with. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4596.08s)]
*  You go crazy and then you can relax and you made a ton of money. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4599.08s)]
*  And you also saw fans all over the world. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4602.08s)]
*  I don't I can't do it. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4605.08s)]
*  I do weekends. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4607.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4608.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4609.08s)]
*  Go out on the weekends and weekdays. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4610.08s)]
*  I work out in town. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4611.08s)]
*  I've always done it in L.A. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4612.08s)]
*  I'd go a couple of weekends a month. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4614.08s)]
*  So as successful as you've been, you feel like you were still there almost at every good moment for your kid. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4616.08s)]
*  You didn't miss as much. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4624.08s)]
*  I didn't miss nearly as much as I would have missed if I was doing the road all the time. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4625.08s)]
*  I go out of my way to do little things that my kids do, events and hang with them. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4629.08s)]
*  And we have family time. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4635.08s)]
*  We try to watch movies together and do stuff together and play together. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4636.08s)]
*  Like you got to like have fun together. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4640.08s)]
*  And I think if you're gone for like long stretches, I don't like being gone for three days. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4642.08s)]
*  Like three days fucks with my feelings. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4649.08s)]
*  Three days is like it makes me uncomfortable. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4651.08s)]
*  I love like doing stuff. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4654.08s)]
*  Like I love going on vacations. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4656.08s)]
*  Vacations are some of my favorite times because then we're with each other 24-7. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4658.08s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4661.08s)]
*  And we get to fuck around and go swimming and do cool shit and go fishing and have fun. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4662.08s)]
*  You know, it's like you don't realize how quick it goes by, man. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4668.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4671.08s)]
*  It goes by so fast. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4672.08s)]
*  I because I had Louis C.K. on my Chrissy K. House podcast. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4673.08s)]
*  I know you've had him a bunch of times. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4677.08s)]
*  I know you guys are friends. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4678.08s)]
*  I was talking to Louis and I was talking about how my daughters and my stepson are young right now. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4680.08s)]
*  You know, we've got 12, 7 and 1. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4687.08s)]
*  They're kids. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4688.08s)]
*  So I said, I don't want to go on the road so much right now because I want to be with them. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4689.08s)]
*  And even though it's costing me money and my agent will be like, you got to add shows here. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4694.08s)]
*  I'm like, no, I want to go home with my family. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4697.08s)]
*  I want to be with my family. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4698.08s)]
*  I know it's going to cost me money, but not everything in my life is money. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4700.08s)]
*  I want to spend time with my kids. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4703.08s)]
*  And so I said, but I figure, you know, when they get older, you know, [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4705.08s)]
*  and they're going to not want to hang out with me. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4709.08s)]
*  Right. So I said, that's when I'll, God willing, go on the world tour or whatever. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4710.08s)]
*  And he said, you have that all wrong, man. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4714.08s)]
*  And I was like, what do you mean? [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4716.08s)]
*  He said, take it from me. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4717.08s)]
*  Louis saying this. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4718.08s)]
*  He's like, you know, I have daughters who are older in their 20s. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4719.08s)]
*  He said, what happens is, is when they get older, yes, they want to they want to go out and be with their friends and do that. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4722.08s)]
*  And they don't need dad or mom as much as they did when they were your children's age. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4730.08s)]
*  He said, but your time with them is actually so much more precious because they have less time to give you. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4733.08s)]
*  So if you're on the world tour and they only had that hour a week to give you and you weren't home for it. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4738.08s)]
*  Well, now you've missed the opportunity for that hour with your kids because they were willing to give you a time. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4744.08s)]
*  But you weren't there because you want. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4750.08s)]
*  So he said, so the way you're thinking now, believe it or not, even if this means you won't, you know, get to the world famous arena tour. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4752.08s)]
*  He was like, you're doing the right thing. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4761.08s)]
*  He said, Louis said he was like, you know, I was on stage at the TV. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4763.08s)]
*  Louis was on stage at the TV garden. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4766.08s)]
*  You know, he's like doing this arena tour and amazing and all that. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4767.08s)]
*  And he was like, I could tell you, I just want to you should only go around that arena tour, go around that top shelf one time. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4770.08s)]
*  He was like, because you realize, like, that you can't live up there. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4777.08s)]
*  You got to hit a cruising altitude. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4781.08s)]
*  You got he was like, you got to you got to be Chrissy cruising altitude. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4783.08s)]
*  You got to think, where am I going to live for the majority of my career? [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4786.08s)]
*  And he was like, that's where you want to be. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4790.08s)]
*  Go up there. If you get an opportunity, go up there, taste the air. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4792.08s)]
*  There's not a lot of oxygen up there. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4795.08s)]
*  Use the Mount Everest example. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4796.08s)]
*  You don't have a lot of oxygen at the top. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4798.08s)]
*  You can't stay up there for long. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4799.08s)]
*  But he said, if you get there, take the opportunity, but do it once and then cruising altitude and have time with your family. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4801.08s)]
*  He was like, you know, there's so many moments in my daughter's lives where I was making all this money and doing this, but I miss this or I miss that. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4807.08s)]
*  And, you know, you have it in your mind right now. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4813.08s)]
*  Like, I'm not going to miss things in my kids' lives. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4816.08s)]
*  So but it is hard because I'm like, man, I could, you know, be adding shows and making more money and be more successful. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4819.08s)]
*  But I'm like, but I want to be in my kids jujitsu. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4825.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? You also don't want to lose your mind. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4828.08s)]
*  Yeah, I know a lot of guys lose their minds. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4830.08s)]
*  Yeah, they, you know, they go too hard. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4832.08s)]
*  They're they're out too long. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4835.08s)]
*  They're gone too too much. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4837.08s)]
*  Well, how do you feel? I mean, you're like, you know, it's got to be pressure to be where you are. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4839.08s)]
*  I mean, I would be amazing to get to a level like you. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4842.08s)]
*  But you got, you know, you can do whatever you want to do wherever you go. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4845.08s)]
*  You can sell as many tickets as humanly possible and all that. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4848.08s)]
*  And you have all the opportunity in the world. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4851.08s)]
*  But do you ever feel like, you know, like, is there ever feel like you wake up and you're like, damn, I don't want to be this Joe Rogan. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4853.08s)]
*  Do you ever feel that way? [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4859.08s)]
*  Well, there's nothing you do about that. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4860.08s)]
*  Right. You just became who you became. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4862.08s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think about like what I can control. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4863.08s)]
*  Right. Specifically, I concentrate on not doing that. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4866.08s)]
*  Right. Then I just concentrate on what I can control. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4869.08s)]
*  And when you're time with your family, with your, you know, your family, you just say, I'm going to be with them when I'm with them and I'm going to give them 100 percent. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4872.08s)]
*  And then when I go on the road, it's it's for them kind of thing. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4879.08s)]
*  Do you think like that? [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4882.08s)]
*  No, when I'm going on the road, I'm doing it because that's what I do for a living. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4883.08s)]
*  I mean, obviously it benefits everybody. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4886.08s)]
*  But it's like this is what I do. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4889.08s)]
*  This is what I do. And if I can bring them with me, that's great, too. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4891.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4893.08s)]
*  You know, and, you know, they could find fun stuff to do if I'm on Saturday in the evening when I'm doing my show. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4894.08s)]
*  I don't want my fucking kids to see my horrible act. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4901.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4903.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4904.08s)]
*  But other than that, man, it's like doing fun stuff together is it's like you bomb these important memories when you get that iPhone photos of like all the different fun times you've had together and plays it with music for you. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4905.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4919.08s)]
*  It's not even just the ones on photos. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4920.08s)]
*  They just spark up the ones in your brain. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4922.08s)]
*  But it's, you know, it's not for everybody. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4924.08s)]
*  I don't think that, you know, I'm not one of those dads. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4927.08s)]
*  It's like everybody should be a dad. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4929.08s)]
*  But it was profoundly good to me. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4931.08s)]
*  Like the whole process, it's been a long like it changes how you are as a human raising children and seeing them become adults and see them become these fascinating human beings. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4934.08s)]
*  It's wild. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4948.08s)]
*  Well, that's what strikes me about you is because I obviously, you know, we, you know, it's public, you know, financially very well and so successful. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4949.08s)]
*  But it doesn't feel like you're motivated by money. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4956.08s)]
*  It feels like I'd be like, I bet you not that I know anything about it, but I bet you Joe Rogan, his kid, you spoke to Rogan's kids. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4959.08s)]
*  They think he's a great dad because I'm like, oh, he's there. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4964.08s)]
*  So I'm like, how do I get, you know, the financial success and also be there at the same time? [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4966.08s)]
*  But I'm hearing from you. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4972.08s)]
*  Maybe it's just, you know, well, it's, you know, I would be a liar if I said that it happened. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4973.08s)]
*  Oh, thank you, sir. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4977.08s)]
*  Instantaneously. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4978.08s)]
*  You have to learn. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4979.08s)]
*  No, it's a learning process. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4980.08s)]
*  And I think once you have enough money, you have to realize you have enough money. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4982.08s)]
*  And I think a lot of people don't. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4987.08s)]
*  I think a lot of people, once they they get a ton of money, they want more and more and more like, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn't say I'm good. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4989.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4996.08s)]
*  Like Bill Gates doesn't say I'm good. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4997.08s)]
*  We're good. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4998.08s)]
*  We've got billions. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=4999.08s)]
*  Let's fucking party. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5000.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5001.08s)]
*  But I think quality of life is the most important thing. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5002.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5004.08s)]
*  And I think if you're really thinking about the numbers more than you think about the other stuff, you're taking away bandwidth that your mind utilizes to get better at stuff. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5005.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5013.08s)]
*  You're taking bandwidth that could be for, you know, hanging out with my wife or hanging out with my friends. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5014.08s)]
*  I want to just be in the, it's so corny to say, but I want to be in the moment. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5019.08s)]
*  I want to try to be in the moment as much as possible. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5025.08s)]
*  So the things that I have to think about the least are like if you're making good money and you're doing well, you don't have to think about that anymore. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5028.08s)]
*  So stop thinking about it. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5035.08s)]
*  Just concentrate on the things that got you there and trust this process. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5036.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5041.08s)]
*  Just do the best you can at podcast. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5042.08s)]
*  Do the best you can at comedy. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5044.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5046.08s)]
*  Do the best you can at the things you concentrate on. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5047.08s)]
*  Do the best you can. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5048.08s)]
*  That's all you can do. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5049.08s)]
*  That's all that matters. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5050.08s)]
*  But that's the only thing that really achieves any real measurable success. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5051.08s)]
*  Like if you're concentrating on wanting it to be this or wanting it to be that or one, it's like, I just don't think that's positive energy. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5056.08s)]
*  I don't think that's like well-used energy. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5066.08s)]
*  I think your energy should be spent doing the things you do. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5068.08s)]
*  That's why I could do so many different things, because all the things that I do, I enjoy doing. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5071.08s)]
*  There's no faking. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5075.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5076.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5077.08s)]
*  Like it's not like, you know, you're not counting down the minutes. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5078.08s)]
*  Like you'll do a three, four hour podcast, four days a week, because you genuinely love doing this. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5079.08s)]
*  Yes. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5083.08s)]
*  And that's the same for the UFC. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5084.08s)]
*  Like I'm so looking forward to the UFC this weekend. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5085.08s)]
*  Like I'm just going to get to hang out with Daniel Cormier and John Anik. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5087.08s)]
*  There's six hours of fights. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5091.08s)]
*  I fucking love it. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5092.08s)]
*  It's not lost on you what your life's become. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5093.08s)]
*  Yes. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5095.08s)]
*  It's not at all. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5096.08s)]
*  Which is beautiful. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5097.08s)]
*  I am very, very, very, very, very thankful. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5098.08s)]
*  And the way that I show my thanks is by like I think about it all the time, but also I work. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5100.08s)]
*  But have you evolved to this? [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5106.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5108.08s)]
*  Or you've always been this? [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5109.08s)]
*  No, no, no, for sure. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5110.08s)]
*  Yeah, I've definitely evolved. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5111.08s)]
*  Okay. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5112.08s)]
*  And you know, having a family and having a bunch of people counting on you, it also gives you some extra motivation, extra discipline. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5113.08s)]
*  It definitely does. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5119.08s)]
*  But at a certain point in time, that doesn't become the motivation anymore when you're okay. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5120.08s)]
*  So then the motivation becomes just do your best at whatever you're doing. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5124.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5127.08s)]
*  That's my motivation. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5128.08s)]
*  My motivation is 100% just try to do my best at whether it's hosting a podcast or whether it's doing stand up or whether it's doing commentary or just being a friend or being a husband or being a father or just being a good neighbor. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5129.08s)]
*  I just try to do my best. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5142.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5143.08s)]
*  And I'm not always great at it. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5144.08s)]
*  I stumble at every single thing in that group, whether it's comedy or UFC or whatever the fuck it is. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5146.08s)]
*  It's complicated. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5153.08s)]
*  Life is complicated. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5155.08s)]
*  But I'm always just trying to do my best. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5156.08s)]
*  Well, I think that's what you said before is being in the present. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5158.08s)]
*  I feel like you listen to Saad Guru, you listen to Marcus Aurelius, you listen to anybody. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5161.08s)]
*  What they're all doing is just giving you different examples to just stay in the present. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5166.08s)]
*  That just feels like the Dalai Lama. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5171.08s)]
*  All they're ever saying is if you're in the present, you're good. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5173.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5176.08s)]
*  You can do that. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5177.08s)]
*  You'll probably be better off. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5178.08s)]
*  And it's not that easy to do. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5180.08s)]
*  No, it's very difficult. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5181.08s)]
*  It's pretty complicated because like the things that we've talked about today, like the anxiety and the fact that like I think a really positive move for you is getting off social media. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5182.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5191.08s)]
*  I recommend that to so many people. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5192.08s)]
*  And it's not that there's bad people that you interact with. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5193.08s)]
*  It's just people interact in a bad way in these things. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5196.08s)]
*  And I would have done it too. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5199.08s)]
*  I'm not a hypocrite. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5201.08s)]
*  If I was 15, 16 years old and had a Twitter account, oh my God, the mean shit that I would say to Christa Stefano or to me or to fucking Bobby Lee or anybody. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5202.08s)]
*  It's natural. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5211.08s)]
*  You know what I've noticed too with getting off social media just from now being at a pretty significant time, seven months, is what I've learned is one of my favorite quotes, Teddy Roosevelt, is comparison is the thief of joy. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5213.08s)]
*  I love that quote. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5225.08s)]
*  That's a great quote. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5226.08s)]
*  Great one. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5227.08s)]
*  I love that. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5228.08s)]
*  And what I realized is with being off social media, you know, I think the reason why I've been able to stick to this diet plan, exercise plan and keep myself relatively healthy is because I'm not on social media scrolling comparing myself to somebody who's jacked and ripped, you know, somebody who's going above and beyond. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5229.08s)]
*  And then what happens is subconsciously I would be, you know, five pounds into a weight loss program and see somebody being jacked and ripped and be like, well, I'm not doing what they're doing so fuck it. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5246.08s)]
*  And then whatever. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5256.08s)]
*  Where now I don't compare my, I only compare myself to me from yesterday. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5257.08s)]
*  I live my life in one day increments because the biggest thing that I notice about being off social media is not about comparing myself to others, which is very negative, is comparing myself to me. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5262.08s)]
*  I would compare myself to me all the time and that would make me depressed. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5273.08s)]
*  I would look at myself from six months ago, some perfectly crafted picture that I forgot about and say, you look good back then, Chris. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5276.08s)]
*  What the fuck are you doing then? [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5283.08s)]
*  And then you look yourself in the mirror now and say, I don't like this, Chris, because you're comparing yourself to a real, an unrealistic version of you, a perfectly crafted version of you. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5284.08s)]
*  And I didn't realize that. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5293.08s)]
*  And then the other big thing is people talk a lot about the negative comments that we see as, you know, whatever on social media. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5294.08s)]
*  It was the positive comments that were throwing off my mental, my mental state to the positive comments were also putting me into an overdrive that was not helping me at all. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5301.08s)]
*  So now I don't see anybody. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5310.08s)]
*  The only person I ever see that says anything positively or negatively negative to me exists in the real realm, exists in the physical realm, not in the social media realm. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5312.08s)]
*  And that has profoundly changed my brain chemistry. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5322.08s)]
*  Dude, me and my girl, Jasmine, you know, we were having some rough times the last time I came in here. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5325.08s)]
*  We were thinking maybe we're going to go back to co-parenting, whatever. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5330.08s)]
*  We are as close as we've ever been in the last eight years because now I would also didn't even realize like I would see, you know, innocently, subconsciously, a woman on social media that was a, you know, a fitness instructor and a medical doctor. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5332.08s)]
*  And I would be like, start to subconsciously think, well, wouldn't my life be easier with her? [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5345.08s)]
*  Wouldn't it? [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5349.08s)]
*  What a blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5350.08s)]
*  And then and then it would cause a fight subconsciously with Jasmine and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5351.08s)]
*  And then I got off of that. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5356.08s)]
*  I didn't see anything at all ever except what I noticed was how beautiful a person Jasmine was, how lucky I was to have Jasmine. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5357.08s)]
*  That's what I noticed being off social media because I blocked everything else. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5365.08s)]
*  And I said, what I have my whole everything I've dreamt of in life to have a beautiful woman, a beautiful partner, a beautiful mother of my children is right here. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5369.08s)]
*  She's not on Instagram in fucking Sweden. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5378.08s)]
*  You know, she's right here. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5382.08s)]
*  And then I just noticed all those things that I my subconscious would cloud my mind with from the social media feed and the algorithm were gone. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5384.08s)]
*  And I was like, I see her for has beautifully perfect and imperfect. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5391.08s)]
*  She is as me. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5395.08s)]
*  And that's what I saw. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5396.08s)]
*  And I'm gay. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5397.08s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5398.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5399.08s)]
*  Have you seen what social media is doing to people is really profound because that kind of honesty that you just experience that you just expressed rather that's that's very hard for people to to recognize in themselves sometimes. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5400.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5414.08s)]
*  But I guarantee that's going on all over the world. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5415.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5418.08s)]
*  It's just it's influence. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5419.08s)]
*  It's it does a thing to the mind that confuses the mind with real life. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5420.08s)]
*  And it does it in this weird way. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5425.08s)]
*  And now it's doing it with like filters. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5427.08s)]
*  I've seen these new filters on. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5429.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5430.08s)]
*  It's horrifying. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5431.08s)]
*  Somebody sent me Bridget Phetasy sent me. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5432.08s)]
*  This is Bridget Phetasy. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5434.08s)]
*  I love her to death. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5435.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5436.08s)]
*  It was her or it might have been Megan Murphy. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5437.08s)]
*  One of them sent this thing. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5440.08s)]
*  There's a new tick tock filter and it puts makeup on women like so you could be completely unmade up. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5441.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5449.08s)]
*  And it'll be perfect makeup. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5450.08s)]
*  And it used to be like if you had the filter on and you moved your hand in front of your mouth that the lips would go over your hand. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5451.08s)]
*  It would be cartoonish hilarious because it's so obvious that they're using these filters. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5458.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5463.08s)]
*  Now it doesn't happen anymore. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5464.08s)]
*  Now everything seamless and the AI is better or the computer algorithm or whatever. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5465.08s)]
*  Whatever it is that's doing this is better. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5471.08s)]
*  And if you see it, it's wild. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5473.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5476.08s)]
*  Do you know where it is? [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5477.08s)]
*  I can send it to you. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5478.08s)]
*  You got it. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5479.08s)]
*  Well, do you worry about this woman is doing this and so crazy like look at this. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5480.08s)]
*  Oh look at the play it play it a little bit so we can hear it. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5484.08s)]
*  You used to do that with an old filter and you would see the lashes on your hand like it would glitch. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5487.08s)]
*  But look how perfect this is. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5493.08s)]
*  I'm wearing no makeup right now. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5495.08s)]
*  This is all a filter and it's just scary because there's a lot of girls out there that don't realize when someone's got a filter on and they're chasing perfection because that's what they think everybody looks like. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5497.08s)]
*  And this is not what people look like. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5509.08s)]
*  So this is very scary. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5511.08s)]
*  I think that lady, what she just showed is the future. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5517.08s)]
*  You're not going to be able to tell at all who I mean face swaps are going to be indistinguishable. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5522.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5528.08s)]
*  Deep fakes. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5529.08s)]
*  Deep fakes indistinguishable. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5530.08s)]
*  They've already done podcasts with me and Steve Jobs. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5531.08s)]
*  I never met Steve Jobs. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5533.08s)]
*  I saw that. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5534.08s)]
*  It's just they put it into a computer and the computer will say anything you want it to. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5535.08s)]
*  It sounded as real as can be. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5539.08s)]
*  And now you can have his face moving to those words. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5540.08s)]
*  You have my face moving to those words. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5544.08s)]
*  Is this a lady doing this as well? [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5546.08s)]
*  Again? [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5547.08s)]
*  So that's what she really looks like. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5548.08s)]
*  So she did both, which is good of her. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5550.08s)]
*  Because that's what I was curious. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5555.08s)]
*  What is the difference? [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5557.08s)]
*  But that's a difference it could be. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5558.08s)]
*  They could do that with makeup. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5561.08s)]
*  But as a parent, is it just staying in the present and saying I hope my children don't kind of fall victim to this? [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5563.08s)]
*  How do you reconcile that? [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5571.08s)]
*  They're in a new world. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5572.08s)]
*  There's two schools of thought. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5574.08s)]
*  There's a school of thought that you should keep your children away from social media. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5577.08s)]
*  And there's a school of thought is everyone has social media. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5580.08s)]
*  Everyone has social media. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5583.08s)]
*  You have it. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5584.08s)]
*  The kids have it. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5585.08s)]
*  Maybe let them have experience in it and maybe they're going to be okay. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5586.08s)]
*  We always want to think that while these kids have this new rock and roll music, what are they going to ruin childhood? [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5591.08s)]
*  And then we thought that in the 60s with drugs. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5598.08s)]
*  And we thought that throughout with disco, people always think kids are going to ruin their fucking lives. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5601.08s)]
*  This is the most profound change that human beings have ever experienced in terms of their access to information, the way they get educated, [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5606.08s)]
*  the way they're experiencing different things that are happening all over the world all at once. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5614.08s)]
*  It's a profound shift in human consciousness. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5619.08s)]
*  And these kids are going to be so much more advanced than us in terms of their ability to understand things. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5623.08s)]
*  OK. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5628.08s)]
*  It's a different road, but it's a different road like the road between people that invented agriculture and the road with people at hunter gatherer tribes worrying about invading ones. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5629.08s)]
*  Got it. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5638.08s)]
*  Like it's new roads. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5639.08s)]
*  And this is the new road. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5640.08s)]
*  The new road is Internet communication. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5641.08s)]
*  The new road is social media. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5644.08s)]
*  The new road is interconnectedness. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5646.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5648.08s)]
*  This bizarre interconnectedness that humans have to navigate now. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5649.08s)]
*  But but but so what you're saying is the interconnectedness we're experiencing now at this level is the same level that somebody in the 1600s was experiencing interconnectedness because for the first time they left their village and got on a road and went to another village or the printing press. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5653.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5668.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5669.08s)]
*  I mean, there's been a bunch of these things that have happened and probably look. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5670.08s)]
*  Look, I mean, my view of history is shaped by the work of Graham Hancock and Randall Carlson and John Anthony West and all these people to examine these ancient cultures. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5674.08s)]
*  And I have a real strong feeling that they're right and that there's a lot of evidence to support it about this younger drives impact theory and that human civilization like, you know, Egypt and the pyramids. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5685.08s)]
*  And before that had achieved this incredible level of sophistication in a way that we don't understand. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5697.08s)]
*  I think we're relearning how to navigate life. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5703.08s)]
*  That's what I think is happening right now. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5707.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5709.08s)]
*  And I think it comes in these big waves. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5710.08s)]
*  And I think it's one of the reasons why these waves. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5712.08s)]
*  It's like we when technology is at the place it's at now where you have like chat GPT that's writing like you could write a whole Christa Stefano set. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5715.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5725.08s)]
*  You could write a set like, you know, talk about your mom. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5726.08s)]
*  Talk about, you know, the fucking homeless guy that beat a guy up and gave him ice cream. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5728.08s)]
*  They could write a whole routine for you. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5733.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5735.08s)]
*  We're in a weird time. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5736.08s)]
*  I know. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5737.08s)]
*  You can't just deny that it exists and protect your children from it. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5738.08s)]
*  I think you have to communicate with your children. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5741.08s)]
*  But I think your children also exist in this new world. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5743.08s)]
*  And I think we can't. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5746.08s)]
*  It's a difficult one to navigate. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5748.08s)]
*  And I think one of the decisions that you've made as you've navigated and you realize, hey, this is not good for me. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5750.08s)]
*  Like, I don't like this, so I'm going to get off of that. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5755.08s)]
*  A lot of people make similar decisions when they stop drinking or when they stop gambling. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5758.08s)]
*  They go, you know what? [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5762.08s)]
*  This is not good for me. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5763.08s)]
*  I got to get off of that. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5764.08s)]
*  But I feel like you have to let people make those decisions for themselves and you have to give them the ability to say like confidently that some people have navigated this water. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5765.08s)]
*  Some people figure out how to use it. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5776.08s)]
*  Some people don't get involved in disputes online and they don't get involved in all the negative aspects of it and reading all the positive stuff too, which can also fuck with your head. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5779.08s)]
*  Yeah, because it throws your equilibrium off. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5787.08s)]
*  My father was a gambling addict, went through Gambler's Anonymous and has come out on the other side. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5789.08s)]
*  Great. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5794.08s)]
*  But I went through a very tough point in my life where me and Jasmine, my girlfriend, mother of my children, we broke up. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5795.08s)]
*  We were co-parenting. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5805.08s)]
*  She was dating someone else. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5806.08s)]
*  It was all very hard for me. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5807.08s)]
*  And I was like living this life where I was like, maybe it's better this way and I'll go out and date all these women and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5808.08s)]
*  And my father one day, you know, we're hanging out. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5815.08s)]
*  I didn't even think I was doing anything wrong. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5817.08s)]
*  And he sees me and he's like, you know, could see I'm a little like disheveled and no drugs, no alcohol, not like that. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5819.08s)]
*  And he was like, you got an addiction problem, Chris. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5825.08s)]
*  I said, what are you talking about? [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5828.08s)]
*  He goes, I was a gambling addict. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5829.08s)]
*  You look like you look like you've been gambling all night. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5831.08s)]
*  But I think what you've been doing is chasing women all night. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5835.08s)]
*  I think you've been either having sex with girls or you've been messaging women and you've been doing that. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5838.08s)]
*  He was like, just I'm your father. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5843.08s)]
*  Am I right? [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5844.08s)]
*  I said, yeah. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5845.08s)]
*  I mean, you know, talking to a couple of girls, but whatever. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5846.08s)]
*  I'm single. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5849.08s)]
*  You know, she's with somebody else. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5850.08s)]
*  I'm single. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5851.08s)]
*  He was like, let me tell you something, Chrissy. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5852.08s)]
*  He was like, here's what I know about gambling and here's what I know about life. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5854.08s)]
*  And here's what I know about what's going to happen to you. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5858.08s)]
*  You can beat the house 99 times out of 100. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5860.08s)]
*  You beat them clean. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5863.08s)]
*  Ninety nine out of 100. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5864.08s)]
*  The one time the house wins, which is inevitably going to happen, negates the other 99. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5866.08s)]
*  You're hooking up and you're meeting all these strangers, bring all these strangers into your life. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5871.08s)]
*  Ninety nine out of 100. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5876.08s)]
*  Great. No problem. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5878.08s)]
*  All good. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5879.08s)]
*  The one stranger that has it in her head that she needs to ruin your life for whatever reason, has a baby, says you did this, says you did that, [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5880.08s)]
*  is going to negate all the rest. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5889.08s)]
*  You need to limit your probability and stop bringing all these women into your life. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5891.08s)]
*  And you need to figure out how to go be with a mother, your children, because that is what is the most important thing. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5897.08s)]
*  That's fantastic fatherly advice. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5903.08s)]
*  If everybody had a father like that, and he just laid it into me, that's such a great way of laying it down to. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5905.08s)]
*  Yeah. Such a great way of laying it down. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5911.08s)]
*  These patterns that human beings fall into when it comes to addiction, they're so fascinating. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5914.08s)]
*  They're so fascinating. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5920.08s)]
*  I was never around gamblers until I was in my early 20s. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5922.08s)]
*  I was around these guys that would bet on poker. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5925.08s)]
*  They would bet on fucking raindrops coming down off a windowsill. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5927.08s)]
*  Yeah. My father was a pretty profound gambler, ruined his marriage with my mother, all that stuff. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5931.08s)]
*  And what my father said, he would tell me. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5938.08s)]
*  He was like, when I was growing up, a teenager, he was like, do not gamble. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5940.08s)]
*  I don't want you to even know what a vig is. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5943.08s)]
*  I don't want you to know what a point cover is. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5945.08s)]
*  I don't want you to know what a spread is. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5947.08s)]
*  I don't want you to know that stuff. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5948.08s)]
*  Because he's like, I have it in my brain and I'm terrified I'd pass it to you. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5950.08s)]
*  So still to this day, as a 38-year-old guy, with all the draft kings and all that, I don't even know. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5953.08s)]
*  If he said, what's the over under, it's a foreign language to me because my father was explicit. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5960.08s)]
*  He was intentional. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5966.08s)]
*  Do not do that. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5967.08s)]
*  That's a very wise choice. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5969.08s)]
*  And I listened to him and I don't have that gambling thing now. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5970.08s)]
*  I do think I had that addict thing in my brain. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5972.08s)]
*  I think he had it too. I think people have it. I think it makes them good at things. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5975.08s)]
*  That's what I think. I think it's a dangerous mindset. It's like a thing in your mind. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5979.08s)]
*  And it could lead to something like gambling or it could lead to something like getting addicted to being the best at guitar. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5984.08s)]
*  I think it's real similar. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5990.08s)]
*  So with his advice always to me, my whole childhood, he would always say two things. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5992.08s)]
*  He said, if you're going to be an addict, make sure you're addicted to something positive. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5996.08s)]
*  So I hopefully with comedy. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=5999.08s)]
*  And then the second thing he would say, always to me, he said, Chrissy, he would always call me Chrissy. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6000.08s)]
*  He would always like make me a girl. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6004.08s)]
*  And he would say, you'll love life. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6006.08s)]
*  You're going to love life when you finally understand that life isn't fair. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6010.08s)]
*  When you know life isn't fair, you'll love life. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6014.08s)]
*  And I took that and I feel like I did understand that in my 20s where like, you know, in the movies, the villain always gets caught. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6017.08s)]
*  And that's not real life. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6025.08s)]
*  So when somebody gets something that you know personally isn't a good person or the media is saying, you know, this person just keeps rising through the ranks because I understand life isn't fair. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6027.08s)]
*  And that was instilled in me through my father. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6036.08s)]
*  You know, and I think that my dad having this kind of life, like he would always say to me, you know, something dark. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6039.08s)]
*  He would always say to me, he would say, Chris, you know, he would say, what do you want to be in life? [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6046.08s)]
*  And I would say, you know, as a kid, I want to be a doctor. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6051.08s)]
*  I want to be an astronaut. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6055.08s)]
*  You know, I want to be in the NBA. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6056.08s)]
*  All the things children would say. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6057.08s)]
*  He'd say, oh, that's great. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6058.08s)]
*  He said, here's what I want you to be in life. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6060.08s)]
*  I want you to be the exact opposite of me. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6062.08s)]
*  I want you to not be me. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6065.08s)]
*  And then you'll be OK. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6068.08s)]
*  So you see what dad does. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6069.08s)]
*  You see how dad lives. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6071.08s)]
*  Be the opposite of me. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6072.08s)]
*  And you'll be a OK. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6073.08s)]
*  That's what I want you to strive for. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6075.08s)]
*  And as a kid, I would laugh at that, whatever. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6077.08s)]
*  But now I see because he was like, I gambled. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6079.08s)]
*  I lost your mother. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6082.08s)]
*  I lost all these things in my life. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6083.08s)]
*  And I don't want you to have that. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6085.08s)]
*  And even like with this Radio City stuff, because it is like it's almost like emotional Radio City for a New York guy and, you know, sold all these tickets so quick. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6086.08s)]
*  And then my sunglasses, you're wearing sunglasses. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6094.08s)]
*  I got the watch on, you know, I've fucking hiding my homosexuality. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6096.08s)]
*  It's all these things. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6100.08s)]
*  And and and my dad and then my agent now recently a couple of days ago was like, oh, maybe we'll put a second show on sale. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6101.08s)]
*  Maybe we'll do the Hulu theater. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6108.08s)]
*  Maybe we'll do a second at Radio City. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6109.08s)]
*  You're selling quick, baby. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6110.08s)]
*  And I'm like, OK. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6111.08s)]
*  And then and then I'm talking to my dad and I'm like, oh, the agent said maybe we'll put a second show on sale. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6113.08s)]
*  So why do you want to do that? [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6119.08s)]
*  I was like, you know, he said it's selling quick. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6121.08s)]
*  And I was like and he was like, yeah, but the goal was one. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6123.08s)]
*  The goal was you sold out one. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6128.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6129.08s)]
*  And the goal was you're going to spend time with your family. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6130.08s)]
*  Me as your father, your daughters will be done by nine o'clock. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6132.08s)]
*  We'll go have dinner. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6136.08s)]
*  It'll be beautiful. It'll just be celebrating Radio City. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6137.08s)]
*  He was like, why do you want to add more pressure to yourself? [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6139.08s)]
*  I was like, oh, I don't know. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6142.08s)]
*  I thought maybe the money, the agent said this. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6143.08s)]
*  The agent said that he said you're losing the whole point of this. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6146.08s)]
*  He said the simple fact you put Radio City on sale was the win. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6148.08s)]
*  That was the win. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6152.08s)]
*  He goes, you're doing what I would do. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6153.08s)]
*  You're doubling up. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6155.08s)]
*  You're double or nothing. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6156.08s)]
*  Double or nothing. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6157.08s)]
*  Double or nothing. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6158.08s)]
*  Stop it. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6159.08s)]
*  He said, do one. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6160.08s)]
*  I was like, yeah, but dad, if I can sell out a second show, then maybe the Madison Square Garden people see me. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6161.08s)]
*  And then I hit my real goal. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6165.08s)]
*  MSG. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6166.08s)]
*  He goes, MSG will happen when it happens. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6167.08s)]
*  Stop doubling up. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6169.08s)]
*  Stop doubling or nothing. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6170.08s)]
*  That's what got me in the worst shape of my life. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6171.08s)]
*  Your dad's right. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6174.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6175.08s)]
*  He was like, get one and move on. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6176.08s)]
*  Get one. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6178.08s)]
*  Get one. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6179.08s)]
*  And I was like, wow. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6180.08s)]
*  What's just fascinating that he sees those patterns in you. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6181.08s)]
*  Like it is like a genetic propensity for gambling or a psychology thing. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6184.08s)]
*  But also it's like growing up with him. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6189.08s)]
*  I'm sure like it transferred to you. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6191.08s)]
*  Whether he recognized it or not, you're probably aware of his gambling. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6193.08s)]
*  Well, when me, when me and I got to piss again, I'm so sorry. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6196.08s)]
*  I drank so much water. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6199.08s)]
*  It's so frustrating. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6201.08s)]
*  This is like an hour and a half in. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6202.08s)]
*  It's like two hours in an hour and a half. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6204.08s)]
*  I'll piss. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6207.08s)]
*  I'll piss too. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6209.08s)]
*  All right. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6210.08s)]
*  And we're back. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6211.08s)]
*  Hello. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6212.08s)]
*  Hello. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6213.08s)]
*  By the way, let me tell you something. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6214.08s)]
*  If people want to know, I mean, Joe Rogan has a at least 60 second long piss healthy prostate. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6216.08s)]
*  You are. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6222.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6223.08s)]
*  You got you don't have BPH. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6224.08s)]
*  You I doubt you have benign. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6225.08s)]
*  I doubt you have the prostate hyperplasia. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6227.08s)]
*  I don't think you have BPH. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6230.08s)]
*  I think there's no way that that prostate is healthy. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6231.08s)]
*  You're drinking pomegranate juice or I don't know what it is, but you got a healthy prostate and a very, very strong flow. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6234.08s)]
*  Guys judge guys on flows. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6240.08s)]
*  You're next to a dude and he's trickling. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6242.08s)]
*  You're like, what's going on over there, man? [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6244.08s)]
*  Like Tony Hinchcliffe's working out. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6245.08s)]
*  I don't think he has a stronger flow as you know, even though he's looking jacked. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6247.08s)]
*  You never know. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6250.08s)]
*  He might one of those silent heavy hog dudes. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6251.08s)]
*  Here's what I know about Tony Hinchcliffe. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6254.08s)]
*  He's just got that face. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6255.08s)]
*  Jack looking good. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6256.08s)]
*  He would be a if he was lived in if he had power in medieval times, he'd be a nightmare nightmare beheading people. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6257.08s)]
*  One hundred percent. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6266.08s)]
*  You know, taking their organs out, eating their small intestine as a sausage and peppers. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6267.08s)]
*  Tony Hinchcliffe nightmare in medieval times. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6271.08s)]
*  But thank God we got him here in Austin. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6274.08s)]
*  We got him subdued. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6276.08s)]
*  He can't hurt anybody. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6277.08s)]
*  If I was a prince and I had a brother who was also a prince who was just like murdering people and I was trying to stop him. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6279.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6285.08s)]
*  He would look exactly like Tony. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6286.08s)]
*  Tony Hinchcliffe. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6287.08s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6288.08s)]

*  Tell me that is not that is not medieval bloodthirsty prince face. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6291.08s)]
*  I mean, that's Joffrey's cousin. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6296.08s)]
*  That's Joffrey's cousin. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6298.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6299.08s)]
*  Tony. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6300.08s)]
*  He's from the kingdom to the north. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6301.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6303.08s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6304.08s)]

*  Dude, Tony. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6306.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6307.08s)]
*  He would hurt you. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6308.08s)]
*  He would hurt you in a bad way. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6309.08s)]
*  Tony would be the greatest joker of all time. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6310.08s)]
*  Yes. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6312.08s)]
*  He'd be right up there with Heath Ledger. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6313.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6314.08s)]
*  Just let him be himself. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6315.08s)]
*  Tony just a sinister fit. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6318.08s)]
*  Love fucking Tony. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6319.08s)]
*  How many jokers have there been? [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6320.08s)]
*  There have been so many jokers. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6321.08s)]
*  You know, I won't even say that Heath Ledger is the best because I think Joaquin Phoenix is the best. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6322.08s)]
*  He's the creepiest. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6328.08s)]
*  He's the most like profound. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6329.08s)]
*  The one that I buy the most is the Joaquin Phoenix joker. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6331.08s)]
*  Like Jack Nicholson one was fun. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6335.08s)]
*  There's a lot of fun ones. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6337.08s)]
*  But the Joaquin Phoenix one is like, holy shit. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6338.08s)]
*  Timmy D had an opportunity to work with Joaquin in a movie. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6341.08s)]
*  And he was saying Joaquin, not only is he a great guy, but he said the acting is so amazing that it's almost like throws you off because you're like this guy is like born to do this. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6346.08s)]
*  And they said he was he stays in character the whole time, which is tough. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6358.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6362.08s)]
*  I'm not an actor by trade, but I'm like, I don't know if I could say in the character the whole time, but these guys do it. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6363.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's a thing that like the actors are split on that, I guess. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6368.08s)]
*  I mean, obviously I'm not an actor, but in that camp, there's like people that think that's the dude from succession. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6374.08s)]
*  Who's the old guy? [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6380.08s)]
*  Brian Cox. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6381.08s)]
*  Amazing. Yeah. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6382.08s)]
*  He doesn't like the fact that the other gentleman was named Jeremy Irons. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6383.08s)]
*  Right. No, Kendall, Jeremy Strong, Kendall from success. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6388.08s)]
*  He's really good. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6392.08s)]
*  That guy's a phenomenal actor. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6394.08s)]
*  Give him his proper's. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6395.08s)]
*  Jeremy Strong. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6396.08s)]
*  Jeremy Strong. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6397.08s)]
*  He's very method, I guess. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6398.08s)]
*  And Brian Cox gets upset. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6400.08s)]
*  He's not that guy. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6401.08s)]
*  Fuck is this whole shit. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6402.08s)]
*  He's one of those guys. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6403.08s)]
*  Well, I saw that act like Brian Cox. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6404.08s)]
*  I saw an interview with him. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6406.08s)]
*  He said the reason why he's so good at playing Logan Roy is because he in real life hates the idea of that guy. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6407.08s)]
*  He hates the 1% corporate so-and-so douchebag. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6414.08s)]
*  He hates that guy. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6418.08s)]
*  He plays that guy at a different level. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6419.08s)]
*  I wonder if there's because you when you I mean, I know you did the sitcom acting in News Radio, but did you ever do any like dramatic acting? [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6421.08s)]
*  You always did comedy acting. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6428.08s)]
*  Yeah, I did. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6429.08s)]
*  I mean, I did a couple of Kevin James movies. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6430.08s)]
*  I really didn't do that much. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6432.08s)]
*  I mean, I really enjoyed doing the sitcoms, but it was so it's kind of similar to stand up, right? [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6433.08s)]
*  Because you're trying to hit a punch line. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6438.08s)]
*  You try to get a laugh. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6441.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6442.08s)]
*  You're having it, but it's interactive. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6443.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6444.08s)]
*  And if you're doing it with talented people like I fortunately was with News Radio, it's a lot of fun. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6445.08s)]
*  But it's not as fun as stand up. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6449.08s)]
*  It's just stand up. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6451.08s)]
*  Stand up is the best. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6452.08s)]
*  And stand up is the art form. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6453.08s)]
*  I think that is the separator, the equalizer where it's like, you know, you can definitely sell a lot of tickets if you go big on TikTok and you go. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6454.08s)]
*  But you can do it one time around. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6462.08s)]
*  If they see the one show and then you come back and you're doing the same horse shit or whatever. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6464.08s)]
*  And there's no shortcut with stand up. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6468.08s)]
*  It takes time. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6470.08s)]
*  Like I'm 13 years in now and I feel like I'm finally just about maybe finding my voice in the way that I'm like Colin Quinn is my mentor. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6471.08s)]
*  Thirty five years. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6481.08s)]
*  He started comedy in 1984 or 38 years. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6482.08s)]
*  I'm sorry. I was born in 1984 and he says, man, it's going to take 15, maybe 20 years for you to find your voice. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6485.08s)]
*  But that's all part of it. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6490.08s)]
*  It's all part of this journey. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6491.08s)]
*  It's all part of, you know, he's always preaching to me like stay in the moment. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6493.08s)]
*  Right down the the the little tidbits of a bit. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6497.08s)]
*  And and and don't worry. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6500.08s)]
*  He was and you know, he talks about like the he was the one who told me he's like, you know, the algorithm. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6502.08s)]
*  Right. He was like, you kids are so obsessed with the algorithm. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6506.08s)]
*  Calls me a kid. I'm 38. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6508.08s)]
*  But so he is. He's like, he's like, you're obsessed with the algorithm because I've seen the algorithm 30 times in 30 years. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6509.08s)]
*  He goes, there's always something there. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6516.08s)]
*  First it was the sitcom. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6518.08s)]
*  Then it was the reality show. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6519.08s)]
*  Then it was clips. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6520.08s)]
*  There's always something that you guys are that the young generation is chasing. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6521.08s)]
*  He goes, all I want you to do is get a clean, solid hour of material. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6525.08s)]
*  And that's all I want you to focus on. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6530.08s)]
*  And that's what I try to do. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6532.08s)]
*  That's solid advice. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6533.08s)]
*  That's what I try to do. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6534.08s)]
*  Because he's like, there's always a distraction. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6535.08s)]
*  Yeah. Don't worry about that. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6536.08s)]
*  Keep your mind on the process. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6537.08s)]
*  He told me. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6538.08s)]
*  And also, like, what do you enjoy? [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6539.08s)]
*  Do you enjoy comedy? [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6540.08s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6542.08s)]
*  That's why we all got into it. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6543.08s)]
*  Yeah. We enjoy it. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6544.08s)]
*  The adrenaline rush that I got from playing basketball, Division 3, but still I played. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6545.08s)]
*  And then I transferred that adrenaline rush to physical therapy. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6549.08s)]
*  I was a physical therapist and I love that. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6553.08s)]
*  Now I've transferred that adrenaline rush to comedy. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6555.08s)]
*  So that's all it is for me. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6557.08s)]
*  It's like, I love doing it because I feel like it's cathartic. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6559.08s)]
*  I'm getting my point of view out. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6563.08s)]
*  Whether you like it or not, I'm getting it out. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6565.08s)]
*  It's cathartic. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6567.08s)]
*  And that's what matters at the end of the day. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6568.08s)]
*  And that's why my dad's advice, I think, is profound. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6570.08s)]
*  When he's like, hey, with the Radio City shit, he's like, the goal was just the putting one on sale is just this is a byproduct of what you've set out to do. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6572.08s)]
*  So don't worry about the money. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6580.08s)]
*  He was like, the money always came second. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6581.08s)]
*  Oprah said that once. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6583.08s)]
*  I remember I had mono, I had mononucleosis and my mom had gout when I was in eighth grade. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6584.08s)]
*  And I heard Oprah say, we're watching the Oprah Winfrey Show, and Oprah said the money always comes second. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6588.08s)]
*  In passion, the money always comes second. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6593.08s)]
*  And that's always been in my head. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6595.08s)]
*  Like, you'll get the money. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6596.08s)]
*  Like, even if I just did a whole, you know, did three theaters in a row before coming here, I haven't gotten one check yet from either one of them. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6598.08s)]
*  Like, the money will come. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6605.08s)]
*  You know, I'll remember in a month from now if I haven't gotten paid yet. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6606.08s)]
*  The money will come. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6609.08s)]
*  I did it because I loved it. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6610.08s)]
*  I loved performing and making fun of Fresno and, you know, kind of shitting on San Jose and getting involved in the Sacramento politics. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6611.08s)]
*  I loved it. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6619.08s)]
*  I felt like I was I felt like I was playing D3 ball again. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6620.08s)]
*  That's how you feel. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6623.08s)]
*  And so I don't worry about the money. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6624.08s)]
*  I mean, I need the money because I need another watch. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6626.08s)]
*  But I, you know, you know, you I do feel like the money with comedy has been I love doing physical therapy. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6627.08s)]
*  I was a pediatric physical therapist. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6635.08s)]
*  I was making fifty three thousand dollars a year. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6637.08s)]
*  But I loved it. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6639.08s)]
*  You know, I had helping kids. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6640.08s)]
*  You get a kid from a wheelchair who couldn't walk to not that I'm, you know, fucking miracle worker here. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6641.08s)]
*  He's not going to dunk a basketball. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6647.08s)]
*  But the fact that he could stand up out of his wheelchair and get his leg up or her leg up to take one step and watch the parents, you know, be so it's so gratifying. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6648.08s)]
*  And you have the gratuity towards it where I was like and I kind of transfer that a bit into comedy where it's like I just I'm happy to if one person says, hey, you made my day better. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6658.08s)]
*  You know, you know, you're great. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6667.08s)]
*  Even if it was 99 percent of people being like, you suck. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6668.08s)]
*  Fuck you. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6671.08s)]
*  I don't care. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6672.08s)]
*  Well, it makes when I watch someone kill makes my day better. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6673.08s)]
*  You know, we were we did the creek rather the Vulcan last week with Shane and Ari and Norman and the protective guys. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6676.08s)]

*  It's like just watching those guys kill. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6687.08s)]
*  It's like it's so it's so enjoyable. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6689.08s)]
*  It's such a fun thing to do. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6692.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6694.08s)]
*  I still love watching people kill. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6695.08s)]
*  It's so much fun. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6697.08s)]
*  Great. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6698.08s)]
*  It's so much fun. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6699.08s)]
*  I got to take one of those guys out to get and protect your parks. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6700.08s)]
*  I go for Shane. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6703.08s)]
*  A lot of people want to them out just you can get in. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6704.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6707.08s)]
*  You can't just get in like that. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6708.08s)]
*  I got to take people out. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6709.08s)]
*  I got in. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6710.08s)]
*  But what if I had a fucking what if I like that's not really how it works. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6711.08s)]
*  It would be a different thing. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6714.08s)]
*  Protect our parks is us. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6715.08s)]
*  You got to come up with another thing. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6717.08s)]
*  What about what about protect our rivers? [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=6718.08s)]

*  I think it makes it feel like this thing is okay. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7003.08s)]
*  I think it takes away the pain of the victim because when they made, I mean they played [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7007.08s)]
*  the cool fucking 80s music. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7012.08s)]

*  So violence is okay. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7078.84s)]
*  It's puritanical. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7079.84s)]
*  But isn't that crazy that violence is okay but the word fuck is not okay. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7080.84s)]
*  Like you could show a dead body with a bullet hole in it. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7084.84s)]
*  In its head. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7087.84s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7088.84s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7089.84s)]
*  It's very strange. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7090.84s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7091.84s)]
*  It doesn't make sense at all. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7092.84s)]
*  What do you think, what's the cause of it? [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7094.84s)]
*  Is it something that we agreed to at an early stage of society and we just hold on to it [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7096.84s)]
*  as being like some sort of a measure of civility? [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7101.84s)]
*  Like don't say fuck, don't say shit, don't say cunt, don't say horrible words on television. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7104.84s)]
*  But you can show literal dead bodies. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7110.84s)]
*  You can show people, people's lives being ended. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7113.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7116.84s)]
*  I think personally, you know the term I use before puritanical, I think it's from the, [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7117.84s)]
*  I genuinely think it's a kind of great great great great great grandfather of the puritans [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7121.84s)]
*  who would say you are not following in the footsteps of God in our definition of it. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7127.84s)]
*  So we are going to burn you at the stake in front of the village. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7132.84s)]
*  Right? [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7135.84s)]
*  I mean that's what they were doing with the Salem witch trials. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7136.84s)]
*  They were saying you're not following in the footsteps of God. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7138.84s)]
*  We are Christians. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7141.84s)]
*  So we're going to burn your flesh in front of children. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7142.84s)]
*  But we're Christians. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7145.84s)]
*  You're not. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7146.84s)]
*  So we get to burn you. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7147.84s)]
*  So that's what I think is happening in a different way today. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7148.84s)]
*  Not as on the nose as what it was in the Salem witch trials. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7151.84s)]
*  But it is happening. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7154.84s)]
*  Do you know the story of the Salem witch trials? [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7155.84s)]
*  Do you know what actually happened? [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7157.84s)]
*  Well I think that there was some now scientists today think there was a possible root being [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7158.84s)]
*  grown that was giving people psychedelic kind of mental health issues that were. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7163.84s)]
*  It's a fungus. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7167.84s)]
*  It's a fungus. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7168.84s)]
*  A fungus. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7169.84s)]
*  Because of a late frost. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7170.84s)]
*  They had a late frost. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7171.84s)]
*  But is that proven proven proven? [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7172.84s)]
*  No I don't think so. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7173.84s)]
*  I think it's just supposed and it makes sense to people. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7174.84s)]
*  Sure I'll take another one. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7178.84s)]
*  I think they think it makes sense to people because of the way people were behaving was [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7179.84s)]
*  so crazy. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7183.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7184.84s)]
*  They think it's probably a combination of a bunch of things. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7185.84s)]
*  People are I think predisposed to hysteria in certain situations. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7188.84s)]
*  In like case famine, war, disease. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7193.84s)]
*  But there's also this thing with ergot which is a real thing. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7197.84s)]
*  I believe it. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7200.84s)]
*  I think that this stuff does grow and they have found evidence of ergot from that time [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7201.84s)]
*  period. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7206.84s)]
*  Like I think they're pretty sure that it would have been on the wheat. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7207.84s)]
*  How much evidence do they have? [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7212.84s)]
*  We should probably find out. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7213.84s)]
*  How much evidence do they have that ergot played a role in the Salem witch trials? [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7214.84s)]
*  I think that they think it's pretty profound. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7219.84s)]
*  Yeah it happened to a town in France too. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7223.84s)]
*  There's a town in France that they had ergot poisoning. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7225.84s)]
*  I think people died as well. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7229.84s)]
*  Did you see the train derailment in Ohio? [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7230.84s)]
*  The people there are saying that they're sounding like Mickey Mouse now from Disney World. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7232.84s)]
*  They have like high pitched voices. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7236.84s)]
*  Oh Jesus Christ. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7237.84s)]
*  Yeah Google, well whatever you want but train derailment Ohio. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7238.84s)]
*  Mickey Mouse voice it's like a big thing. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7241.84s)]
*  Oh my God that's horrible. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7244.84s)]
*  But I think that something like that train derailment bullshit thing is this. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7245.84s)]
*  What's going on? [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7249.84s)]
*  Let's hear this. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7250.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah East Palestine. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7251.84s)]
*  You quickly learn that you don't have a voice in this. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7253.84s)]
*  They don't care. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7257.84s)]
*  They're going to hush it up. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7258.84s)]
*  They're going to push it through. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7259.84s)]
*  The mayor of East Palestine yesterday at the Trump circus that came to town. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7260.84s)]
*  I'm a Trump voter right? [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7265.84s)]
*  I live in East Palestine. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7267.84s)]
*  We didn't need that right now. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7269.84s)]
*  But the mayor at this press conference says, hey media go away. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7270.84s)]

*  because he's been non-existent. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7283.84s)]
*  I know he gets a lot of positive press. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7285.84s)]

*  What are they telling you? [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7411.84s)]
*  Look at the Donald Trump shirt. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7413.84s)]
*  I most definitely have the chemicals in me. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7415.84s)]
*  Oh Jesus Christ. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7418.84s)]
*  You believe that? [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7420.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7422.84s)]
*  Who knows right? [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7423.84s)]
*  If someone was trolling imagine being that guy and faking this. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7424.84s)]
*  That doesn't make sense. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7428.84s)]
*  But if that is the case and there's more than one person that's having that happen to them [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7429.84s)]
*  and it's just happened recently, what's the long term effects on these people to live [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7434.84s)]
*  near this stuff? [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7438.84s)]
*  Is it a short term thing? [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7439.84s)]
*  Is it a long term thing? [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7441.84s)]
*  Is it just because of the initial fire? [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7442.84s)]
*  Or is that like a poison waste ground now? [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7444.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7446.84s)]
*  That's what I don't know. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7447.84s)]
*  Fuck dude. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7448.84s)]
*  That's what people don't know. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7449.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7450.84s)]
*  But that's why. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7451.84s)]
*  They're trying to blame it on deregulation too. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7452.84s)]
*  But what I read was that that was incorrect because the deregulation didn't actually get [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7455.84s)]
*  applied and that the railroad that these chemicals were traveling on was not for these kind of [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7464.84s)]
*  hazardous materials. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7473.84s)]
*  Okay. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7474.84s)]
*  And so they weren't supposed to be doing it anyway. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7475.84s)]
*  And what happened was one of the bearings of one of the wheels apparently fucked up. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7477.84s)]
*  Got it. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7481.84s)]
*  So it had nothing to do with any of those things. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7482.84s)]
*  But then they say that, again I don't know, but then they say that there's multiple other [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7484.84s)]
*  train derailments with chemicals and multiple other chemical facilities in Florida and this [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7488.84s)]
*  state. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7493.84s)]
*  Yes. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7494.84s)]
*  So it just feels like I don't know what's happening. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7495.84s)]
*  Well we don't know about this stuff until something like this happens. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7497.84s)]
*  Right. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7501.84s)]
*  Like this is happening probably all the time. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7502.84s)]
*  There's probably constantly transporting hazardous waste across the country all the time. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7504.84s)]
*  Well see, that's what I thought because my boys on my group chat would be like, this [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7508.84s)]
*  is a conspiracy. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7511.84s)]
*  They're trying to distract us because so and so is happening. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7512.84s)]
*  I'm like maybe or is it that now that this is a hot story the media is reporting on every [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7515.84s)]
*  train derailment that happens more, that's been happening all this time but we don't [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7521.84s)]
*  report on it. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7525.84s)]
*  But now they're reporting on it so we think it's a bigger problem than it actually is. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7526.84s)]
*  Right. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7529.84s)]
*  That could be it. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7530.84s)]
*  That's what I think about. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7531.84s)]
*  It could be it because as soon as you do concentrate on these things then you start looking for [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7532.84s)]
*  patterns. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7536.84s)]
*  Right. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7537.84s)]
*  And there's been a bunch of them that are very, okay look at this. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7538.84s)]
*  A thousand derailments occur each year. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7540.84s)]
*  There you go. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7543.84s)]
*  Now it's the new climate change. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7544.84s)]
*  I've seen this. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7545.84s)]
*  It's a new thing to freak out about. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7546.84s)]
*  That's it. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7547.84s)]
*  The derailments! [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7548.84s)]
*  There's a thousand this year. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7549.84s)]
*  There's a thousand every year. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7550.84s)]
*  That's as high as 1800. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7551.84s)]
*  There you go. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7552.84s)]
*  As high as 1800. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7553.84s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7554.84s)]
*  That's like 36 a day. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7555.84s)]
*  Look at this. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7556.84s)]
*  There were 1049 such instances in 2022 out of roughly 535 million miles traveled. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7557.84s)]
*  Wow. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7564.84s)]
*  But it's just when it happens with fucking toxic chemicals and they have to light them [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7565.84s)]
*  on fire. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7568.84s)]
*  And so this chemist was saying that he didn't think it was the wise idea to light them on [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7569.84s)]
*  fire but I don't know what the options were. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7573.16s)]
*  Dude, I gotta be honest. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7575.4400000000005s)]
*  I just took my glasses off. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7576.72s)]
*  I'm seeing three of you. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7577.96s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7578.96s)]
*  How strong are those glasses? [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7579.96s)]
*  I'm drunk. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7580.96s)]
*  I'm high. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7581.96s)]
*  Well I've been lying to people and telling them they're prescription. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7582.96s)]
*  They're not prescription. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7583.96s)]
*  What are they then? [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7584.96s)]
*  They're just, I just, I made a choice to try to be cool. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7585.96s)]
*  Okay. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7588.76s)]
*  But I've been telling, lying to people all around the country saying they're prescription [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7589.76s)]
*  that I legally need to wear these. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7593.24s)]
*  But I don't. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7595.92s)]
*  I tried to take a, I made a bold choice. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7597.0s)]
*  And right here on this podcast, maybe because I'm high, maybe because I'm drunk, but I'm [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7599.96s)]
*  saying to you in real time that I'm regretting who I am. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7604.36s)]

*  Don't take the watch off. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7608.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm not giving it up. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7610.28s)]
*  I'm putting it here. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7611.84s)]
*  This is not who I want to be. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7613.18s)]
*  Wow. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7615.4s)]
*  In real time. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7616.4s)]
*  In real time. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7617.4s)]
*  I'm not who I want to be. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7618.4s)]
*  And Jasmine, I love you. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7619.84s)]
*  You know, mother of my children. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7620.84s)]
*  But I don't, you know, I'm not 100% not gay. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7622.28s)]
*  I just won't, I won't. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7625.36s)]
*  I won't. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7627.92s)]
*  I can't commit to that. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7628.92s)]
*  What's the number you think? [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7629.92s)]
*  I would say I'm 75% straight. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7631.6s)]

*  You want to take me to the club. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7644.68s)]
*  You want to take me to a dinner. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7645.68s)]
*  You know, if you're drunk or whatever and you say, you know what, Chris, I'm fucking, [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7647.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm feeling it too. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7650.68s)]

*  I'm not saying you want to do that, but what I'm saying is, Jamie, and the same applies [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7655.72s)]
*  to you. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7658.240000000001s)]

*  If you'd like me to leave the room for you to discuss this with Jamie, but I'm not very [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7660.68s)]
*  interested. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7664.6s)]
*  I don't think Jamie's gay, but I don't think Jamie is not gay, is what I'll tell you. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7665.6s)]
*  I don't think you're gay, but I don't think Jamie is not gay. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7669.320000000001s)]

*  But I think Jamie, if given a nudge, can be persuaded to have some experiences that he [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7678.48s)]
*  didn't understand that he wanted to have. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7686.36s)]
*  That's what I'll say. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7688.0s)]
*  Am I wrong about that, Jamie? [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7689.0s)]
*  What kind of nudge are you talking about? [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7690.0s)]
*  Yeah, what's a nudge? [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7691.36s)]
*  I'm talking about, I'm talking about a hip thrust. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=7692.36s)]

*  That's very interesting. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8344.199999999999s)]
*  I think the guys that have that feeling, they all wind up being really good because I think [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8345.199999999999s)]
*  that that feeling comes from this place where you really do care and you really want to [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8349.359999999999s)]
*  do the best that you can with your act and you really want to be on it. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8353.36s)]
*  But you know, you're nervous. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8357.28s)]
*  And so you think like, oh, my God, like, there's no way I could be this person. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8359.04s)]
*  I've tricked people. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8362.12s)]
*  You know, I think it all the time when I get my name called when I was about to go on stage. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8363.6s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8368.640000000001s)]
*  I used to think it all the time. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8369.640000000001s)]
*  This is wild. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8370.640000000001s)]
*  All the time. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8371.640000000001s)]
*  I used to like in the back of the comedy store, like they'd say, ladies and gentlemen, please [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8372.640000000001s)]
*  welcome Joe Rogan. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8375.640000000001s)]
*  I'd be like, what are they clapping for? [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8376.640000000001s)]
*  This is crazy. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8378.24s)]
*  This can't be real. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8379.24s)]
*  Yeah, I feel that way too. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8380.24s)]
*  I find myself doing my shows, you know, and having my prepared act and writing the material [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8382.32s)]
*  or whatever and, you know, giving it 100 percent at the end of my set, one of my last bit, [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8388.68s)]
*  which, you know, sometimes we'll get a big laugh or whatever. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8395.76s)]
*  I'll find myself being like, guys, I'm sorry. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8398.52s)]
*  I hope you enjoyed your money. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8400.199999999999s)]
*  I hope you got money. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8401.96s)]
*  I'm sorry it wasn't what you expected it to be and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8402.96s)]
*  But then they'll like be clapping, sometimes standing up and clapping. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8406.6s)]
*  And I'm like saying I'm sorry to them. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8409.64s)]
*  And I always wondered like, what is this? [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8412.08s)]
*  But you just kind of said something profound to me where you were like, it's everybody [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8414.44s)]
*  has that. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8418.48s)]
*  I thought it was just me. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8419.48s)]
*  Instead of apologizing, just tell them you appreciate them. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8420.48s)]
*  Just tell them you appreciate them. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8423.52s)]
*  Maybe that's what I should do. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8424.52s)]
*  And then you'll have like an honest little like engagement with those people and you'll [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8425.52s)]
*  enjoy it. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8431.64s)]
*  It's like it's a natural propensity to lean towards the negative and think about the negative [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8432.64s)]
*  and be fearful that all this success that you have now is going to go away. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8437.7s)]
*  That's what people worry about. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8441.9s)]
*  That's what I feel. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8442.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8443.9s)]
*  They're worried that they're a fraud. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8444.9s)]
*  And you know, you see when one of the things that's really hard to watch is when you see [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8445.9s)]
*  someone who's doing really well and then all of a sudden they're not doing well anymore. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8449.94s)]
*  And then they start their career starts to dwindle and then they start to get panicky [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8453.359999999999s)]
*  and people get to a weird place, especially guys who get like older and it's not happening [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8457.619999999999s)]
*  for them. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8463.699999999999s)]
*  It's like yikes. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8464.699999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8465.699999999999s)]
*  The fear that you have is the fear of the rising. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8466.699999999999s)]
*  That's the best fear because it's like the fear of the unknown. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8470.24s)]
*  Where is this going to lead to? [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8473.1s)]
*  You have so much potential. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8474.66s)]
*  You're 38 years old. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8475.66s)]
*  You know, you're just getting into your groove with stand up. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8477.58s)]
*  You think I look jacked? [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8480.14s)]
*  You're good. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8481.14s)]
*  Everything's good, dude. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8482.14s)]
*  Everything's good. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8483.14s)]
*  It's natural. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8484.3s)]
*  All these thoughts are natural for anybody successful at anything. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8485.3s)]
*  And you could ask that athletes will tell you that. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8487.94s)]
*  Like everybody has imposter syndrome. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8490.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8492.58s)]
*  The imposter syndrome is a real and I don't think it's even in entertainment. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8493.58s)]
*  I think it's in anybody who's listening to this right now. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8496.66s)]
*  Whatever career or field, life. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8500.160000000002s)]
*  You have this imposter syndrome where whatever success you may get, you don't think is worthy. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8501.720000000001s)]
*  But you got to kind of think that you got to change your mindset and say, no, I am worthy [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8506.960000000001s)]
*  of it. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8511.28s)]
*  Well, a lot of times the thing that drove people to try to be big at show business was [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8512.28s)]
*  a lack of attention. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8516.52s)]
*  You know, I know that's definitely what happened to me when I was a child. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8518.320000000002s)]
*  I know that happens to a lot of people. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8521.480000000001s)]
*  That thing that drives you to that is like a dominant force. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8523.66s)]
*  But at some point in time, in order to be like what I would say a healthy artist is, [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8529.54s)]
*  you have to recognize what that is and then transfer the energy that you spent trying [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8534.86s)]
*  to get attention to now try to get really good at this thing you do. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8540.380000000001s)]
*  Just try to get really good at stand up. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8544.78s)]
*  Try to get really good at the bits. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8545.9s)]
*  Try to kill. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8546.9s)]
*  Try to do your best at that and don't think about the attention anymore. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8547.9s)]
*  The attention is like a thing that gets you to it and you try so hard to be good at stand [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8550.98s)]
*  up because you want the positive feedback. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8554.96s)]
*  You want that attention from the audience. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8557.0s)]
*  But then once you figure out how to get that, there becomes like a transitioning period [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8559.119999999999s)]
*  where you blossom out of that. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8564.119999999999s)]
*  You can. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8567.359999999999s)]
*  Not everybody does. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8568.8s)]
*  Some people choose to just concentrate on what got them to the dance. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8569.96s)]
*  But I think that the best way to think about it and be mentally healthy is not think about [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8573.439999999999s)]
*  yourself and attention and just think about the bits. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8577.88s)]
*  Just think about doing your best at stand up and then once you do that, the attention [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8580.92s)]
*  you get will be like a balanced attention. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8585.14s)]
*  Do you think you as Joe Rogan right now is the best stand up that you've been in your [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8587.26s)]
*  life right now? [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8591.66s)]
*  Yes. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8592.66s)]
*  Yeah, I think right now is the best I've ever been because I'm doing it a lot and I'm smarter. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8593.66s)]
*  I'm older. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8597.34s)]
*  I've been doing it longer. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8598.34s)]
*  We're still doing stand up the way we always did stand up. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8601.34s)]
*  There's no subjects that are off limits. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8604.66s)]
*  That's horseshit. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8606.58s)]
*  This is stupid. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8607.58s)]
*  The way we're living in now where people are terrified of doing stand up, it's so strange. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8608.64s)]
*  Canceling people for jokes and fucking around with the way reality is being perceived. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8613.36s)]
*  Well, like, yeah. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8619.8s)]
*  You, Louis, Bill Burr, Dave Chappelle, Chris Rock, these guys, Mount Rushmore of guys from [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8621.68s)]

*  You kind of have that, not bravado, but like kind of like no fear kind of comedy, right? [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8633.28s)]
*  You have to just do comedy for what you think would be funny, what you would like to hear [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8639.820000000002s)]
*  and like how, like the kind of shit that you enjoy. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8644.94s)]

*  I enjoy hilarious people that have this fucking perceptions of life that could boil down [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8655.78s)]
*  to the most outrageous shit on stage that makes me cry laughing. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8661.18s)]
*  That's why I love Joey Diaz. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8664.36s)]
*  That's what I like and that's what I do and that's what I'm always going to do. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8666.36s)]
*  You could like it or you don't like it, but that's what the art form is and don't go to [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8669.92s)]
*  a rap concert and complain that they're singing about money and guns. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8674.6s)]
*  Don't. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8679.08s)]
*  Don't go to a country western show and complain that's singing about the fucking ranch and [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8680.08s)]
*  sunset and being down by the river. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8684.56s)]
*  Don't go to a Taylor Swift song and complain she's not doing Led Zeppelin. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8687.24s)]
*  There's different vibes and what we do as standups is like it's not compatible with [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8691.86s)]
*  like woke social media culture. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8697.98s)]

*  Dude, the energy in here, the karmic energy in the Joe Rogan experience is very positive. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8952.279999999999s)]

*  It's very positive. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8958.759999999998s)]
*  That's what I want. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8959.759999999998s)]

*  One of your security guys was taking a shit. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8968.24s)]
*  It smelled positive. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8970.24s)]
*  Positively horrific. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8974.32s)]
*  I mean, no, yeah, he eats too much chicken skin, but positive, good guy. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8975.42s)]
*  I came into the studio, he shook my hand, said, hey Chris, how you doing? [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8983.9s)]
*  But I know he's positive, friendly, but I know if at any moment I got out of line, he'd [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8988.18s)]
*  break my neck. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8992.02s)]

*  You know what I mean? [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8995.34s)]
*  Does that make you feel comfortable? [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8996.34s)]
*  It does because I say, you know what? [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=8998.24s)]
*  He's positive, he's happy. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9000.3s)]
*  He has the capability to kill me with his bearings if he wanted to, but he's not that [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9002.78s)]
*  guy. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9006.560000000001s)]
*  That won't happen unless I push him into that happening. [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9008.24s)]
*  That makes me feel good. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9013.08s)]
*  He knows his strength, he knows his experience, but he's got control of it. [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9014.08s)]
*  It makes me feel comfortable. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9018.44s)]
*  Right. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9019.44s)]
*  It makes me feel comfortable. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9020.44s)]
*  Does it make you aspire to that, to be that kind of a person? [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9021.44s)]
*  It makes me aspire to that, but it also makes me simultaneously feel like I can't do that [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9023.44s)]
*  because I haven't dedicated my life to that and I'm too scared. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9027.84s)]
*  I still sleep to this night. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9031.460000000001s)]
*  If I'm sleeping in my hotel last night, I have the bathroom light on because if I'm [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9032.980000000001s)]

*  there. [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9040.58s)]

*  Did you see that the Mexican president, the president of Mexico took a photograph and [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9046.34s)]
*  posted, say, he caught a picture of a wood elf. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9050.54s)]

*  Like I said, great prostate. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9084.880000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9086.6s)]
*  We're out working out while we were peeing. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9087.6s)]
*  There's this YouTube guy I follow, AthleanX. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9089.18s)]
*  Yeah, I follow that too. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9092.220000000001s)]
*  Jeff. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9094.98s)]
*  And he does these ERs, they're called. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9095.98s)]
*  Maybe it's efficient reps, I think. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9101.18s)]
*  But basically, it's Arnold Schwarzenegger. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9103.140000000001s)]
*  He's a big fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9105.300000000001s)]
*  And I've been doing this and I've been seeing results. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9106.300000000001s)]
*  He thinks that the real hypertrophy, which I think is scientifically backed, the real [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9108.98s)]
*  hypertrophy comes at the last two to three reps of an exercise. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9114.58s)]
*  So say you're doing 12, 10, 8, 6. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9117.68s)]
*  The last 9, 10, 11, 12 is really where the hypertrophy comes. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9120.26s)]
*  So what he says is he does 20 efficient reps, 20 ERs. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9123.4s)]
*  So you get an ignition set. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9129.16s)]
*  So you take a weight that you'll fail at between 8 and 12. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9130.68s)]
*  Let's say you're doing bicep curls. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9134.0s)]
*  You'll take a 50-pound dumbbell and you'll fail at 10. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9135.06s)]
*  You're failing at 10. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9137.92s)]
*  Failing to him means you're breaking the form and the concentric exercise and you're using [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9139.54s)]
*  other muscles to kind of recruit the bicep to get that. [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9147.5s)]
*  That's failing. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9151.460000000001s)]
*  So he says what you do then, that's your ignition set. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9152.640000000001s)]
*  You take a 50-pound dumbbell, your ignition set is 10 reps. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9155.86s)]
*  Boom, good. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9159.460000000001s)]
*  You wait 15 seconds. [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9160.460000000001s)]
*  Now the real workout begins. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9161.86s)]
*  You have to get 20 efficient reps, 20 ERs in that time. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9164.26s)]
*  So after you do the 10, you're at failure. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9168.38s)]
*  Wait 15 seconds. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9171.359999999999s)]
*  Boom, one, two, maybe I can get four and then I got to take a break. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9172.359999999999s)]
*  Wait 15 seconds. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9175.759999999998s)]
*  Boom, boom, boom. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9176.759999999998s)]
*  Every 15 seconds up to 20, that's one set. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9177.96s)]
*  Then you move on to the brachioradialis, the brachialis, the front deltoid, whatever it [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9181.3s)]
*  may be. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9185.679999999998s)]
*  And you, you know, ATHLEANX says you stay in that one type of workout he has. [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9186.679999999998s)]
*  You stay in that efficient rep range. [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9190.58s)]
*  And I got to tell you, that's brought, I went from doing his efficient rep exercise, I went [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9193.08s)]
*  from being able to do about 10 pull-ups in a row to 20 in about a month and a half. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9199.52s)]
*  So with weight, right? [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9205.14s)]
*  So I think I've been following that, that ATHLEANX YouTube follow in my opinion, one [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9207.28s)]
*  of the best follows you can on, on, on, on YouTube. [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9212.56s)]
*  It's such an amazing time if you're interested in physical fitness because there's so much [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9215.76s)]
*  information now. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9219.6s)]
*  There's so many people that have like all these studies that have been done. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9220.6s)]
*  There's so many people that really understand like the science behind building cardiovascular [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9223.44s)]
*  fitness and hypertrophy and all that. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9228.24s)]
*  It's a really unique time, man, because there's guys like Andrew Huberman, or BioLane, like [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9230.800000000001s)]
*  Lane Norton, who are like legit like weightlifters and like jack dudes who are also scientists. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9236.4s)]
*  Like legit scientists who can give you the real information about what's effective, what's [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9243.960000000001s)]
*  not, different ways to do it. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9247.68s)]
*  Here's the thing that I think, this is more important than anything, is consistency, focus, [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9249.72s)]
*  and effort. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9254.48s)]
*  And everything works. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9255.48s)]
*  Like the people that want to do high reps, there's guys that get super jacked on calisthenics. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9257.279999999999s)]
*  I mean look at those bar stars guys. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9262.199999999999s)]
*  They have the most incredible physiques and it's all calisthenics. [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9264.199999999999s)]
*  The only thing that a lot of those guys are missing is the load bearing work for the legs. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9268.24s)]
*  Because I think like in order to get, like they're load bearing with their arms because [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9273.6s)]
*  they're doing all this body work, but load bearing with your legs, almost kind of like [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9277.320000000002s)]
*  to build your legs up to match your upper body, you almost kind of have to do, unless [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9280.92s)]
*  you do like one legged type squats and plyometrics and shit, I feel like you kind of have to [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9285.12s)]
*  lift something. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9290.52s)]
*  What about a little steroids? [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9291.52s)]
*  That'll help you. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9292.52s)]
*  What if I do one cycle? [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9293.52s)]

*  Look, this, this is my dad's face right here. [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9612.400000000001s)]
*  Probably wearing that same. [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9614.2s)]
*  And this is this. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9615.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9616.68s)]
*  This is me. [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9617.68s)]
*  This is me as Karen. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9618.68s)]
*  That was me looking and I, I tried to make believe like I didn't see it. [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9619.68s)]
*  And my dad goes in my face. [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9623.04s)]
*  He goes, that was your job. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9624.04s)]
*  And I said, what, what, what? [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9625.6s)]
*  I'm fucking, what do you mean? [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9626.84s)]
*  I'm a kid. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9628.2s)]
*  I'm 15 years old. [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9629.2s)]
*  I have psoriasis. [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9630.2s)]
*  You know, and, and, and, and, and then two hours later we're going over the Varizano [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9631.2s)]
*  Bridge, which connects, you know, Brooklyn to Staten Island. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9635.52s)]
*  My dad's taking me to my game. [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9638.44s)]
*  I was going to stay by him for the weekend. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9639.44s)]
*  And he, you know, cause my dad always had like, that's why I call my comedy tour the [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9641.44s)]
*  right intention, but the wrong move. [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9644.76s)]
*  My dad's intentions were protect your mother, but the move was executed, you know, poorly. [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9646.16s)]
*  But he says to me, he says, Chris, we're on in traffic on the Varizano Bridge. [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9651.880000000001s)]
*  He goes, Chris, he goes, you know what I did was wrong back there, right? [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9656.56s)]
*  You know, I shouldn't have done that. [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9660.32s)]
*  I was like, uh, yeah, I know. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9661.32s)]
*  Mom knows the police know, like everybody knows you shouldn't have done it. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9663.72s)]
*  He goes, exactly. [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9666.72s)]
*  He goes, but you know, you shouldn't, instead of playing video games in your room, like [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9667.72s)]
*  an asshole, you should be out there comforting your mother when she's going through a hardship. [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9672.92s)]
*  You made me do your job. [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9677.279999999999s)]
*  That's you're supposed to be a man. [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9678.92s)]
*  You're responsible for protecting your mother. [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9680.92s)]
*  What a mixed signal though. [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9682.64s)]
*  You shouldn't do that. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9683.92s)]
*  It's a bad thing to do, but it's your job. [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9684.92s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9687.08s)]
*  So that's where the kind of a dichotomy and my father comes in the right intention, but [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9688.08s)]
*  the wrong move, because I understand what he was saying. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9692.519999999999s)]
*  Protect your mom, which actually was instilled in me to protect my mom. [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9694.839999999998s)]
*  But after that, but the move was to beat somebody up, another grown man when I'm just a kid, [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9699.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9704.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9705.880000000001s)]
*  Your anxiety makes a lot of sense. [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9706.880000000001s)]
*  Very anxious. [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9708.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9709.400000000001s)]
*  It makes sense. [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9710.400000000001s)]
*  Like it's a conflict. [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9711.400000000001s)]
*  And if you deal with that conflict when you're a young growing person, you know, it's very [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9712.400000000001s)]
*  hard for your brain to figure out what's the right thing to do. [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9715.52s)]
*  You don't have like a clear, you can have bad examples. [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9718.12s)]
*  Like you could have a dad that's a horrible alcoholic. [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9722.400000000001s)]
*  I have friends that have that and they won't touch a drink because they saw what it does [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9724.92s)]
*  when someone becomes an alcoholic. [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9729.800000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9730.800000000001s)]
*  So you can learn from a bad example, but it seems like he was a great guy with like really [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9731.800000000001s)]
*  wise things to say, but also a bad example. [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9735.68s)]
*  That's what's crazy. [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9738.6s)]
*  Well, like he was a wise man who cared about you, but also a bad example and also a violent [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9739.6s)]
*  criminal. [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9745.080000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9746.080000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9747.080000000002s)]
*  So that's this kind of, like I said, dichotomy, this confusion about my father as a guy because [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9748.080000000002s)]
*  he was an amazing. [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9753.480000000001s)]
*  His advice is amazing. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9754.480000000001s)]
*  Oh, an amazing human being. [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9756.480000000001s)]
*  An amazing human being, but there was, you know, his methods of it was a little suspect, [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9758.36s)]
*  you know, where I was like, I got his point, you know, like, but he would, like I said, [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9765.240000000002s)]
*  his intentions on it were not always the best, but as, you know, but the byproduct of it [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9772.0s)]
*  was from that moment when I was 15, 16 years old, I never ever, ever, when my mom needed [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9778.04s)]
*  help, I was always there to help her. [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9783.800000000001s)]
*  I think we can't even imagine what it would have been like to grow up during your dad's [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9786.2s)]
*  time. [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9791.12s)]
*  I don't think we could imagine it. [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9792.12s)]
*  I really don't. [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9793.800000000001s)]
*  And I don't think he could have imagined growing up in his dad's time, coming over here during [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9794.800000000001s)]
*  the depression. [[02:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9798.68s)]
*  Right. [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9799.68s)]
*  You know, these people that came over here from Italy and from Ireland and England and [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9800.68s)]
*  wherever the fuck they came from. [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9804.28s)]
*  And during that time, like so many people came during the early 19th century, those [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9805.720000000001s)]
*  fucking people were hard ass people, man. [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9811.76s)]
*  Right. [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9814.560000000001s)]
*  They were hard ass people and it took a long time for us to get sensitive and we're only [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9815.92s)]
*  becoming like really sensitive to the way what happens to people when they grow up kind [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9819.72s)]
*  of over the last few generations. [[02:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9824.48s)]
*  And somebody like my dad, like I said, third, fourth grade education was able to foresee [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9826.6s)]
*  issues we're having in society now. [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9831.6s)]
*  Yes. [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9833.8s)]
*  12 years ago. [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9834.8s)]
*  Like for example, when Twitter came out, right, my dad said, I remember this was 2009, 2009, [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9835.8s)]
*  2010. [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9839.6s)]
*  I had just gotten into comedy, so it was 2010. [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9840.6s)]
*  And I got a Twitter and I was telling my dad and he was like, why'd you do that? [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9842.960000000001s)]
*  I was like, ah, you know, it's comedy, you know, like you got it. [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9846.64s)]
*  Everybody has a Twitter. [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9849.12s)]
*  Right. [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9850.12s)]
*  And he goes, let me tell you something about Twitter. [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9851.12s)]
*  He goes, this is the worst thing that's going to happen to society. [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9852.64s)]
*  I said, why? [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9855.04s)]
*  Again, third grade education. [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9856.04s)]
*  He said, cause let me tell you, he said, let me tell you something that I know a hundred [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9857.04s)]
*  percent. [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9860.48s)]
*  He goes, not everybody's supposed to be talking. [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9861.48s)]
*  You're not supposed to have everybody in society talking. [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9864.12s)]
*  Only a few people are supposed to talk. [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9867.2s)]
*  Most of us supposed to listen. [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9868.82s)]
*  When you got everybody talking, you're going to have a big problem. [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9869.88s)]
*  Trust me on that. [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9873.119999999999s)]
*  And now we're here at 2023. [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9874.119999999999s)]
*  Big problem. [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9876.92s)]
*  Everybody's got an opinion. [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9878.359999999999s)]
*  Exactly what I've said about this. [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9879.359999999999s)]
*  But it's just that people have to kind of earn their right to be heard. [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9881.279999999999s)]
*  And I know that sounds ridiculous because they are doing it through Twitter. [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9885.56s)]
*  It's just doing it in a real messy way. [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9888.64s)]
*  Right. [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9890.64s)]
*  Like everybody can be heard now. [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9891.64s)]
*  That just is what it is. [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9893.92s)]
*  And to say, I, I, it's true. [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9895.439999999999s)]
*  What he said is true. [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9897.679999999998s)]
*  Not everybody should talk, but everybody can talk. [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9898.960000000001s)]
*  So that's just the reality of the world we live in. [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9901.0s)]
*  You can't change that. [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9903.4s)]
*  That is, that is, unless there's a fucking supernova out there that blows out our electrical [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9904.8s)]
*  system and we don't have the internet for a decade. [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9910.28s)]
*  That's it. [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9913.6s)]
*  This is the world we live in now. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9914.6s)]
*  And I've accepted that at this point, but I'm just saying like, like a street smart [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9915.8s)]
*  guy, like, like I had a street smart guy who grew up today would still be street smart, [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9919.84s)]
*  just with this new reality that you live in. [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9924.12s)]
*  Right. [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9925.960000000001s)]
*  Like I grew up, like I said, with an Ivy league educated mother. [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9927.0s)]
*  So very book smart and a third grade educated father, but very street smart in and out of [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9929.919999999998s)]
*  the system, whatever. [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9933.48s)]
*  So I had this idea. [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9934.96s)]
*  I had this both sides of like my mom making me, you know, understand history and memorize [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9936.119999999999s)]
*  every state capital and understanding the economy, blah, blah, blah. [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9941.439999999999s)]
*  Where my dad coming at it from just life stuff. [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9944.119999999999s)]
*  Like when I, when I, you know, my, my oldest daughter is, is seven now and I've only been [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9946.439999999999s)]
*  with Jasmine, the mother of my children for eight years. [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9952.88s)]
*  So that means to the second or third date, we conceived our daughter and it was a big [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9955.34s)]
*  thing because I grew up very Catholic, especially, you know, I got Catholic tattoos all over [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9959.9s)]
*  my body. [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9963.42s)]
*  Like I'm fighting in the army of God, like I'm Chrissy crusades. [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9964.42s)]
*  And, and, and, and, and, and I grew up that way, just fucking Catholicism pounded down [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9966.94s)]
*  my throat by my mom. [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9971.34s)]
*  And so when I got a girl pregnant out of wedlock, this in my family and in my being is a huge, [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9973.94s)]
*  it's almost like I murdered someone. [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9981.58s)]
*  Like it is huge. [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9983.06s)]
*  Like I had to approach my mother now with these, this idea of I got a woman pregnant [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9984.42s)]
*  who I barely know out of wedlock. [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9989.619999999999s)]
*  The anxiety, the kind of fear to approach my mother with this was palpable. [[02:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=9993.3s)]
*  It was, it was inconceivable in my mind. [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10000.14s)]
*  And so, but my father being street smart and being understanding of the world knew how [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10003.019999999999s)]
*  to help me with this. [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10008.38s)]
*  I told my father first, cause my father doesn't judge me. [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10009.38s)]
*  He just like, is like, whatever you want to do, Chris, I support you and I'm going [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10012.18s)]
*  to help you get in and out of trouble as best I can. [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10015.94s)]
*  That's how my father feels. [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10018.78s)]
*  Like he's like, I'm my, my father lives his life for me, his son. [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10019.78s)]
*  He's like, I, my whole life changed. [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10024.42s)]
*  And that's how I feel about my children. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10026.5s)]
*  I live my life for my children. [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10027.86s)]
*  So cause that was how my dad was. [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10029.86s)]
*  So he said to me, when I told him, I confessed, I said, you know, I got, you know, I really [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10031.94s)]
*  like him in love with this woman. [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10036.42s)]
*  She's pregnant with my child. [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10038.58s)]
*  I, I, I'm going to, we're going to have this baby. [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10040.1s)]
*  I had already been a physical therapist. [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10042.5s)]
*  I'd already had a minimal success in comedy. [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10044.26s)]
*  I felt like I'm going to have this baby. [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10047.94s)]
*  I'm the one who decided to have unprotected sex. [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10050.5s)]
*  We're going to have this baby despite the odds against us. [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10052.66s)]
*  I'm going to do it. [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10055.140000000001s)]
*  My dad goes, listen, I support you a hundred percent. [[02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10056.140000000001s)]
*  Whatever you want. [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10059.300000000001s)]
*  Cause everybody else in my life, when I told them I had a guy, a girl pregnant, we're like, [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10060.300000000001s)]
*  oh my God, blah, blah, blah. [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10062.58s)]
*  Negative right away. [[02:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10065.380000000001s)]
*  My father's first words out of his mouth were congratulations. [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10066.380000000001s)]
*  That's what he said. [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10069.1s)]
*  Congratulations. [[02:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10070.1s)]
*  Cause he knew he was like, I'm just going to support you, whatever it is. [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10071.1s)]
*  That's a great combination between your mom and your dad. [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10073.54s)]
*  It really is. [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10076.42s)]
*  It's a great combination for like a balanced view of the world. [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10077.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10079.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10080.98s)]
*  And I agree with that because my mom at times we would, you know, butt heads, but she was [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10081.98s)]
*  keeping me in the straight line as much as she could where my dad was like, I'm just [[02:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10084.98s)]
*  supporting you in every way I can. [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10088.34s)]
*  So I did have a, again, privileged, beautiful, blessed life. [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10090.1s)]
*  I'm very aware of that. [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10092.62s)]
*  What my dad said to me was he was like, okay, here's the thing. [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10093.74s)]
*  He goes, here's what we got to do with your mother right now. [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10097.7s)]
*  He goes, she barely knows this woman. [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10100.1s)]
*  Okay. [[02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10101.86s)]
*  She barely knows this woman who's carrying your child. [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10102.86s)]
*  We got to do, what we got to do is you got to introduce this woman and show the best [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10104.66s)]
*  qualities of this woman to your mother. [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10110.820000000002s)]
*  Cause we got to, we got to basically get your mother pregnant. [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10112.54s)]
*  Get her on board. [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10116.58s)]
*  He, she said exact quote. [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10117.58s)]
*  He goes, we got to get your mother pregnant with the idea of her being pregnant. [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10118.58s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10122.380000000001s)]
*  We got to fucking, we got to make your mother fall in love with this woman. [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10123.380000000001s)]
*  And then the fact that she's pregnant is a bonus. [[02:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10127.32s)]
*  That's what we got to do. [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10130.32s)]
*  So that's what I did. [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10131.5s)]
*  And I got to tell you, by the time I told my mom Jasmine was pregnant was four or five [[02:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10132.5s)]
*  months into knowing her. [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10137.88s)]
*  Mom didn't bat an eye. [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10140.199999999999s)]
*  She was like, amazing. [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10141.699999999999s)]
*  I love it. [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10143.48s)]
*  And that was all my dad being street smart saying, get your mother pregnant with the [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10144.699999999999s)]
*  idea of her being pregnant. [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10148.779999999999s)]
*  I was like, fucking now my mom graduated from Columbia university. [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10150.6s)]
*  I really, she couldn't have come up with the shit. [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10154.52s)]
*  My dad who's got one tooth came up with. [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10157.68s)]
*  That's amazing. [[02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10160.44s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10161.44s)]
*  Right? [[02:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10162.44s)]
*  That's a great combination, man. [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10163.44s)]
*  Are you close with your mom and dad? [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10164.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10166.48s)]
*  Well, I'm close with my mom. [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10167.48s)]
*  I'm not close with my biological dad, but I'm close with my stepdad. [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10168.48s)]
*  Well, your stepdad. [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10170.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10171.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10172.800000000001s)]
*  See, see, and that's what I love about, you know, I have a step child and, and I was raised [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10173.800000000001s)]
*  half by a step mom. [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10177.4s)]
*  And I feel like step parenting is the most thankless job. [[02:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10179.12s)]
*  It's one of the most thankless jobs because I have to, I treat my stepson like he is my [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10183.12s)]
*  own, just like my stepmother treated me like I was her own, but we're not right. [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10187.08s)]
*  There's no nature biological connection. [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10191.24s)]
*  But I said, my connection to you as my stepson is through my daughters. [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10193.72s)]
*  And I, you are as much as even though I did not create you, you are a part of my life, [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10198.64s)]
*  part of my family. [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10203.36s)]
*  And I love you like I love my children. [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10204.36s)]
*  But it's, it's, it's a tough thing to kind of, uh, when you're a step parent, you realize [[02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10205.96s)]
*  like, man, I'm, I'm in third, fourth, fifth place in my own life. [[02:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10211.24s)]
*  And I just have to accept that. [[02:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10214.56s)]
*  I got to try to be the most positive, uh, human being I can and be happy for me. [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10215.88s)]
*  Because happiness is, I can transfer it to my, my family. [[02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10220.44s)]
*  But being a step father is harder than being a biological father because it's nature is [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10224.199999999999s)]
*  saying this is not your kid, but yet you have to say, no, no, no, it is my kid. [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10229.64s)]
*  This is my child. [[02:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10234.92s)]
*  And, and, and I found that being a step dad has, uh, it's almost like, you know, when [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10237.2s)]
*  you kind of like grind the gears and like, you know, grind the stuff and then a diamond [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10242.2s)]
*  comes out, like I feel like that. [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10245.800000000001s)]
*  I feel like I'm proud to be a father because of my step parenting more than my biological. [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10247.52s)]
*  I love my children, all three of them the same equally, even though one of them is not [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10253.640000000001s)]
*  biologically mine. [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10257.48s)]
*  I love him like I love my daughters. [[02:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10258.84s)]
*  That's beautiful. [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10260.92s)]
*  It seems like everything you're saying is you being on a path of being a better person. [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10262.0s)]
*  Like, it seems like you're really concentrating on that all the time. [[02:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10266.8s)]

*  No problem. [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10523.76s)]
*  Time's going on. [[02:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10524.76s)]
*  Now we're at a minute. [[02:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10525.76s)]
*  Now we're at a minute and a half. [[02:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10526.76s)]
*  And it's a long time. [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10529.76s)]
*  And it's about two minutes now. [[02:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10530.92s)]
*  And my mom, you know, is crying. [[02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10532.199999999999s)]
*  Larry's blinking. [[02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10534.32s)]
*  Larry actually looks like he's getting a little bit more energy. [[02:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10535.32s)]
*  And I said to the vet, I said, is this normal? [[02:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10537.599999999999s)]
*  She goes, no, I'll be right back. [[02:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10542.599999999999s)]
*  Because Larry now has got, I mean, Larry was dying. [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10545.72s)]
*  And now Larry's kind of got a bit of a pep in his step. [[02:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10548.439999999999s)]
*  So I'm saying, okay. [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10551.48s)]
*  What's going on here? [[02:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10553.12s)]
*  My mom's kind of upset, but she's like, we're all confused. [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10554.12s)]
*  Vet leaves, comes back, white as a ghost. [[02:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10557.28s)]
*  The vet, I say to the vet, because my mom is inconsolable, I say, doc, what's going on? [[02:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10560.8s)]
*  She goes, I'm very sorry. [[02:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10567.84s)]
*  She goes, we have a new vet tech that just started last week. [[02:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10570.44s)]
*  Innocent mistake. [[02:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10574.44s)]
*  The dog next door to you was dehydrated. [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10575.6s)]
*  And we accidentally gave Larry electrolytes. [[02:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10578.36s)]
*  Not the death medicine. [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10581.56s)]
*  We gave him electrolytes. [[02:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10582.84s)]
*  So you might see a quick surge of energy, which we're seeing. [[02:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10583.84s)]
*  I mean, Larry was doing cartwheels. [[02:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10586.84s)]
*  I mean, this dog was acting like he was a fucking puppy. [[02:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10588.039999999999s)]
*  You see this quick surge of energy. [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10591.68s)]
*  What about the other dog? [[02:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10593.439999999999s)]
*  That's what I thought. [[02:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10595.56s)]
*  The electrolytes into Larry, the vet says, don't worry, I have the right medicine right here. [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10597.359999999999s)]
*  Larry will be dead in a minute. [[02:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10602.039999999999s)]
*  Larry now is like blinking, like literally like we gave Larry like a shot of cocaine. [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10605.439999999999s)]
*  Fucking fully alive. [[02:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10611.199999999999s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10612.6s)]
*  My mom doesn't know what to do. [[02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10613.6s)]
*  They give the right medicine to Larry, like the right medicine. [[02:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10616.199999999999s)]
*  Larry died in five seconds. [[02:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10620.16s)]
*  Dead last blink, whatever. [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10622.0s)]
*  I thought the same thing you did. [[02:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10624.08s)]
*  I said, God knows what the hell happened to the dog next door. [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10625.279999999999s)]
*  I have no fucking idea. [[02:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10628.72s)]
*  Just get out of there. [[02:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10630.52s)]
*  I signed that paperwork. [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10631.52s)]
*  We fucking left. [[02:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10632.52s)]
*  Oh boy. [[02:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10633.52s)]
*  Yeah, it was one of those things where. [[02:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10634.52s)]
*  It's not you. [[02:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10636.0s)]
*  It ain't me. [[02:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10637.0s)]
*  You can't pull it back either. [[02:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10638.0s)]
*  It was a big fuck up and my mom was kind of on the drive home. [[02:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10639.0s)]
*  I was like, do you think Larry could have been saved? [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10641.84s)]
*  I said, Mom, you know what? [[02:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10643.52s)]
*  I think we made the right choice. [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10644.52s)]
*  Here's a Wendy's here. [[02:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10645.68s)]

*  And the dehydrated dog died suddenly. [[02:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10649.16s)]
*  Might have died suddenly. [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10651.2s)]
*  That's, but that's medicine baby. [[02:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10652.2s)]
*  That's medicine. [[02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10655.04s)]

*  By the way, I think if you, if you have a dog, it's great to name it a funny human name. [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10661.44s)]
*  I don't like Fido spot. [[02:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10666.16s)]
*  I like Larry, Gary, Harry, Megan. [[02:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10667.68s)]

*  I don't know if she was rabies, but she was a vicious dog. [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10677.72s)]
*  Her name was Josephine. [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10680.24s)]

*  Because it's six months of just dropping tests through your ass crease. [[03:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10837.2s)]
*  It's so weird. [[03:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10840.76s)]
*  Right? [[03:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10841.76s)]
*  It seems like I'd rather just inject it. [[03:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10842.76s)]
*  But you got to take a pill to prevent baldness. [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10843.76s)]
*  You got to take a pill to prevent tits. [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10846.6s)]
*  You got to take a pill to prevent blood clots. [[03:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10847.960000000001s)]
*  It seems like a lot. [[03:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10850.2s)]
*  You don't have to take a pill to prevent blood clots. [[03:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10851.2s)]
*  Unless you have some sort of high blood pressure medication or some sort of issue with your... [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10853.12s)]
*  I mean, it's not a normal thing to take a pill to prevent blood clots. [[03:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10858.28s)]
*  It's not something a lot of people take. [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10861.8s)]
*  I'm on high blood pressure medicine. [[03:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10863.48s)]
*  Los Arden. [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10864.8s)]
*  Is that a blood clot issue though? [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10865.8s)]
*  No. [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10867.36s)]
*  I think I've always had high blood... [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10868.36s)]
*  I had high blood pressure and high cholesterol when I was 12. [[03:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10869.800000000001s)]
*  But if someone is taking a pill to prevent blood clots... [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10871.36s)]
*  I mean, I'm not a doctor, right? [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10873.76s)]
*  But is that... [[03:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10875.12s)]
*  That seems unusual. [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10876.12s)]
*  It seems unusual. [[03:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10877.12s)]
*  A pill to prevent blood clots. [[03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10878.12s)]
*  What would that be for? [[03:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10880.12s)]
*  What's the disease that... [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10881.12s)]
*  Is there a disease specifically? [[03:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10882.480000000001s)]
*  For blood clots? [[03:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10883.92s)]
*  That causes blood clots? [[03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10884.92s)]
*  Is there a condition that causes blood clots? [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10885.92s)]
*  But you think that I got to get my blood drawn. [[03:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10888.960000000001s)]
*  I got to get on something. [[03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10892.16s)]
*  Well, you should definitely find out... [[03:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10894.0s)]
*  Instead of saying I got to get on something, find out where all your levels are at. [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10896.12s)]
*  So that's an easy fix. [[03:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10900.48s)]
*  They go, they do blood work, they do a comprehensive panel. [[03:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10902.08s)]
*  All the nutrients, all your hormone levels, everything. [[03:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10905.4s)]
*  And so then you can say, oh, you're low in vitamin D or you're low in zinc or you're [[03:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10908.4s)]
*  low in DHEA, whatever it is. [[03:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10913.44s)]
*  There's a bunch of different things. [[03:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10916.4s)]
*  Right. [[03:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10917.4s)]
*  Got to be something. [[03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10918.4s)]
*  Yes. [[03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10919.4s)]
*  Got to be something I'm low in. [[03:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10920.4s)]
*  I'm sure. [[03:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10921.4s)]
*  Have to be. [[03:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10922.4s)]
*  I'm sure there's a balance that could be achieved. [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10923.4s)]
*  Do you take vitamins? [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10924.4s)]
*  Is that enough? [[03:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10925.72s)]
*  On an empty stomach. [[03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10926.72s)]
*  Yes. [[03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10927.72s)]
*  Which I heard does not break your fast. [[03:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10928.72s)]
*  I'm going with, I take those on an empty stomach at 8 a.m. with a shot of apple cider vinegar. [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10929.72s)]
*  And it says it does not break your fast because anything over 30 calories breaks your fast, [[03:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10934.64s)]
*  according to the Zero Fasting app. [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10939.24s)]
*  And this is 30 on the dot. [[03:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10940.6s)]
*  There you go. [[03:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10942.08s)]
*  What do you think? [[03:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10943.08s)]
*  I say don't sweat it. [[03:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10944.44s)]
*  Just take it, right? [[03:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10946.44s)]
*  Just take it. [[03:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10947.44s)]
*  It can only be good for you. [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10948.44s)]
*  Dude, we got to hang out more. [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10949.44s)]
*  Okay. [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10950.44s)]
*  You ever have comedians sleep over your house? [[03:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10951.44s)]
*  Not anymore. [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10953.64s)]
*  Right? [[03:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10954.88s)]
*  What about a sleepover? [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10955.88s)]
*  What about a comic sleepover? [[03:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10957.519999999999s)]
*  Comic sleepover, maybe we get a big suite at a hotel somewhere. [[03:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10959.56s)]
*  Maybe that's our thing. [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10962.519999999999s)]
*  Maybe you got to protect the parks from the other guys. [[03:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqM_x6GKrM&t=10963.519999999999s)]
