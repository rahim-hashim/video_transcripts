# Joe Rogan Experience #1929 - Louis CK
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU)
*  I never thought about you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of shit going on over there. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  That thing in the front is weird. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=16.0s)]
*  What, this thing right here? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=18.0s)]
*  What is that? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=19.28s)]
*  Oh, that's a piece of art. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=20.28s)]
*  That comes from Beeple. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=22.52s)]
*  Beeple crap on Instagram. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=26.36s)]
*  Beeple is a digital artist. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=28.86s)]
*  He puts up a new piece of digital art every day. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=30.78s)]
*  And he came in to do the podcast and he gave us this thing that's Elon Musk, if he was [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=33.14s)]
*  jacked. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=39.019999999999996s)]
*  Like once genetic engineering comes along. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=40.019999999999996s)]
*  I'm just going to grab a paper towel. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=41.86s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=46.1s)]
*  Glasses are brutal. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=49.42s)]
*  I wear reading glasses when I try to like look at my phone in the morning. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=50.92s)]
*  I'm like, Jesus fucking Christ. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=54.5s)]
*  Every day I'm going a little blinder. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=56.06s)]
*  Yes you are. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=57.66s)]
*  That's just the way it goes. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=59.62s)]
*  I mean, they're just such intricate little machines and they're organic so they just [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=61.099999999999994s)]
*  start to soften on you. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=65.78s)]
*  I had a guy in the other day, Bilal Mohammed, he's a UFC fighter who's had a detached retina [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=67.42s)]
*  and a detached lens on his other eye. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=71.97999999999999s)]
*  On both eyes it's like, you're talking to people like that and the game they're playing [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=74.58s)]
*  is you're punching people in the face and a lot of times the thumbs go in the eyes because [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=78.53999999999999s)]
*  UFC gloves have open fingers. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=83.34s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=85.7s)]
*  So occasionally guys accidentally get poked in the eye. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=86.7s)]
*  Fucking terrifying. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=88.94000000000001s)]
*  That's the reason I wouldn't ever, I mean there's a lot of reasons I wouldn't be a pro [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=90.22000000000001s)]
*  fighter. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=92.7s)]
*  But that's it now. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=93.7s)]
*  If it wasn't for the eyes, I'd be all over it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=94.7s)]
*  They can kind of fix them a little bit. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=98.10000000000001s)]
*  You remember when Sugar Ray Leonard had a detached retina and he retired from the sport [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=99.86000000000001s)]
*  and everybody's like, holy shit. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=103.42000000000002s)]
*  And then he came back. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=104.42000000000002s)]
*  And everybody's like, he's back. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=105.42000000000002s)]
*  He needed the money probably. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=106.42000000000002s)]
*  I think he needed the money but I think he also needed the thrills. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=107.42000000000002s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=112.30000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it must be, those guys retire so young and then what's left is a huge expanse of [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=113.42s)]
*  life ahead of you. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=117.46s)]
*  Not just that, it's like the things that you've looked forward to are these enormous events [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=119.02s)]
*  where you're in your underwear and you're walking out in front of this gigantic group [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=123.86s)]
*  of people that's there to watch you slam your fists into someone's face. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=128.66s)]
*  Well, and you've worked up to it too. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=132.22s)]
*  All the training and the getting ready, the challenging someone, the setting the fight [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=133.74s)]
*  and where it is in your career and are you challenging, are you defending? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=138.34s)]
*  So it's like a year, a fight's like a year of your life. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=144.34s)]
*  I mean in boxing. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=146.54s)]
*  UFC, they fight more often, right? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=147.54s)]
*  I guess, I don't know. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=149.54s)]
*  Depends. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=150.54s)]
*  Depends on the fighter. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=151.54s)]
*  Depends on what stage they are in their career. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=152.54s)]
*  But the guys like to fight more often just to stay comfortable because otherwise the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=156.14s)]
*  moment's so big. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=161.38s)]
*  When you have more fights, you can relax and you just... [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=163.1s)]
*  I remember Ali describing, somebody asked him, does he get nervous? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=167.22s)]
*  He was a great guy because he wasn't a bullshitter. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=170.54000000000002s)]
*  He bullshitted when it was time to sell the fight. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=174.26000000000002s)]
*  But whenever anybody asked him things like that, he was honest. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=177.62s)]
*  Somebody asked him, do you get nervous? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=180.94s)]
*  He said, every fight I get really nervous. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=182.14000000000001s)]
*  When I come out to the ring, I feel like I can't do this and that guy's huge. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=185.06s)]
*  Why did I come here? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=190.42000000000002s)]
*  But then the bell rings and as soon as it becomes about the work, I go, well, this is [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=194.74s)]
*  what I do. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=200.5s)]
*  And then what takes over is just routine. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=202.18s)]
*  What I do and then he's just serious. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=204.85999999999999s)]
*  I always felt like the worst part was before the fight started. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=206.54s)]
*  The worst part was standing there getting ready before the fight started. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=211.42s)]
*  But then once the fight starts, you're on instinct. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=215.78s)]
*  You're in. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=218.3s)]
*  Sort of normal. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=219.3s)]
*  That's what stand up is like. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=220.3s)]
*  I fucking hate waiting to go on stage. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=221.3s)]
*  That's the worst thing. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=223.62s)]
*  And I get a little if there's stuff going on, I get irritated if the opener is going over [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=224.62s)]
*  a little or. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=228.98s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=229.98s)]
*  You want a drink. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=230.98s)]
*  You want to this. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=231.98s)]
*  You want to that. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=232.98s)]
*  Give me something to distract myself. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=233.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=235.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's bad news. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=236.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=237.7s)]
*  But yeah, I could see why guys like that need to come back. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=238.7s)]
*  But it's good to be able to live your life where that's not normal. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=241.94s)]
*  That's not what you're what you need. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=245.78s)]
*  It's a gigantic shift, though, in the way you view the world. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=247.7s)]
*  You have to view the world as not like these big events that you're planning for every [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=251.77999999999997s)]
*  three to six months. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=255.33999999999997s)]
*  But instead, just life. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=256.34s)]
*  Yes, that's what I've tried to do in the last few years. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=257.94s)]
*  And this is I'm about to end this tour and then I'm going to take a year off, I think. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=260.53999999999996s)]
*  100 percent off. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=265.74s)]
*  Yeah, no, no, no age anywhere. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=266.74s)]
*  That's great. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=268.65999999999997s)]
*  That's the plan. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=269.65999999999997s)]
*  I think that there's a there's a balance between performing a lot and perspective. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=270.65999999999997s)]
*  Like and one of the things that happens to guys when they perform too much is that they [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=275.86s)]
*  talk about things that are related to their life as a traveling comedian. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=279.54s)]
*  It's all air travel and flights and hotels and restaurants. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=283.66s)]
*  And so much of the material revolves around this very narrow window of existence. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=288.02000000000004s)]
*  Yes, that's true. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=292.42s)]
*  But also, you put all this pressure on performance that it's got to fix all your life. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=293.90000000000003s)]
*  And it's not going to. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=299.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=301.26s)]
*  But if you live a fuller life, then then comedy has the place to show, which is like it's [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=302.26s)]
*  a weird thing to do. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=306.18s)]
*  It should always be weird and it should always be like, man, I can't believe I'm doing this. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=307.34s)]
*  If your life is normal, then comedy is a gas. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=311.78s)]
*  It's a jolt. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=314.61999999999995s)]
*  And inside of it, you know, for me, you do work, you're working in there and there's [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=316.14s)]
*  routine and there's, you know, yeah. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=319.53999999999996s)]
*  But it should stay special, you know. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=323.09999999999997s)]
*  Well, you're you're at a point right now you're ready to do this special, which is this thing [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=325.62s)]
*  you're going to live stream. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=330.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=331.9s)]
*  In Madison Square Garden. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=332.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=333.9s)]
*  Fucking super exciting. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=334.9s)]
*  I love it. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=335.9s)]
*  It's January 28th. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=337.46s)]
*  It's my I'm going back to the garden. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=338.46s)]
*  I used to play there all the time. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=340.14s)]
*  Haven't played there in a number of years. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=342.02s)]
*  I didn't know what to come back. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=343.65999999999997s)]
*  There it is. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=345.09999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=346.09999999999997s)]
*  And so we put the sale, Joe and sale. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=347.09999999999997s)]
*  I wrote to you because I wanted to do it in the round. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=349.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=352.73999999999995s)]
*  I never did it that way. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=353.73999999999995s)]
*  And so I asked you if it was good. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=355.34s)]
*  You said it was really fun. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=357.62s)]
*  That's so fun. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=358.62s)]
*  And then I found out that it costs twice as much because you got a light from two sides. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=360.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=364.7s)]
*  You need to be able to see the guy from four angles. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=366.5s)]
*  So you need more cameras. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=370.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=371.65999999999997s)]
*  And then we sold the thing out like we sold 10,000 tickets on the first day. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=372.65999999999997s)]
*  It's sold out now. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=376.26s)]
*  It's 18,000 seats. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=377.26s)]
*  It's the most people I've ever have. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=378.26s)]
*  I mean, I'm doing this 38 years. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=381.26s)]
*  That'll be the biggest audience I ever played for. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=382.58s)]
*  And so it costs so much money, though, to put the cameras in there for the Jumbotron. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=385.18s)]
*  And then I thought just let's live stream it because it's actually only costing a little [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=391.34s)]
*  bit. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=394.94s)]
*  You know, there's not that much more because we already have all this shit in there. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=395.94s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=398.94s)]
*  So yeah, so we're going to live stream it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=399.94s)]
*  And on my website, you just go and it's like 25 bucks and that's awesome. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=401.94s)]
*  We'll keep it up. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=406.02s)]
*  It's a live event. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=407.02s)]
*  It's not a special so much as a live event. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=408.02s)]
*  So it's all new material since my last special. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=409.3s)]
*  And it'll be up till the 17th, I think, of February. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=411.98s)]
*  Then we take it down and then it'll go away. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=416.34s)]
*  And then in April, I'll put out a special of the same material that I already shot at [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=418.82s)]
*  the Dolby Theater in L.A. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=423.22s)]
*  I shot a special. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=424.54s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=425.54s)]
*  When did you shoot that? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=426.54s)]
*  Earlier this month. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=427.54s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=428.54s)]
*  Yeah, it was really good. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=429.54s)]
*  That's a great idea. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=430.54s)]
*  I love that. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=431.54s)]
*  So that's like the album. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=432.54s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=433.54s)]
*  And that'll be the same as every special I've ever done, like 10 bucks. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=434.54s)]
*  And you can download it and all that stuff and keep it. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=436.74s)]
*  But this one is only for streaming in a short, limited time. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=439.78s)]
*  So Chris Rock is doing a live special too on Netflix, right? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=443.3s)]
*  He's going to film it and it'll stream live on Netflix. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=447.02s)]
*  Is that what they're going to do for the first time? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=450.14s)]
*  Yeah, they never live streamed anything. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=451.62s)]
*  So he's their first one. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=453.5s)]
*  And that's cool for him. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=455.34s)]
*  And it'll be March, I think he's doing. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=456.34s)]
*  He's in Atlanta. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=457.66s)]
*  I've heard nothing but good things about his new set. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=458.66s)]
*  Yeah, he's well, he's been, I think, holding back a little bit. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=461.1s)]
*  So this I think this tour has been great for him. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=465.38s)]
*  Yeah, I think this is going to be really great. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=468.82s)]
*  I'm excited. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=471.54s)]
*  I'm excited for his show. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=472.54s)]
*  I'm excited for comedy right now. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=474.02s)]
*  Yeah, comedy is getting. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=475.46s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=476.74s)]
*  Picking up steam. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=477.74s)]
*  Well, it's also it's like people are really longing for it because there's so much political, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=478.74s)]
*  correct bullshit, this woke bullshit, what you can and can't say. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=482.65999999999997s)]
*  And so many people feel upset about it and that like they don't know what to say because [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=486.14s)]
*  they can't talk at work or they get fired. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=489.65999999999997s)]
*  They can't talk amongst their community or they get shamed. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=491.62s)]
*  They don't they like, oh, and then you can go see someone talk on stage like, yeah. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=494.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=499.18s)]
*  And that's what comedy always was. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=500.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=501.7s)]
*  It's always been that. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=502.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=503.7s)]
*  And it's to me, everything that's happened has been natural. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=504.7s)]
*  It's like normal that comedy has to be defended every few years. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=506.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=510.38s)]
*  When everybody's being cool, like when the world is kind of cool, like it was up till [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=511.38s)]
*  maybe 2015 or so, like it's just kind of cool. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=515.42s)]
*  Comedy is cool and every, you know, but then when things get shitty in terms of this sort [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=519.38s)]
*  of thing, people being more divided and unable to express themselves, comedy gets more important, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=523.78s)]
*  but also starts getting attacked and we have to defend it. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=530.54s)]
*  That's all. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=533.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=534.46s)]
*  I mean, by just doing it, that's all I don't I don't get into defending it by saying fuck [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=535.46s)]
*  these people. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=538.84s)]
*  This means you have to keep doing it at the same discipline. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=539.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=542.88s)]
*  And doing it the same way. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=543.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=545.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=546.08s)]
*  Don't pull back. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=547.08s)]
*  No, just keep doing it and folks will show up and love it. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=548.08s)]
*  Well that's one of the things I really loved about your last special. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=551.84s)]
*  It was like a hundred percent a Louis CK special. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=555.0400000000001s)]
*  There wasn't you didn't back off of anything like that whole thing that you did at the [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=558.32s)]
*  end, the the the faggot thing was so funny, man. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=565.32s)]
*  It's so funny. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=569.16s)]
*  It's such a good bit. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=570.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=571.16s)]
*  That's new today. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=572.16s)]
*  Straight manner. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=573.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=574.16s)]
*  It's so funny. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=575.16s)]
*  It's so good because it's so like, ah, he's going there, you know, but it was really well [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=576.16s)]
*  thought out. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=580.0s)]
*  My audiences are really diverse. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=581.0s)]
*  I mean, in terms of like I get young people and some kind of like progressive looking [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=583.4s)]
*  people, I get men and women in all races, mostly white, but you know, some cities I [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=587.8s)]
*  get more. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=592.48s)]
*  But I tested it in front of so many people that bit and every kind of person laughed [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=594.04s)]
*  at it. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=600.36s)]
*  The only people that got offended by it were people like in the south or more kind of like [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=601.36s)]
*  red state people because when I said straight manner faggots, I'm talking about, you know, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=607.1999999999999s)]
*  Brooklyn Twinks and right, right, right. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=614.76s)]
*  They don't know those people. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=616.72s)]
*  They think I'm talking about them. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=617.72s)]
*  Hey, man, will you come? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=618.72s)]
*  So they didn't. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=620.72s)]
*  They missed it. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=621.72s)]
*  I thought I would be offending progressive young kids, but for them it was a relief because [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=622.9200000000001s)]
*  it's about them and they feel that way. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=628.32s)]
*  In real life, people like being laughed at. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=631.64s)]
*  They like their community to be like when you do good jokes about black people, not [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=634.4s)]
*  like a white perspective about being alienated from them. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=638.52s)]
*  But if you do a good joke about black culture or Chinese culture or Jewish culture, the [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=642.0s)]
*  people in those groups laugh because they're in the show and they know their culture as [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=646.88s)]
*  well as anybody does. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=652.76s)]
*  So that's always been the case. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=655.28s)]
*  But people just, you know, I mean, it never really changed. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=657.28s)]
*  And the way I figured it was there was no point in backing down and changing because [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=661.1s)]
*  what do you want out of life? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=665.5s)]
*  Maybe I could have like I already had a crazy heyday where the kind of comedy I do, which [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=668.12s)]
*  is just flagrant fouls, just fucking just bad, bad behavior throughout. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=674.8s)]
*  For a while, that was like considered the greatest thing. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=681.3199999999999s)]
*  And people were just like, this is great. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=684.16s)]
*  The mainstream loved it. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=686.4399999999999s)]
*  Everybody loved it. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=688.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=689.18s)]
*  And I had that for years, that success. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=690.18s)]
*  So I figured if I have to do it and I start getting hated for it or even just business [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=692.14s)]
*  goes down, I have to take some heat from the sides. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=696.96s)]
*  So what? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=702.4s)]
*  It's not a lot to ask of me considering what I've enjoyed. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=703.52s)]
*  So if my I was like that before when I first started, I was gross and a lot of people stayed [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=707.0s)]
*  away from me. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=713.4s)]
*  And then I had a heyday and then I'm like, it's back to go. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=714.86s)]
*  It's time to go back into the underground. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=717.88s)]
*  It's time to go back into just like, like I don't get mentioned in the big lists for [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=719.6s)]
*  a lot of reasons, but also for the comedy. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=723.8199999999999s)]
*  But so it's OK. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=727.48s)]
*  It's acceptable to me if it if if it's not as popular anymore, I'm still going to do [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=729.52s)]
*  the same thing. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=735.24s)]
*  But that's what's bullshit. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=736.24s)]
*  It is as popular. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=737.24s)]
*  That's the lists are nonsense. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=738.24s)]
*  The lists are all non binary people made a fucking special in a coffee shop. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=740.28s)]
*  I guess. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=744.8s)]
*  And by the way, let them have the list for a while. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=745.8s)]
*  That's fine, too. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=747.56s)]
*  Let you know, that's that has never meant much. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=748.56s)]
*  The mistake is when you're on it, you go like, yeah, right. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=752.72s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=756.72s)]
*  When you're on it, when you're on the lists and you're at the red carpet and stuff, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=758.0400000000001s)]
*  you it's like playing blackjack and you start getting good cards and you think you're good [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=761.24s)]
*  at blackjack. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=765.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=766.08s)]
*  You're like, see, I know. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=767.08s)]
*  No, you just it's an arbitrary thing that has its own reasons for being. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=768.08s)]
*  And sometimes you get benefit for it. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=772.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=775.0400000000001s)]
*  And sometimes you don't. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=776.0400000000001s)]
*  And that's who gives a shit. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=777.0400000000001s)]
*  But like saying about your heyday, I don't I don't think I think you're right there. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=778.12s)]
*  I like you sold out 10,000 tickets in a day. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=781.6800000000001s)]
*  Like what the fuck? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=784.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=785.2s)]
*  I mean, I did it five times in a year. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=786.2s)]
*  I bet you could do it five times in a year. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=787.5200000000001s)]
*  I don't think it's much different. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=789.2s)]
*  I think probably that one was it for me. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=790.2s)]
*  And also, I don't want to do five shows at the Garden. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=792.6s)]
*  Well, you don't have to if you don't want to. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=794.88s)]
*  But I bet you could. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=796.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I suppose. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=797.9200000000001s)]
*  I bet you could. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=798.9200000000001s)]
*  Well, people fucking love comedy right now. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=799.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they do. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=801.6400000000001s)]
*  We're having a great time. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=802.6400000000001s)]
*  It's a lot of fun right now. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=803.6400000000001s)]
*  It's a fucking ball. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=805.48s)]
*  I have no concerns on stage about. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=807.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=810.84s)]
*  Is this going to be? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=812.08s)]
*  They're coming to see you. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=813.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=814.08s)]
*  I like the other thing is at this time was good for comedy. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=815.5600000000001s)]
*  The time of people getting their assholes a little tighter because like I was listening [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=819.72s)]
*  to Patrice last night with my opener, Ariel. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=824.36s)]
*  Three names for some reason. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=829.48s)]
*  Fucking Ariel Isaac Norman. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=830.48s)]
*  We worked together in New Orleans. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=832.64s)]
*  We did a show mobile and we drove to New Orleans and I was playing for her Patrice's album, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=834.6800000000001s)]
*  Mr. P and Patrice O'Neil. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=839.32s)]
*  He does a couple of bits and he says to the crowd, you guys are laughing. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=843.92s)]
*  That's good, but you're not all laughing and that's good. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=846.4399999999999s)]
*  I don't want you all to laugh. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=848.48s)]
*  If everybody's laughing, it's not fun. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=850.88s)]
*  You need somebody in here going like, that's not. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=852.4399999999999s)]
*  That's not OK. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=856.4s)]
*  And I believe that like that's it actually makes comedy better if it has an adverse, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=858.04s)]
*  if you have pushback because and the thing, the problem that some comedians have is they [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=863.9599999999999s)]
*  get hurt. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=869.3199999999999s)]
*  They get their feelings hurt. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=870.3199999999999s)]
*  If someone doesn't like the joke, they feel that it's oh, you don't like me. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=871.48s)]
*  And then they back away from anything that makes them feel like that. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=875.04s)]
*  But if you can be like, here's a terrible thing. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=878.8000000000001s)]
*  And then the audience goes like, oh, and you just hear you don't get emotionally involved. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=882.0s)]
*  You hear the oh, and you go, OK, I can either go around it or I can go into it. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=887.6s)]
*  We can go further into this. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=893.0s)]
*  There's some this potential in that horrible feeling for another laugh past it that they've [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=894.12s)]
*  never experienced. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=900.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=901.16s)]
*  Because usually when an audience shows, I don't want to hear that people back away. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=902.16s)]
*  But if you stay with it, I'm still talking about it. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=906.4s)]
*  I'm still talking. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=908.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm still your friend. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=909.5600000000001s)]
*  Like, I'm not going to fuck you people. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=910.5600000000001s)]
*  You know, that thing. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=913.88s)]
*  That's another cop out. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=914.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=916.28s)]
*  Fuck you, you pussies. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=917.28s)]
*  You just go, OK, you didn't like it. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=918.28s)]
*  Well, here's a little more about it. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=919.68s)]
*  And if you get them like that and then you can. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=923.5600000000001s)]
*  I remember once I was in Houston. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=926.16s)]
*  And there was the Houston Improv. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=929.24s)]
*  And there's it's pretty much a black club. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=933.16s)]
*  Like, it's mostly black comedians go there. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=934.68s)]
*  And the clientele for the Houston Improv is mostly black people, Texas black people. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=936.28s)]
*  And so I went and did a weekend there. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=940.32s)]
*  And there's a lot of my fans, but there's a lot of folks that just come to the improv. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=942.6s)]
*  So they I could see in their faces that they don't know me. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=945.4s)]
*  And there is this one table of people they were dressed like it's Easter, like beautiful [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=948.76s)]
*  clothes, you know, and this woman in like a like a Robin's egg dress and beautiful [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=952.3199999999999s)]
*  makeup, this black woman. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=957.6s)]
*  I was doing this bit about pedophiles, one of the many pedophile bits. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=959.04s)]
*  I remember which one. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=963.8s)]
*  It was the thing about that they should make doll very realistic dolls of children for [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=967.04s)]
*  for pedophiles to fuck. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=973.24s)]
*  And she was just like, oh, like literally putting her hands up like, please don't. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=977.9599999999999s)]
*  And I just I look at her. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=983.64s)]
*  I looked at her with love, with sympathy. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=985.36s)]
*  I was really playing to her now. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=988.3199999999999s)]
*  And I'm trying to convince her that I'm not just trying to piss her off, that there's [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=990.4399999999999s)]
*  something worth hearing in here. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=993.4s)]
*  And somehow I don't remember what the moment was, but there was a moment in the bit where [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=995.3199999999999s)]
*  she went, I got I get it. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=998.64s)]
*  And then she started to laugh. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1001.36s)]
*  And I felt this relief. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1003.0s)]
*  I think she would rather not have had the experience at all. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1005.0s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1009.84s)]
*  I just love that. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1011.64s)]
*  So I'm so I love doing that so much. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1012.64s)]
*  And then it finds now I have a bit that she's part of that her resistance helped me find [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1015.24s)]
*  all of the round edges to the bit and all of the angles. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1021.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1025.3600000000001s)]
*  That's one of the most fascinating things about comedy is that you really need the audience [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1025.92s)]
*  to develop it. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1028.88s)]
*  You need them. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1029.68s)]
*  You can't do it in a vacuum. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1030.3600000000001s)]
*  No, it is the one art that the audience is your horn. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1032.32s)]
*  That's your fucking instrument. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1038.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're participating. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1039.76s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1041.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1041.6399999999999s)]
*  And you need a bunch of different kinds of audiences. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1041.9199999999998s)]
*  So many. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1044.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1045.0s)]
*  From all over the world. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1045.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1046.32s)]
*  You need to use you need to see people that aren't like you. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1046.6s)]
*  That's the most important thing is to go to places where you're like, I this is not going [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1049.1599999999999s)]
*  to be fun. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1054.56s)]
*  And there's bits that I do that I'm like, I don't want to do this to them. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1055.4399999999998s)]
*  I don't want to feel this feeling. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1058.72s)]
*  But I know if I keep doing it, each audience will bring me closer to them and figuring [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1061.12s)]
*  out. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1065.76s)]
*  And then there is this bad point where these bits that I do that are like about pedophilia [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1066.1599999999999s)]
*  and stuff, they get to where they're killing because I've just I've fashioned them so well [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1069.8799999999999s)]
*  and had so much great collaboration with different kinds of outrage. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1075.6s)]
*  And now it's a blistering hot bit. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1079.76s)]
*  And then when I'm doing it, I forget it was ever offensive. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1084.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1087.8799999999999s)]
*  And I just go like, I'm doing it like this. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1088.3999999999999s)]
*  Like, yeah, you're going to love this. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1090.52s)]
*  And I always crest over the wave to some audience that they just stare at me like, what are [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1093.12s)]
*  you talking about? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1098.0s)]
*  And I go, oh, yeah, that's right. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1099.8799999999999s)]
*  This is the fucked up stuff. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1100.9199999999998s)]
*  This is a fucked up thing to be talking about. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1103.12s)]
*  And then they remind me to approach it like this. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1105.3999999999999s)]
*  Mm. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1108.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1109.04s)]
*  Like, like the way you're talking to somebody with like a panicking person with a guy. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1109.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1114.1599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1114.6799999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1115.1999999999998s)]
*  You know, who's got a guy like this and he's doing this. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1115.4799999999998s)]
*  And you're just trying to get him to breathe. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1118.72s)]
*  You're trying to get him, you know, trying to take them through a scary room. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1120.6s)]
*  But what a great thing to take people to where the things that they hate and make them laugh. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1125.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1129.32s)]
*  What a great thing for some of us. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1129.88s)]
*  Some people don't like that. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1133.08s)]
*  No, some people just like fine and easy. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1134.32s)]
*  And that's that's fine, too. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1136.4s)]
*  I mean, there's a great audience for that, too. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1137.64s)]
*  I think one of the unique things that you've always liked to do is you like to go to clubs [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1140.0s)]
*  so they don't know you're going to be there. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1145.8s)]
*  They're not your fans necessarily. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1147.6799999999998s)]
*  They're just people. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1149.28s)]
*  And then you just drop in and try stuff out. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1150.4799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's the most honest thing. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1154.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, there's the it's thinking of some analogy where if you turn up all the [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1155.8s)]
*  dials, it all becomes zero again. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1161.12s)]
*  So if you're doing your audience, there's also a huge amount of pressure. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1163.8s)]
*  They're paying more money and they've been waiting. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1167.6399999999999s)]
*  So there you feel this thing of like, this has got to be good. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1170.36s)]
*  The pressure is really high for those shows. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1173.68s)]
*  There's support. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1175.5600000000002s)]
*  But those are your customers. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1177.0800000000002s)]
*  Yes. So they're just like, let's go. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1178.48s)]
*  Yeah. But when you just walk in, I mean, a lot of times if I walk in a place, they know [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1180.8400000000001s)]
*  who I am. But there's enough in the audience. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1185.8s)]
*  They didn't come to see me. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1188.3600000000001s)]
*  And there's enough in the audience that's just I can get an honest sense of how this [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1189.64s)]
*  material works. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1194.72s)]
*  There's someplace in Australia, there's a club in Melbourne, and I've done it twice. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1197.1200000000001s)]
*  20 years apart. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1202.56s)]
*  And both times nobody had any idea who I was like the MC did. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1203.9199999999998s)]
*  He's a comic. So he was like he said a lot of really nice things. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1208.32s)]
*  And he said, this guy, what a what a treat. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1211.8s)]
*  And he brings me on in the crowds like. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1215.1599999999999s)]
*  And they're just I could see them going like this to each other. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1218.12s)]
*  And I'm doing material that has been killing in large concert venues. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1222.04s)]
*  And they just don't give a fuck. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1227.56s)]
*  Like then then I found out what's actually, you know, means something to anybody. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1229.28s)]
*  So it's different culturally, too, like they'll laugh at things over there that we don't [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1235.48s)]
*  laugh at. Australia, do you find that? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1239.44s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1241.48s)]
*  Yeah. Australia is a fascinating place. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1243.16s)]
*  There is there. Wild people. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1245.72s)]
*  They're like they're very similar to Americans, but not but not at all. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1247.8s)]
*  That's what you get there and you think it's America. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1252.84s)]
*  No. And you because you're in a tube in an American tube and you go over there and you [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1255.52s)]
*  sleep in an American hotel and everybody's white and they don't sound British. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1260.16s)]
*  They sound a little more like us. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1264.0s)]
*  It feels American. Then you walk down the street and a fucking parrot flies by [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1265.84s)]
*  and lands on a telephone pole. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1271.0s)]
*  They're like, what the fuck is a parrot doing? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1273.12s)]
*  You realize you're surrounded by tropical creatures like I was in Perth, which is [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1274.36s)]
*  completely different from Sydney and Melbourne. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1278.8s)]
*  They call them those the eastern states. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1281.08s)]
*  Perth is on the west coast of Australia. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1283.52s)]
*  And it's in the Indian Ocean, south of India. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1285.72s)]
*  It's a great I mean, it's really like Perth is like a city surrounded by [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1289.36s)]
*  just no people. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1294.16s)]
*  And there is crazy creatures and weird plants and and then these white people. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1296.16s)]
*  And they're not. Yeah, they're not. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1301.0s)]
*  They used to be prisoners. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1302.44s)]
*  Well, in Perth, they were. It's different. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1304.12s)]
*  It's a mind. Yeah, they were. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1305.96s)]
*  It was founded as a as a commercial venture. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1307.36s)]
*  An English captain went to England and said he got money and he got people. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1311.3600000000001s)]
*  He paid people to go and and they're miners. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1315.8400000000001s)]
*  It's just these huge giant holes in the ground. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1318.8000000000002s)]
*  I think it's iron. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1321.2s)]
*  And there is these guys that live in us in Perth. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1322.5600000000002s)]
*  And they all have tons of money from this dirty work that they do. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1326.0s)]
*  And they call them five foes fly in, fly out, because they fly into the mines. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1329.4s)]
*  And then they just live. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1333.8400000000001s)]
*  It just covered in shit and, you know, sleep in a bunk next to the hole [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1335.7600000000002s)]
*  for like a month. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1340.3600000000001s)]
*  And then they give them like whatever, you know, thousand, hundred thousand dollars. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1341.92s)]
*  Then they go back to Perth. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1345.16s)]
*  It's a weird culture. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1346.76s)]
*  There's a lot of those people in Canada. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1348.24s)]
*  I guess like for the fishing, right? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1350.48s)]
*  No miners. Oh, yeah. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1352.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's a lot of miners. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1353.96s)]
*  Oil people, a lot of people work the oil rigs in Canada. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1355.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. A lot of the people that they're a part of that strip mining. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1359.1200000000001s)]
*  Like they all have like jacked up trucks and giant gold chains and tons of money. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1362.28s)]
*  That's what it's like in Perth. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1367.36s)]
*  Every truck is a off road, you know, jacked up with with the snorkels. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1368.8s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you need that out there for the dust. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1374.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you do. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1376.76s)]
*  But then the Eastern States was founded by [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1377.48s)]
*  they were penal colonies. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1382.28s)]
*  But and I don't know much about it, honestly. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1384.36s)]
*  But Sydney and Melbourne is my favorite place over there. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1386.28s)]
*  Melbourne's great. Such a great town. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1389.32s)]
*  It's like San Francisco before it was ruined in Australia. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1391.24s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1394.4399999999998s)]
*  I was just in San Francisco. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1395.72s)]
*  It's pretty gnarly right now. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1396.92s)]
*  Weird, right? Yeah. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1398.2s)]
*  It is strange how quickly a city can deteriorate with terrible government. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1399.56s)]
*  I mean, I don't know all the reasons, but it's pretty. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1405.1200000000001s)]
*  There's a ton of reasons. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1407.16s)]
*  Yeah. But clearly they haven't made a course correction. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1408.6000000000001s)]
*  Some of it is cyclical. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1411.4s)]
*  I mean, I started going there in the 80s [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1412.48s)]
*  and it's a little like it was when I started going there. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1415.84s)]
*  It gets a little bit like New York City. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1418.16s)]
*  Nobody remembers anything like that because it's all the young people. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1419.96s)]
*  There's always young, trendy people. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1423.3600000000001s)]
*  Whose parents pay for an apartment in New York City, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1425.72s)]
*  and they show up and they're just like, I'm a New Yorker. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1427.8400000000001s)]
*  And they came in. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1430.0s)]
*  A lot of the kids that are there now came in [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1431.8400000000001s)]
*  during this sort of gold and sort of Bloomberg era [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1434.44s)]
*  when it was Giuliani had just, you know, stuck plungers up [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1438.24s)]
*  many black anuses to clean the place up. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1441.68s)]
*  And we all kind of watched like, oh, don't do that. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1445.0800000000002s)]
*  Oh, like which turned away. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1448.52s)]
*  People forgot about cleaned up the city. What's that? [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1451.04s)]

*  Oh, boy, it's rough. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1486.92s)]

*  I mean, that came out of our house. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1519.72s)]
*  The towers were our view right out the door. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1521.24s)]

*  And she called me. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1528.44s)]
*  It was like nine in the morning in L.A. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1530.44s)]

*  And she called me and she was just bawling. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1536.88s)]
*  And I was like, what's wrong? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1539.52s)]
*  And she couldn't say anything. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1540.8s)]
*  And I was like, what the fuck is going to partly? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1542.24s)]
*  I'm like, am I in trouble? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1544.0s)]
*  Like, and then she says, turn on the TV. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1545.2s)]
*  And I saw these towers on fire and I was like, OK. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1549.52s)]
*  It's not it's nothing to do with with home. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1555.16s)]
*  This is a big world problem, not a me problem. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1558.72s)]
*  I'm pretty sure that's not my fault. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1561.68s)]
*  No. Anyway, she was she handled actually she handled it really well. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1563.68s)]
*  Todd Berry, you know, Todd, right? [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1567.32s)]
*  He called her. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1569.64s)]
*  She's the one who told him like what had happened. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1572.76s)]
*  He woke up not understanding what was happening. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1574.52s)]
*  And he was really scared and called my ex wife and she calmed him down. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1576.88s)]
*  She's a good she's a good person. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1582.52s)]
*  But anyway, yes. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1585.16s)]
*  And then and I was like, get out of this. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1586.64s)]
*  I just panic living in Manhattan. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1588.28s)]
*  Because I grew up with movies like Warriors [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1591.16s)]
*  and with memories like the blackouts. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1593.8400000000001s)]
*  And I wasn't even there for the blackouts. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1596.16s)]
*  But there's all these blackouts where everybody got killed. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1597.8400000000001s)]
*  And there's a lot of movies about like New York City is shut down [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1600.4s)]
*  and everybody and the wolves come out. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1603.28s)]
*  Yeah. So I thought as soon as it happened, I told her, get out of Manhattan. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1605.48s)]
*  There's just going to be people throwing TV sets through windows in like five. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1611.0800000000002s)]
*  I just believe I am legend. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1614.16s)]
*  Yes, that kind of thing. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1615.64s)]
*  So get the fuck out of it. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1616.92s)]
*  So she got out of there. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1618.1200000000001s)]
*  And then I was on the road and I was I was in L.A. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1620.64s)]
*  I was supposed to pitch a show and I called the network and I said, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1623.96s)]
*  I assume the meeting is canceled. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1628.68s)]
*  And they said, yeah, but if you want your show to go forward, we do have to. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1631.52s)]
*  We have to have. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1636.4s)]
*  They made me do [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1637.96s)]
*  pitching comedy on September 11th on the 12th. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1639.56s)]

*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1646.44s)]
*  It's a day to let everything. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1647.4s)]
*  Yeah, the 12th is my birthday. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1648.32s)]
*  But so I had to pitch a fucking comedy and it was. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1650.96s)]
*  There's harb. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1654.16s)]
*  I mean, obviously, that was terrible. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1654.8s)]
*  And then I went back on the road. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1657.48s)]
*  I was doing gigs. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1659.52s)]
*  So I was flying as soon as they were flying. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1660.8400000000001s)]
*  You know, there's no airplanes for how many days was it? [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1662.8400000000001s)]

*  But I think it was a couple of weeks before a flight went up. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1667.72s)]
*  I don't remember. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1671.72s)]
*  But but I started flying right away. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1672.56s)]
*  And the airports were all empty. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1675.24s)]
*  And you got everyone was allowed in the lounges [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1678.6000000000001s)]
*  and everyone was getting upgraded to first class [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1682.4s)]
*  because the planes were empty. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1684.48s)]
*  And for a while, it was part of the protocol. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1686.2800000000002s)]
*  Before the flight takes off, they used to say they would give you the safety stuff. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1689.8000000000002s)]
*  And then they would say, you can use your seatbelt, the attaches. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1693.8400000000001s)]
*  You can use it as a weapon. Oh, Jesus. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1696.3600000000001s)]
*  You can use your seat as a shield. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1698.2800000000002s)]
*  And they would. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1702.0s)]
*  Yes, they would say this is part of the thing for like the first month after 9-11. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1702.96s)]
*  And they would say, we're here to protect you, but you have to protect us. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1706.7600000000002s)]
*  They would say that. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1710.92s)]
*  And there was one flight I took where I was flying first class, like seat one B. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1712.1200000000001s)]
*  I was right at the bulkhead. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1716.96s)]
*  And this other guy sitting at one C across from me, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1718.8s)]
*  and the captain came out right before the flight and he kind of squatted between us. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1721.3600000000001s)]
*  And he said, listen, fellas, because it was a red eye. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1724.68s)]
*  He said, you're the last line of defense. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1728.0s)]
*  So I need you not to sleep on this flight. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1730.72s)]

*  First of all, I don't know who's right. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1811.8s)]
*  I mean, this one guy who says it's his seat and it's above his seat. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1813.68s)]
*  Yeah. He's kind of got a point. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1817.92s)]
*  And the other guy's got a point, too. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1819.32s)]
*  Like, if that's the only space that's open. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1820.52s)]
*  I don't think it's about who's right. Right. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1822.2s)]
*  In that situation, it's not about who's right about that. Right. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1824.8s)]
*  It's about if somebody throws hands. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1827.84s)]
*  Well, it was about one guy was really douchey about it. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1830.2s)]
*  Like he could have he could have been like there was nothing else available. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1832.76s)]
*  Do you want like is there a space over here? [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1837.52s)]
*  I'll move your bag for you. Yeah. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1839.84s)]
*  Like you could have made so many. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1841.44s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. They could have made some sort of a considerate. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1842.8s)]
*  He's probably got some at home. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1846.48s)]
*  You know, probably you get on a plane after a fight with whoever at home. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1849.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Work sucks at home. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1853.1200000000001s)]
*  He can't say it. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1855.8000000000002s)]
*  He's got somebody who he's fighting with, who he needs to press. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1856.96s)]
*  Yeah. And so the first motherfucker. Yeah. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1860.88s)]
*  You know, or he's just a dick. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1864.88s)]
*  He's just an asshole. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1867.4s)]
*  Could be just a dick. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1868.3200000000002s)]
*  I can't get my head around that, that there's a I always think it's something [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1869.3200000000002s)]
*  that's bothering him. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1873.68s)]
*  I can't get my head around somebody who's just like. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1875.24s)]
*  Well, some people think you have to be that way to get ahead. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1878.76s)]
*  You have to be a dick to get ahead. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1881.64s)]
*  Like there's there's people that have that mentality. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1883.16s)]
*  Right. And there's people that feel comfortable if they can do that. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1885.56s)]
*  Yeah. They just comfortable if they can have whatever they want. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1888.92s)]
*  So if you challenge it, they go they find they have their logic. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1892.4s)]
*  Usually it's just fuck you. Yeah. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1895.6s)]
*  I mean, he tried one argument and his second argument. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1897.32s)]
*  Yeah. Was fuck you. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1899.92s)]
*  And some dudes like to just take up that kind of space, you know? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1902.8s)]
*  Yeah. Just like this is all mine. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1906.92s)]
*  And fuck off. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1910.04s)]
*  And I'm not if I do one thing for somebody else, it's going to start chintzing in. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1911.28s)]
*  So I'm not doing that. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1915.04s)]
*  So that's just how they live. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1916.76s)]
*  Some women do it, too. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1917.8400000000001s)]
*  But it's a different version of it. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1919.0800000000002s)]
*  And now, you know, there's like the but the people that like this is all [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1921.04s)]
*  I was on a subway in New York once and it was packed and everyone's, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1925.68s)]
*  you know, people like this, you're smushed against people, you know, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1930.48s)]
*  your chest is against somebody's back and we're all strapped hanging. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1934.1200000000001s)]
*  And some people are sitting and this woman had a salad [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1937.88s)]
*  and she was eating it on the packed subway. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1941.2800000000002s)]
*  And she was like she had she had it out like this. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1944.24s)]
*  And she's just stabbing that. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1947.7600000000002s)]
*  And she's just taking up all this space so she can eat her fucking chicken salad. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1949.5200000000002s)]
*  And all of us were just watching her. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1954.2800000000002s)]
*  Every person was just like, Cunt, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1957.7600000000002s)]
*  fucking stupid, like like black nurses [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1960.4s)]
*  that have been working 14 hours, just like bitch. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1963.64s)]
*  Fucking bitch. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1967.04s)]
*  Anyway, I mean, for her, it's probably the only time she has to eat [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1967.9199999999998s)]
*  the girl we had salad, I guess. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1971.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, she probably had some reason. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1973.1599999999999s)]
*  I mean, she didn't look she looked comfortable. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1974.76s)]
*  Kind of a prison thing to like, maybe your arm around your food and eat like this. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1976.48s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1980.8s)]
*  Have you ever had been scared somebody's going to eat your food? [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1983.1599999999999s)]
*  Maybe in high school. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1987.1999999999998s)]
*  Maybe. Yeah, maybe not really. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1989.1599999999999s)]
*  New South. Yeah, maybe some rough some dickhead. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1991.6s)]
*  It wasn't very rough. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1997.08s)]
*  Wasn't very rough. I mean, I'm thinking maybe I don't have a thought. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=1998.72s)]
*  A memory. I remember the first conversation we had. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2002.4399999999998s)]
*  I guess I was like 20. Ever. Really? Yeah. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2006.36s)]
*  How will you think is this reminds me of it? [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2010.84s)]
*  Because it was about Newton South. OK. Cafeteria. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2012.4399999999998s)]
*  I'm 55, 55 to I'm 55. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2016.84s)]
*  OK, so we must have both been around 20. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2019.76s)]
*  When you started comedy, you were 21. Yeah. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2021.76s)]
*  All right. So I must have been the same age. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2024.0s)]
*  But we talked about because I find out you were a taekwondo guy or something. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2026.0s)]
*  Is that what you'd fight? Yeah. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2030.92s)]
*  And I asked you about fights like I said, do you have skills for fighting in real life? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2033.24s)]
*  And you said, well, it's just some things, you know, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2038.0s)]
*  that are put, you know, that put you way at advantage with people that aren't fighters. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2041.0s)]
*  Like, you don't wait for the fight to start. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2045.48s)]
*  You told me like you told me you were in a cafeteria once in South and some [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2047.6s)]
*  some kid came up and, you know, people think they're going to get to do a preamble. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2052.2000000000003s)]
*  They think that there's going to be a whole hey, fuck you. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2056.2000000000003s)]
*  And now they think there's going to be like, yeah. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2058.52s)]
*  And as soon as you knew he was there to threaten you, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2061.36s)]
*  you just punched him in the sternum and he just went down. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2065.1200000000003s)]
*  He's like, hey, man, you. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2069.2400000000002s)]
*  Oh, and then he just anyway. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2070.88s)]
*  So that was the first time you would explain that to me. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2074.04s)]
*  Yeah, that could have been avoided. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2076.5600000000004s)]
*  I thought about that one for a lot after. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2078.36s)]
*  Yeah. You think you jumped the gun? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2081.6800000000003s)]
*  Sometimes you jump the gun because like there with great power comes great responsibility. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2084.52s)]
*  You know, the guy, he had no chance. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2090.8s)]
*  He was just bowing up. Right. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2093.2400000000002s)]
*  He was just a knucklehead. Yeah. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2095.1600000000003s)]
*  I should probably let him slide. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2096.6400000000003s)]
*  That's funny. Yeah, I think that's how you've changed, too, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2100.32s)]
*  because you were really wired that you're tightly wired. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2103.4s)]
*  Well, we're talking then about like me being 15 or 16. That's right. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2106.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And a trained fighter at a young age. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2109.84s)]
*  So it's also like you have this thing you want to try out. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2114.0s)]
*  So you got a fast car. You want to hit the gas. Yeah, of course. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2116.08s)]
*  Let's let's see what happens. Of course. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2118.96s)]
*  This guy. Yeah. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2121.1200000000003s)]
*  Because people, you know, in high school, you're kind of trying out [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2122.36s)]
*  bowing up on people. Right. You know. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2125.36s)]
*  It's a pretty, pretty nuanced thing to ask a kid that age to know, [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2129.1200000000003s)]
*  like how to back how to back off. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2133.56s)]
*  I don't need I don't need to fight you. Yeah. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2135.4s)]
*  No, it's hard. It's hard for kids. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2137.76s)]
*  I just watched this horrible brawl today [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2139.36s)]
*  that someone had put up on Twitter in a high school. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2142.1600000000003s)]
*  It was terrible. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2145.08s)]
*  We're like all these kids were fighting in the hallway [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2146.32s)]
*  and teachers are trying to separate it. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2148.96s)]
*  And this one kid threw this kid to the ground and punched him unconscious. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2150.44s)]
*  And the kid went into a seizure and like, oh, God. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2153.52s)]
*  This is awful. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2157.2400000000002s)]
*  And a lot of it is people that just don't know how to fight. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2158.44s)]
*  And they don't know how to defend themselves. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2161.08s)]
*  And then they're fucking flailing wildly at each other. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2162.6s)]
*  And this one guy knew something and he threw this guy to the ground [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2165.04s)]
*  and punched him out. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2168.04s)]
*  Fucking school so dangerous. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2170.68s)]
*  It's so dangerous because kids are just starting to get testosterone. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2172.72s)]
*  They're just starting to become like strong and like almost a man. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2175.6s)]
*  And I'm out of lopsided. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2180.04s)]
*  Yeah. Other kids who didn't it just didn't kick in. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2181.52s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2183.8s)]
*  Well, these kids were it was all there was none of that. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2185.44s)]
*  They were similar sized, but it was just awful. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2187.7599999999998s)]
*  This is awful. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2190.32s)]
*  There's also weird energy in school for kids that age. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2191.44s)]
*  That's it's intricate. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2195.36s)]
*  Like I remember I saw a lot in my high school fights that were between friends [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2197.64s)]
*  because there's always somebody who wants people to fight. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2202.3599999999997s)]
*  There's always somebody who doesn't fight, but wants a fight to happen. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2205.7599999999998s)]
*  Everybody wants to see it. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2209.64s)]
*  So you take a kid who's trying to get some kind of status with a certain group [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2211.56s)]
*  and they go, why are you friends with that guy? [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2216.92s)]
*  You know, like that guy's a pussy and they actually turn them on. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2219.0s)]
*  They want to see if they can make a kid fight a friend of his. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2222.92s)]
*  I saw that so many times. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2227.08s)]
*  And I saw a lot of kids that were tough and but had a head, you know, smart kids [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2229.0s)]
*  who were I remember this one kid. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2234.28s)]
*  His name was Chris and his friend Doug was pushed into like he's going to kick your ass. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2236.08s)]
*  And Chris could have beat Doug, but he just started crying [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2240.68s)]
*  because it was too much. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2245.8s)]
*  Yeah, pressure. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2249.04s)]
*  And he didn't want to fight his friend and he could hurt his friend real bad. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2250.16s)]
*  And he's isolated. Everybody's around him. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2254.28s)]
*  He's like now the kid, the fag, you know, and he just started crying. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2256.2s)]
*  And then everybody starts laughing at him because he's crying. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2261.68s)]
*  Now he's mad and he just beat Doug's face to red. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2264.96s)]
*  It's just like he painted his face red. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2269.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2272.52s)]
*  One of the most humiliating fights I ever got into was [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2273.9199999999996s)]
*  there's never even a punch thrown. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2277.2s)]
*  It was me. I was 14. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2279.04s)]
*  And there's this kid in the locker room. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2280.52s)]
*  And I don't remember what words were said, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2282.48s)]
*  but we're standing in front of each other. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2284.6800000000003s)]
*  And this is before I even was really into martial arts. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2287.2400000000002s)]
*  This is one of the reasons I got into it. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2290.12s)]
*  This kid grabbed me in a headlock, threw me on the ground [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2291.84s)]
*  and was going to punch me in the face, but then stopped and decided not to. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2294.44s)]
*  So I was going to let you up. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2299.12s)]
*  And I was like, oh, no. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2300.92s)]
*  So humiliating. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2303.28s)]
*  It would have been better if he hit you because then you look a little bit tough [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2305.8s)]
*  for taking the punch. Well, at least I mean, he was so unconcerned [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2308.12s)]
*  that I could do something to him that he just let me up. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2313.32s)]
*  And then I like would avoid him, like in school, like if I would like [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2315.2s)]
*  look down the hallway and like I would open up the door to the outside [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2318.96s)]
*  breezeway and I saw him on the other side of my car. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2322.36s)]
*  I got to go around this way. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2324.4s)]
*  I got to keep away from that. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2325.84s)]
*  I was terrified of horrible, terrified of him. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2326.76s)]
*  There was a full year when I was a senior. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2329.12s)]
*  I never really gotten in fights. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2332.04s)]
*  I just didn't. It just didn't happen to me. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2334.4s)]
*  I was kind of bigger than a lot of kids my age. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2336.08s)]
*  So I guess that, you know, I just didn't. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2337.84s)]
*  And I didn't have a lot of conflicts with people. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2339.56s)]
*  So I never really got much into fights. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2342.2s)]
*  I just sort of slid through, you know, and then a senior year. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2343.68s)]
*  I don't know, my junior or whatever. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2348.12s)]
*  But I was high a lot and I was in the library and I was laughing. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2349.3199999999997s)]
*  I was making a lot of racket in the library. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2353.7599999999998s)]
*  I used to get yelled at all the time for being loud in the library. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2355.48s)]
*  And this kid who was a sophomore, little kid, who was like this on me, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2358.96s)]
*  were kind of skinny and wearing a leather jacket. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2364.88s)]
*  He goes, hey, shut the fuck up. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2368.3199999999997s)]
*  Because he was just annoyed. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2372.36s)]
*  And the worst part is he was right. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2375.24s)]
*  Like I knew in my head, I'm being annoying. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2377.16s)]
*  Yeah. But I said, fuck you. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2379.7599999999998s)]
*  Like, and I'm just like, it's status. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2381.92s)]
*  I'm a senior year, a sophomore. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2383.24s)]
*  Fuck you. Shut up. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2385.04s)]

*  I'll fucking kick the shit out. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2391.64s)]
*  He's smaller than me, but he's wiry. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2393.04s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm scared. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2395.72s)]
*  I was terrified because I don't want to fight this kid. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2397.92s)]
*  Even if I win, I'm not going to like go unscathed. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2401.12s)]
*  I don't want to get hurt. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2404.3199999999997s)]

*  this little kid. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2424.88s)]

*  I didn't know what to do. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2449.28s)]
*  I wasn't sure if I should hit her back. Yeah. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2450.32s)]

*  But he was just fucking intense and he's a really good wrestler. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2572.44s)]
*  Yeah, I lived in Newtonville, which was like right along the highway [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2575.56s)]
*  and right next to Nonantum, which was all those Irish and Italian kids. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2579.7999999999997s)]
*  And so that's who I went to junior high school with and mostly high school. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2583.92s)]
*  But there is a lot of really terrifying kids. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2587.48s)]
*  There's a lot of scary kids. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2591.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, blue collar communities like I was in Upper Falls. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2592.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. In Newton, Upper Falls, there was a lot of fucking a lot of drinking. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2595.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2599.44s)]
*  Everybody would hang out by Echo Bridge. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2600.08s)]
*  Right. Echo Bridge. Yeah, sure. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2602.04s)]
*  That's where my house was. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2603.16s)]
*  My house was right next to Echo Bridge. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2604.44s)]
*  Yeah. Newton had a lot of like Cabot. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2605.84s)]
*  I went to Cabot School Elementary School and Cabot Park was a hang. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2607.8s)]
*  And to cross Cabot Park, sometimes you'd get these guys [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2612.04s)]
*  that would just converge on you and they would play games with you. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2615.68s)]
*  And you didn't know what was going on. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2620.16s)]
*  Hey, kid, come here. Come in. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2622.56s)]
*  And then all of a sudden you're in the middle of the park and you're like, fuck. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2623.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. I remember once as kids, he said he had a hundred dollar bill for some reason. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2626.52s)]
*  And he said, we're going to play this game. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2631.2400000000002s)]
*  They're all surrounding me. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2632.8s)]
*  And he puts the hundred dollar bill on my on my hand. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2634.0800000000004s)]
*  And he gives me a cigarette and he says, if you can burn a hole [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2637.4s)]
*  in his head all the way through, I'll give you the hundred dollar bill. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2640.6800000000003s)]
*  And I was like, I don't want to do it. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2644.4s)]
*  No, not try it. Try it. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2646.6800000000003s)]
*  And I was trying to do it and it hurt like fuck. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2649.32s)]
*  And I don't remember how that ended. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2653.44s)]
*  Like, I just remember that terrifying and they're all staring at me. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2654.8s)]
*  And one time some kids had a cup of puke. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2658.0s)]
*  It was like a coffee cup with puke. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2660.8s)]
*  And he said, can you drink this whole thing? [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2664.04s)]
*  If you drink this whole thing, we'll give you a beer. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2665.84s)]
*  That was that thing. Oh, God. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2667.5600000000004s)]
*  And these guys can I'll give you a beer. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2670.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. These guys just scared me. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2671.84s)]
*  And then when I grew up, I hung out with those kids and smoked cigarettes. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2674.2400000000002s)]
*  That's where I learned to smoke cigarettes in that park. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2677.6000000000004s)]
*  And I drank my first beer in that park. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2679.2000000000003s)]
*  But there was kids, there was a kid named Mike who was the toughest kid in Newton. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2682.32s)]
*  He was just a fucking terrifying person. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2687.0800000000004s)]
*  And there was one point where the kid named David Russell, [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2690.5600000000004s)]
*  he was his family lived in Boston. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2695.76s)]
*  I don't know if you guys had met co kids, the kids that were bused [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2698.6000000000004s)]
*  from Boston into our schools, black kids from all black kids from Boston [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2701.36s)]
*  who were bused into our school system. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2705.6800000000003s)]
*  It wasn't part of that bus bossing Boston thing. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2707.6400000000003s)]
*  It was out to the suburbs. Right. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2710.8s)]
*  And these were kids that got up at four o'clock in the morning to go to school. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2712.5600000000004s)]
*  You know, they're living a particular life and coming out to this suburb. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2715.1200000000003s)]
*  And some of them were my friends. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2718.32s)]
*  One of them was Ronnie Devo of Belle Biv Devo. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2719.48s)]
*  No shit. Yeah, I went to high school with him. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2722.2400000000002s)]
*  Wow. And I knew him since like junior high school through high school. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2723.8s)]
*  He's a nice kid. And when he was in what he first edition or new edition, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2727.16s)]
*  they used to come get him in a limousine. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2732.68s)]
*  And people would say, shout racist shit at the Bobby Brown. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2735.52s)]
*  All these guys would be in the scene in high school. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2739.68s)]
*  It was so racist. It was so crazy. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2742.4s)]
*  Yes. Whoa. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2744.64s)]
*  So David Russell was a medco kid and his family's house burnt down [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2745.48s)]
*  in Boston and a family in Newton, actually friends of mine. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2750.96s)]
*  They had a rental unit and they let the Russells live there. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2755.48s)]
*  So it was like there's a black family living in Newtonville. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2758.84s)]
*  It's a big deal. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2761.56s)]
*  And everyone was into because it was all liberal teachers. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2762.88s)]
*  Everybody was into like, we're hosting this family because they lost their home. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2766.32s)]
*  So all of a sudden, David Russell's living in Newton. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2770.36s)]
*  He's not just going to school there. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2772.32s)]
*  And one day, Mike and his group [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2773.72s)]
*  confront David Russell at the park and they go, hey, listen, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2778.68s)]
*  we were really happy you're here. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2781.24s)]
*  We want to show you this bench right here. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2783.2s)]
*  This is your bench. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2784.9199999999996s)]
*  And they had literally painted it black. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2786.0s)]
*  And they painted one of the swings black. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2789.6s)]
*  They said, this is the Russell swing. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2792.52s)]
*  This is the Russell bench. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2794.3199999999997s)]
*  You can use it many times you want. Whoa. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2795.52s)]
*  And I remember I heard that story and I went to the park that day. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2798.6s)]
*  And it was a black bench and a black swing. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2801.56s)]
*  And they were there. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2804.16s)]
*  I mean, I remember I went back when I was in my 20s and it was still a little [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2804.84s)]
*  kind of black. Yeah. Wow. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2808.36s)]
*  Yeah. The new Massachusetts. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2810.88s)]
*  It's crazy. Kids were latchkey kids back then. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2813.0s)]
*  Yeah. Those days you just like, oh, your parents are work. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2816.0s)]
*  They let you out. There's no parents. Yeah. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2819.16s)]
*  They come home. My mom would come. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2821.4s)]
*  I was raised by a single mom. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2822.84s)]
*  She had four kids and worked. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2824.68s)]
*  So she'd come home at seven thirty eight o'clock rush hour traffic. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2826.68s)]
*  Just exhausted. Yeah. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2830.5600000000004s)]
*  And but I'd come home, make my own lunch and often dinner. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2832.28s)]
*  Yep. Yeah. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2835.36s)]
*  Sometimes I'd make something for my mom, you know. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2836.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2838.84s)]
*  Home alone all day, all day. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2840.48s)]
*  Yeah. Out on the streets, out on the streets. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2842.48s)]
*  Nobody knew where you were. There was no cell phones. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2844.6000000000004s)]
*  You just wandered around. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2847.2400000000002s)]
*  Yep. And just hope you didn't die. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2848.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Because every now and then someone would die. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2851.32s)]
*  So yeah, kids would drive driving accident or something. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2854.4s)]
*  Every I think every year in my [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2857.52s)]
*  in my high school, there would be a page in the yearbook for the kid [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2860.7999999999997s)]
*  that got killed in the driving. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2864.2s)]
*  Something. There was always something like that. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2865.9199999999996s)]
*  My friend's sister, my best friend, Ian, his sister, Claire, [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2867.9199999999996s)]
*  was in a drunk driving accident where somebody died and half her face [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2871.12s)]
*  was paralyzed still today. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2874.64s)]
*  She is just. Yeah. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2876.12s)]
*  It was a fucked up, fucked up time. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2878.24s)]
*  Well, it's just those. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2880.3999999999996s)]
*  I mean, getting through that, though, is like a very unusual education. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2882.6s)]
*  And human beings and development and like why people do the things they do [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2887.08s)]
*  and why they say the things they do and why they're trying out [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2892.08s)]
*  different kinds of behaviors and, you know, and bullies. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2894.68s)]
*  And people are pacifists and people get bullied and you see it ruin their lives. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2898.68s)]
*  And, you know, it can ruin your fucking life, man. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2902.88s)]
*  I really feel for people who get bullied, because if you get bullied in high school [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2906.2s)]
*  and you just decide that's who I am, I'm just this fucking loser. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2910.92s)]
*  I'm just going to hide. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2913.88s)]
*  And then you hide in your apartment and you hide in your house [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2915.0s)]
*  and you hide at your job. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2917.2400000000002s)]
*  And then like your life is hiding now because somebody fucked with you. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2918.28s)]
*  And somebody. Well, so you were very badly hurt [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2922.04s)]
*  when you were extremely vulnerable. Exactly. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2924.64s)]
*  And you're probably hurt because you already were vulnerable. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2927.0s)]
*  You are already were right. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2929.96s)]
*  Unsure of yourself for a million different reasons. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2932.56s)]
*  Yeah. And so you never really recover from that. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2935.68s)]
*  I don't think it's so it's part. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2938.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, it doesn't mean it destroys your life, but it's in your life. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2940.2400000000002s)]
*  All the things it's all the things that happen to you that are horrible, [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2944.64s)]
*  like unbelievable, they just stay with you. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2948.36s)]
*  They just become part of you. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2950.84s)]
*  You don't swap it out. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2952.24s)]
*  You don't you don't clean it out. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2953.8s)]
*  You don't go away. It just stays in you. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2956.32s)]
*  You can get over it. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2957.88s)]
*  You can get over it. You can integrate it. Yeah. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2959.24s)]
*  It can help you understand what's happening to other people. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2962.36s)]
*  It can help you even understand people that hurt people. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2966.2s)]
*  Yeah. Like when you get really hurt by people, you have two choices. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2969.2799999999997s)]
*  You can decide to collapse under it and say, I'm too weak to live in this world. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2973.32s)]
*  Or you can decide to hate them, which is another very corrosive thing. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2977.48s)]
*  You can just decide that they are shit. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2981.6800000000003s)]
*  They're not human. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2983.6800000000003s)]
*  Or you can look at them and go, what the fight this person do this to me. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2985.8s)]
*  They've always been abused. Yeah. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2989.44s)]
*  And then you go, OK. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2990.84s)]
*  And then you get an insight that no people don't get without that kind of experience. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2992.52s)]
*  And and then you have a self reliance because you go, I got through it. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=2997.32s)]
*  I did it. I got through it. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3001.4s)]
*  I think every extreme experience, bad and good is food. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3004.1200000000003s)]
*  You know, it's good. It has it is the potential for a learning experience. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3008.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Potential. Yeah. It's up to you. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3011.48s)]
*  It's totally turn it into. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3013.4s)]
*  Yeah. Like all those stories about like me being bullied and thrown around. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3015.44s)]
*  Like that's what led me to get into martial arts. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3019.7200000000003s)]
*  If it wasn't for that, I probably never would have done it. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3023.56s)]
*  And I never would have been the person that I am. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3025.8s)]
*  Sure. But all that came out of bad feelings, like terrible. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3027.6000000000004s)]
*  I feel like just moving to town. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3031.8s)]
*  So I was 14. I just moved there. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3033.5600000000004s)]
*  I lived in Jamaica Plain before that, and then we moved. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3036.88s)]
*  Oh, I didn't know that. Yeah. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3039.32s)]
*  Well, how old were you when you moved from there? [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3040.5600000000004s)]
*  We were I lived in Jamaica Plain for, [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3042.6400000000003s)]
*  I guess, a year and a half or so. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3046.1200000000003s)]
*  My parents were like, this is way too dangerous. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3047.92s)]
*  We got to get out of there. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3049.6800000000003s)]
*  Still. Yeah. It was sketchy. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3050.76s)]
*  Well, now I think Jamaica Plain is gentrified now. Oh, yeah. OK. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3053.0800000000004s)]
*  But when I was there, it was not when I was in. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3056.7200000000003s)]
*  I guess it was eighth grade, seventh or eighth grade. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3061.64s)]
*  There was a boy who was in our class who was 17 years old. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3064.52s)]
*  I was like, what the fuck is he doing in class? [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3069.08s)]
*  And what grade were you? Seventh grade. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3071.08s)]
*  Oh, wow. That's crazy. It was crazy. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3073.16s)]
*  Yeah. He had he just kept falling out of school. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3075.44s)]
*  And he was in there and he started off at the beginning like, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3078.96s)]
*  I'm just going to fucking do it this time. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3082.64s)]
*  And I remember being in class like I was like a little kid. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3084.52s)]
*  He was like an adult. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3087.3199999999997s)]
*  So I was like, this is crazy. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3088.48s)]
*  And he fell off. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3089.96s)]
*  It just he was in class for a couple of days and then he stopped. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3092.0s)]
*  And I realized, like, oh, this poor guy, like, he's never going to catch up. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3094.88s)]
*  Like, he's fucked because now he feels like a loser [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3098.0s)]
*  and he feels like he's so far behind. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3100.6s)]
*  He can't even do it anymore. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3102.2400000000002s)]
*  And so he just dropped out. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3103.32s)]
*  But it was that kind of a neighborhood. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3104.7200000000003s)]
*  It was there was a lot of criminals in my neighborhood. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3106.48s)]
*  I mean, the other thing is that school makes people feel really shitty in some ways. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3109.52s)]
*  I always felt like a loser in school. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3113.36s)]
*  Me too. I was always in trouble. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3116.6800000000003s)]
*  I was never I mean, I remember when I was in kindergarten, I was in in first grade. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3118.68s)]
*  I was in Mexico City. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3124.08s)]
*  That's where I lived when I was little. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3125.0s)]
*  And I have this one. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3127.08s)]
*  I don't remember much about that time, but I remember this one day we had desks [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3128.7599999999998s)]
*  with all work in a desk and folded down and all your papers were in there. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3132.4s)]
*  And you had to keep it organized and keep handing stuff in. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3137.2799999999997s)]
*  But I could never finish anything. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3140.2s)]
*  So my desk was always like I couldn't close it. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3142.0s)]
*  And I hated this feeling in the teachers, [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3144.88s)]
*  fucking angry Mexican teachers would scream at me. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3146.7999999999997s)]
*  And one day the teacher left us in the room alone, me and some kids for some reason. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3151.2s)]
*  And I took all the papers and I threw them out the window. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3155.96s)]
*  I opened the window and I threw all my papers out the window. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3158.24s)]
*  And the kids were like, what? [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3161.96s)]
*  And they started screaming and everybody started throwing papers out the window. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3164.88s)]
*  It was like, oh, my God, Attica, just nuts. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3168.44s)]
*  And then there was this pounding at the door and the teacher. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3171.2s)]
*  And I knew I'm in so much trouble right now. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3174.16s)]
*  Like I'm in beyond trouble. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3176.8399999999997s)]
*  But it felt so good. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3179.24s)]
*  It just felt so good to be like in this outside of the box. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3180.64s)]
*  Yeah. You're not supposed to do that at all. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3185.92s)]
*  But it felt free. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3188.92s)]
*  I felt like some kind of adult or something, you know. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3189.8799999999997s)]
*  Isn't it funny those moments of rebellion, like early on, that really sit with you? [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3192.3999999999996s)]
*  Like it felt so good. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3196.72s)]
*  It like it plants seeds for further rebellion in the future. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3197.92s)]
*  Well, once you get that feeling, you don't. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3200.96s)]
*  You want it again and again, you know, because it takes you out of everything. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3203.96s)]
*  It's like, yeah, I may never get out of this class. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3208.16s)]
*  I may never finish any of these. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3210.44s)]
*  I might not graduate. I might, you know. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3212.56s)]
*  Yeah. But I'm right now. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3214.92s)]
*  I'm throwing all this shit out. I'm alive. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3217.92s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3219.68s)]
*  It feels good for right now. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3221.64s)]
*  And it's hard to reconcile that. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3223.6s)]
*  I think that's a little bit of a comedian's upbringing. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3225.28s)]
*  And then you have to start being, you know, you have kids and it all goes away. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3229.44s)]
*  You have kids and you grow right at whatever is left. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3233.12s)]
*  I think when you have kids, I mean, not for everybody, there's some real [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3236.08s)]
*  douchebag parents, but for the most part, I think once the kids come, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3238.7599999999998s)]
*  you know, it's not about you anymore. Right. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3243.7599999999998s)]
*  About them. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3246.16s)]
*  And it's all it's it's bizarre watching them go through it. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3246.96s)]
*  They're going through like trying to find their identity and trying to find [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3250.7999999999997s)]
*  their friends group and little disputes that they have in their friends group. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3254.08s)]
*  Yeah. Like one of my daughters has this one little daughter, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3258.08s)]
*  one little friend, rather, who's I want to say she's evil, [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3261.8799999999997s)]
*  but something's wrong. Something's wrong. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3265.9199999999996s)]
*  She's just like always like very mean to the other girls. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3268.4399999999996s)]
*  Yeah. Very insulting. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3271.72s)]
*  And for whatever reason, this girl just has like this fire inside of her. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3273.8799999999997s)]
*  And all the other 12 year olds are starting to figure it out now. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3279.3999999999996s)]
*  So they're starting to separate from her. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3283.0s)]
*  Like they gave her a few chances. Right. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3284.72s)]
*  And so now the mom is contacting the other moms like, what's wrong? [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3286.7599999999998s)]
*  She's such a sweet girl. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3290.36s)]
*  Like your daughter's kind of a cunt. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3291.6s)]
*  And it's like it's weird. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3293.28s)]
*  And then, you know, me and my wife are having this conversation. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3295.96s)]
*  I'm like, do you think it's the mom? [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3298.08s)]
*  Like, where's this coming from? [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3299.44s)]
*  Do you think it's the family? [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3301.52s)]
*  Like, how does a daughter get to be so insulting and shitty? [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3302.6800000000003s)]
*  You got to learn that you can't just be like the sweetest, [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3306.32s)]
*  kindest person in the world and have this fucking hyper aggressive. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3309.6800000000003s)]
*  No, something's going on. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3313.36s)]
*  I mean, there's people like I remember there was a kid when I grew up [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3314.84s)]
*  and he was a mess and he was huge. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3318.8799999999997s)]
*  He just got really huge in third grade. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3321.96s)]
*  He was a formidable. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3324.52s)]
*  He was bigger than all of us. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3325.56s)]
*  And he was a really bright kid. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3327.2799999999997s)]
*  And he was funny and interesting, but he had this crazy temper [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3330.2799999999997s)]
*  and he would throw these tantrums in the middle of class. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3334.48s)]
*  Like something would piss him off and he'd start screaming [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3337.3999999999996s)]
*  and throwing shit and he'd get violent. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3340.44s)]
*  And the teacher would go to the back. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3342.64s)]
*  Then there was like a box on the side of the classroom wall. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3344.48s)]
*  With a clock and a speaker and a button, like a microphone, like to call the office. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3348.24s)]
*  And they'd call the office and say, get Mr. Shanahan. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3353.08s)]
*  He was our one teacher who was big enough to handle this kid. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3356.08s)]
*  And he would come and just subdue him. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3359.7599999999998s)]
*  He'd wrap his arms around this kid and the kid's face would be purple. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3361.68s)]
*  And Mr. Shanahan would just subdue him until he ran out. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3365.2799999999997s)]
*  He would just collapse. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3368.3199999999997s)]
*  And we would all sit there and watch this. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3369.7999999999997s)]
*  And then he'd be taken out of the classroom. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3372.12s)]
*  And then we'd all talk about him. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3374.52s)]
*  But like, you know, the teacher would say, let's talk about it. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3377.2s)]
*  Yeah. Let's like, oh, that's what do you think is going on with John? [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3379.68s)]
*  And how do we handle this? Oh, that's cool. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3382.72s)]
*  He's in our communities, in our class. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3384.68s)]
*  Oh, that's a great teacher. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3387.04s)]
*  He was great. Mr. Weisberg, great teacher. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3388.3599999999997s)]
*  And then I was always in John's class, fourth grade, fifth grade and fifth grade. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3390.64s)]
*  We had a trip to Cape Cod. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3395.44s)]
*  The whole fifth grade class goes in cars in a caravan, [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3397.2799999999997s)]
*  you know, to Cape Cod. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3401.6s)]
*  And you live in tents and you visit the Cranberry Bogs, [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3403.48s)]
*  whatever the fuck you do in Cape Cod. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3406.88s)]
*  And it's a very social thing, you know, so somebody's mom is driving. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3408.7200000000003s)]
*  So they're like, you know, will you come in my car? [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3412.4s)]
*  You know, that was the cool thing. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3414.92s)]
*  And I got invited to be in Jeff Drew's car. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3416.48s)]
*  And I was like, this is going to be I love Jeff Drew. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3418.6s)]
*  It's going to be me and him and Mike McDougal. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3421.08s)]
*  We're going to have a great time. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3423.6s)]
*  But the teacher pulled me aside and he said, listen, [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3425.2000000000003s)]
*  John, the fucked up kid, he goes, his parents have offered to drive [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3429.1600000000003s)]
*  and nobody wants to drive with him. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3432.6400000000003s)]
*  And I'm asking you to do it. Oh, boy. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3436.12s)]
*  And I was like, I don't want to do that. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3438.96s)]
*  And he said, you're I'm asking you because I think you're a nice person [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3441.56s)]
*  and you're the one person I can think of that I could ask. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3445.3199999999997s)]
*  Could you make this sacrifice and let him not feel so isolated? [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3447.7999999999997s)]
*  And I was like, fuck. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3453.16s)]
*  And I was that made me feel good that he wanted me to do it. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3454.24s)]
*  And I did it. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3458.72s)]
*  And I got to know him and he was a really cool kid. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3459.8399999999997s)]
*  And his parents were both professors. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3463.28s)]
*  Really, really bright people. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3466.2400000000002s)]
*  His father had killed himself. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3468.2000000000003s)]
*  But his stepfather and his mother were professors. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3470.7200000000003s)]
*  Really intelligent people. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3473.48s)]
*  That's probably where it came from. I think so. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3475.0400000000004s)]
*  It was really hard. His life was really hard. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3476.88s)]
*  And then I knew him for years after that. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3479.92s)]
*  We were kind of we were friends, but he would always explode all the way [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3481.8s)]
*  until, you know, 17 or so. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3484.7200000000003s)]
*  The last time I saw him, he was like 16, I think. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3487.32s)]
*  And he was still he. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3490.4s)]
*  We were talking outside of a Brigham's ice cream in Newton Center. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3492.0s)]
*  And he was leaning on the glass of the window. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3495.32s)]
*  And this guy came outside and said, don't lean on the glass. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3499.12s)]
*  And so he kicked it and shattered the whole [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3502.08s)]
*  the whole window. And I walked away. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3505.44s)]
*  I'm like, I don't want I don't ever want to see this kid again. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3507.16s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. But anyway, just to say that, yeah, [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3508.88s)]
*  the point of it is I tried to stay friends with that kid. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3513.4s)]
*  When there is a kid who's really fucked up and has a wire loose, [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3516.04s)]
*  someone's got to be their friend. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3521.6s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think, you know, it's like I've had girlfriends [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3523.2400000000002s)]

*  I mean, if everybody walks away from her, she's nuts. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3531.6s)]
*  She's going to be alone. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3536.6400000000003s)]
*  That was always the case with Brian Callan, with Brian Callan, me [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3537.6800000000003s)]

*  Ruining folks. Yes. And that's what he did. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3703.88s)]
*  He's just yeah, he started believing he really but he wasn't lying. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3706.0400000000004s)]
*  He just was wrong. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3711.0400000000004s)]
*  He really believed that the government had faked it to try to confiscate [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3712.36s)]
*  people's weapons like he's just. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3716.48s)]
*  Well, I mean, it was a haze of drugs and booze and a psychotic break [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3718.44s)]
*  and like legitimate traumatic brain injury. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3725.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. There's a lot going on there. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3728.88s)]
*  Well, you know, pretending that he wasn't the way to start this conversation. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3730.96s)]
*  I remember when that happened. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3735.2000000000003s)]
*  Sandy Hook. That was Sandy Hook. Right. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3736.96s)]
*  And and I remember that the media went up there right away. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3738.6s)]
*  Yeah. I remember it made me really sick [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3742.8s)]
*  because there's such a horrible thing that happened. Yeah. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3744.92s)]
*  And what everybody should have done is just let the chief of police talk to you [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3747.36s)]
*  and let him say, we don't know these things yet. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3751.92s)]
*  Just wait. Just wait for information to come out of this very painful place. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3754.2400000000002s)]
*  But the media flew in, of course, and they're on the fucking grounds of the school. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3758.52s)]
*  And Anderson Cooper is talking to fucking kids who were there. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3762.96s)]
*  And their parents have their hands on the kids shoulders. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3767.52s)]
*  And you can see in both the kids face and the parents face [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3769.6400000000003s)]
*  that they're not sure they should be doing this. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3772.04s)]
*  They don't know. They don't. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3773.84s)]
*  We take for granted this thing of being exposed to the media [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3775.16s)]
*  and being talking on cameras. Right. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3778.56s)]
*  And there's been things, of course, in your life and my life [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3781.04s)]
*  where you say something or have an experience. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3783.56s)]
*  And then afterwards you go, fuck, that was I wish I hadn't said that. Right. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3785.48s)]
*  Or I didn't know how this would feel is the thing. Right. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3789.24s)]
*  So somebody who is not even in public life and who just suffered it [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3792.72s)]
*  on off the charts, trauma and Anderson Cooper and his producers going, [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3796.04s)]
*  no, you should talk to talking them into it, saying [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3800.92s)]
*  you should talk to the world right now. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3803.92s)]
*  You should be on the news talking about it now. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3806.6s)]
*  We don't want to wait till later. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3809.96s)]
*  We don't want to do an expose 10 years later. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3811.2000000000003s)]
*  What was it like? Or even a year. We want to know right now. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3813.0s)]
*  So why does it have to be now? [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3815.48s)]
*  Why can't you just talk to the to the stoic chief of police? [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3817.28s)]
*  Who says here's why? Because you're fuck. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3820.56s)]
*  Because it's just dirty greed. It's just dirty. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3822.32s)]
*  I want it. It'll be great on camera. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3825.4s)]
*  I don't give a fuck what happens to this person when I leave Sandy Hook today. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3828.0s)]
*  I don't give a shit. I'll be back in my scene in studios. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3830.92s)]
*  I'm picking him because that's the face I remember. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3833.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. And the fact that they were there, it's just macabre and it's ghoulish. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3835.7599999999998s)]
*  And it's gross. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3840.84s)]
*  And it puts those people in a very vulnerable, [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3841.72s)]
*  fucked up position that they didn't anticipate. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3843.56s)]
*  They had no idea. And I'm talking out of school because I didn't experience [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3845.8s)]
*  what they experienced. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3848.52s)]
*  But as a person sitting and watching, I'm like, I'm being told too much. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3849.8s)]
*  I know too much about this too soon. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3853.84s)]
*  And that's not because I need to know where it's going to help [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3856.48s)]
*  fix what happened. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3860.04s)]
*  It's because somebody wanted it. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3862.04s)]
*  Because it drives ratings. That's it. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3864.36s)]
*  That's it. It's just money. Yeah. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3865.72s)]
*  So and there's been an extension of that throughout the history since then. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3867.56s)]
*  If every time something bad happens, [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3871.88s)]
*  nobody slows down and thinks about it. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3874.6s)]
*  Well, there's also a thing that happens where you get eyewitness accounts [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3878.16s)]
*  that are all fucked up. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3881.48s)]
*  And one of the reasons why eyewitness accounts that are fucked up is because [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3882.44s)]
*  when people experience a traumatic incident, their memory is very confused. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3885.6s)]
*  They're the whole you are working with a part of your brain [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3890.44s)]
*  that's like this reptilian part of your brain that's like completely freaked out [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3893.92s)]
*  that something horrible happened. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3898.2799999999997s)]
*  And that happened after 9 11. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3900.08s)]
*  Like after 9 11, everybody wanted to believe that this was some grand [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3902.24s)]
*  conspiracy because there was all these bizarre eyewitness accounts. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3905.56s)]
*  Oh, I heard a bomb go off. I heard this. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3909.7999999999997s)]
*  I heard that. Like these people don't know what they remember. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3911.6s)]
*  They don't know what they flabbergasted. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3913.64s)]
*  They don't know what the fuck happened. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3915.0s)]
*  They were so overwhelmed and blown away by the moment. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3916.52s)]
*  There just should be every time something awful happens, [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3920.68s)]
*  there should just be a blackout, like just a period where let's not talk to anybody. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3922.7599999999998s)]
*  Don't talk to the traumatized. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3926.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, going there and sticking a fucking microphone in their faces. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3928.32s)]
*  It's just so gross. And it's par for the course. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3930.7599999999998s)]
*  It's like how it's done. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3933.28s)]
*  And then they're reporting from the place. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3934.88s)]
*  And imagine what it's like being in that community. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3936.56s)]
*  And there's fucking a van with a satellite thing going here. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3939.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's obscene. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3944.64s)]
*  Yeah, it is obscene. It's obscene and it's normal. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3946.6s)]
*  Yeah. And that's what they operate under. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3949.08s)]
*  That's that's their currency. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3950.72s)]
*  I guess so. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3952.56s)]
*  They don't think they think about it anymore. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3953.88s)]
*  I don't think they think about it because there's a diffusion of responsibility [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3955.72s)]
*  when you work for a large corporation. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3958.7599999999998s)]
*  That's the job that has to get done. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3960.24s)]
*  Yeah. We got to go there. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3961.48s)]
*  I'm not my call. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3962.8s)]
*  It was my call. I'd stay in the studio. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3964.0s)]
*  I'm a good person. Right. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3965.72s)]
*  Yeah. I remember I was at Fox News once because I was shooting a sketch [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3967.4s)]
*  with Greg. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3972.68s)]
*  What's his name? He's Geraldo. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3975.4s)]
*  No, no, Greg. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3976.7599999999998s)]
*  The Fox News. He's got a funny talk show. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3977.92s)]
*  Gutfeld. Gutfeld. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3980.96s)]
*  He this was when he was just sort of he was didn't have the Gutfeld show. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3982.7599999999998s)]
*  I shot. Yeah, I think it was. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3987.04s)]
*  But they he let us shoot a thing where it was a sketch for my show. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3989.56s)]
*  It was like a scene for my show where I'm [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3992.88s)]
*  I'm debating with a woman who's against masturbation. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3996.96s)]
*  And I'm I'm the guy on pro masturbation. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=3999.96s)]
*  And he was the moderator. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4002.6s)]
*  And we had this like TV news thing. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4004.0s)]
*  It was a silly episode of my show. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4005.68s)]
*  And anyway, so I got to go to the studios to shoot it. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4007.52s)]
*  And Gutfeld was really cool. I like him. He's a good guy. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4011.56s)]
*  He's a nice guy. And so I sat in the they didn't have [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4013.44s)]
*  the place for us yet. And they let me I asked if I could go in a control room. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4018.04s)]
*  And they're like, OK. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4021.16s)]
*  And I sat in this control room because I love television. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4023.6s)]
*  I love being behind the scenes. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4026.04s)]
*  And the president was making a speech was Obama. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4028.6800000000003s)]
*  He's making a speech. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4032.0800000000004s)]
*  And I was in the live fucking in the room, the Fox News room, [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4033.2400000000002s)]
*  watching them do their thing. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4037.52s)]
*  And Bill O'Reilly is on this camera having his hair done. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4039.32s)]
*  And this guy's over here looking at, you know, a girl's got [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4042.84s)]
*  she's getting makeup. Everybody's getting ready. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4046.48s)]
*  The president is in the corner and the sound's off. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4048.7200000000003s)]
*  Nobody's listening to the president. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4051.84s)]
*  He's giving a speech and nobody's they're just going, Alex, what do you got, Alex? [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4053.6000000000004s)]

*  Everybody's cursing and trying to line up guests for interviews. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4058.6000000000004s)]
*  And just it was fascinating to watch. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4063.5200000000004s)]
*  And the second the president is done, they go out as whoever. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4065.5200000000004s)]
*  Not Alex Jones. What am I talking about? [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4070.2000000000003s)]
*  The guy who was the big Fox News guys back then, Bill O'Reilly, Bill O'Reilly. Yeah. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4071.6400000000003s)]
*  They go to Bill O'Reilly and he goes, well, this is just the president doing this. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4077.6800000000003s)]
*  He wasn't listening. Nobody listened to the speech. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4080.88s)]
*  They just go, this is just bullshit. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4083.0s)]
*  We don't believe it. And then this guy and this guy. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4085.16s)]
*  And I saw how fast and they were so urgent. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4087.36s)]
*  It was so urgent that they get in right away. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4090.2799999999997s)]
*  And I know that the same things happen in an MSNBC and CNN. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4093.16s)]
*  They're not thinking about anything. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4096.64s)]
*  They already know their reaction. Yeah. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4098.48s)]
*  And they got to come in with it really quick because because it's got to get in here [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4100.92s)]
*  before anything else. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4105.4s)]
*  It's got to, you know, so nobody listens to if there was like a thing [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4106.64s)]
*  where you need to take a day after his speech, you have to read it. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4111.36s)]
*  You have to watch it and discuss it with the staff and then make a decision, [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4114.4s)]
*  make a speech, you know, an opinion. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4118.599999999999s)]
*  The opinion would be like, he's got points and blah. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4122.12s)]
*  You know what I mean? It would definitely be. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4124.5599999999995s)]
*  And it would move the ball forward and it would get people to hear each other more. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4126.44s)]
*  But there's such a need because it's instantaneous. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4130.16s)]
*  Yeah. You have to be there right away with a rebuttal. Yeah. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4133.48s)]
*  Well, you know, what it is is like for its entertainment, [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4137.24s)]
*  disguised as news for minimally engaged, casual viewers. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4141.2s)]
*  Yeah, because it's not really people that are completely locked in for the most part. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4146.32s)]
*  No, most people are just flipping to the channels and something outrageous. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4150.24s)]
*  What I think he's doing is bad for America. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4154.24s)]
*  Bad for America. What is he doing? [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4156.4800000000005s)]
*  And then you'll tune in. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4159.4400000000005s)]
*  But if they don't say that, you're not going to pay attention. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4160.68s)]
*  And then they're going to lose out on those that Pfizer dollars. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4163.04s)]
*  It's going to go during the outbreak. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4165.4800000000005s)]
*  If you say what you really think, you would be like, [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4166.8s)]
*  well, you know, we'll see. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4170.44s)]
*  It should be fine in other ways. It won't be. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4172.36s)]
*  But nobody wants to watch that. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4174.44s)]
*  Well, because of the format, it's just a trick to get you to watch a commercial for Colgate. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4176.24s)]
*  It's just a trick. That's the old days. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4180.599999999999s)]
*  That's the old days. It is now, too. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4182.4s)]
*  Yeah. Like if they can't get you to stick around and wait for the commercials, [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4184.08s)]
*  they don't make any money. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4188.44s)]
*  Like the whole deal is they have to be engaging enough to get you locked in. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4189.4s)]
*  So you can see that Toyota truck commercial. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4193.919999999999s)]
*  And if they don't, they don't make the money. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4196.08s)]
*  No, that's the same with the little videos, too. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4197.839999999999s)]
*  Like have you ever seen back when there was police shooting videos, [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4199.6s)]
*  black people that were coming up a lot, they'd always some news organization would get it. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4202.84s)]
*  It would be theirs. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4207.6s)]
*  And you go on YouTube to watch it and there's an ad. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4208.96s)]
*  So it's like Snapple. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4211.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. The guy gets beat up and then Snapple again. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4212.56s)]
*  And then the end. Yeah. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4214.88s)]
*  And they make money off. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4216.84s)]
*  Snapple is like, yeah. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4217.76s)]
*  So strange. The news is so bizarre. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4221.04s)]
*  Yeah, we get what you're at. So bizarre. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4223.56s)]
*  We get what we want from it, though, because everybody likes to be entertained by news. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4225.280000000001s)]
*  So if there was it's like drug use, if there isn't the user, then the [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4229.6s)]
*  well, it's way less popular than it's ever been in human history. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4234.320000000001s)]
*  Like in the history of television news, the news, [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4239.0s)]
*  like the evening news and CNN, those things are less popular than they've ever been. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4242.6s)]
*  Ever. And it's because people are tired of it. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4248.360000000001s)]
*  It's a shitty format. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4251.280000000001s)]
*  And in comparison to long form discussions like independent [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4252.52s)]
*  interview shows like, you know, there's so many different political shows now [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4257.96s)]
*  and podcasts where people have nuanced perspectives. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4262.4s)]
*  And if you really want to understand what's going on in the world, like [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4265.4s)]
*  complicated issues like the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, like you need people to [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4268.28s)]
*  break it down to you and they're not going to get it in in five minutes. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4273.12s)]
*  No, you're not going to. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4276.44s)]
*  You're going to get they hate us for our freedom. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4277.36s)]
*  That's what you're going to get in five minutes. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4279.28s)]
*  You're going to get nonsense talking points. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4280.32s)]
*  Now, I remember when I grew up, like Walter Cronkite was still on the air somewhere. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4282.44s)]
*  I remember he was on CBS, I think. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4286.52s)]
*  I still the my earliest news memory. Yeah. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4288.76s)]
*  Was when Apollo and Soyuz, the two [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4292.400000000001s)]
*  the Russian and the American capsule docked in midspace. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4296.080000000001s)]
*  There was something where they were both up there once and they ran into each other [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4300.72s)]
*  and saw each other from the window and kind of got close and thought, [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4304.92s)]
*  hey, what if we could meet? [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4308.280000000001s)]
*  So they went back and they bashed into a dock. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4310.040000000001s)]
*  This is like in the early 70s or mid 70s. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4313.72s)]
*  And they went up and they and they docked and then they walked. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4316.88s)]
*  They they hung out and drank vodka. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4319.4800000000005s)]
*  Anyway, it was it was during the Cold War. It was a big deal. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4321.8s)]
*  And I remember Walter Cronkite. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4325.200000000001s)]
*  I think this is what I remember. I could be wrong. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4326.84s)]
*  But Walter Cronkite saying, if you live in the northeast of the United States, [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4329.64s)]
*  if you go outside tonight, if you look up, you'll see a red light [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4333.8s)]
*  and a white light blinking next to each other. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4336.88s)]
*  And that's and that's them in orbit. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4338.56s)]
*  And I went up and I fucking saw it and it just I mean, it blew my mind. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4341.84s)]
*  And the way he said it with a little bit of a smirk, like, isn't that cool? [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4346.12s)]
*  Because he was very stoic. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4349.360000000001s)]
*  But there was a thing back then where there was just him and David Brinkley. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4351.0s)]
*  It was a couple of news organizations and then like PBS. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4354.400000000001s)]
*  And you kind of got a sense that they were on it, [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4358.240000000001s)]
*  that they and also that it wasn't fun. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4361.88s)]
*  It was they had ethics that they took years of training [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4364.04s)]
*  in college and school to get through and and a system of a hierarchy [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4368.04s)]
*  of whatever internships and that by the time you were running the network news, [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4372.68s)]
*  you were you were a serious person that took it seriously. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4378.64s)]
*  Yeah. And I remember maybe in the mid 80s when I started [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4381.8s)]
*  to hear this sound from the news that I thought, what are you what are you doing? [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4385.72s)]
*  And then sometimes it sounded like this. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4391.8s)]
*  Right. And they're saying and I was like, what are you fucking? [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4395.12s)]
*  You are. I could hear the bullshit. Yeah. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4398.4400000000005s)]
*  And I knew that they were. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4401.799999999999s)]
*  But that back then they were just trying to make it sound interesting when it wasn't. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4402.96s)]
*  They didn't start having this opinion thing yet, you know. Right. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4407.759999999999s)]
*  But it became a show. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4411.04s)]
*  And now it's a show about opinions. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4411.96s)]
*  It's entertainment. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4414.08s)]
*  And like any other entertainment organization in America, [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4415.2s)]
*  they ran it way past the finish. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4418.48s)]
*  They went way past it. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4420.08s)]
*  Nobody likes it anymore. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4421.719999999999s)]
*  And it's there. They're running it to the ground. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4423.16s)]
*  They can't just they don't know when to stop. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4425.48s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that's the train they're on. Right. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4427.44s)]
*  Do you think Fox started it? [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4429.88s)]
*  Was it Fox has started this like aggressive sort of opinion [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4431.52s)]
*  version of the news? [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4436.400000000001s)]
*  Were they the first? [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4437.64s)]
*  And then everybody else sort of had to respond to it? [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4438.400000000001s)]
*  Maybe. I don't know. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4440.8s)]
*  Fox is a first. I don't know that hot ladies in short skirts. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4442.2s)]
*  They were the first. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4445.64s)]
*  Well, there was there was I mean, look, [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4446.4400000000005s)]
*  Barbara Walters was hot when she started. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4448.32s)]
*  Right. But she dressed appropriately. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4450.92s)]
*  She was very attractive, but she dressed appropriately. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4452.6s)]
*  Is that do you remember thinking that? [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4455.2s)]
*  Yes, I did. You know what? [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4457.04s)]
*  She's attractive, but she's very composed and she dressed [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4458.56s)]
*  appropriately and the way she handled Sean Connery was great. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4461.72s)]
*  Yeah, I liked her. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4465.4800000000005s)]
*  I found her. I like the bump on her nose. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4467.280000000001s)]
*  She had kind of a funny face. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4469.92s)]

*  I, you know, I really enjoyed that. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4943.92s)]
*  I loved it. It was enough to pay my rent in New York City. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4946.36s)]
*  And at the time, I liked New York City a little more than I do now [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4950.2s)]
*  because there was more like cool stuff, like bookstores and tower records. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4953.0s)]
*  And there was more movie theaters. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4956.96s)]
*  And it was more off the wall culture and strange stuff to see. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4958.32s)]
*  And and more restaurants and diners. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4962.4800000000005s)]
*  There's really not all night diners in Manhattan anymore. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4964.52s)]
*  There isn't. They're gone. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4966.92s)]
*  Like me and Bobby Kelly, when we were getting ready to do his special, [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4968.12s)]
*  I went to watch him at the cellar. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4971.72s)]
*  And then I said, let's go to a diner and talk it over. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4973.4800000000005s)]
*  And we walked around there, couldn't find one. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4975.72s)]
*  They all clubbed and they closed at like midnight. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4977.8s)]
*  Now, is that because of crime? [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4980.360000000001s)]
*  Well, COVID killed a lot of places. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4982.200000000001s)]
*  I mean, it really just really distinctly changed the city. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4984.52s)]
*  And it's it's thriving New York. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4987.64s)]
*  It's really like there are sometimes I hear people talk on your show [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4990.0s)]
*  and other shows saying like this city, New York City is dead and it's dangerous. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4993.52s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't know. We're here. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4997.240000000001s)]
*  Like, it's OK. It's a very resilient city. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=4999.08s)]
*  It's been through a lot. Yeah. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5001.96s)]
*  Well, it's bouncing back just the fucking sheer numbers. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5003.36s)]
*  Yeah, there's so many people. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5006.5199999999995s)]
*  Someone's going to pick up slack. Yeah. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5007.759999999999s)]
*  Somebody's business will fail. A lot of businesses fail. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5010.12s)]
*  Katz's deli still open, right? Sure. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5012.719999999999s)]

*  I love that. That's my favorite New York place to eat late night. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5020.84s)]
*  It hasn't changed. You give them your the ticket and then the guy. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5023.88s)]
*  You're paying cash. Yeah. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5027.24s)]
*  Paying cash. The guy gives you a little piece of pastrami while you're waiting. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5028.32s)]
*  Yeah. And you take him. Yeah. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5031.12s)]

*  And a big pickle. Oh, my God. So good. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5036.84s)]

*  I mean, probably younger generations have their own version of that. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5113.799999999999s)]
*  But ours, we're 55, so there's less of us. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5117.2s)]
*  Most people our age are pretty settled. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5120.8s)]
*  They're not going out anymore. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5122.64s)]
*  But the thing about the delis and for me was always the history. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5123.72s)]

*  Like he nodded. He nodded at her ass like, Mm hmm. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5163.400000000001s)]
*  And she's standing. She had no idea. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5166.8s)]
*  Well, Jackie Mason was a guy who got he got kicked off of the Ed Sullivan show [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5168.76s)]
*  because Ed Sullivan claimed that he gave him the finger. Yes. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5173.04s)]
*  And so he got banned from television. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5176.64s)]
*  Yeah, because I went to the to the Museum of Broadcasting or whatever it is in New [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5178.16s)]
*  York, where they have all the archives, because I wanted to see that tape [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5183.28s)]
*  because I read his description of it and I saw it. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5186.76s)]
*  What is it? Did he give him the finger? [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5190.68s)]
*  No, what happened was the way he tells the story is that he was doing his set. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5192.04s)]
*  And I guess Ed was kind of [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5197.52s)]
*  of I don't know, a little nutty. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5201.2s)]
*  And he wanted him off. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5204.24s)]
*  He didn't he wanted to quit to stop. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5205.4400000000005s)]
*  I wanted to get him off early or something. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5207.36s)]
*  And so he got behind the camera and he was giving him two minutes. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5209.24s)]
*  It was like giving him a say like himself. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5212.32s)]
*  And and Jackie's trying to do his set. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5214.24s)]
*  And he goes, what are you showing me a finger? [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5216.8s)]
*  Here's a thing. You want a finger? Here's a couple of fingers for you. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5218.32s)]
*  Like he just sort of like flashed fingers around because Ed Sullivan was shown [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5220.2s)]
*  like making finger signs in him that he didn't understand. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5223.96s)]
*  He wasn't he wasn't told that Ed Sullivan would give him a two minute signal. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5226.52s)]
*  Right. Just Ed Sullivan came over. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5230.48s)]
*  He was stressed out for some reason. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5232.2s)]
*  And I saw the tape and it doesn't it's goes by very quickly. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5234.08s)]
*  But he goes, well, finger finger, you want finger fingers fingers. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5237.08s)]
*  Is that available on YouTube? [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5239.44s)]
*  You got it here before he had been in Jackie. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5241.48s)]
*  Someone else talking over it. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5244.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's a they got to apparently give Sullivan finger on this day in 1960. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5246.4s)]
*  Wow. How young he was. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5251.16s)]
*  Just play it a little bit on the Ed Sullivan show. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5253.08s)]
*  During his set, Sullivan gave Mason a signal [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5256.08s)]
*  indicating that he had two minutes left before he had to finish up. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5259.4400000000005s)]
*  It's actually my video gestured at Sullivan. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5263.6s)]
*  Yeah. And it was interpreted as him giving the host the finger. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5266.24s)]
*  They're not going to show. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5269.96s)]
*  Yes. See if you can find it. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5270.96s)]
*  If he's just talking over it, that's right. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5272.4400000000005s)]
*  See if you can find it. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5274.04s)]
*  No, that's how you know. Yeah. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5275.12s)]
*  Yeah. Bullshit thing. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5277.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there's so many of those. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5278.92s)]
*  Well, I think they have to do that so that some like, you know, like you have [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5279.96s)]
*  you can't just own someone's stuff, but if you do commentary over it. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5284.360000000001s)]
*  Oh, that's the thing. And then you play it. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5288.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Then they can't give you a copyright strike on it. Right. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5289.68s)]
*  Because you've altered it enough with your commentary. Right. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5292.6s)]
*  Unfortunately, no footage from that specific incident exists on YouTube. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5296.280000000001s)]
*  Yes. However, it's been widely argued that Mason never did flip off. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5299.400000000001s)]
*  No, he didn't do it. I mean, I saw it. I saw. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5303.8s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I don't know if that place is still there, but you know, [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5305.84s)]
*  you're supposed to be kind of an asshole, supposedly. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5308.4400000000005s)]
*  Ed Sullivan. I mean, you'd think. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5311.28s)]
*  Yeah. With that, just that what he did, you know, he's like, [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5312.64s)]
*  you ever see Sweet Smell of Success? No. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5316.44s)]
*  It's one of the best movies ever. Really? So good. What is it? [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5318.6s)]
*  It's Tony Curtis and Burt Lancaster. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5322.32s)]
*  What year is it? [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5325.92s)]
*  Oh, 50s, early 60s. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5327.08s)]
*  Patty Chayefsky wrote it. So 57. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5329.5199999999995s)]
*  So Tony Curtis plays a [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5334.16s)]
*  he's a publicist. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5338.4s)]
*  It's this New York. I mean, look at the images. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5339.6s)]
*  It's fucking beautiful, this movie. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5341.400000000001s)]
*  And it's all about nightlife in New York. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5343.88s)]
*  The 50s. Yeah, in the 50s. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5347.08s)]
*  And this guy, Burt Lancaster, plays J.J. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5348.72s)]
*  Hunsucker, who's a columnist. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5353.4400000000005s)]
*  And he makes people famous by writing just little little [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5356.320000000001s)]
*  snippets about them in his column. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5359.8s)]
*  And Tony Curtis plays a publicist who tries to shill items to him, tries to. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5361.8s)]
*  He represents comedians and there's a comedian in the movie. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5366.4s)]
*  And so and he's a bullshitter. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5371.639999999999s)]
*  And this guy is really powerful and he changes people's lives and show business. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5373.719999999999s)]
*  And he's also very conservative. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5377.639999999999s)]
*  But anyway, he has also a TV show. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5380.0s)]
*  And that's that's where Ed Sullivan came from. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5382.32s)]
*  He had like a column where he would write, you know, great young comic, [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5384.08s)]
*  just to people cared about his opinion. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5387.08s)]
*  He became very powerful. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5389.08s)]
*  And then he had like a radio program where he would say this, this young artist. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5390.679999999999s)]
*  And then and then he started his show. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5394.4s)]
*  So J.J. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5396.0s)]
*  Hunsucker is kind of like a version of Ed Sullivan, and he's a bastard. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5397.28s)]
*  So I don't know if people knew that about Ed Sullivan, but [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5401.56s)]
*  he ruins lives and and pits people against each other. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5405.12s)]
*  It's a very dirty movie. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5408.92s)]
*  If you go back to those days when there was only one or two, [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5410.6s)]
*  you know, you had like Jack Parr, you had Ed Sullivan. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5414.32s)]
*  There was only one or two guys [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5418.0s)]
*  that was in control of the like the gateway to show business. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5420.88s)]
*  In a lot of ways, like Johnny Carson was like that in a lot of ways. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5425.8s)]
*  Being on Carson made your whole life. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5429.120000000001s)]
*  And if he liked you and you sat on the couch next to Carson. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5431.040000000001s)]
*  I mean, that made Richard Jennings career. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5434.76s)]
*  That's really where he took off from. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5436.76s)]
*  You know, that's where I first saw him. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5438.92s)]
*  I used to watch the Tonight Show specifically just to watch the stand ups. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5440.84s)]
*  And Rich Jenny did a great thing I'd never seen before, which he did. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5444.6s)]
*  One subject set about Jaws three. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5448.88s)]
*  Oh, but he could do that, though. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5452.200000000001s)]
*  He did. But that said, if you ever find it, [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5453.36s)]
*  just him talking about Jaws three for five minutes. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5456.04s)]
*  And see if you can find it. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5459.0s)]
*  It's the greatest Richard Jenny was the very best. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5459.92s)]
*  He was so good. All of the material, all of the. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5463.44s)]
*  Here we go. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5466.679999999999s)]
*  You're all in a good mood tonight, because that's important for a young comedian [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5467.24s)]
*  who's making his very first appearance on the Tonight Show. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5470.0s)]

*  You just it's not that you can tell you're getting lonely [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5556.0s)]
*  when you're sitting in your hotel going, gee, I never noticed it before. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5557.68s)]
*  But Wilma Flintstone doesn't have a bad body. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5560.4400000000005s)]
*  That's the sanitized version of that joke. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5562.8s)]
*  Yes. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5568.96s)]
*  You're just lonely. Oh, no, really? [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5569.56s)]
*  She's got a nice ass. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5570.88s)]
*  She's probably with Lange. Yeah, that's what it was. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5571.88s)]
*  In the clubs, it was nice ass. Yeah. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5573.76s)]
*  I got so desperate for something to do one night, [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5580.0s)]
*  I actually went to the video store. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5582.12s)]
*  Listen to this. I rented all four Jaws movies in a row. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5583.28s)]
*  This is a little boy in your life. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5587.08s)]
*  When it's like 445, you're watching Jaws Father Revenge. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5588.16s)]
*  That's the title. Jaws Father Revenge. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5591.16s)]
*  And you're sitting there going, this shouldn't be the title. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5592.5599999999995s)]
*  The title should be Here's a Fish. You're Stupid. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5594.08s)]
*  That's the title. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5596.4s)]
*  You ever see a movie like so bad that they just slap you in the face [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5599.5199999999995s)]
*  with how bad it is. You can't even pretend. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5603.0s)]
*  You go, you know, maybe this movie isn't that bad. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5604.96s)]
*  I'm not wasting my life. And they just go, yes, you are. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5606.44s)]
*  Are you sure? Absolutely. Look at you. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5609.76s)]
*  It's four in the morning. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5612.08s)]
*  You're sitting there with one sweat sock and a burrito watching a shark [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5613.12s)]
*  that only kills one family out of an entire ocean full of perfectly edible [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5616.72s)]
*  people for no reason that we ever explain. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5620.52s)]
*  And you won't turn it off because you think it's going to get better. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5623.280000000001s)]
*  Sit there. A movie. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5627.120000000001s)]
*  I'm still in pain from this. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5630.92s)]
*  A movie so stupid that no matter how stupid, you couldn't be stupid enough [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5632.8s)]
*  to enjoy it. Let's say you have no brain at all. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5636.320000000001s)]
*  Let's say you're sitting on your bed. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5638.8s)]
*  Here's you. A bucket of popcorn and a spinal cord. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5639.96s)]
*  That's it. Even your spinal cord will go, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5642.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm not a brain. I don't have thoughts. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5647.080000000001s)]
*  But what is going on here? [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5648.4400000000005s)]
*  The mother of the family, check this out, has three people in her family [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5651.52s)]
*  eaten by the shark in one week. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5654.72s)]
*  So a genius in her own right, she comes up with a plan. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5656.64s)]
*  She says, well, shark is obviously after our family. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5659.92s)]
*  Can't put anything over on me. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5666.0s)]
*  So only one thing to do will have to leave town. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5668.4400000000005s)]
*  And you go and leave town? [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5671.72s)]
*  Wouldn't an apartment building be sufficient protection from the average shark? [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5673.200000000001s)]
*  I mean, even if he's a really ambitious shark, right? [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5676.400000000001s)]
*  Let's say by the time he gets to the apartment building, [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5679.36s)]
*  parks in the guest spot, explains himself to the doorman, [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5682.28s)]
*  come up in the elevator, you would most likely smell fish and run. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5684.8s)]
*  No, the mother is leaving town all together. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5688.24s)]
*  And you sit there. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5694.08s)]
*  And you're going, well, why doesn't the mother just not go in the water? [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5698.24s)]
*  Wouldn't that make more sense? [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5700.5599999999995s)]
*  And they go, well, no, yeah, but this is stupid, you see, [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5701.599999999999s)]
*  it was stupid, really, everyone's stupid. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5705.0s)]
*  The mother is stupid. The people that made it are stupid. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5706.599999999999s)]
*  But none of them are as stupid as you, because it is now five oh one. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5708.72s)]
*  And you still think this is going to get better. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5712.56s)]
*  And look at it in his head, he's like, I am destroying on Carson. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5720.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5723.6s)]
*  Plans to kill these people that the CIA couldn't figure out. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5724.080000000001s)]
*  I caught fish and not that brilliant. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5727.64s)]
*  They don't even make any noise when you're about to kill them. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5731.080000000001s)]
*  You ever see a fish come up on a hook line? [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5733.0s)]
*  They had any brains, they make noise, you wouldn't be able to kill them. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5735.360000000001s)]
*  They'd be going, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, start the boat. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5737.08s)]
*  I'll get a burger at the dock. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5742.08s)]
*  Did you see what just took place over there? [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5743.2s)]
*  So now comes a turning point in your life. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5746.5199999999995s)]
*  If you don't turn off the movie now, just do the world a favor. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5749.24s)]
*  And when the credits roll, get a vasectomy. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5752.24s)]
*  The mother gets on a plane to get away from the shark. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5754.12s)]
*  But before she goes, has an affair with Michael Caine. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5757.92s)]
*  Typical reaction to this kind of tragedy. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5760.92s)]
*  That's what I would do. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5762.5199999999995s)]
*  Most people would say, gee, there's three people in my family [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5764.2s)]
*  who've been eaten by a shark in one week. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5766.84s)]
*  Geez, am I horny? Man, I don't know. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5769.24s)]
*  Man, why don't... [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5772.0s)]
*  My goodness. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5775.08s)]
*  Ooh, ooh, God. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5776.4800000000005s)]
*  Ooh, the pit. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5779.24s)]
*  Ooh, ooh, the tragedy, the bloodshed. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5784.24s)]
*  Stop me, I'm vibrating. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5787.12s)]
*  Where's the blow up towel when you need one? [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5789.96s)]
*  Ooh, I mean, so now, get this, here's the crescendo. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5791.52s)]
*  The mother gets on a plane in Long Island, New York, [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5794.84s)]
*  to get away from the shark. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5797.52s)]
*  Flies to the Bahamas. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5798.72s)]
*  Are you with me here? An ideal place to avoid a fish. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5800.12s)]
*  Let's go out surrounded by water. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5803.400000000001s)]
*  When she gets there, guess what? [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5804.84s)]
*  Not only has the shark discovered that they have travel plans [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5807.52s)]
*  to go to the Bahamas, [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5810.6s)]
*  but to boot, he has beat the jet to the Bahamas. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5812.6s)]
*  They land, there he is, couple of beers, ray bands, [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5816.4400000000005s)]
*  and you're going, but wait a minute, that was a jet. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5819.52s)]
*  Wouldn't a jet be faster than a shark? [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5821.52s)]
*  It's not going to go well ordinarily, but again, this is stupid. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5823.32s)]
*  You see, in a stupid movie, [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5825.5199999999995s)]
*  shark is the fastest transportation available. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5827.679999999999s)]
*  See, if you're going to London from New York, let's say, right? [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5830.599999999999s)]
*  Tear up them Concord tickets, get the next fish out of town. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5833.24s)]
*  Oh, they played him off, interesting. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5840.599999999999s)]
*  Well, they were probably told that's his last line. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5843.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Get the next fish out of town. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5846.04s)]
*  Yeah, that made him. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5847.96s)]
*  And it came in hot with the music, yeah. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5848.96s)]
*  Yeah, I saw him at Catch Rising Star [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5850.44s)]
*  when I was an open mic'er. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5853.0s)]
*  I went to see him, I sat in the front row, it was amazing. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5854.28s)]
*  Because it was like a half-filled crowd. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5856.64s)]
*  It was like a Wednesday night show. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5858.24s)]
*  Catch Rising Star in Cambridge. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5860.92s)]
*  Still the best way to see stand-up comedy. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5862.56s)]
*  Yeah. Is in a dead club. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5865.04s)]
*  Right, you get to see the real deal. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5867.12s)]
*  I've been, when I was getting ready for this tour, [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5869.72s)]
*  I'm on now, I was at the cellar a bunch, [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5871.88s)]
*  and that's where I usually build this stuff, [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5874.04s)]
*  and I was struggling a lot of sets, [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5876.88s)]
*  because the cellar has become very trendy. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5880.32s)]
*  There's a lot of cooler people that go there, [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5885.08s)]
*  nicely dressed young people go to the cellar. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5886.679999999999s)]
*  It's a scene. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5888.44s)]
*  It's a scene now. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5889.44s)]
*  So it's not automatic that they're going to get, [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5890.639999999999s)]
*  it's like a weird thing, and it's actually good, [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5893.719999999999s)]
*  I think, in a sense, because you've got to fight [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5896.2s)]
*  for your laughs a little more than we used to. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5898.799999999999s)]
*  But I've done some shows this year where I'm struggling. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5901.08s)]
*  I'm like, every bit is pissing them off, [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5906.599999999999s)]
*  and not for PC reasons, [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5909.12s)]
*  but just because they're not trained comedy audiences, [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5910.72s)]
*  and they're like, ew, it's more that old thing. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5913.68s)]
*  Remember before, that's problematic, [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5916.24s)]
*  there was just ew. Right. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5918.44s)]
*  So it's like that again, and I'm just struggling. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5920.24s)]
*  But I got nowhere to go. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5924.36s)]
*  All my shit in this set is kind of nasty, [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5926.04s)]
*  so I'm just getting through it. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5928.44s)]
*  But out of the 100 people at the cellar, [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5930.32s)]
*  there's about 20 of them who are fucking having [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5932.76s)]
*  the best time of their lives. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5935.32s)]
*  They're laughing so hard, [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5937.28s)]
*  because not only are they seeing jokes that they like, [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5939.16s)]
*  they like my jokes, [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5942.16s)]
*  they're getting to watch people get really offended, [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5943.8s)]
*  and they're getting to watch me squirm. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5947.16s)]
*  Every time I do a joke, and it would kind of get this, ugh, [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5950.32s)]
*  then I'd go like, you'd see me go fuck, [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5953.2s)]
*  and I'd hear people go like, this is the, [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5955.12s)]
*  like high-fiving, this is the best night. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5957.759999999999s)]
*  So much better than seeing your favorite comic [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5960.84s)]
*  in a theater where everybody loves him. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5964.88s)]
*  I don't know if it's so much better, [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5967.2s)]
*  but it's definitely different. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5968.28s)]
*  It's just there's more friction to it, [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5969.599999999999s)]
*  so there's more going on. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5971.36s)]
*  One of the, when I was like early days, [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5973.24s)]
*  like open mic-er, me and Fitzsimmons saw Bill Hicks' bomb [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5977.32s)]
*  at Nick's Comedy Stop. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5980.72s)]
*  Most of the times, that's what he did. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5981.72s)]
*  And clear the fucking room. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5983.12s)]
*  But at the end of his set, there was 50 people left. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5985.2s)]
*  Like, what does Nick's hold, like 300-plus people? [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5988.04s)]
*  Yeah, it was big, about 300. Yeah. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5990.24s)]
*  So at the end of the set, [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5991.96s)]
*  there's 50 people left in the audience, [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5993.76s)]
*  and maybe 20 comedians. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5995.64s)]
*  And Fitzsimmons and I are just fucking howling. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=5997.280000000001s)]
*  We're howling. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6000.72s)]
*  We thought it was so funny, [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6002.240000000001s)]
*  and it was so funny that he was clear in the room. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6003.4400000000005s)]
*  And he went on after Larry Norton. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6006.08s)]
*  Do you remember Larry Norton? [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6007.8s)]
*  Sure, Comic-Con-A-Harley. Comic-Con-A-Harley, yes. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6008.64s)]
*  I'm Larry Norton, I'm a Comic-Con-A-Harley. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6011.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6013.68s)]
*  So Larry Norton killed, and then Hicks went on after him. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6014.96s)]
*  And you know, Hicks is, you know, [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6018.360000000001s)]
*  it's fucking existential angst, and smoking cigarettes, [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6019.84s)]
*  and you know, cancer, and this and that. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6022.96s)]
*  And then the audience is just fucking leaving. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6025.28s)]
*  And so he's doing, I don't know if you remember that bit [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6028.24s)]
*  that he does about, I think it's like, [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6030.44s)]
*  the devil fucks John Davidson in the ass. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6033.28s)]
*  Yes, and Debbie Gibson, or no, that was Jimi Hendrix [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6036.24s)]
*  fucking Debbie Gibson with his guitar. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6040.5599999999995s)]
*  That was that. That was a different one. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6042.5199999999995s)]
*  You wanted it rock and roll, didn't you, Debbie? [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6044.84s)]
*  Rear! No! [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6046.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, that was a different one. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6049.24s)]
*  So he's doing this bit where John Davidson [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6050.759999999999s)]
*  is shitting out the devil's kid. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6053.4s)]
*  That's where, I remember that. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6055.599999999999s)]
*  So he's squatting, and he's like... [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6057.04s)]
*  And he looks up and he goes, [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6062.16s)]
*  yeah, this generally clears the room. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6063.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. And the people are just getting up [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6066.04s)]
*  in fucking droves, and we were howling. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6067.599999999999s)]
*  We thought it was so funny. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6070.599999999999s)]
*  Yep. We thought it was so funny. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6072.24s)]
*  It was just, it was nice to see this guy [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6074.04s)]
*  who was so, like, respected, but eating shit [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6077.24s)]
*  in front of a bunch of people who didn't know who he was. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6081.68s)]
*  He ate shit a lot. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6083.6s)]
*  I worked with him, I opened for him [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6084.84s)]
*  at the San Francisco punch line, [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6086.200000000001s)]
*  and there were some nights where he was destroying, [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6088.360000000001s)]
*  just killing. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6091.52s)]
*  He did this whole thing about that they should use [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6093.08s)]
*  terminally ill patients as stuntmen. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6094.92s)]
*  Yes, for Chuck Norris movies. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6097.76s)]
*  Yeah, he goes, do you want your grandmother to die alone [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6099.4400000000005s)]
*  in a room of strangers with her veins fading into dust, [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6104.360000000001s)]
*  or do you want her to meet Chuck Norris? [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6109.0s)]
*  And he'd do this thing of sending out, [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6112.6s)]
*  like, this person who's half dead, [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6115.320000000001s)]
*  and then Chuck Norris just kicks her head off. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6116.68s)]
*  Just kicks it off, and you go, whoa! [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6120.240000000001s)]
*  But he was destroying some shows, [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6123.04s)]
*  and then other shows, just nothing, just nothing. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6125.4800000000005s)]
*  Wow. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6128.280000000001s)]
*  Just they didn't get it, they didn't want to hear it. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6129.12s)]
*  He didn't have a gear to go to. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6130.92s)]
*  No. And he didn't have, [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6133.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, I learned from it, because I used to think [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6136.160000000001s)]
*  you could make these jokes work for some of these people [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6138.08s)]
*  that don't like them, you could just, [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6140.4s)]
*  I'd just reach out a little bit. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6143.12s)]
*  It doesn't mean changing the jokes, [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6144.799999999999s)]
*  it just means, just give it, [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6146.12s)]
*  it's just something in your eyes that says, [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6148.36s)]
*  look, I know you're having a hard time, [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6150.799999999999s)]
*  but I don't mean you any harm, [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6152.4s)]
*  I just, this is funny if you listen, [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6154.719999999999s)]
*  I swear to God, just get through. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6156.839999999999s)]
*  He wasn't interested in making that bridge. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6158.639999999999s)]
*  No, he wasn't, he wasn't. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6160.5599999999995s)]
*  He was a bit of a misanthrope. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6161.799999999999s)]
*  Also a very sweet guy in his way, you know, but. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6164.44s)]
*  Yeah, I never got the chance to talk to him. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6167.839999999999s)]
*  I liked him. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6170.0s)]
*  I only said hi to him once, [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6170.84s)]
*  Nick's comedy stop, and I was like, ooh. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6172.280000000001s)]
*  I don't think he noticed much about me, [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6174.08s)]
*  but I worked with him a number of times. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6175.96s)]
*  And I liked him, I liked listening to him, [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6178.280000000001s)]
*  I liked his act. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6180.88s)]
*  He also was a good comic, like he made good noises [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6181.72s)]
*  with a microphone and stuff, [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6184.72s)]
*  because he came from here, he came from Texas [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6186.240000000001s)]
*  and Sam and all those guys, this was a big scene. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6188.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, this was the scene at one point in time. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6191.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, you think of Kinnison and him [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6195.240000000001s)]
*  both coming out of here, pretty wild. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6196.92s)]
*  And those guys were, I mean, Kinnison was probably [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6199.88s)]
*  the most revolutionary comedian of our lifetime. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6202.4s)]
*  In the 1980s. You think so? [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6205.0s)]
*  Yeah, there'd never been anybody like him. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6206.16s)]
*  All of a sudden screaming, I was married, twice! [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6208.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6212.679999999999s)]
*  Hell would be like Club Med! [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6213.5199999999995s)]
*  Yes, he was like, where did this come from? [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6215.2s)]
*  Totally different than any other kind of comedy. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6218.44s)]
*  I think Steve Martin was like that too [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6220.96s)]
*  in a totally different tone. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6222.5199999999995s)]
*  He was, he was the one that excited me the most. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6223.759999999999s)]
*  Like I loved Cosby and Pryor and Carlin when I was a kid, [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6227.68s)]
*  but Steve Martin was the first one where I went, [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6232.280000000001s)]
*  you're not even doing show business. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6234.68s)]
*  Right, what are you doing? [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6236.8s)]
*  You're just being really weird. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6238.160000000001s)]
*  And I love it and other people love it. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6240.56s)]
*  He was the guy who made me think, maybe I could do this. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6242.76s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6245.4800000000005s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6246.400000000001s)]
*  He was the first person I watched that I thought, [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6247.240000000001s)]
*  there's other ways, because I wasn't a slick guy [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6249.96s)]
*  who can talk and then talk like this and then talk like that. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6252.200000000001s)]
*  And Pryor, just these skills were just swim around my head. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6255.8s)]
*  Like I could never do that, especially as a kid. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6260.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6263.360000000001s)]
*  But when I saw him, I was like, [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6264.2s)]
*  that's how I talk with my friends. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6266.04s)]
*  That's the kind of jokes I make and the off, [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6267.400000000001s)]
*  no rhythm to it. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6271.28s)]
*  I'm so mad at my mother. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6273.76s)]
*  Like just odd, weird stuff. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6275.52s)]
*  He was so weird. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6279.28s)]
*  It's kind of a bummer that he stopped doing standup [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6280.4800000000005s)]
*  because it was so good. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6282.6s)]
*  And when, back in those days, [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6283.76s)]
*  what was that, I guess early 80s? [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6286.08s)]
*  70s. When he was really killing it? [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6288.4400000000005s)]
*  I think mid to late 70s. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6290.12s)]
*  It was disco time. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6292.68s)]
*  He had a white suit, which was kind of a disco thing. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6293.52s)]
*  So it was around the time of like Saturday Night Fever. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6297.08s)]
*  There was this time when there were so many hits, [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6300.360000000001s)]
*  hit things back then. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6303.64s)]
*  There was Saturday Night Fever [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6305.360000000001s)]
*  and all of this is compressed in my head, [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6306.84s)]
*  but Jaws and Star Wars and Rocky. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6308.88s)]
*  And Steve Martin was the comedian of that time. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6314.4400000000005s)]
*  Those were all the golden things that were killing, [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6317.64s)]
*  making tons of money. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6321.120000000001s)]
*  Everybody loved those things. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6322.240000000001s)]
*  I remember reading that he had decided at one point in time [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6323.52s)]
*  that the audiences liked him too much [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6326.160000000001s)]
*  for being Steve Martin. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6328.56s)]
*  And then he would go out there and he couldn't get a gauge [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6329.88s)]
*  as to what was funny and what was not. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6332.0s)]
*  Cause they were just so happy to see him. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6333.52s)]
*  Yeah, he did the arenas. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6335.0s)]
*  And people would just scream. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6337.52s)]
*  And it wasn't the same anymore. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6340.04s)]
*  I mean, it was a good discipline. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6341.64s)]
*  I think there's truth to that, I think. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6344.04s)]
*  There's definitely truth to that. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6345.28s)]
*  I mean, I think it could be navigated, [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6346.4s)]
*  but you're definitely in some very tricky waters. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6347.88s)]
*  Like you can still do comedy. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6350.5199999999995s)]
*  And I think what we were talking about earlier, [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6351.96s)]
*  what you do a lot by showing up at clubs [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6353.799999999999s)]
*  where they don't know you're gonna be there [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6356.48s)]
*  and just actually working out stuff. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6358.08s)]
*  You really do get to figure out what's funny and what's not. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6360.44s)]
*  Whereas I know guys who have their own crowds [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6362.88s)]
*  who never perform in front of anyone, but their crowd. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6366.36s)]
*  This is diminishing returns. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6369.799999999999s)]
*  It's just not gonna be. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6371.28s)]
*  I mean, you could do that and your crowd might appreciate it. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6372.28s)]
*  You could do it, but you get more out of fucking around. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6375.4s)]
*  It's the only way to do it is to go on and do clubs [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6379.16s)]
*  and unannounced and start with zero jokes [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6384.08s)]
*  and struggle, have a bunch of bad sets, get through. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6388.2s)]
*  Even at the cellar, people, when they recognize me, [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6392.599999999999s)]
*  they're happy to see me. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6394.759999999999s)]
*  And then I'm like, well, here comes new jokes. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6395.719999999999s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6398.0s)]
*  And they just within a, cause that evaporates. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6398.84s)]
*  No one pretends to laugh at you. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6401.5599999999995s)]
*  No one will pretend to laugh at you. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6403.36s)]
*  So the first couple of jokes, they go, what? [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6405.5199999999995s)]
*  And I usually would try opening with stuff [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6407.799999999999s)]
*  that's not, this ain't gonna get it. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6412.12s)]
*  This isn't gonna work probably. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6413.919999999999s)]
*  And get them to this level. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6416.08s)]
*  And I'm like, okay, here we are. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6417.16s)]
*  I don't wanna be here, but this is where. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6418.16s)]
*  It's like if you're in the gym. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6420.24s)]
*  You don't go to the gym to have a good time. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6421.919999999999s)]
*  And you get into like, I'm glad, I'm proud of myself. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6424.16s)]
*  I'm at the gym today. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6426.719999999999s)]
*  But when first moves you make, you're like, [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6428.08s)]
*  this fucking sucks. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6429.88s)]
*  But so you get through shitty 10 minutes of jokes. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6432.16s)]
*  And you maybe got one joke. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6436.6s)]
*  So you do that night after night till you get 10, 20. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6437.92s)]
*  And then after you get 20 minutes, [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6442.08s)]
*  and you've done it a few times, [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6443.8s)]
*  if you have the discipline, you stop doing those jokes. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6445.8s)]
*  And you start again with a new 20 from nothing. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6448.92s)]
*  And this is the way I usually do it. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6452.0s)]
*  I end up with two 20 minute sets. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6453.84s)]
*  And then I start mixing them a little bit. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6456.32s)]
*  And then I start going to stuff in the notebook [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6458.599999999999s)]
*  that never worked and never should have worked. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6460.28s)]
*  Or things I was too scared to try. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6462.639999999999s)]
*  You know when you write something on your notes [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6464.96s)]
*  for a new comedy set. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6466.599999999999s)]
*  But when you look at it, you go, I ain't doing that. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6469.599999999999s)]
*  Like I thought of it, it sounded good today. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6472.12s)]
*  I'm not touching that. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6475.4s)]
*  I always have a set when I'm developing [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6476.44s)]
*  where I go, you have to do a set that's only those now. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6478.599999999999s)]
*  Only things that you just shouldn't be doing. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6481.92s)]
*  Or things that have gotten silence. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6485.04s)]
*  It's like this is the last chance for these bits tonight. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6487.4s)]
*  And no bits that have been getting laughs. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6491.76s)]
*  That's a rough set. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6493.92s)]
*  That's a rough set. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6495.84s)]
*  But if anything makes it out of it, [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6496.68s)]
*  it's good. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6498.56s)]
*  That's a fucking, some of those bits [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6499.4s)]
*  have ended up being the best bit. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6501.4s)]
*  Isn't that wild? [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6503.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6503.92s)]
*  The best, always the best bits I have in a special, [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6505.16s)]
*  like the ones that are like that just kills every time. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6507.76s)]
*  But started with silent, hate it, hate it. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6510.2s)]
*  It's wild. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6514.08s)]
*  It's just a wild process. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6515.08s)]
*  The beginning to the end. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6516.84s)]
*  When you write, do you sit in front of a computer [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6518.12s)]
*  like specifically trying to come up with material? [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6521.24s)]
*  Never, never did it. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6524.4s)]
*  Really? [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6525.32s)]
*  I never wrote jokes, ever. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6526.32s)]
*  Do you write ideas? [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6528.92s)]
*  Or do you just write bullet points? [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6530.4s)]
*  I have, I write it down like one word. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6531.6s)]
*  You know, to one, because I need to write on stage. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6534.32s)]
*  It doesn't, if I write off stage, it comes out writer. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6537.68s)]
*  And then you're using, [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6542.2s)]
*  it's like you're using your hand to write, [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6543.639999999999s)]
*  and then you're using your eyes to read it, [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6545.8s)]
*  and then it's coming out your mouth. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6548.04s)]
*  So when I have an idea, you know that moment [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6549.96s)]
*  where you go, oh, it's a bit. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6552.2s)]
*  It's fucking maddening, but it comes when it comes. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6554.24s)]
*  You're in conversation, or you're in the car, wherever. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6557.44s)]
*  You go, fuck, that's a bit about whatever, [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6560.599999999999s)]
*  about zoo lions. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6563.599999999999s)]
*  And I avoid thinking about it. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6566.28s)]
*  I don't wanna work it out. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6567.92s)]
*  I just write down zoo lions, [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6569.5599999999995s)]
*  and I know that it's in the aether. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6571.36s)]
*  I know the general feeling. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6573.16s)]
*  And I wait till I'm on stage that night, [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6575.24s)]
*  and I explain it to them. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6577.919999999999s)]
*  And the audience is there as a target. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6579.599999999999s)]
*  So I tell, I for the first time work it out, [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6583.719999999999s)]
*  and then it's like that's the bit. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6588.0s)]
*  Because I know I can't think straight as a comic [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6589.639999999999s)]
*  unless I'm on stage. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6592.28s)]
*  Did you develop this process over time? [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6593.5599999999995s)]
*  Have you always done it that way? [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6595.759999999999s)]
*  Or did you initially try to write the jokes out first? [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6596.88s)]
*  I could never do it. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6600.24s)]
*  I was a bad student in school. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6601.32s)]
*  I didn't go to college. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6603.08s)]
*  I barely graduated high school [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6603.92s)]
*  because I can't do work like that. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6605.68s)]
*  I mean, I learned to do it [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6608.2s)]
*  when I started working in TV and movies. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6609.52s)]
*  But for stand-up. When you're writing scripts and stuff. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6611.16s)]
*  Yeah, I can write when I have to. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6612.52s)]
*  But I have a huge agita problem and whatever, [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6615.36s)]
*  many Ds and Hs and all that shit. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6619.0s)]
*  So I would just do little set lists. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6622.56s)]
*  And that's the way I always did it. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6626.92s)]
*  I never wrote, there's no written word of my act. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6628.68s)]
*  Because your spoken, your speech center, [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6633.240000000001s)]
*  when it generates the work, [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6636.080000000001s)]
*  that's where it's supposed to come from. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6638.400000000001s)]
*  It's a spoken word art. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6640.200000000001s)]
*  And then I do a lot of work. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6642.52s)]
*  I record every set and I listen to them. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6643.6s)]
*  And I do now, I work on paper, [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6646.96s)]
*  but it's kind of like research. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6650.04s)]
*  I listen to the set and I write notes. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6651.64s)]
*  Like this last whole tour I had to do [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6655.08s)]
*  because I had to come over to the material a little quicker. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6658.64s)]
*  But I write notes about what worked, [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6660.52s)]
*  what didn't, what's innovating. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6662.12s)]
*  That last set was funny when I did this. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6665.52s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6668.240000000001s)]
*  Stuff like that. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6669.08s)]
*  And before, if I take a break of three days or more, [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6670.240000000001s)]
*  before the day of the show, [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6675.12s)]
*  I sit down and I write a set list. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6676.360000000001s)]
*  Even if it's identical to the last one, [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6677.92s)]
*  I listen to the last show I did [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6680.32s)]
*  and I write down tonight's order. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6682.96s)]
*  It's like the lineup for baseball. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6685.6s)]
*  Yeah, I always do that when I do arenas. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6687.12s)]
*  What I do is I get index cards [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6689.84s)]
*  and I'll actually write the bullet points for each bit [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6691.4800000000005s)]
*  and I lay them out on the coffee table in the green room. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6693.64s)]
*  I get there early and I write all that stuff out [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6696.96s)]
*  because that way I'm good. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6699.44s)]
*  Like my head, I know I remember it. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6700.96s)]
*  You gotta load it in. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6702.6s)]
*  You gotta be living it. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6704.0s)]
*  You gotta be, it's gotta be refreshed. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6705.44s)]
*  I know, I just did a set last night. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6708.16s)]
*  I'm ready to go. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6710.2s)]
*  I'm not unconfident about it, [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6711.2s)]
*  but I know that the right way to do it is to sit down [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6713.64s)]
*  and to write down these index cards and to set them out [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6716.72s)]
*  and have all the punch lines [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6719.72s)]
*  because the fucking thing that drives me more nutty [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6721.88s)]
*  than anything is like when I forget a tag. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6724.96s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, it's a shame. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6728.0s)]
*  Then I leave and I'm like, [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6729.2s)]
*  fuck, I forgot that part about the guy. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6730.28s)]
*  Oh. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6732.72s)]
*  And then the rest of the night, [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6734.5199999999995s)]
*  doesn't matter, like everybody's like, [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6735.76s)]
*  oh, standing ovation, great show. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6736.64s)]
*  No, no, no, the tag is gone. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6738.280000000001s)]
*  That's everything, you're destroyed. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6740.64s)]
*  They didn't get it. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6741.88s)]
*  Yeah, they missed it. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6742.72s)]
*  Well, it's because your brain, [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6743.54s)]
*  like I remember my mom teaching, [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6744.38s)]
*  my mom was in computers when I was a kid. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6745.22s)]
*  She was a computer programmer, [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6746.72s)]
*  like when they were punch cards and stuff, [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6748.08s)]
*  like from the beginning. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6749.96s)]
*  My stepdad did that too. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6750.780000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah? [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6751.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6752.46s)]
*  And then she had a terminal at home [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6753.360000000001s)]
*  with a big modem and the phone going, [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6754.8s)]
*  wow. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6757.72s)]
*  And so she taught me about computers [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6759.4800000000005s)]
*  and the thing I always remembered [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6762.200000000001s)]
*  was that there's main memory [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6763.52s)]
*  and then there's auxiliary memory. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6765.44s)]
*  So auxiliary memory, I might be getting the words wrong, [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6767.16s)]
*  is stuff that's on tape that's stored [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6770.0s)]
*  and main memory is the, it's like RAM. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6774.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6776.28s)]
*  It's the working, buzzing, loaded into the hopper, [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6777.12s)]
*  what you've got working and then you have stuff on tape [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6782.24s)]
*  and you can access it anytime you want. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6785.2s)]
*  Oh, remember this, remember this, remember this. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6786.799999999999s)]
*  But you're set from the times you've been doing it [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6788.5199999999995s)]
*  over and over again, it's kind of on tape [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6790.879999999999s)]
*  and when you're on stage, your brain goes and accesses it [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6793.68s)]
*  but doing like the cards before, it loads it into the RAM, [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6796.68s)]
*  it loads it into the present moment [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6800.360000000001s)]
*  because especially when you're doing big things [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6803.6s)]
*  like an arena, you get adrenaline [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6805.68s)]
*  and you start thinking about the size [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6810.56s)]
*  and then that's nowhere, there's no help there. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6812.84s)]
*  It's all negative. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6815.8s)]
*  Shouldn't be thinking about any of that. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6816.64s)]
*  At all. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6817.68s)]
*  The thing you should be thinking of, [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6818.52s)]
*  you shouldn't be thinking about what do I need [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6819.56s)]
*  and all this bravado stuff. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6821.320000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6822.72s)]
*  Or like I'm gonna kill. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6824.4400000000005s)]
*  That's the worst. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6825.72s)]
*  Death, death. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6826.56s)]
*  The only thing you should be thinking about is cows. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6828.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6830.96s)]
*  Because you're talking about cows. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6831.8s)]
*  You shouldn't be thinking this is my bit about these cows [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6832.64s)]
*  and here's what's gotten a laugh before. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6835.92s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6837.6s)]
*  You should be thinking about here's how I feel about cows. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6838.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6840.88s)]
*  You should be in the feeling, [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6841.72s)]
*  my favorite shows are when I feel very present. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6843.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6847.080000000001s)]
*  And sometimes they're because I studied [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6847.92s)]
*  but sometimes they're because I haven't been on stage [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6849.56s)]
*  in a long time and I'm having to remember [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6851.6s)]
*  and I go yeah, fuck and I get the feelings [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6855.04s)]
*  get a little more real. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6857.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there's also a little, [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6858.76s)]
*  sometimes when I do too much stand up, [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6860.240000000001s)]
*  I lose a touch of enthusiasm [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6862.4800000000005s)]
*  and sometimes it's actually good to take a day or two off [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6865.120000000001s)]
*  and then I jump back in and then I'm kind of excited. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6867.68s)]
*  And there's this. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6870.320000000001s)]
*  Yes, that's why this like I'm doing tonight, [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6871.160000000001s)]
*  the what do you call it? [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6872.8s)]
*  The Moody. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6873.92s)]
*  The Moody Theater in Austin and then tomorrow again [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6874.76s)]
*  and then San Antonio and I just did New Orleans in Mobile. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6877.280000000001s)]
*  It's five nights, which is a lot for me. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6881.04s)]
*  And then I go up to Baltimore and DC [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6883.64s)]
*  but then I take two nights off before the Garden [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6886.28s)]
*  and that's pretty decent amount, two nights. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6888.4800000000005s)]
*  Yes, that's perfect. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6890.92s)]
*  Yes. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6892.2s)]
*  So you'll be juicy when you get back. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6893.04s)]
*  I won't think about my set at all for two days. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6893.88s)]
*  Really? [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6896.2s)]
*  Yeah, and then I'll work out and exercise. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6897.04s)]
*  I kind of train for this stuff [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6899.92s)]
*  because my feeling is the show has to be great. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6902.44s)]
*  That's my responsibility. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6905.0s)]
*  If you're not in shape, [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6907.88s)]
*  then the show is as good as your luck, right? [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6909.8s)]
*  If you have a good crowd, you'll have a good show. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6913.36s)]
*  And if it's just a good night and things line up right, [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6915.92s)]
*  you'll have a good show. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6918.92s)]
*  But if you leave it up to that, you're a fucking asshole. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6919.76s)]
*  If you're in shape and you have wind and your, [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6922.72s)]
*  you know, your mind gets clearer when you're in better shape [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6925.36s)]
*  and you try not to eat sugar and stuff, [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6927.88s)]
*  then if the, no matter what the show is gonna be great, [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6929.88s)]
*  if the crowd sucks, [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6933.08s)]
*  I'm just gonna have to work a lot harder. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6934.04s)]
*  It's not up to them how good this show is. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6936.96s)]
*  It's just, I'm gonna have to put in [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6939.84s)]
*  a lot more fucking effort. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6940.84s)]
*  So I need to be healthy enough that when they suck, [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6942.48s)]
*  I'm great. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6946.36s)]
*  And when they're great, it's out of the park. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6947.88s)]
*  It's complete. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6951.32s)]
*  I remember you telling me about this back in the day [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6952.16s)]
*  where you used to run. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6953.72s)]
*  You used to like run like you're training for a fight. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6954.92s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6956.88s)]
*  That's where I'm going right now, yeah. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6957.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6958.88s)]
*  Yeah, I was on the steps machine for an hour. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6959.72s)]
*  And I train for however long I try to do [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6962.24s)]
*  the steps machine for how long the set is I'm doing. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6965.72s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6968.12s)]
*  And I watch Ali Frazier fights or. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6968.96s)]
*  No shit. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6971.8s)]
*  Yeah, I watch 15 round, the old fights, [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6972.64s)]
*  and I pick a guy that I'm him. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6975.4800000000005s)]
*  And I, with the level of the machine, [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6977.84s)]
*  I follow his effort. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6981.8s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6983.4800000000005s)]
*  So when Ali's back is on the ropes, [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6984.320000000001s)]
*  I go down to five a little bit. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6986.92s)]
*  And then when he comes off the ropes, I go to six. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6989.04s)]
*  And when he starts firing away, I go to eight. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6991.240000000001s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6993.08s)]
*  It's up and down a lot. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6993.92s)]
*  And it's very good for your heart. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6995.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's very good for anxiety. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=6997.56s)]
*  There's a thing. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7000.36s)]
*  Yeah, there's a thing about exercise before any big event. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7001.2s)]
*  I think it burns off all the residual, [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7004.76s)]
*  ancillary, unnecessary stress. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7008.36s)]
*  Because there's like a certain amount of stress [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7011.4s)]
*  that I think people just naturally carry in their bodies. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7012.84s)]
*  And if you don't exercise, [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7015.8s)]
*  you're going to have a certain amount of tension [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7017.12s)]
*  and a little weirdness that it's just energy. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7019.68s)]
*  Because your body's designed to run away [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7023.04s)]
*  from fucking saber-toothed tigers and fight off villagers. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7024.52s)]
*  That's the body that we're dealing with today [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7027.96s)]
*  is the same body that people had 10, 15,000 years ago. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7031.12s)]
*  I think what's special about humans [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7034.32s)]
*  is that some of us try that extra step. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7036.92s)]
*  In other words, every animal has that. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7039.8s)]
*  If there's trouble, get the fuck away. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7041.88s)]
*  They have a calculation in their heads. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7044.6s)]
*  Who can I take and who can't I? [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7046.72s)]
*  So sometimes there's a confrontation. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7049.52s)]
*  This guy's a match for me, so I'm gonna, [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7052.56s)]
*  you know, like two bears fighting. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7054.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7055.6s)]
*  So they have that thing. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7056.52s)]
*  But humans go like, if I try to hang in there, [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7059.240000000001s)]
*  if I hide or if I, you know, [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7062.320000000001s)]
*  I might be able to get something out of this. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7064.4800000000005s)]
*  Like it's worth doing something dangerous. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7066.280000000001s)]
*  It's worth going not, it's worth resisting fight or flight. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7068.84s)]
*  Because if I'm still hanging around [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7073.56s)]
*  after the flashpoint moment is over, [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7075.120000000001s)]
*  I might be able to do something that somebody else couldn't do. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7078.160000000001s)]
*  That's a very human thing, [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7081.2s)]
*  is to think past the fight or flight moment. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7082.76s)]
*  And also being able to like not confront somebody, [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7085.96s)]
*  like the guy in the cafeteria. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7087.8s)]
*  Like do I need to fight or flight? [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7090.76s)]
*  Is there something else? [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7093.92s)]
*  That's I think particularly human. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7094.84s)]
*  It's like, can I just, I mean, [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7096.72s)]
*  maybe there's gorillas that do it, I have no idea. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7098.2s)]
*  Or elephants. Probably not. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7101.12s)]
*  Probably not, I don't know. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7102.16s)]
*  No, it's probably a human thing. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7103.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's just going like, I could fight, I could flight. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7103.92s)]
*  He looks like he wants to fight. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7107.5599999999995s)]
*  But if I just wait a few extra seconds and let, [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7109.88s)]
*  and keep my, if I can discipline my heart rate, [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7113.360000000001s)]
*  and not listen to the reptile and just cool off, [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7117.32s)]
*  I might be able to get something out of this. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7120.96s)]
*  I think that's what helps me on stage. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7122.32s)]
*  Because there's a fight or flight moment when I do, [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7124.360000000001s)]
*  you know, an abortion joke or something, [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7127.12s)]
*  and everyone's just upset that I brought it up. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7128.76s)]
*  And I'm like, that's all right. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7131.4800000000005s)]
*  I've seen this, that comes from experience. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7133.2s)]
*  I've seen this. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7134.68s)]
*  I know there's a moment past this that's worth it. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7136.400000000001s)]
*  That payoff is extra sweet. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7138.8s)]
*  It's huge, because nobody does it. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7140.320000000001s)]
*  I mean, a lot of people do it, but it's rarer. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7142.200000000001s)]
*  It's rare. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7144.72s)]
*  And then when you do get that juicy payoff, [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7145.56s)]
*  yes, it's so much better than something [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7148.360000000001s)]
*  that's easy to get to. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7150.92s)]
*  Yes, which has its own charm. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7152.84s)]
*  Yeah, there's nothing wrong with a good, easy joke. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7155.84s)]
*  I enjoy all kinds of jokes. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7158.360000000001s)]
*  So do I. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7160.400000000001s)]
*  Jim Gaffigan is one of my favorite guys, [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7161.240000000001s)]
*  because he just keeps, hey, he keeps coming. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7162.56s)]
*  He's got this constant flow. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7164.72s)]
*  Huge laugh, but he walks past it. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7167.84s)]
*  He's one of my favorites. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7170.6s)]
*  He's great. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7171.68s)]
*  And it's such an interest. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7172.52s)]
*  No one else has quite that, [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7173.56s)]
*  that talking and talking. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7175.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7177.8s)]
*  You know, very different. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7178.64s)]
*  Brian Regan's another killer clean guy, [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7179.4800000000005s)]
*  but it's punchier, you know? [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7181.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7183.32s)]
*  And it's a whole other thing. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7184.16s)]
*  Gaffigan's like, oh, you ever notice? [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7185.0s)]
*  There's a misnomer about, or whatever you wanna call it, [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7187.92s)]
*  about dirty comedy being easy. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7190.52s)]
*  I don't buy that. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7192.12s)]
*  I don't buy it. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7193.12s)]
*  When comedians say, like clean comedians [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7193.96s)]
*  or comedians that are purists say, [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7196.0s)]
*  well, that's an easy laugh, [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7198.96s)]
*  because it's about dicks. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7200.16s)]
*  I always wanna say, well, you do it. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7202.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7204.6s)]
*  Go up and get the easy laughs with the dirty shit. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7205.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7208.12s)]
*  It's not, this thing is an easy laugh. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7208.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7210.64s)]
*  There's none. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7211.48s)]
*  Joey Diaz used to do this bit about [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7212.32s)]
*  what he called doing the pigeon. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7214.08s)]
*  And he goes, that's when you're eating [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7216.08s)]
*  a girl's monkey from behind. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7217.0s)]
*  You stick your nose in her asshole like a fucking pigeon. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7218.32s)]
*  And somebody who said that about it, like, oh God, [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7221.28s)]
*  why is he talking about it? [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7226.84s)]
*  I go, you think that's easy to do? [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7227.679999999999s)]
*  Do you know how hard it is to be that person, [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7229.48s)]
*  to go on stage and talk about stuffing his nose [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7231.719999999999s)]
*  in a girl's asshole when you're eating her pussy from behind? [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7234.32s)]
*  Yeah, and also it's just another subject, [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7236.719999999999s)]
*  and it's a pungent subject, [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7238.36s)]
*  because sex is a pungent, [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7240.4s)]
*  and it excites people and it scares people. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7241.599999999999s)]
*  What people don't like about dirty jokes, [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7244.08s)]
*  they're really hard to follow with clean jokes. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7245.96s)]
*  If you're a fucking pussy and you're not paying attention. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7248.4s)]
*  Yes. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7252.2s)]
*  Because anybody who's killing, [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7253.04s)]
*  comics are so stupid that they think, I can't follow that. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7254.719999999999s)]
*  When somebody's killing, if you have your head on straight, [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7259.679999999999s)]
*  you're gonna have a great time. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7263.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, because the audience is primed. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7264.719999999999s)]
*  They're excited. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7266.0s)]
*  They're having a good time. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7266.839999999999s)]
*  And they don't think like, hmm, this guy. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7267.66s)]
*  They're not thinking in your stupid and secure brain, [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7269.4s)]
*  like, huh, I bet this guy's not as good. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7272.5599999999995s)]
*  They're just thinking, hey, another guy. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7274.5199999999995s)]
*  And if you're doing something very different, [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7276.599999999999s)]
*  they're like, cool, here's another way to. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7279.36s)]
*  Right. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7280.759999999999s)]
*  Like, I learned that, because I was the same. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7281.599999999999s)]
*  I was scared of certain guys. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7283.36s)]
*  I worked with a guy named John, something, Ayers. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7284.639999999999s)]
*  John Ayers, maybe. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7287.5599999999995s)]
*  He was a Connecticut comedian. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7288.92s)]
*  There's certain comedians that were like Connecticut guys. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7290.24s)]
*  Yeah, weird guys. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7292.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7293.679999999999s)]
*  And he was, he opened, it was the Nanuette Holiday Inn. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7294.5199999999995s)]
*  This is the 90s when comedy had just fallen out. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7300.36s)]
*  Remember all the clubs? [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7303.48s)]
*  Catch closed, the improv closed. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7304.839999999999s)]
*  Yep. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7307.08s)]
*  And I was, had been in it too long to quit. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7308.4800000000005s)]
*  And now I was doing like $100 gigs out of town. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7311.4800000000005s)]
*  So I was at the Nanuette for a whole week, [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7315.0s)]
*  like Wednesday through Sunday with Tom Ayers, Tom Ayers. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7317.32s)]
*  Nice guy too, I liked him. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7321.6s)]
*  And his closing bit, he was opening for me, [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7323.2s)]
*  and he would just annihilate. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7325.88s)]
*  And his closing bit was he had a banjo [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7328.72s)]
*  and he would do dueling banjos. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7333.08s)]
*  So he had a hat on that was like a helicopter [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7335.28s)]
*  with hooks that he put a cow on, like a stuffed cow. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7339.88s)]
*  And he'd go, and on the tape would go, [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7346.16s)]
*  moo, moo, moo, moo, moo, moo, moo, moo, moo, [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7349.32s)]
*  and then he'd put it, then he'd move the thing [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7351.2s)]
*  and put it on a cat. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7352.48s)]
*  Meow, meow, meow, meow. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7353.679999999999s)]
*  And so each animal, and at the end he's spinning, [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7354.5199999999995s)]
*  the thing is spinning on his head, [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7357.5599999999995s)]
*  and he's playing, and all the animals are, [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7359.5599999999995s)]
*  and people are going, ah, ah. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7362.84s)]
*  You see them so excited, and at the end [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7364.24s)]
*  he'd play a big finished da, da, da, da, da, da, [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7366.4s)]
*  and he'd raise his leg and on the tape was a big fart. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7368.32s)]
*  Made no sense. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7372.32s)]
*  Big fart at the end, and the people would get up, [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7374.0s)]
*  just stamp and applaud. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7377.679999999999s)]
*  And I think Keith Robinson was emceeing for me, [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7378.96s)]
*  he's opening for me at MSG now, I mean on the 20th. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7384.48s)]
*  Keith was like, you want me to do some time, [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7388.719999999999s)]
*  and I'm like, bring me right up. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7391.48s)]
*  It was the first time I watched a guy really just go for it [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7394.0s)]
*  like that, and I thought, it's beautiful, I loved it. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7397.04s)]
*  And there's joy in it, and the audience is so happy, [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7400.04s)]
*  so I started telling them, bring me right up. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7403.08s)]
*  Give no pause. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7405.16s)]
*  People would barely hear him introduce me. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7406.5599999999995s)]
*  And I'd be out to people going, oh, oh, [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7410.0s)]
*  just like dying, and I'd just look at them, [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7413.16s)]
*  and I had great sets after Tom Ayers. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7415.2s)]
*  You rode the wave. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7418.599999999999s)]
*  I did. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7419.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, that's what people have to realize, [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7420.4s)]
*  to just ride the wave. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7422.2s)]
*  Comics tend to think of things, [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7424.28s)]
*  a lot of comics are narcissists, [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7426.84s)]
*  and they think of themselves [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7428.24s)]
*  more than they think of anything else. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7429.36s)]
*  And they also, they have a famine mentality. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7431.16s)]
*  What's that? [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7434.84s)]
*  Famine mentality means there's only enough for one person, [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7435.679999999999s)]
*  like there's not enough for everybody. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7438.32s)]
*  It's a weird way to think of the world. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7440.04s)]
*  It's a terrible way to think of the world. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7441.48s)]
*  It's so wrong, and it's so self-serving, [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7442.84s)]
*  and it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7446.04s)]
*  If you really do believe [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7449.84s)]
*  that there's only so much out there, [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7451.12s)]
*  you'll act as if. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7453.2s)]
*  And you'll give up. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7455.04s)]
*  Yeah, and you'll start to alienate people around you, [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7456.16s)]
*  because people know that you're really [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7461.0s)]
*  just thinking about yourself. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7462.04s)]
*  You get real weird, and then people get weird around you. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7463.68s)]
*  They don't feel comfortable. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7466.4800000000005s)]
*  When you're happy for people, [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7468.68s)]
*  genuinely happy for people, better things happen. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7469.92s)]
*  Everybody feels good. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7472.56s)]
*  No, I always tell comics [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7473.56s)]
*  when you're watching the guy before you, [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7474.84s)]
*  and you're thinking, what a piece. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7478.08s)]
*  If you shit on a comic to the person next to you, [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7479.32s)]
*  you're gonna bomb. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7482.5599999999995s)]
*  I've seen that happen a million times. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7483.599999999999s)]
*  Somebody's on stage, and the guy next to me is going, [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7485.48s)]
*  God, I hate this, I hate when he says this. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7487.04s)]
*  And they go on, and they have a shitty set. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7489.719999999999s)]
*  Because you're angry. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7491.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's the last thing you should be thinking about. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7492.32s)]
*  And also, some comedians, [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7495.84s)]
*  a lot of us are frustrated we wish we were like rock stars. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7497.4s)]
*  So we wanna look cool up there, [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7499.639999999999s)]
*  but nobody wants you to look cool. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7502.12s)]
*  Nobody wants to look cool. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7503.4s)]
*  They just wanna laugh. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7504.36s)]
*  But the looking cool thing is because [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7506.12s)]
*  you don't wanna feel like a piece of shit, [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7508.12s)]
*  and you do so you decide, I wanna look cool, [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7510.32s)]
*  so that way I won't be a piece of shit. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7512.48s)]
*  And then you go up there and you just ruin the vibe. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7514.48s)]
*  It's so complicated. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7520.0s)]
*  There's so much going on with comedy. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7521.4s)]
*  There's so much going on with every phrase [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7524.32s)]
*  and everything you say. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7527.12s)]
*  It's really like mass hypnosis. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7527.96s)]
*  That's really what's going on. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7529.92s)]
*  Yeah, there are some I've kinda gotten realized [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7531.12s)]
*  in the last few years. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7535.599999999999s)]
*  Because I'm in deep now, 38 years into it. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7537.08s)]
*  And there's like you get another, [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7541.6s)]
*  it's like Scientology when they tell you about the aliens. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7543.2s)]
*  You gotta get really deep in. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7545.8s)]
*  You start to go, oh, there's shit about standup [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7549.0s)]
*  I didn't know. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7552.2s)]
*  And one of them is that there's some automatic laughs [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7553.4s)]
*  that you're getting. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7556.64s)]
*  And you gotta be careful with that. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7558.08s)]
*  Right, just timing laughs. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7559.72s)]
*  Yeah, you're just getting some laughs [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7561.08s)]
*  because like tags. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7562.36s)]
*  A lot of tags are just like, [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7564.2s)]
*  all you're doing is spending that dollar again. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7565.72s)]
*  And they'll laugh for you. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7569.200000000001s)]
*  And also, they're nice people. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7570.04s)]
*  The comedy audience automatically is a pretty nice person. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7573.4800000000005s)]
*  They have fun. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7577.200000000001s)]
*  Well, and also they came to sit [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7578.12s)]
*  and in this day and age of like staring into it, [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7580.200000000001s)]
*  they put their phone down for the most part. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7582.200000000001s)]
*  And they sit with strangers like shoulder to shoulder [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7584.76s)]
*  and they listen to a fucking person. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7588.0s)]
*  For sometimes two hours, they're just listening. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7591.16s)]
*  It's a very giving, you know? [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7593.84s)]
*  People that can't, there's people that can't do that. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7595.96s)]
*  Like sit in a comedy audience. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7598.28s)]
*  They're constantly, you know, [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7600.08s)]
*  like people you see leaving their table constantly. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7601.12s)]
*  And some people, they just not built for it. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7604.64s)]
*  But it takes a very patient and giving person. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7607.4400000000005s)]
*  So they'll laugh. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7610.2s)]
*  And I think about this when I do shit [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7611.68s)]
*  that's really fucked up and I get some laughs, [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7613.4800000000005s)]
*  but I look at them and I go, [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7616.32s)]
*  you didn't wanna laugh at that, [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7617.76s)]
*  but you did it for me. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7618.8s)]
*  You did it for me. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7620.08s)]
*  And especially if they're your fans. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7621.400000000001s)]
*  But also like I have, my ex-girlfriend was my dear friend. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7623.84s)]
*  She's a comedian in France. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7627.5199999999995s)]
*  Her name is Blanche Gardin. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7629.04s)]
*  She's a hilarious comedian. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7630.24s)]
*  She's a huge star in France. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7632.36s)]
*  She's like the biggest star there. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7633.88s)]
*  And I used to go see her do shows. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7636.16s)]
*  I saw her about 10 times in French. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7638.6s)]
*  And I would sit in the audience and watch her [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7641.32s)]
*  and I'd laugh really hard [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7643.28s)]
*  and I don't know anything that she's saying. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7644.64s)]
*  And I'm not fake laughing. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7647.12s)]
*  I'm just, it's hypnosis. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7649.12s)]
*  I start getting into it. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7650.92s)]
*  She's got a rhythm and she's really good at it. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7652.24s)]
*  And so there's ways that she's doing this stuff [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7656.84s)]
*  and then she's building a thing. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7659.32s)]
*  And I'm just find myself laughing with the people also [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7660.92s)]
*  cause they're laughing. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7664.04s)]
*  But also I just, I was honestly laughing really hard [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7664.88s)]
*  at something. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7669.08s)]
*  I didn't know what they were saying. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7669.92s)]
*  So I know that there's this armature under the jokes. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7671.2s)]
*  That's just a, it's a trick. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7675.5199999999995s)]
*  It's a bit of a trick. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7677.32s)]
*  There's definitely that, [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7678.96s)]
*  but there's also if you are genuinely having a good time [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7680.32s)]
*  and you're genuinely locked into these ideas, [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7684.24s)]
*  like you are not thinking about anything else. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7687.2s)]
*  You're thinking about those ideas [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7689.5s)]
*  and that makes its way into other people's minds. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7690.92s)]
*  Yeah, when you do, when that's to me the goal. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7694.0s)]
*  Every show to break out of the rhythm [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7697.56s)]
*  and try to be saying this stuff and really feeling it. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7700.36s)]
*  Yeah, you have to be actually thinking about it [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7703.24s)]
*  in the moment. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7704.84s)]
*  When you're not, they can tell. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7705.68s)]
*  Yes, they can. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7707.2s)]
*  There's some weird way they can tell. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7708.04s)]
*  It's a weird thing about what an audience can, [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7710.84s)]
*  but sometimes you think they can, [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7713.88s)]
*  you think there's stuff going on on stage [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7715.32s)]
*  that's not going on. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7717.84s)]
*  Right, yeah, it's cause it's in your head. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7718.8s)]
*  It's in your head and you're in a very weird place. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7720.64s)]
*  On stage it's like being a pilot in 20 G's. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7723.44s)]
*  It's like your brain's not working properly. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7726.28s)]
*  You're being a pilot, but you're also a passenger too. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7728.5s)]
*  Cause you're kind of like riding this thing. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7730.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7732.68s)]
*  You want to steer it, but you're also kind of riding it. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7733.5199999999995s)]
*  You're in it with them. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7736.16s)]
*  The best, you're in it with them. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7737.12s)]
*  You're like, right? [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7739.08s)]
*  It is a mass hypnosis. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7742.6s)]
*  I really think it is. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7744.04s)]
*  I think it's very difficult to trick people on stage. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7745.44s)]
*  I think you can trick people for a little while, [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7748.48s)]
*  but after a while they kind of figure out who you really are. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7750.24s)]
*  Yeah, well it's like pitching. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7752.72s)]
*  I think at comedy they like pitching a lot. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7753.84s)]
*  They'll time your fastball after a while. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7755.28s)]
*  They see it. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7757.4s)]
*  It's like, you know when there's a new phenom [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7758.24s)]
*  that gets put in a game and he strikes everybody out. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7760.04s)]
*  But by the sixth inning, they've all been up twice. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7764.6s)]
*  Right. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7767.88s)]
*  And they just start killing the ball. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7768.72s)]
*  That's most comics. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7770.4400000000005s)]
*  They figure out how to pitch. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7772.320000000001s)]
*  But after a while the audience goes, [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7775.16s)]
*  I am, I know what you're doing. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7776.52s)]
*  But if you can be like, what's his name, [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7778.24s)]
*  El Duque in the Yankees, like many arm angles, [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7779.84s)]
*  not sure where it's coming from. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7782.16s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7783.64s)]
*  I think of some jokes as brushback pitches. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7784.72s)]
*  Some stuff where they just go, what the fuck was that? [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7788.04s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7791.24s)]
*  And some of those jokes you don't come back and fix them. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7792.84s)]
*  You just let them be upset and you go, [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7796.32s)]
*  yeah, I'll do that, just watch it. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7797.68s)]
*  I'll fucking do that. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7799.96s)]
*  That wasn't even to make you laugh. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7801.96s)]
*  You now know what I'm gonna do. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7804.5199999999995s)]
*  So don't dig in too easy. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7805.96s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7807.88s)]
*  They're off balance. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7809.0s)]
*  You can get them different ways. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7809.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7812.12s)]
*  We talked about, you at one point in time thought about [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7813.0s)]
*  opening up a comedy club? [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7815.68s)]
*  Yeah, cause you're opening one here. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7817.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, you thought about it? [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7818.8s)]
*  When? [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7819.72s)]
*  I thought about it when I saw the Babe Ruth movie [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7821.38s)]
*  with John Goodman. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7826.1s)]
*  Did you ever see that movie? [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7827.0199999999995s)]
*  No. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7827.86s)]
*  He played Babe Ruth. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7828.7s)]
*  And I don't know how much truth there is in it, [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7829.9s)]
*  but he wanted to manage a ball team. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7831.78s)]
*  John Goodman was such a good actor. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7836.06s)]
*  And he does this moment where he says, [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7837.86s)]
*  I just wanna, I love the guys. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7839.62s)]
*  I wanna take care of the guys. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7841.42s)]
*  I wanna be the guy who looks after them [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7843.18s)]
*  and trains them and makes sure they're okay. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7845.9s)]
*  Cause he just loved ball players. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7849.82s)]
*  I watched him do that and I thought, [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7851.7s)]
*  that's how I feel about comedy. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7853.7s)]
*  I'd like to have a club and start, [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7855.0599999999995s)]
*  like be the place where new guys come in [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7858.0599999999995s)]
*  and new people and watching them [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7860.099999999999s)]
*  and encouraging awkward comedians [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7863.7s)]
*  that aren't easy laughers. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7866.3s)]
*  Right. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7868.74s)]
*  And being a place and bringing in great veterans [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7871.58s)]
*  for them to learn from and you know what I mean? [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7873.94s)]
*  And feeding and cultivating an audience. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7875.78s)]
*  I watched a lot of guys do that. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7877.94s)]
*  Like Manny and The Cellar [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7879.86s)]
*  and Lucian Holden in the comic strip. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7881.5s)]
*  These, some of my best friends were comedy club owners. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7883.259999999999s)]
*  Guys I respected so much were guys that ran clubs. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7888.219999999999s)]
*  So I thought that would be really cool. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7892.66s)]
*  But it's a very, I mean opening a fucking business [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7894.66s)]
*  is horrible. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7898.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7900.219999999999s)]
*  I don't wanna do that now. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7901.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I don't wanna either, but I'm stuck. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7902.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7904.9s)]
*  I already started doing it. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7905.74s)]
*  Are you anxious about it? [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7906.58s)]
*  Surprisingly not that anxious. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7908.66s)]
*  No. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7910.38s)]
*  Yeah, I have an unusual ability to handle a lot of stress. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7911.22s)]
*  Like I just kinda like settle in to whatever that is. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7915.74s)]
*  I know what you mean. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7919.3s)]
*  And I go, okay, this is what we're doing. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7920.14s)]
*  I can not freak out. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7922.1s)]
*  And so this is not that stressful [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7923.9s)]
*  because I got really good people here. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7926.5s)]
*  I brought Curtis Nelson and Adam Eget [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7928.78s)]
*  and Eric from the Comedy Store. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7931.5s)]
*  All these people from the Comedy Store [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7933.66s)]
*  to carry to run the bar. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7935.1s)]
*  I brought the best people that were at the Comedy Store. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7936.3s)]
*  And I just said, because it was during the pandemic, [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7938.860000000001s)]
*  nobody was working. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7940.580000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7941.5s)]
*  I said, hey, this is what I'm gonna do. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7942.34s)]
*  Do you guys wanna work for me? [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7943.9400000000005s)]
*  And so for the last year and a half, [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7945.14s)]
*  they've been actually working for free. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7947.3s)]
*  Wow. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7949.700000000001s)]
*  They've been getting paid, but they haven't working. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7950.54s)]
*  They're not working. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7953.900000000001s)]
*  They've just been waiting to work. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7954.740000000001s)]
*  You're just holding them. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7955.740000000001s)]
*  Right, but I kept giving them their full salary. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7956.900000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7959.18s)]
*  I just said, this is not your problem. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7960.02s)]
*  We had an initial venue that fell apart. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7962.3s)]
*  So we had to buy a second venue. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7965.86s)]
*  And the second venue required considerable construction. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7966.7s)]
*  So I said, listen, this is okay. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7969.54s)]
*  We're gonna have fun. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7972.259999999999s)]
*  So let's just do this the right way. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7973.099999999999s)]
*  And I want everybody to be comfortable. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7974.86s)]
*  And now we're less than a month away. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7976.66s)]
*  That's amazing. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7979.299999999999s)]
*  It's pretty exciting. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7980.139999999999s)]
*  And it's really good. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7981.139999999999s)]
*  The inside looks fucking incredible. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7982.379999999999s)]
*  And the scene here is already amazing. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7984.099999999999s)]
*  I mean, I did the Vulcan last night. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7986.099999999999s)]
*  And then after I did a set there, [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7988.74s)]
*  I went over to the creek in the cave. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7989.98s)]
*  And then there's other rooms in town too. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7991.379999999999s)]
*  And guys are hopping back and forth [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7993.179999999999s)]
*  from room to room and doing two, three sets a night. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7995.14s)]
*  It's really exciting. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7997.54s)]
*  And there's really good comics here. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=7998.98s)]
*  There's really good up and coming people. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8001.0599999999995s)]
*  And Tom Segura moved here. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8003.3s)]
*  Duncan Trussell moved here. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8005.58s)]
*  Tim Dillon lives here now. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8006.9s)]
*  Christina Pszczyski. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8008.7s)]
*  There's a lot of really good comics. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8009.94s)]
*  Tony Hinchcliffe. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8011.82s)]
*  So we're doing these shows. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8013.3s)]
*  Ron White is here. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8014.46s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8015.9s)]
*  He came to see me at the creek in the cave last night. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8016.74s)]
*  Oh, did he? [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8018.86s)]
*  He's one of my favorites. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8019.7s)]
*  He's the best. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8020.54s)]
*  He's the godfather of this town. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8021.36s)]
*  So when we're doing these shows, [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8023.3s)]
*  we're doing shows like Shane Gillis comes into town [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8025.46s)]
*  all the time and Ari's here all the time. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8028.18s)]
*  So we're having so much fun. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8030.22s)]
*  It's really an amazing scene right now. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8031.42s)]
*  And it's exciting because it's new. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8033.66s)]
*  And all these young people that come here [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8036.06s)]
*  and they do Kill Tony, that show. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8037.780000000001s)]
*  And so that gives them a chance to maybe get one minute [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8040.860000000001s)]
*  and do it in front of hundreds of thousands [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8043.34s)]
*  of people on YouTube. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8044.780000000001s)]
*  So there's like this energy to this town [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8046.02s)]
*  that's happening now at standup that's really exciting [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8048.9800000000005s)]
*  because it's a completely new scene. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8051.5s)]
*  It's great. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8053.38s)]
*  Well, like you said, you can't practice it at home. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8054.22s)]
*  It's the only way to learn it. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8058.14s)]
*  So I always feel a responsibility in that sense. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8059.94s)]
*  If you love standup, you gotta encourage other people. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8063.38s)]
*  I bring people on the road with me [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8067.22s)]
*  who I think need exposure to higher pressure and stuff [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8068.7s)]
*  and to help them learn and also to tap my head. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8072.26s)]
*  And I spend the whole time talking to them [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8077.02s)]
*  and answering stuff and stuff like that. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8079.38s)]
*  And when I'm at the cellar, I try to, I like mentoring. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8082.18s)]
*  I like being a bit of a teacher. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8083.9400000000005s)]
*  But you have to because there's no school for it [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8086.02s)]
*  and there's no... [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8088.46s)]
*  Which is wild. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8089.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there never will be. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8090.74s)]
*  I don't think anybody will ever properly, [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8091.9400000000005s)]
*  you can't really teach standup. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8093.78s)]
*  It comes from the heart or the balls or the pussy [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8095.5s)]
*  or wherever it comes from. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8098.66s)]
*  Well, how do you do it? [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8099.5s)]
*  Do you do it like Steve Martin? [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8100.34s)]
*  Or do you do it like Steven Wright? [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8101.16s)]
*  Or do you do it like Patrice O'Neil? [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8102.58s)]
*  Like you can't teach that. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8104.06s)]
*  No. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8105.38s)]
*  You can teach like certain principles [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8106.22s)]
*  and you can kind of coach people [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8107.54s)]
*  in whatever their individual style is [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8108.82s)]
*  and sort of giving them some tips. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8112.02s)]
*  Like maybe if you did it this way [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8112.860000000001s)]
*  or here's the problem with that [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8114.3s)]
*  or you're taking too much time with this. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8115.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there's obvious mistakes people make. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8117.58s)]
*  And you can help them by giving them that. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8119.9800000000005s)]
*  So I'm like, you don't need to be doing that. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8122.9800000000005s)]
*  That's a big, giant waste of time. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8125.06s)]
*  One thing I've told a few guys and women that work for me [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8127.02s)]
*  is stop laughing. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8129.740000000001s)]
*  You're just nervous. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8132.18s)]
*  That's just shit. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8133.14s)]
*  You know, a little nervous laughter. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8133.9800000000005s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8136.18s)]
*  It just looks dumb and it's just, do the joke. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8137.02s)]
*  That nervous laughter is because you said something [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8141.26s)]
*  that's kind of tough to sell. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8143.18s)]
*  Fucking stand there and sell it. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8145.46s)]
*  Or just say, that's the joke. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8146.78s)]
*  Like Adrienne Appaloochit opens for me a lot. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8149.34s)]
*  She's hilarious. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8152.82s)]
*  Very funny. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8154.18s)]
*  And she's really hard to take for a lot of, [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8155.02s)]
*  for my crowd who are there to be offended. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8157.74s)]
*  What I love doing, whenever Adrienne's on stage, [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8161.58s)]
*  I'm right behind her, behind the curtain. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8164.9s)]
*  And I'm standing there where I can really hear, [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8167.46s)]
*  because she does these jokes and people go, oh! [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8169.22s)]
*  She does this thing about how Jeffrey, [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8171.820000000001s)]
*  how white women, about racism and white women are the worst [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8177.5s)]
*  and that we don't have enough serial killers [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8181.9400000000005s)]
*  because they always kill white women. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8184.34s)]
*  And it boils down to, when you think about it, [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8186.1s)]
*  Jeffrey Dahmer did more for black people [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8189.14s)]
*  than Martin Luther King because he killed white women. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8190.900000000001s)]
*  And, and- [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8194.34s)]
*  But he didn't. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8195.54s)]
*  What? [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8196.380000000001s)]
*  Jeffrey Dahmer didn't kill white women. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8197.220000000001s)]
*  Oh, I don't know. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8198.5s)]
*  Ted Bundy? [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8199.34s)]
*  Not Ted Bundy, yeah. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8200.18s)]
*  I'm fucking up her bit. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8201.02s)]
*  I'm destroying her bit. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8201.86s)]
*  Anyway, it's a hilarious bit, [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8203.34s)]
*  but any audience goes like, Jesus! [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8204.74s)]
*  And I love hearing them, [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8207.46s)]
*  because she's really loosening them up. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8209.42s)]
*  She's really fucking doing deep knee bends, [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8211.06s)]
*  getting them warmed up. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8214.34s)]
*  But she used to kind of nervously laugh after certain jokes, [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8217.58s)]
*  which showed a little insecurity on her part. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8220.94s)]
*  Like, maybe I shouldn't be saying this. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8223.02s)]
*  And I told her, just do the fucking joke and stand there. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8224.46s)]
*  Like, that's it. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8227.82s)]
*  That's what I said. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8228.86s)]
*  That's what I said. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8230.38s)]
*  And some early jokes, people were having a hitch with it, [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8231.22s)]
*  but they see that confidence in you, [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8236.02s)]
*  and they go, I guess she doesn't give a fuck. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8239.14s)]
*  I guess she really means it. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8241.74s)]
*  And they start to come around. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8243.539999999999s)]
*  That's my favorite thing, [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8247.98s)]
*  is how do comics that don't belong up there get good at it? [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8249.06s)]
*  That's where great comedy comes from, [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8252.66s)]
*  is somebody who's not a ham and who's not, [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8255.06s)]
*  even into performing much, [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8257.98s)]
*  but they just want to do this one thing. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8260.3s)]
*  Those are where some of the better comics come from, [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8262.66s)]
*  I think. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8265.1s)]
*  And then they figure it out. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8265.94s)]
*  And it's so exciting to watch them figure it out. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8266.779999999999s)]
*  It's so exciting to watch someone go from being like, [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8269.02s)]
*  he used to be like, guys who were like a doorman [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8271.619999999999s)]
*  at the comedy store. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8273.42s)]
*  And then you see them six, seven years later, [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8275.14s)]
*  and you haven't seen them for a while, [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8276.779999999999s)]
*  and all of a sudden they're killing. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8277.86s)]
*  And they've got interesting points, [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8278.98s)]
*  and they've got great bits. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8280.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8282.42s)]
*  It's great to watch. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8283.26s)]
*  It's a fun art form, man. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8284.26s)]
*  It's still my favorite thing to watch [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8285.78s)]
*  after all these years. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8287.7s)]
*  I still enjoy it. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8288.86s)]
*  And I didn't for a while, [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8289.7s)]
*  in the beginning. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8292.7s)]
*  In the beginning I didn't, [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8294.18s)]
*  because of jealousy and insecurity. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8295.42s)]
*  I didn't want, [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8298.78s)]
*  if someone else was killing, [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8299.62s)]
*  I'd be like, god, I wish I thought of that. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8300.62s)]
*  God, I wish I was killing. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8302.34s)]
*  It was like a weird thing where I was too wrapped up [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8303.58s)]
*  in trying to get somewhere in comedy [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8307.060000000001s)]
*  that I didn't enjoy it anymore. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8310.26s)]
*  Right. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8311.54s)]
*  And then I realized, hey, stupid, [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8312.380000000001s)]
*  you got into comedy because you love watching it. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8314.38s)]
*  Why would you not still love watching it? [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8317.5s)]
*  Are you gonna give up loving watching it [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8320.099999999999s)]
*  because you like to do it? [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8322.22s)]
*  That's so stupid. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8323.38s)]
*  Yeah, I have written all over my notebook this year, [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8324.859999999999s)]
*  don't forget to love it. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8328.06s)]
*  I wrote it across the bottom of the page, [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8329.939999999999s)]
*  of all the pages one day, [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8332.14s)]
*  and on an airplane. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8333.699999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8334.9s)]
*  So as I'm writing notes, it's just there. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8335.74s)]
*  Because you do forget. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8337.9s)]
*  It's work, and it's hard. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8338.74s)]
*  And whatever you do for a living becomes a hassle. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8340.699999999999s)]
*  But you gotta love it. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8343.62s)]
*  Whatever you do in life becomes a hassle. [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8345.78s)]
*  One thing I always tell people is like, [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8348.300000000001s)]
*  the one thing that you think about the most when you're sick [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8350.26s)]
*  is, god, I wish I was healthy. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8353.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8355.980000000001s)]
*  When you're healthy, it just seems normal. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8356.900000000001s)]
*  It just is what it is. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8358.900000000001s)]
*  But when you get sick, you're like, oh god, this sucks. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8359.740000000002s)]
*  I can't wait to get healthy. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8364.7s)]
*  But when you're fucking healthy, [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8366.380000000001s)]
*  you've gotta do whatever you can to preserve that [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8370.380000000001s)]
*  and recognize that there's a possibility [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8374.06s)]
*  that you could get sick. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8376.3s)]
*  Appreciate the shit out of being healthy. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8377.86s)]
*  Well, and then with work though, with comedy, [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8380.74s)]
*  I feel like there's this other side, [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8382.82s)]
*  of the other side of the spectrum, [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8384.42s)]
*  which is that you should be willing to be very uncomfortable [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8385.58s)]
*  and very unhappy to do it right. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8387.86s)]
*  Because that's love. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8390.06s)]
*  That's real love. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8391.3s)]
*  But you're doing it, is my point. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8392.14s)]
*  If it took it away from you, [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8395.14s)]
*  like COVID when we couldn't do standup, [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8397.14s)]
*  well then that's you being sick. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8399.26s)]
*  Yes, that's right. That's what I'm saying. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8401.54s)]
*  Not that it should always be the most fun thing to do, [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8403.5s)]
*  the most, because exercise fucking blows. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8406.18s)]
*  Being healthy, sitting in a fucking sauna for 25 minutes [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8409.380000000001s)]
*  at 190 degrees and cold plunges [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8413.300000000001s)]
*  and all this shit that I do, it sucks. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8416.460000000001s)]
*  I don't like doing it, but I'm doing it [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8418.74s)]
*  because being healthy is far superior to being sick. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8420.900000000001s)]
*  But you forget. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8425.74s)]
*  You forget sometimes. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8427.140000000001s)]
*  But also it can be a bummer to be healthy. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8428.54s)]
*  It can be. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8433.660000000002s)]
*  How so? [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8434.5s)]
*  Well, I've had streaks where I'm like, [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8435.34s)]
*  I'm doing it all right. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8438.18s)]
*  And I'm not doing things that I know make me feel like shit. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8440.580000000002s)]
*  Like eating a bunch of pizza [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8443.380000000001s)]
*  that's just gonna flood me with sugar [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8444.78s)]
*  and slow me down and give me a headache [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8447.18s)]
*  and give me a depression that I end up curing [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8449.740000000002s)]
*  with a cigarette and then I can't move even more [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8452.060000000001s)]
*  and then I eat more. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8454.78s)]
*  And then it's a terrible thing. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8455.62s)]
*  And two weeks later I come out of a dungeon. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8457.46s)]
*  I gotta stop. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8459.82s)]
*  I can't believe I just wasted all that time. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8461.74s)]
*  But when I'm like, I'm doing it all right. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8464.619999999999s)]
*  I'm eating well, fucking salmon with brown rice, [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8467.539999999999s)]
*  a little bit of vegetables or whatever, [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8470.699999999999s)]
*  and drinking water with lemon [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8473.339999999998s)]
*  and staying away from drinks, no alcohol, [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8475.82s)]
*  sleeping without any help, all those good things. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8480.179999999998s)]
*  There's a dryness to that. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8484.779999999999s)]
*  After a while I just get cranky. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8486.740000000002s)]
*  I just feel like I want to indulge [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8488.300000000001s)]
*  and just get some sugar in you. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8493.54s)]
*  Yeah, moderation. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8496.140000000001s)]
*  Feeling like shit has its good points. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8496.980000000001s)]

*  Yeah, when you feel like, [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8502.300000000001s)]
*  you're like, what the fuck did I do that for? [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8503.5s)]
*  When you hit the bottom, there's a comfort in that. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8506.460000000001s)]
*  It's a bed. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8509.58s)]
*  The bottom is like a bed, do you know what I mean? [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8510.66s)]
*  I mean, not like alcoholics and drug addicts. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8512.62s)]
*  I don't know what it's like for them. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8515.1s)]
*  My little self abuses. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8517.06s)]
*  Every now and then getting off the rails. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8520.019999999999s)]
*  You just got it. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8521.9s)]
*  No, I like it. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8523.22s)]
*  I like doing that too, but I stay healthy. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8524.06s)]
*  That's good. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8526.779999999999s)]
*  But I do go off. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8527.619999999999s)]
*  I will eat pizza and fucking spaghetti and ice cream. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8530.019999999999s)]
*  I'll go crazy. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8533.339999999998s)]
*  This is the best thing in the world. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8534.179999999998s)]
*  But then I just self correct. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8535.019999999999s)]
*  I go, okay. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8536.859999999999s)]
*  I feel so bad when it's over. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8538.58s)]
*  When I eat a giant, a fucking big Italian sub [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8541.179999999998s)]
*  and a fucking 32-ounce Coca-Cola, [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8546.1s)]
*  I feel like hot dog shit. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8548.9s)]
*  No, it's the worst. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8551.1s)]
*  An hour and a half. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8551.94s)]
*  No, and then ice cream, which is my favorite thing. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8552.78s)]
*  I'm just, it's just Schittsville [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8555.14s)]
*  and it's burning hot shits for a week. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8558.22s)]
*  I pay hard for ice cream, so I don't do it often. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8562.06s)]
*  But there is, I don't know, [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8566.7s)]
*  I don't think it'll ever not be. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8568.42s)]
*  I still stay in shape and some discipline for a standup. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8569.98s)]
*  And I've got this thing at the garden, [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8573.46s)]
*  and to me that's like the big fight of my life. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8575.94s)]
*  That's the championship fight. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8577.22s)]
*  But when that's over and I take a year off, [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8579.380000000001s)]
*  I do, part of me thinks I might just Brando out. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8581.26s)]
*  I might get really fucking big. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8584.1s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8587.06s)]
*  You might do a reverse Bobby Kelly. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8587.9s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know, I don't know. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8589.74s)]
*  I hope not. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8591.42s)]
*  Sometimes I'm able to be more healthy [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8592.26s)]
*  when I'm not performing. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8593.98s)]
*  Because I go up state more and I get, [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8595.06s)]
*  I make my trail and I do my, [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8597.7s)]
*  that's better exercise than a gym anyway. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8600.82s)]
*  I think it's important to be healthy, [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8604.1s)]
*  but I also think it's important to enjoy yourself. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8605.58s)]
*  I think there's something about food pleasure, [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8608.1s)]
*  mouth pleasure from eating a big fucking bowl of rigatoni. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8610.74s)]
*  It's great, it tastes great. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8616.019999999999s)]
*  You just gotta know what's happening. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8617.42s)]
*  I like drinking, I enjoy drinking. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8619.58s)]
*  I like fucking tipping a few back with my friends. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8621.859999999999s)]
*  Cheers everyone, cheers. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8624.74s)]
*  I like doing a shot before I go on stage. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8626.26s)]
*  I enjoy it. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8628.06s)]
*  Yeah, but I know what I'm doing. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8629.14s)]
*  I know when it comes to the morning, [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8632.1s)]
*  I'm going to do everything I can to counteract that. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8634.06s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8636.26s)]
*  I do everything I can with vitamins. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8637.1s)]
*  I take IV vitamins and drips and I do all kinds of shit, [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8638.78s)]
*  but I keep it working right. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8642.06s)]
*  But I also use my body in a different way. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8644.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8647.54s)]
*  Because of Jiu Jitsu and martial arts. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8648.380000000001s)]
*  It's a vehicle for me. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8650.94s)]
*  I'm using it. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8652.26s)]
*  Well, we live weird lives too, [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8653.140000000001s)]
*  because most people can't, when we say things like, [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8655.1s)]
*  it's important to be healthy, [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8658.18s)]
*  but it's important to enjoy yourself. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8659.34s)]
*  Most people even can't have that conversation. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8661.02s)]
*  Right. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8663.300000000001s)]
*  Like most of the population is just fucking grinding. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8664.140000000001s)]
*  Just trying to live. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8667.34s)]
*  They're just dragging their bodies across broken glass [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8668.18s)]
*  and trying to like hand off just enough to their kids [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8670.300000000001s)]
*  and then fucking collapse in a heap of cancer. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8673.34s)]
*  Yeah, they're just trying to pay the bills. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8675.94s)]
*  They're just trying to pay the bills. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8677.54s)]
*  Just stay one step ahead of the gravedigger. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8678.78s)]
*  Or only two and a half steps behind. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8682.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8684.26s)]
*  That's how most people live. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8685.34s)]
*  Like I was talking to my French pal and I said, [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8686.7s)]
*  life is a zero sum game. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8689.980000000001s)]
*  It's something I believe is a zero sum game. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8691.26s)]
*  After you put in and it comes back, [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8693.74s)]
*  but you end up at zero. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8695.54s)]
*  Right. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8697.26s)]
*  She said, for a lot of people, [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8698.380000000001s)]
*  life is about a negative 500 sum game. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8699.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8703.18s)]
*  And it's true. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8704.02s)]
*  Some people, everything they can possibly do, [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8704.86s)]
*  they end up so fucked. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8706.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8708.9s)]
*  Just fucked for good. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8709.74s)]
*  And it's just life is fucked. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8710.62s)]
*  And because of that, [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8713.66s)]
*  you have this attitude that life is fucked. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8714.5s)]
*  So then that's a self-fulfilling prophecy. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8715.82s)]
*  I guess. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8718.26s)]
*  Negative attitude. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8719.380000000001s)]
*  Negative people. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8720.220000000001s)]
*  There's not much room for that kind of shit though [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8721.06s)]
*  in most people's lives. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8722.74s)]
*  But in America compared to everybody else, [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8724.06s)]
*  we're really doing great. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8726.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8728.54s)]
*  So we can have these long conversations [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8729.380000000001s)]
*  about what's the right way to think [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8731.34s)]
*  and what's the right way to live [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8732.9s)]
*  and all these many, many boutique things [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8735.1s)]
*  of here's how to feel better. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8738.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8739.94s)]
*  Because we're just kind of sitting around. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8740.78s)]
*  We're just consumers. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8742.66s)]
*  We're just consumers of the rest of the world. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8743.74s)]
*  I was watching this video [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8747.26s)]
*  where these guys were talking about, [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8748.140000000001s)]
*  Lex Friedman and Andrew Huberman [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8749.460000000001s)]
*  were talking about saunas and cold plunges [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8751.1s)]
*  and stuff like that. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8753.82s)]
*  And the benefits of it. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8754.66s)]
*  They're two scientists. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8756.02s)]
*  They're talking about the provable benefits, [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8757.86s)]
*  heat shock proteins, cold shock proteins. [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8761.02s)]
*  And then I read in the comments [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8762.86s)]
*  where some guy was like, [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8764.62s)]
*  yeah, well you guys aren't talking about [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8765.78s)]
*  how much it costs to buy a sauna. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8767.62s)]
*  You're making it seem like it's all free. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8770.1s)]
*  What are you supposed to do? [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8772.78s)]
*  Every fucking thing. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8774.380000000001s)]
*  I'm sorry if you're broke. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8776.220000000001s)]
*  Oh no, you have the conversation [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8777.5s)]
*  for people that can live that way. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8778.98s)]
*  Well I mean, it's not impossible to achieve. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8780.5s)]
*  We're not talking about buying a fucking Lamborghini. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8785.74s)]
*  But I'm not saying that there's something wrong [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8787.86s)]
*  with talking about that stuff [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8789.98s)]
*  because other people can't afford it. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8791.06s)]
*  That's not at all what I'm saying. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8792.34s)]
*  What I'm saying is that it's actually, [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8793.38s)]
*  part of why people are miserable [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8795.3s)]
*  is because they're actually, [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8797.02s)]
*  it's a ridiculous conversation. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8798.5s)]
*  It's a ridiculous, it's not like the worth [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8800.9s)]
*  and the experience of competing for food and oxygen [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8804.34s)]
*  and living on earth, and living in society [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8808.58s)]
*  and just being a person. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8811.74s)]
*  We've got to some altitude here [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8813.34s)]
*  where we're having some stupid conversations [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8816.58s)]
*  that are just, should I do a cold plunger of sauna? [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8819.22s)]
*  Like what the fuck is that? [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8823.74s)]
*  It's not that you should be ashamed [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8825.42s)]
*  because people can't afford it. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8827.62s)]
*  I feel sorry for the guy in that conversation. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8829.3s)]
*  It's like it's a ridiculous trying to find [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8832.220000000001s)]
*  just the right balance because there's nothing [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8834.5s)]
*  really challenging you. [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8836.18s)]
*  Because you don't have any real problems [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8838.460000000001s)]
*  and you're not on the earth. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8840.300000000001s)]
*  You're not standing on the earth anymore. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8841.5s)]
*  You're in a bubble where you sort of like, [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8842.86s)]
*  maybe I'll try this and maybe I'll just do protein now [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8845.62s)]
*  and I'll do, you know what I mean? [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8848.54s)]
*  And you'll never find a balance [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8850.26s)]
*  because that's not a normal life. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8852.300000000001s)]
*  That's not organic living. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8856.220000000001s)]
*  That's not living like a human being. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8857.62s)]
*  You don't have a choice because I mean. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8859.98s)]
*  What are you going to do, be poor on purpose? [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8862.82s)]
*  But you have a physical body. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8863.66s)]
*  And if you have a physical body, [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8865.18s)]
*  there's things that are beneficial to your physical body. [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8866.46s)]
*  And if you choose to do those things, [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8869.18s)]
*  you'll have a better body. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8870.779999999999s)]
*  It'll work better. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8871.66s)]
*  And if you choose not to do those things [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8872.58s)]
*  because you think they're ridiculous, [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8874.539999999999s)]
*  what do you think? [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8875.9s)]
*  That's not organic living. [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8876.74s)]
*  That's not life. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8878.14s)]
*  This is not life. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8879.1s)]
*  It is life. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8880.42s)]
*  It's life and people have invented shoes. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8881.26s)]
*  The reason why they invented shoes [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8883.14s)]
*  is because rocks will cut your feet. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8884.22s)]
*  So they figured out shoes. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8886.06s)]
*  Shoes are better than no shoes. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8887.14s)]
*  Getting in a sauna and getting in a cold plunge [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8889.06s)]
*  is better for the physical body than not doing it. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8891.26s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8894.26s)]
*  Lifting weights is better than not lifting weights [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8895.099999999999s)]
*  because then you develop a strong body [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8896.939999999999s)]
*  and don't lose your bone density. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8898.38s)]
*  100%, all true. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8899.22s)]
*  Like all these things are a part of life. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8900.06s)]
*  You can just decide they're not organic. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8902.5s)]
*  They're a part of life when you've removed yourself [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8904.34s)]
*  from the food chain and from real life. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8906.539999999999s)]
*  They become part of life. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8908.46s)]
*  If you're not getting eaten by tigers, yes. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8909.42s)]
*  That's right. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8911.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but like we already figured that out. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8912.619999999999s)]
*  So like as we move to becoming a multi-planetary species. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8914.34s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8917.74s)]
*  There's a lot of things that you're going to figure out. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8918.58s)]
*  Well, and also our predator now is each other. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8920.06s)]
*  So it's now, we're not anymore about other animals. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8922.34s)]
*  We're about killing each other. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8926.58s)]
*  And when you are about other animals, [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8928.58s)]
*  that's when you realize you've really fucked up. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8932.1s)]
*  Like we already sorted this out [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8934.06s)]
*  and here I am getting eaten by a tiger. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8935.66s)]
*  Yeah, you're a fucking idiot. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8937.66s)]
*  Yes, you're a fucking idiot [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8939.74s)]
*  if you're a human being being eaten by a tiger. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8941.1s)]
*  If you're a guy from Connecticut, [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8942.939999999999s)]
*  you're getting eaten by hyenas. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8944.5s)]
*  You've made a giant mistake. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8945.9s)]
*  That's right. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8947.18s)]
*  But I don't know. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8948.26s)]
*  I think part of it is just being an old guy [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8949.140000000001s)]
*  that I think like you get, [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8950.9s)]
*  you see certain signs that the game is over [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8952.82s)]
*  because people are starting to talk about [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8955.26s)]
*  such abstract forms of life. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8957.1s)]
*  And I can see that none of it satisfies anybody. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8959.9s)]
*  Abstract forms of life, how so? [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8963.1s)]
*  Abstract things like having your body [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8964.54s)]
*  at the right temperature [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8966.78s)]
*  and talking about different substances going in and out [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8968.140000000001s)]
*  and ways to, you know, [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8971.18s)]
*  and turning on oxygen in certain rooms. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8972.98s)]
*  Well, it's just to try to enjoy it more. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8974.82s)]
*  It's just to try to enjoy it more. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8976.02s)]
*  Yes, it is, but you won't ever get to [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8977.42s)]
*  what is fulfilling about life, I don't think. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8980.1s)]
*  That's not true. Through that stuff. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8983.3s)]
*  That's not true. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8984.66s)]
*  When you do those things, [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8986.02s)]
*  your body is more relaxed, it works better. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8987.82s)]
*  Sure. And you feel better. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8990.38s)]
*  Sure. It does with me. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8992.22s)]
*  When I, if I do- I understand, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8993.78s)]
*  When I do cold punches and I get out, [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8995.5s)]
*  you know what raises your dopamine 200% [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8997.14s)]
*  and it lasts for multiple hours? [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=8999.38s)]
*  Yes. You feel better. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9000.82s)]
*  You really feel better. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9003.94s)]
*  I don't even know what I'm saying. [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9004.78s)]
*  I just feel a thing about this. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9006.18s)]
*  I know what you're saying. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9007.78s)]
*  I feel a thing about it. [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9008.62s)]
*  But there's also a thing that people do and try to- [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9009.460000000001s)]
*  The last thing I'm doing is putting it down from like, [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9011.300000000001s)]
*  oh, you're so lucky you can have- [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9014.380000000001s)]
*  That's not what I mean. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9016.1s)]
*  No, no, no, but you're kind of dismissing it as being, [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9017.220000000001s)]
*  at the end of the day, it's all fucking bullshit anyway. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9020.66s)]
*  Kind of. It's just that it's just- [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9024.06s)]
*  Which is true. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9025.54s)]
*  I think that the most, I don't know, [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9026.380000000001s)]
*  there's a form of life. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9029.74s)]
*  It's a weird thing because you're not supposed to be happy [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9031.18s)]
*  and you're not supposed to be safe. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9034.5s)]
*  I think that that's the problem is that people expect that [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9036.98s)]
*  and it's not a good way to- [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9039.74s)]
*  You're not happy when you're safe. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9041.22s)]
*  You're not happy when you're happy, when you're secure. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9043.34s)]
*  You know, like people, [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9048.26s)]
*  I was really listening to something about the border, [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9049.1s)]
*  these people just trying to come into America [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9050.98s)]
*  and some people are like, well, if we let just a few in, [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9053.42s)]
*  it's a mess. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9056.34s)]
*  Like there's no good answer. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9057.26s)]
*  What if we just let the ones in who are really upset? [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9059.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9063.18s)]
*  But we can't let them all in. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9064.02s)]
*  Like when liberals try to say, [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9065.1s)]
*  it's like the dumbest position they get into, [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9066.74s)]
*  it's like, well, we can't, no, we can't let them in here. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9068.66s)]
*  Gotta keep them out. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9071.460000000001s)]
*  But we really like them and it's great [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9072.3s)]
*  that they're brown and sorry, [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9074.98s)]
*  but you know, there's like an impossible. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9077.06s)]
*  And then the right takes over and they sound racist [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9078.74s)]
*  and then the left takes over, they just sound stupid. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9081.9s)]
*  But my feeling is they should open it, the border, [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9084.460000000001s)]
*  and just let them pour it, let everybody pour in. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9087.58s)]
*  And then the answer, which is, well, [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9089.54s)]
*  then there'll be all these problems. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9091.66s)]
*  Yes, there should be. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9093.46s)]
*  It shouldn't be so great here, [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9094.86s)]
*  is what I'm saying in America. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9097.18s)]
*  It shouldn't be, it's a weird thing to sequester [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9098.94s)]
*  a certain group of people and try to keep upping [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9101.26s)]
*  their lifespan and their lifestyle [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9103.94s)]
*  and just keep trying to increase that [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9107.78s)]
*  for this group of people. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9109.3s)]
*  And then everyone's, and then this pressure people [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9110.58s)]
*  trying to come in so they can enjoy it. [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9112.66s)]
*  And then it gets worse and worse down here. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9114.9s)]
*  I mean, I'm not a candidate that, [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9116.9s)]
*  it's really just from down here. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9118.82s)]
*  There's something wrong with that. [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9121.300000000001s)]
*  That's not a system that's working. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9122.300000000001s)]
*  And it forces people to do cruel things to other people. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9124.380000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of people that die so Americans can be safe. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9127.94s)]
*  They're just dying, you know, weddings [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9131.82s)]
*  that are drone bombed in Yemen, [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9134.82s)]
*  because the guy said something that might have resulted [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9137.98s)]
*  in American insecurity, not even like definite American deaths, [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9141.54s)]
*  but like, just so we can breathe a little easier. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9146.1s)]
*  Folks die and folks do labor in unsafe places [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9148.9s)]
*  so that we can keep the prices where we like them. [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9153.58s)]
*  There's so much about American life [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9156.02s)]
*  that other people pay for it. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9158.58s)]
*  That's part of it. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9159.74s)]
*  But also it's not good for us either. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9161.02s)]
*  It's not a good way to live in a gated community. [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9162.619999999999s)]
*  If you let folks pour in like any other wave, [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9166.34s)]
*  it'll kind of slosh and then y'all just, [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9169.38s)]
*  things will be different. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9172.14s)]
*  I don't know, like what'll really happen? [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9174.06s)]
*  A bunch of people, like, well, they just come with knives [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9176.539999999999s)]
*  and start killing everybody. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9178.66s)]
*  I don't think so. [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9180.22s)]
*  I don't know what'll happen, but it's just weird to me. [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9182.14s)]
*  I mean, I lived in Mexico when I was a kid. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9184.539999999999s)]
*  My dad's Mexican. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9185.74s)]
*  And I remember, my first cogent thoughts were in Mexico [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9187.18s)]
*  and then I came to America. [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9190.539999999999s)]
*  I remember coming here. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9192.22s)]
*  But you lived in Mexico pre-cartels. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9193.06s)]
*  It's a different world now. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9194.7s)]
*  Yeah, but it was Mexico in the 70s. [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9195.94s)]
*  It was a pretty gnarly, smelly place. [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9197.539999999999s)]
*  Oh, I'm sure. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9199.7s)]
*  I mean, it was Mexico City. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9200.539999999999s)]
*  It was beautiful. [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9201.74s)]
*  It was a city before America had anything. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9202.74s)]
*  It's this very old European kind of place, you know, [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9204.58s)]
*  Mexico, it's beautiful country. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9207.220000000001s)]
*  And it's got a lot more depth to it than anybody knows here. [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9209.42s)]
*  And we're not really sharing with them [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9212.78s)]
*  because they're kind of like the other guys [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9214.220000000001s)]
*  because we're afraid of how many of them are dying [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9217.18s)]
*  to come here to work for us for very little. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9220.26s)]
*  Like this thing, I don't know. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9223.300000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9225.18s)]
*  This is shit I don't know about. [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9226.02s)]
*  But the feeling I get is that the more [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9227.62s)]
*  this American security, this feeling of like, you know, [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9231.66s)]
*  was more oxygen in the air, it was more, [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9234.94s)]
*  it's not good in the end for everybody somehow. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9237.539999999999s)]
*  Well, it's certainly not balanced, right? [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9241.98s)]
*  No, it's not balanced. [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9244.38s)]
*  The top 1% of the world is $34,000 a year. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9245.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9250.699999999999s)]
*  You make $34,000 a year, [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9251.539999999999s)]
*  you're in the top 1% of the world. [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9252.82s)]
*  You're basically living in like lower income America [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9253.98s)]
*  is the top 1% of the world, which is crazy. [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9259.1s)]
*  It is. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9262.46s)]
*  And so like, why is that? [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9263.3s)]
*  Well, corrupt governments, lack of freedom, [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9265.18s)]
*  lack of democracy, but also exploitation [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9267.460000000001s)]
*  from American businesses where they go over there [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9269.820000000002s)]
*  and they start sweat chops. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9272.5s)]
*  And, you know, I mean, one of the greatest ironies [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9273.7s)]
*  is people complaining about social justice issues [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9276.380000000001s)]
*  on an iPhone, which is made by slaves. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9278.7s)]
*  Oh yeah, it's a horrible, it's a horrible thing. [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9281.34s)]
*  I had a Siddharth Kara on the podcast. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9284.060000000001s)]
*  He's a journalist that traveled to the Congo [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9286.580000000002s)]
*  to watch them mine cobalt [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9289.02s)]
*  and he snuck into these cobalt mines. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9290.7s)]
*  And he wrote this, is it called cobalt red? [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9292.58s)]
*  Is that what it's called? [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9295.82s)]
*  It's out, it's out at the end of this month. [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9297.5s)]
*  Oh, what they do to get the- [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9300.58s)]
*  It's fucking horrific. [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9301.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9304.1s)]
*  I mean, horrific. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9304.94s)]
*  It's all slaves. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9306.1s)]
*  It's slaves, it's women who are 19 years old [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9307.34s)]
*  with cobalt red, how the blood of the Congo [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9309.62s)]
*  powers our lives. [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9312.06s)]
*  And that's some of what goes into like electric cars [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9313.58s)]
*  and stuff too, right? [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9316.02s)]
*  Yes, cobalt, yeah. [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9316.86s)]
*  It goes with lithium ion batteries, it stabilizes them. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9318.02s)]
*  So there's all sorts of shit that has to- [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9322.699999999999s)]
*  Look at those people. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9326.019999999999s)]
*  That's a cobalt mine. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9326.859999999999s)]
*  This is the thing is that we look at these wide shots [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9327.699999999999s)]
*  of just like clogs of people. [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9330.26s)]
*  That's how most human beings live. [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9333.019999999999s)]
*  Well, this is particularly egregious. [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9336.5s)]
*  And this is, what are they, they're making iPhones in there. [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9337.939999999999s)]
*  First of all, look at that dude right there, [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9340.779999999999s)]

*  This is some guy. [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9355.26s)]
*  He could live in Cincinnati. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9356.38s)]
*  He could work at the Avis at the airport in St. Louis. [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9358.539999999999s)]
*  Or he could be a UFC champion. [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9363.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but he's in this huge pile of people [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9364.939999999999s)]
*  so that we can have the new phone. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9368.539999999999s)]
*  It is, it's a crazy amount of, it's so lopsided. [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9372.179999999998s)]
*  So lopsided. [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9377.179999999998s)]
*  And then our lives become more and more pointless [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9378.02s)]
*  until people are like, should we just give Americans money? [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9381.5s)]
*  You know, like Andrew Yang's idea. [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9385.34s)]
*  Let's just give them money and they don't have to do anything. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9386.94s)]
*  Yeah, just fucking took it. [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9389.460000000001s)]
*  Like, what are we doing? [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9390.78s)]
*  What the fuck? [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9392.86s)]
*  The point of life used to be, don't die. [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9394.26s)]
*  That used to be the point of life. [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9397.66s)]
*  Don't die, pass on your sperm or whatever. [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9399.1s)]
*  But, and then somewhere in the margins, [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9402.42s)]
*  you'd be like, this feels good. [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9404.58s)]
*  You know, like at a next to a fire [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9406.060000000001s)]
*  and you just almost died, but you cooked the thing [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9407.62s)]
*  that tried to kill you and you're eating it. [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9410.22s)]
*  And you go, all right, I feel good. [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9412.22s)]
*  This feels nice. [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9413.46s)]
*  And you get to enjoy the stars in the sky, you know? [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9414.3s)]
*  There was something to that. [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9417.14s)]
*  But this point of like, just give everybody money every week [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9418.18s)]
*  so that they can buy, but who's doing anything? [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9421.7s)]
*  Like who's, and just let them. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9423.94s)]
*  Where's the money coming from? [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9425.78s)]
*  Let them make the shit. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9426.62s)]
*  They're invisible. [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9428.1s)]
*  And then let's all just be. [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9430.82s)]
*  And then we start having conversations [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9433.38s)]
*  about what's the right way to say things [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9435.22s)]
*  and what's the right stuff to put in your body [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9436.82s)]
*  and what's the right position to sleep in. [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9438.5s)]
*  Because it's a joke. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9440.779999999999s)]

*  I see what you're saying. [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9444.86s)]
*  I remember I was at a wedding [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9445.699999999999s)]
*  and there was a guy there who was Tibetan [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9446.9s)]
*  and with his wife. [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9449.58s)]
*  And my wife and I were talking about our dog. [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9451.38s)]
*  And we're saying that she needed, [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9454.779999999999s)]
*  she was getting surgery. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9457.3s)]

*  and he goes, I'm sorry, who was getting surgery? [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9459.94s)]
*  And we said our dog. [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9461.779999999999s)]
*  And he just laughed really hard. [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9463.34s)]
*  He's like, what? [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9467.02s)]
*  We had a dog was in surgery. [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9468.9s)]

*  And he was like, I'm sorry. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9473.42s)]
*  I don't understand. [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9474.94s)]
*  He thought like our mom was having surgery or something. [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9476.3s)]
*  It's like, you give your dog surgery? [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9478.66s)]
*  You put a dog in an operating room and operate them? [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9481.66s)]
*  This guy who's like from some place in Tibet was like, [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9484.38s)]
*  that's insane. [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9487.18s)]
*  You know, it's like my chicken has a psychiatrist [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9490.1s)]
*  on some level. [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9492.94s)]
*  It's like ridiculous. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9493.78s)]
*  Ridiculous, we're from, [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9496.060000000001s)]
*  but, and I looked in that guy's eyes [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9498.18s)]
*  and I'm like, I wanna be him. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9500.26s)]
*  It's not, and it's not that I'm ashamed of me [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9501.5s)]
*  being because of him, but I just think [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9503.18s)]
*  we've gotten really far away. [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9507.060000000001s)]
*  And that's me and how I feel. [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9508.34s)]

*  they're smarter about that stuff. [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9536.66s)]
*  It's not, it was a big jolt for us, the internet, but they're. [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9538.9s)]
*  Well, they're growing up with it. [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9542.38s)]
*  They don't know a life without it. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9543.74s)]

*  I think human beings figure things out. [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9556.86s)]
*  Human beings figure things out. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9558.42s)]
*  They do. [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9559.62s)]
*  I think they're, and they also mean well [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9560.460000000001s)]
*  on the whole to each other. [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9562.94s)]
*  They hurt each other a lot, [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9564.460000000001s)]
*  but I think that people don't want to. [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9566.98s)]
*  And there's always extraordinary, you know, [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9569.58s)]
*  the kind of things that go down in history [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9571.5s)]
*  of extraordinary moments by Kennedy or Obama or somebody. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9573.14s)]
*  But I see them all the time. [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9577.86s)]
*  If you ride the subway, you see people take a bit of abuse [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9579.1s)]
*  and go like, okay, okay, you go ahead. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9583.06s)]
*  Like those moments you go, [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9585.9s)]
*  well, you just saved the world, buddy. [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9587.1s)]
*  You just, in your own circle. [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9589.02s)]
*  I mean, that's, I guess, and I think one thing [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9591.220000000001s)]
*  a lot of people are doing is looking at the big picture [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9593.5s)]
*  too much and thinking they can, they listen to podcasts [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9596.34s)]
*  and they have a whole world opinion. [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9599.9s)]
*  But your only responsibility is the space you take up [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9602.82s)]
*  and the people you encounter. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9605.82s)]
*  That's all you should be thinking about. [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9607.660000000002s)]
*  It's how do you treat people. [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9609.34s)]
*  Yeah, and when you're thinking globally, [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9610.18s)]
*  it's a giant distraction. [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9611.060000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9612.34s)]
*  And really, you don't have any real ability [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9613.18s)]
*  to affect things that much. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9616.34s)]
*  No, the things you can do is be kind to people you know [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9617.900000000001s)]
*  and that you encounter people every day. [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9623.58s)]
*  Try to live a life of interaction instead of distraction [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9625.54s)]
*  and be out and look at folks and treat them okay. [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9630.18s)]
*  That's like huge. [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9634.660000000002s)]
*  There's a lot of people. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9636.42s)]
*  There's a great movie called The Man for All Seasons. [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9638.3s)]
*  It's about Thomas More, I think. [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9640.66s)]
*  This guy who was the king's, he was the chancellor [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9643.46s)]
*  of England during Henry VIII. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9647.38s)]
*  I'm not gonna talk about the whole movie, [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9650.14s)]
*  but it's remarkable. [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9651.5s)]
*  I love the movie. [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9652.339999999998s)]
*  And there's a scene where there's, [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9653.3s)]
*  he was a very powerful man, so this one guy keeps [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9654.9s)]
*  trying to get him a position in government [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9657.06s)]
*  and he says to the guy, I don't think you'd be good at it, [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9660.38s)]
*  but I'll get you a job as a teacher. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9663.74s)]
*  And he goes, why would I wanna be a teacher? [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9666.74s)]
*  And he says, I think you would be a great teacher. [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9668.86s)]
*  And the guy said, but who would know it? [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9671.060000000001s)]
*  And he said, well, God, your students, [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9674.140000000001s)]
*  your friends, and yourself. [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9677.58s)]
*  That's a pretty good crowd. [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9679.34s)]
*  I think of life more that way now. [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9682.86s)]
*  It's cool this, I could be that big. [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9686.58s)]
*  Then the negative side of it, how are we gonna, [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9688.94s)]
*  well, it's fucked up, who's gonna solve all this? [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9690.78s)]
*  But if you can just be a good person, [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9693.78s)]
*  and do your best anyway, you do your best. [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9696.78s)]
*  It's all anybody can do. [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9699.5s)]
*  You also gotta acknowledge that you've got problems [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9700.62s)]
*  in your head and you're, everyone's selfish in ways [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9702.58s)]
*  that ends up not being good for other people. [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9706.140000000001s)]
*  Everybody has that. [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9707.62s)]
*  So you try to balance, try to balance and be okay [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9708.94s)]
*  with the people in your work, you know? [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9712.220000000001s)]
*  And your family try to be real, a real parent to your kids. [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9715.94s)]
*  I think that's the only thing you can really do. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9721.66s)]
*  It is bizarre, this very, very common aspiration [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9725.58s)]
*  to wanna be recognized by an enormous number of people [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9730.62s)]
*  that you don't even know. [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9732.94s)]
*  Yeah, that's a weird thing. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9734.26s)]
*  I don't have that. [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9735.220000000001s)]
*  I mean, I've been recognized by a huge amount of people. [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9736.060000000001s)]
*  You don't have that. [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9738.34s)]
*  I don't care about it. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9739.18s)]
*  But you're a famous comedian. [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9740.02s)]
*  Maybe if you weren't, you would have that. [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9741.86s)]
*  Maybe I would, I mean, I. [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9744.1s)]
*  Because you know what it is and you've experienced it. [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9744.94s)]
*  And it's been a giant part of your life, [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9747.02s)]
*  is walking out there and everybody goes crazy [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9749.62s)]
*  and cheers and like, thank you. [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9751.74s)]
*  When I come out and they're all cheering, [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9753.74s)]
*  I have wanted to stop so quickly. [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9755.78s)]
*  I often tell them to stop. [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9757.74s)]
*  But I really don't like that part. [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9759.74s)]
*  It's strange. [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9761.539999999999s)]
*  I don't like it, it's not normal. [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9762.46s)]
*  I like normal interactions, so I don't like that. [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9764.3s)]
*  I think what's normal is it's setting a tone, [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9767.34s)]
*  like they're happy you're here. [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9770.3s)]
*  I'm like, I'm happy you're happy, thank you. [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9771.78s)]
*  That's you, I'm happy you're happy. [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9773.98s)]
*  And I'm happy too, and I've got a bunch of shit for you. [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9775.86s)]
*  I've really been working on this. [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9778.539999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9779.66s)]
*  Yeah, but the people that really soak it in, they love it. [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9780.5s)]
*  Yeah, they need it. [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9783.58s)]
*  I've seen people stand on stage [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9785.66s)]
*  and they just look at the crowd, [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9787.74s)]
*  they take it in and they just walk around. [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9789.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9792.22s)]
*  Oh man. [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9793.06s)]
*  I saw Paul Simon at Forest Hills in New York, [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9793.88s)]
*  which is a great, and I had done it a week before [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9796.74s)]
*  and I went there to see him. [[02:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9798.66s)]
*  And he's, I know him, a friend of mine. [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9799.5s)]
*  And so he was on stage and it was one of his last tours. [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9802.099999999999s)]
*  And Forest Hills is like a block from where he grew up. [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9806.42s)]
*  So it just, they loved him so much. [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9809.099999999999s)]
*  And about halfway through, I saw this moment [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9811.74s)]
*  where the crowd was going nuts and he just put his arms out [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9815.179999999998s)]
*  and he just went like this and he basked in it. [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9817.38s)]
*  Wow. [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9820.019999999999s)]
*  And I brought it up to him later and he said, [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9820.859999999999s)]
*  oh, you saw it, I'm so ashamed of that. [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9822.58s)]
*  I'm so ashamed of that. [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9825.06s)]
*  He said, the second I did it, I was like, stop it, [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9826.779999999999s)]
*  stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it. [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9829.42s)]
*  Ah! [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9831.22s)]
*  Yeah, he's like, that's not cool. [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9832.06s)]
*  That's hilarious, he just tried it out. [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9833.46s)]
*  You're not here to be like, hey. [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9835.34s)]
*  You're here to go like, here's the show, here's the show. [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9837.86s)]
*  Yeah, but he's a rock star. [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9840.78s)]
*  Isn't that funny, that's the thing that people love. [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9842.22s)]
*  The thing that people love is the thing [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9844.66s)]
*  you really should not wanna be, [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9845.78s)]
*  is this complete alien. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9847.34s)]
*  It's no good for a human being. [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9849.62s)]
*  To stand in front of people and like that. [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9850.460000000001s)]
*  No, that's what, when I'm doing, [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9852.14s)]
*  the thing I'm excited, I don't know how to bring it back [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9854.62s)]
*  to my stupid plug, but the garden show. [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9856.3s)]
*  I haven't, I used to do it, it was normal [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9858.86s)]
*  to do the garden for me before, which is not a good thing. [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9862.1s)]
*  I remember Chris Rock saying to me once after a show [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9865.26s)]
*  at the garden, he's like, this is like a club for you [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9867.06s)]
*  where you try shit out now. [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9869.38s)]
*  Because I did it like five times in a week. [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9871.38s)]
*  I just take the subway, take the sea train up, [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9873.42s)]
*  do the garden and leave, like I don't party after [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9875.859999999999s)]
*  I just do the show. [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9877.859999999999s)]
*  But it's, that went away and I hadn't been there for a while, [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9879.42s)]
*  but now to me, this one show, there's like, [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9882.26s)]
*  it's a very exciting thought to just do one. [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9884.38s)]
*  And the set I've prepared for it is not a rock star set. [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9888.22s)]
*  It's pretty gritty, it's pretty, I mean, [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9891.82s)]
*  it all kills. [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9893.900000000001s)]
*  It's similar to what I saw at the creek last time. [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9895.060000000001s)]
*  I've been working on it since, so there's a lot of new stuff. [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9897.140000000001s)]
*  But it's, the idea of being surrounded by these 18,000 [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9899.94s)]
*  people in this elite arena and saying some of this stuff, [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9903.7s)]
*  but also knowing that I've crafted it, [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9908.460000000001s)]
*  so it's not just reckless, you know what I mean? [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9910.78s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9912.980000000001s)]
*  I'm really excited about it. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9914.300000000001s)]
*  38 years in comedy, I don't get that excited, [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9917.02s)]
*  but I'm really excited about it. [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9919.58s)]
*  I'm excited for it too. [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9920.42s)]
*  I love that you've made this return, [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9921.820000000002s)]
*  and then you experienced a bunch of resistance, [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9924.980000000001s)]
*  but now it's kind of gone. [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9927.86s)]
*  Yeah, it just makes, just keep doing it. [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9929.94s)]
*  Just keep doing it. [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9931.34s)]
*  Yeah, and now you're doing shit [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9932.18s)]
*  that's really being recognized. [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9935.34s)]
*  Like, you won a fucking Emmy. [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9936.66s)]

*  It's amazing. It's nice. [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9941.900000000001s)]
*  And I think you won a Grammy for the special, [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9942.74s)]
*  it was very funny, but I think the next one was, [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9944.380000000001s)]
*  I think Sorry was even better. [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9947.220000000001s)]
*  Thank you, man. Thank you. [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9948.900000000001s)]
*  I really do, Sorry was amazing. [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9949.74s)]
*  That got nominated for a Grammy, [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9950.82s)]
*  so we'll see what happens. [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9952.02s)]
*  I hope it wins. [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9953.06s)]
*  I'd love it if you won two years in a row. [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9954.38s)]
*  I wanna see people get crazy. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9955.66s)]
*  Like, fucking bullshit. [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9956.9s)]
*  Whatever. God damn it. [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9958.58s)]
*  I loved it. [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9960.66s)]
*  I got so angry when people were calling out your, [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9961.66s)]
*  that leaked set, when people are mad, [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9966.26s)]
*  because to me it was like, [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9969.14s)]
*  that's what he's always done. [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9969.98s)]
*  This is great stuff. [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9971.38s)]
*  But not only that, you hadn't done stand up in 10 months. [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9973.38s)]
*  I'm like, this is the seeds of a fantastic hour. [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9975.78s)]
*  And you're only seeing, [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9980.02s)]
*  literally the first couple of times, [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9981.14s)]
*  he's even said these things aloud in public. [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9982.86s)]
*  I literally was having a conversation [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9985.5s)]
*  with another comedian and came up with the bits [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9987.34s)]
*  and went on stage and did them. [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9989.3s)]
*  So it was the first time I'd done them. [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9990.46s)]
*  And I just got so excited to be back on stage, [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9992.62s)]
*  because I had taken a long time off, [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9995.98s)]
*  and there was resistance coming back, [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9997.34s)]
*  but I was in a club with my crowd for the first time. [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=9999.34s)]
*  And so I was, the only thing I regretted is it was reckless, [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10002.94s)]
*  because my life was very precarious. [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10007.06s)]
*  Things were tough, and things were tough for my kids. [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10010.179999999998s)]
*  So that created a bigger, huge stink bomb [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10011.42s)]
*  than anything else that had even happened. [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10015.5s)]
*  The set did? [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10017.019999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the set was really, really hard. [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10017.859999999999s)]
*  So given how things were, [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10019.06s)]
*  I probably could have made jokes [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10023.42s)]
*  about a couple other things. [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10025.099999999999s)]
*  I don't believe I did anything wrong. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10026.06s)]
*  You did what you always done. [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10028.22s)]
*  I've always done this. [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10029.699999999999s)]
*  The way it works is I say stuff [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10030.539999999999s)]
*  that is the wrong thing to say. [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10032.66s)]
*  I hear the resistance to it, [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10035.06s)]
*  and then I work with it, [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10037.22s)]
*  and it takes a few shows for it to be a safe bit to do, [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10039.5s)]
*  but there's a few audiences that, [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10042.86s)]
*  and that audience actually didn't mind it, [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10045.58s)]
*  but it's not for regular consumption. [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10048.7s)]
*  It's like watching somebody practice piano [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10052.86s)]
*  and going like he sucks. [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10055.7s)]
*  Or it wasn't supposed to. [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10057.26s)]
*  I think it's really bad [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10060.460000000001s)]
*  that we don't have these barriers anymore, [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10061.980000000001s)]
*  where there's speech that's for these few people, [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10063.9s)]
*  that we're gonna have a fun conversation [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10066.34s)]
*  where we're gonna get a little crazy. [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10068.980000000001s)]
*  It's not for the whole world to see. [[02:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10070.460000000001s)]
*  Well, what was infuriating to me [[02:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10072.220000000001s)]
*  was people that know that. [[02:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10074.18s)]
*  They know what you're saying, [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10075.900000000001s)]
*  and they went after you. [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10077.380000000001s)]
*  I was like, you motherfucker. [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10078.7s)]
*  There's people that I won't talk to to this day [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10080.86s)]
*  because of that. [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10083.74s)]
*  I was like, I'm not talking to you. [[02:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10084.58s)]
*  Unless you wanna make some big public apology, [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10086.86s)]
*  or you wanna apologize to me and tell me why you did it [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10090.220000000001s)]
*  and what real feelings of insecurity and jealousy. [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10093.3s)]
*  But Tim Dillon. Nobody can do that. [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10096.22s)]
*  Tim Dillon put a great post on his page [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10097.9s)]
*  about what's really going on. [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10099.9s)]
*  He put a great post on his Instagram, [[02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10101.42s)]
*  and that's when I became friends with Tim Dillon. [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10103.06s)]
*  He wrote, you're getting a bunch of people [[02:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10105.38s)]
*  that are mediocre comedians [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10107.099999999999s)]
*  and that are attacking him, [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10108.98s)]
*  not really because of what he's saying, [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10110.22s)]
*  but because he's great [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10111.699999999999s)]
*  and because they hate the fact [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10112.9s)]
*  that he was getting any attention at all, [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10115.019999999999s)]
*  and that should be theirs, [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10117.3s)]
*  and now they find some chance [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10118.66s)]
*  to move up in the social structure. [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10120.5s)]
*  That's what it felt like to me. [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10122.66s)]
*  To me, all of that is totally true, [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10124.06s)]
*  and it makes me understand it. [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10126.939999999999s)]
*  In other words, it makes me feel sympathy. [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10129.22s)]
*  It makes me go like, [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10131.019999999999s)]
*  all right, if that's what you need to do, [[02:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10132.859999999999s)]
*  that's what you gotta do. [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10134.06s)]
*  It's a... [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10135.9s)]
*  I get that. [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10136.74s)]
*  I would prefer to hang out with somebody [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10137.58s)]
*  who doesn't need to do that, but I get it. [[02:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10139.099999999999s)]
*  I can't be around them. [[02:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10142.619999999999s)]
*  No, I understand that. [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10143.939999999999s)]
*  You can do that again. [[02:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10145.26s)]
*  You can do that again. [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10146.3s)]
*  It's like having a snake in the room. [[02:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10147.58s)]
*  You can have a snake in the room [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10149.3s)]
*  as long as you keep the lights on. [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10150.3s)]
*  Aside from my shit, [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10151.42s)]
*  the thing that was a drag to me [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10152.66s)]
*  about comedy in the last few years [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10154.98s)]
*  was people who... [[02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10156.38s)]
*  Any comedian who's out in the world [[02:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10158.5s)]
*  saying that comedian shouldn't be saying these things, [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10161.58s)]
*  that's a traitor to comedy. [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10164.939999999999s)]
*  Well, they always suck. [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10166.5s)]
*  They're not a real comedian. [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10167.779999999999s)]
*  None of them are good. [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10168.859999999999s)]
*  They've learned some tricks so they can seem good, [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10169.699999999999s)]
*  and they might have a big audience, [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10171.5s)]
*  but they don't love this, [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10173.42s)]
*  and that's a fucked up thing to do. [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10175.9s)]
*  It's a fucked up thing to do, [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10178.539999999999s)]
*  and it's always coming from a place of jealousy. [[02:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10179.7s)]
*  Yes, and also it's always happening to somebody [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10181.380000000001s)]
*  who's already deeply besieged, [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10183.66s)]
*  somebody who's already the whole world. [[02:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10186.220000000001s)]
*  Of course. [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10187.980000000001s)]
*  When you see the whole world coming down on somebody [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10188.820000000002s)]
*  for something they said, [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10191.060000000001s)]
*  and then you go, [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10191.900000000001s)]
*  man, I'm gonna say the same thing. [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10193.140000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10195.18s)]
*  That's about you. [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10196.02s)]
*  That has nothing to do with how you really feel [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10196.84s)]
*  about what they said. [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10198.66s)]
*  It has nothing to do. [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10199.5s)]
*  It's just that you want to be heard in your circle [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10200.66s)]
*  saying it also, [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10203.54s)]
*  because you see that you can get a little something from it. [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10204.7s)]
*  Well, you're just taking cheap shots. [[02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10207.18s)]
*  That's another way to say that. [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10209.82s)]
*  You're just kicking someone when they're down. [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10210.66s)]
*  Yeah, it's a shame. [[02:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10212.02s)]
*  And not only that, [[02:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10212.86s)]
*  it's someone who should have a deep understanding [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10213.7s)]
*  of what that person's actually doing. [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10216.380000000001s)]
*  But it's too much to ask, I think, from people. [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10218.1s)]
*  I think it is. [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10221.06s)]
*  People's life is hard. [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10221.9s)]
*  If it's too much to ask of those people, [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10223.1s)]
*  those people should not be doing standup, [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10225.14s)]
*  and all the people that did that were all fucking terrible. [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10226.86s)]
*  All of them were mediocre at best. [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10230.18s)]
*  All of them. [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10232.300000000001s)]
*  Every single fucking one of them. [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10233.14s)]
*  Chris Rock's not gonna fucking talk shit about people [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10236.460000000001s)]
*  when they're down. [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10238.82s)]
*  He's not gonna be the guy who gets on Twitter [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10239.66s)]
*  and goes, that subject matter was fucked up. [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10241.9s)]
*  Like, you're not gonna get that at a day's compel. [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10243.699999999999s)]
*  Well, it just became profitable to do it, [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10245.539999999999s)]
*  and it's gonna stop being profitable. [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10247.26s)]
*  It already is. [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10249.22s)]
*  It's already not a good look anymore. [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10250.06s)]
*  But it's not profitable by those comedians. [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10252.3s)]
*  Those comedians get ostracized. [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10254.46s)]
*  Now they do, yeah. [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10256.5s)]
*  Oh, man, I go out of my way. [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10257.58s)]
*  I won't talk to them. [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10260.1s)]
*  I won't look at them. [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10261.02s)]
*  Like, you don't do this anymore. [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10261.94s)]
*  I can't talk to you, [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10265.26s)]
*  because now I can trust you, [[02:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10266.1s)]
*  because you know what this is. [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10267.34s)]
*  You know this bizarre process of bringing an idea on stage [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10269.46s)]
*  like a little puppy and teaching it not to shit on the floor. [[02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10274.3s)]
*  You're doing this thing with me, [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10277.779999999999s)]
*  and you're pretending that that's not what it is. [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10280.42s)]
*  It's an easy thing to do, [[02:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10282.859999999999s)]
*  because the audience will never know that. [[02:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10284.019999999999s)]
*  And they shouldn't. [[02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10285.859999999999s)]
*  Audiences just come and they see what you do. [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10287.34s)]
*  They don't know what goes into it, [[02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10290.099999999999s)]
*  and it's none of their business. [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10291.259999999998s)]
*  Well, some of them do get into it. [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10294.099999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's one of the things [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10295.38s)]
*  that was interesting about the store [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10296.46s)]
*  was you would get comedy nerds that would come [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10297.82s)]
*  and then go, I love how that bit's changed, [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10301.179999999998s)]
*  because I saw it, and then I saw it again, [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10303.419999999998s)]
*  and I saw it again, and now it's got to this point. [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10304.98s)]
*  That was a great compliment. [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10307.46s)]
*  I was always like, oh, thank you, thanks, appreciate it. [[02:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10308.939999999999s)]
*  Yeah, there was a time, [[02:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10311.06s)]
*  there used to be this back in 2005 or so, [[02:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10311.9s)]
*  there was, what is it, Tenacious D, you know, Jack Black? [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10316.58s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10320.3s)]
*  They had a website with a message board [[02:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10321.3s)]
*  back before social media. [[02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10323.339999999998s)]
*  There were message boards where people would make comments. [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10324.86s)]
*  It was just comments without a thing. [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10328.38s)]
*  And they had a message board with different categories, [[02:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10331.3s)]
*  and one of them was other comedians. [[02:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10335.06s)]
*  And that became huger than the website. [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10337.3s)]
*  It was called aspecialthing.com. [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10340.26s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10342.58s)]
*  Remember this? [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10343.42s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I do. [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10344.24s)]
*  And it was about standup mostly in the LA area. [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10345.08s)]
*  And so, like, there was one guy, his name was Sasquatch, [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10348.94s)]
*  and he would go to every show at Largo [[02:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10352.06s)]
*  at these kind of alternative shows, [[02:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10355.02s)]
*  and he would do a rundown. [[02:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10355.78s)]
*  He'd tell you who was on, [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10357.3s)]
*  he'd give you an idea what the bits were, and he'd analyze. [[02:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10358.82s)]
*  Every comedian loved reading it, [[02:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10361.74s)]
*  because if you were, like, being mentioned in it [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10364.26s)]
*  was kind of cool. [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10366.7s)]
*  He was a really smart, his name was Matthew, [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10367.86s)]
*  so I'm gonna forget, but he was interesting, [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10369.62s)]
*  and he would talk about bits, [[02:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10372.34s)]
*  and he'd seen bits before, [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10375.38s)]
*  and how they had changed and stuff. [[02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10376.86s)]
*  Comedy fandom, when it's like, you know, [[02:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10378.72s)]
*  it's really fun, it's really great. [[02:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10381.14s)]
*  It is fun. [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10382.62s)]
*  There's a lot now that's just like, [[02:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10384.060000000001s)]
*  I'm on this guy's side against this guy. [[02:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10385.78s)]
*  There's a lot of tribalism in comedy. [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10388.220000000001s)]
*  But again, you're always gonna have people that are like that. [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10392.5s)]
*  Of course. [[02:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10396.820000000002s)]
*  You're gonna have all sorts of different ways [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10397.660000000002s)]
*  of looking at things, [[02:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10399.380000000001s)]
*  and things that people disagree with and agree with, [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10400.220000000001s)]
*  and things that people like and don't like. [[02:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10402.18s)]
*  But it's just, I fucking love it. [[02:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10404.54s)]
*  After all these years, I've been doing it. [[02:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10407.34s)]
*  35 years, I think. [[02:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10409.62s)]
*  It's the best. [[02:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10412.18s)]
*  It's really the most fun thing to do. [[02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10414.5s)]
*  I love it more than anything I've ever done. [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10415.42s)]
*  And I'll always love it. [[02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10417.74s)]
*  And I do think after this show at the Garden, [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10420.5s)]
*  I'm gonna, on January 28th, livestream on my website. [[02:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10422.98s)]
*  Livestream lucik.com. [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10426.54s)]
*  Lucik.com. [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10427.98s)]
*  There it is. [[02:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10428.82s)]
*  There it is. [[02:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10429.66s)]
*  Livestream event from Madison Square Garden, [[02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10430.5s)]
*  that's fucking awesome. [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10433.02s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if any comedian's done that. [[02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10434.38s)]
*  Not on a website, I mean maybe with HBO and stuff. [[02:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10436.58s)]
*  How difficult is it in terms of the infrastructure, [[02:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10438.9s)]
*  to set it up to livestream from your website? [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10442.1s)]
*  How many people can it handle simultaneously? [[02:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10444.66s)]
*  As many as will come. [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10447.18s)]
*  Really? [[02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10448.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10449.5s)]
*  It's just, you know, Tom Segura does these live shows. [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10450.32s)]
*  Yes, your mom knows. [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10454.1s)]
*  At the company Maestro or whatever it is. [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10454.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10456.26s)]
*  We're just doing the same thing. [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10457.1s)]
*  Oh, great. [[02:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10458.02s)]
*  That's all it is. [[02:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10458.86s)]
*  And it's parked on the site. [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10459.699999999999s)]
*  Have you been a part of one of those? [[02:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10460.539999999999s)]
*  You need to be a part of one of those. [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10461.38s)]
*  I have not done that, no. [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10462.199999999999s)]
*  They're fucking horrific. [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10463.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no, I've heard it's crazy. [[02:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10464.779999999999s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10466.06s)]
*  But he's really so fucking smart, Tom. [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10466.9s)]
*  He's the best. [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10468.86s)]
*  He's very funny and a great guy. [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10469.699999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10470.539999999999s)]
*  I asked him about doing this [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10471.939999999999s)]
*  and he helped me get the courage to do it. [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10472.779999999999s)]
*  And the show starts at 7.30 in the opening acts, [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10475.099999999999s)]
*  like Keith Robinson and somebody else I don't know yet. [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10478.74s)]
*  But also I have Ravi Coltrane, [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10482.38s)]
*  who is John Coltrane's son, which is incidental. [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10484.5s)]
*  But he's a great saxophone player. [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10487.779999999999s)]
*  And he has a trio that he's bringing to open. [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10490.439999999999s)]
*  Oh. [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10493.619999999999s)]
*  So you get to watch, [[02:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10494.66s)]
*  it'll be about 45 minutes of pre-show [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10496.259999999998s)]
*  with him and some comedians. [[02:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10498.06s)]
*  I'll probably be on stage around 8.15. [[02:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10500.460000000001s)]
*  It'll be like a 20 second delay, [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10502.1s)]
*  but otherwise it's fully live. [[02:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10503.7s)]
*  What time are you up tonight and tomorrow? [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10505.1s)]
*  I think the show's at 7.30, but I gotta go soon. [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10507.62s)]
*  Yeah, I was just thinking. [[02:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10510.3s)]
*  And then I guess I'm on it, I guess the show's 7.30. [[02:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10511.7s)]
*  Usually I end up on stage by 8.15, [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10515.26s)]
*  after there's always delay and then opening comedian. [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10517.56s)]
*  Well, I'm going out to eat with my wife tomorrow, [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10521.06s)]
*  so I'm gonna try to catch you tonight. [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10523.06s)]
*  Yeah, you should. [[02:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10524.22s)]
*  I'm gonna head out. [[02:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10525.06s)]
*  You should. [[02:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNHLeMjgOSU&t=10525.9s)]
