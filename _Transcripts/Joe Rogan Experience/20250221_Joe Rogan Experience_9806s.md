*  Yeah. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=128.6s)]
*  Well, they all had crazy hair. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=129.6s)]
*  Everybody lost their mind in the eighties. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=131.6s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=134.2s)]
*  They all, they all lost their mind back then. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=135.2s)]
*  Cause like from the seventies to the eighties, nobody knew how to dress. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=137.92s)]
*  They did crazy shit with their hair. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=140.96s)]
*  She's going over her set. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=142.88s)]
*  Yeah, they would all tease their hair out. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=143.88s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=146.88s)]
*  There was like a big hair thing. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=147.88s)]
*  I think it was when people started doing cocaine. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=149.60000000000002s)]
*  That's what I think. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=152.72s)]
*  I think it's the eighties was Miami vice and cocaine. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=153.72s)]
*  Everybody lost their mind. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=156.4s)]
*  They lost their fashion sense. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=157.4s)]
*  People started to wear wacky clothes. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=159.88s)]
*  Cars started looking like shit. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=162.96s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=163.96s)]
*  The Saab. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=164.96s)]
*  Pinto. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=165.96s)]
*  Bro, cars just started looking like shit. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=166.96s)]
*  I mean, if you want an objective analysis of what happens to a society when they remove [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=170.23999999999998s)]
*  marijuana and mushrooms and then they bring in cocaine. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=175.72s)]
*  It's like, hey, you know what? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=179.23999999999998s)]
*  It's called Ford Fiesta. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=181.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=183.35999999999999s)]
*  Cause we were Fiesta yesterday. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=184.35999999999999s)]
*  But cocaine brought a Sam Kinnison too though. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=187.39999999999998s)]
*  You have to realize, cocaine's done some good. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=189.67999999999998s)]
*  You think it did a lot, a lot, a lot? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=191.64s)]
*  No, no. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=194.64s)]
*  I think it's terrible for everybody who does it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=195.64s)]
*  I do think that there's moments of inspired creativity from all kinds of substances, especially [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=198.68s)]
*  that rock and roll cocaine that they used to get where it was just real pure cocaine. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=206.35999999999999s)]
*  It wasn't stepped on. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  It didn't have amphetamines and fentanyl in it and all kinds of other shit. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  Good shit. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=215.2s)]
*  Not like the stuff you buy in Grand Rapids, Iowa. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=216.2s)]
*  I should say this as a person who's never tried cocaine. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=218.0s)]
*  Never? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=220.44s)]
*  Never. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=221.44s)]
*  Don't be lying. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=222.44s)]
*  No, I would not lie. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=223.44s)]
*  Never? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=224.44s)]
*  No, never. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=225.44s)]
*  No, I got real lucky. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=226.44s)]
*  I had a buddy of mine and his cousin started selling it and he was a great guy. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=227.48s)]
*  And I watched this dude kind of like shrink into himself and lost a ton of weight and [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=231.68s)]
*  him and his girlfriend just, they had this attic apartment and they would just hang out [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=237.48s)]
*  and do coke and sell coke. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=241.28s)]
*  And they would just like watch TV and do coke. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=242.28s)]
*  And it was like they got bit by a vampire, man. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=244.56s)]
*  It scared the shit out of me. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=247.8s)]
*  I was afraid of cocaine, man. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=249.44s)]
*  Because when I started stand up, like I started stand up like in 94, 93, at Open Mic, and [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=251.51999999999998s)]
*  I was clean, I was sober. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=257.52s)]
*  I was a year, I was in rehab and I wanted to be a comedian. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=259.28s)]
*  So I went to a library to learn about writing, Jean Perrette, comedy writing, step by step. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=263.08s)]
*  Another book called How to Write Funny, Be Funny, and Make Money, Being Funny. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=269.68s)]
*  And that was a real great book, bro. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=276.15999999999997s)]
*  It had comedy clubs locations in the back and it had booker numbers to submit your comedy. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=278.12s)]
*  Yeah, remember the Comedy USA industry guide? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=287.40000000000003s)]
*  $100. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=290.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=291.6s)]
*  Can you believe that shit? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=292.6s)]
*  Bro, I remember dudes used to take out full page ads. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=294.2s)]
*  That's how you knew they were killing it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  When a dude would take out a full page ad and the Comedy USA industry guy, I'm like, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=299.76s)]
*  wow, he's got a full page ad. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=303.8s)]
*  I remember, bro, when I was looking for gigs in like 2000, right? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=306.52s)]
*  And I remember this comedian named Shang and Dante, comedian Dante. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=313.64s)]
*  Yeah, I remember those guys. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=318.12s)]
*  Those guys had a list, a five page list of comedy bookers names, NACA numbers to call, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=320.12s)]
*  and the back of the page was shitty bookers to avoid. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=328.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=332.28s)]
*  And they decided to do the comedy for like 75 bucks. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=333.28s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=336.96s)]
*  I got lucky that I was in Boston and Boston had, that was like the boom happened in Boston [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=337.96s)]
*  when like Steven Wright got on Tonight Show, everybody found out about Boston, but it was [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=345.88s)]
*  already this like crazy, there's a great documentary called When Stand Up Stood Out. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=350.67999999999995s)]
*  You had that guy on the show here. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=356.08s)]
*  I've had a few of those guys on the show. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=357.91999999999996s)]
*  It was like a Chinese restaurant. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=359.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=361.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=362.36s)]
*  Don Gavin was one of those guys. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=363.36s)]
*  Steve Sweeney, legends. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=364.84s)]
*  I still say to this day, they're some of the best comics I've ever seen in my life. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=366.59999999999997s)]
*  I've seen that murder harder than anybody I've ever seen in my life, but it was just [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=370.8s)]
*  very regional, very local, and a lot of it didn't translate nationally for some reason. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=374.8s)]
*  Like Steve Sweeney in Boston, in front of a Boston audience, is the funniest guy that's [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=381.6s)]
*  ever lived. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=386.8s)]
*  And I'm not kidding. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=387.8s)]
*  I'm not exaggerating. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=388.8s)]
*  He would get like Boston accents and Boston attitudes. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=390.04s)]
*  It would be all a big part of his act. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=393.0s)]
*  And dude, it was murderous. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=395.40000000000003s)]
*  If you had to follow that, you were fucked. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=396.92s)]
*  You were fucked, man. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=399.76000000000005s)]
*  And they would do that to dudes from out of town. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=401.42s)]
*  It was the most ruthless, cruel shit they would do at Nick's Comedy Stop. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=403.84000000000003s)]
*  They would take these assassins, these local assassins, and stack them one after the other. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=407.84000000000003s)]
*  It would be Kenny Rogerson, Don Gavin, Steve Sweeney. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=414.84000000000003s)]
*  And then they throw up some headliner. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=419.84s)]
*  And this poor headliner is used to soft acts on the road. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=421.96s)]
*  He's used to being known for the guy who was on television. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=425.4s)]
*  Hey, folks, so I'm Mike, you know, the sitcom. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=427.79999999999995s)]
*  And they tried to do stand-up, but they were getting eaten alive. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=431.56s)]
*  He's talking about nuggets. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=435.15999999999997s)]
*  The guys were up there all coked out, working the crowd. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=437.47999999999996s)]
*  They were wild boys, too. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=441.44s)]
*  They were big, like football player-sized, wild, crazy drinkers and partiers. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=442.44s)]
*  And they were funny, man. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=448.92s)]
*  And so because there was this love of comedy in Boston, they had all these comedy nights [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=450.88s)]
*  all over the place where you could make a living. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=455.64s)]
*  So you could be a half-assed comedian like I was, and you can make $500 a week just hustling, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=457.92s)]
*  just moving around. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=465.36s)]
*  That's what we all did. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=466.36s)]
*  So there were so many places that you could work, and so many little booking agents in [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=467.62s)]
*  like Western Massachusetts. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=472.32s)]
*  You'd have to go out there. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=475.48s)]
*  There's these weird towns that are like liberal hideouts, you know what I mean? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=478.2s)]
*  Like Amherst, you'd get Amherst gigs. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=483.08s)]
*  It was weird, like Amherst, Massachusetts. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=486.04s)]
*  The other place that you had to be from there to pronounce it right. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=488.6s)]
*  Which one is that? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=491.88s)]
*  The one that's the uniform, the steak sauce. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=492.88s)]
*  Oh, Worcester. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=495.68s)]
*  Worcester. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=496.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=497.68s)]
*  Yeah, it looks weird. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=498.68s)]
*  In 2010, I was doing Last Comin' Standing there, and I got there a day early, and I [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=499.68s)]
*  hung out with a Boston comic. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=505.40000000000003s)]
*  I think his uncle is the guy that caught, that was missing in action, the Irish gangster. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=508.28000000000003s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=514.8000000000001s)]
*  David Boser is the comedian. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=515.8000000000001s)]
*  I said, yeah, man, we're performing Worcester, sir. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=518.8000000000001s)]
*  And then he took the joint and he goes, no, bro, Worcester. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=524.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=527.6s)]
*  Thank you for telling me, bro. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=528.6s)]
*  Yeah, you don't want to say, hey, Worcester, sir. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=529.9200000000001s)]
*  Nice to be here. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=534.48s)]
*  They would fucking kill you. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=535.48s)]
*  They're like, that's where the great Doug Stanhope is from. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=536.48s)]
*  Yeah, Worcester. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=539.24s)]
*  Doug Stanhope started in Worcester. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=540.24s)]
*  I love him. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=541.24s)]
*  He's the best. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=542.24s)]
*  All right, it's February, and by now, 80% of people have probably abandoned their New [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=543.24s)]
*  Year's resolutions. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=548.28s)]
*  And it makes sense. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=549.28s)]
*  Life can get crazy, and all of a sudden, you don't have the time. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=550.5600000000001s)]
*  But one easy habit to stick with is AG1. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=553.8000000000001s)]
*  It's an easy, realistic habit that you can make to benefit your whole body health. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=557.2s)]
*  AG1 makes hard to get micronutrients, easy to get, and replaces multiple vitamins and [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=562.68s)]
*  supplements with just one scoop. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=567.0799999999999s)]
*  You just mix it in some cold water, take a nice moment in the morning to do your body [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=568.8399999999999s)]
*  right. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=572.8s)]
*  And honestly, it tastes pretty good. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=573.8s)]
*  It's not easy to pack this many high quality ingredients with this much nutrient density, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=575.3599999999999s)]
*  but AG1 makes it happen without added sugars or artificial sweeteners ever. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=580.56s)]
*  AG1 is a great way to invest in your health now and in the long run, which is why I've [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=585.5999999999999s)]
*  partnered with them for so long. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=590.32s)]

*  I had a first comedy album, the one he did with roaring or something. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=611.0400000000001s)]
*  The one where he did with music in the background? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=615.9200000000001s)]
*  That was great. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=617.9200000000001s)]
*  That's a great album. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=618.9200000000001s)]
*  It was in a place like that, a Boston place, but not in a documentary, but Will Durst, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=620.52s)]
*  he's a Francisco comedian. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=624.9599999999999s)]
*  He had a room like that called the Comedy Zoo or the Zoo. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=627.5999999999999s)]
*  Holy City Zoo, right? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=631.4s)]
*  Holy City Zoo. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=632.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=633.4s)]
*  And there's a comedian that came out of there that's a killer comic and he's still alive [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=634.4s)]
*  and he opened for me and he opened for Rob Schneider and Papa and he opened up for a [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=637.4799999999999s)]
*  lot of people. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=644.16s)]
*  Larry Bubbles Brown. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=645.7199999999999s)]
*  Oh, cool. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=646.7199999999999s)]
*  He's an old school guy. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=648.52s)]
*  After every joke he goes, mer. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=649.52s)]
*  But he did Letterman in 1992 and then he did it again in 2006. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=652.52s)]
*  So he has a record for doing Letterman between 30 years. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=659.32s)]
*  Wow. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=662.64s)]
*  But he's one of those comedians that never left San Francisco. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=663.64s)]
*  There's a few of those guys that got trapped like that. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=667.8000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=670.12s)]
*  That were really good guys. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=671.12s)]
*  Remember that one guy in Chicago? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=672.52s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=674.52s)]
*  What was his name? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=676.3199999999999s)]
*  Larry Reeb? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=677.3199999999999s)]
*  Larry Reeb. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=678.3199999999999s)]
*  Remember Larry Reeb? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=679.3199999999999s)]
*  He was a guy like that. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=682.1999999999999s)]
*  Like a really solid national act but it was so Chicago. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=683.36s)]
*  He kind of stayed around there mostly. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=687.36s)]
*  But it was like every now and then you'd find towns like that. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=689.04s)]
*  You had like one murderer that lived in the town. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=691.84s)]
*  Bob Marley in New England. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=694.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=695.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=696.84s)]
*  Bob Marley was the murderer of Maine. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=697.84s)]
*  And Robert Schiml was Arizona. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=700.12s)]
*  I love Robert Schiml, man. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=702.48s)]
*  Yeah, he was the best. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=703.48s)]
*  He was such a good guy. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=705.36s)]
*  But he lived in Phoenix. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=707.2800000000001s)]
*  And it was somewhere in that area. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=709.36s)]
*  I think it was Phoenix. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=710.9200000000001s)]
*  But for him it was like it was easier to get around the country that way and he didn't [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=712.96s)]
*  want to be a part of it. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=717.0s)]
*  He was like one of the first guys that I was like, oh, you could like be a big time comic [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=718.0s)]
*  and not have to leave your state. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=721.9200000000001s)]
*  Like you get to a point where you can live in Oklahoma like Larry the Cable Guy does [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=723.5600000000001s)]
*  probably. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=727.0s)]
*  Where does he live? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=728.0s)]
*  He lives in like somewhere like Georgia or something like that? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=729.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=731.24s)]
*  In the country. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=732.24s)]
*  Where does he live? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=733.24s)]
*  Is that where he lives though? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=734.28s)]
*  I don't want to give up. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=735.28s)]
*  I'm not trying to dock. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=736.28s)]
*  It's just where he was from. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=737.28s)]
*  He's like on the radio there. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=738.28s)]
*  But I think, yeah, he's definitely from there. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=739.28s)]
*  I just don't know if he lives there. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=741.6800000000001s)]
*  We probably shouldn't say where he lives. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=743.32s)]
*  But that dude is, he could be anywhere. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=745.12s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=748.04s)]
*  You could just go anywhere. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=749.04s)]
*  I used to see his face when I go to a Paso comic strip and all the dudes you're talking [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=751.08s)]
*  about they were all there. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=756.32s)]
*  Dude, I remember Josh Wolfe showed me a picture that he took when he was on stage and they [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=757.64s)]
*  were doing, it was like 60,000 people. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=762.08s)]
*  So Larry the Cable Guy was doing like 60,000 people and Josh Wolfe's got his camera and [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=766.6800000000001s)]
*  he's like moving around on stage like that is the craziest fucking thing I've ever seen. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=771.0s)]
*  That crowd is so insane. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=774.9200000000001s)]
*  That's how big that guy got. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=776.5200000000001s)]
*  50,000 people, man. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=777.5200000000001s)]
*  And he was another dude that got hated on for no reason other than his success. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=780.64s)]
*  It was like for some reason everybody couldn't believe that you could say offensive things [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=787.32s)]
*  as a joke in a character all of a sudden. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=793.6s)]
*  And it so coincidentally happened at the same time as him getting super huge. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=797.5200000000001s)]
*  It's like you guys are just fucking haters. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=803.44s)]
*  That's crazy how when they start hating the character but not the person. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=806.5600000000001s)]
*  Well that's the dice thing. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=810.96s)]
*  Yeah right, just like the guy with the, they have that puppet in New York. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=812.6s)]
*  Oh Otto and George. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=815.84s)]
*  Yeah, Greg Girodto, when I opened for him back in the day, back in Addison Improv, he [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=817.04s)]
*  told me that he would say the nastiest shit at that puppet and this lady threw shit at [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=823.6s)]
*  the puppet but not at Otto. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=830.3199999999999s)]
*  Bro, we were talking about it Tuesday night in the green room. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=832.8s)]
*  We were talking about how that puppet was kind of possessed. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=836.36s)]
*  And I'm not even bullshitting. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=839.6s)]
*  You know Otto was out there. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=840.88s)]
*  Otto was out there. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=842.48s)]
*  I mean he was out there. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=843.76s)]
*  That dude partied. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=845.88s)]
*  He went hard and he was a genius comedian. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=847.64s)]
*  But he would get rides to gigs and say pull over. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=850.9200000000001s)]
*  I got to check on George. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=854.84s)]
*  And he would, in the fucking side of the highway, he would pull over, pop the trunk [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=857.32s)]
*  and check on the dummy. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=863.32s)]
*  Wow, his buddy. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=864.9200000000001s)]
*  Weird man. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=868.6s)]
*  Weird man. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=869.32s)]
*  Weird. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=869.88s)]
*  Whoa, there he is. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=870.2s)]
*  Bro, someone stabbed that dummy once at Dangerfields. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=871.32s)]
*  Some Puerto Rican guy. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=875.48s)]
*  The dummy was saying Puerto Rican jokes to this guy. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=876.76s)]
*  And the guy fucking stabbed the dummy. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=879.8000000000001s)]
*  Stabbed the dummy. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=882.52s)]
*  Was it a knife or a sharp bed spring? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=883.72s)]
*  A fucking knife. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=885.8000000000001s)]
*  Or a sharp bed spring, bro. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=887.4s)]
*  Something, anything. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=889.5600000000001s)]
*  Whatever you got that you polished down to a point. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=890.6800000000001s)]
*  You ever watched The Fabulous Miss Maisel? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=892.36s)]
*  What that? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=895.24s)]
*  The Fabulous Miss Maisel is about a female comic growing up in the 50s on Amazon. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=895.64s)]
*  No. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=900.6s)]
*  Oh, Fabulous Mrs. Maisel. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=901.88s)]
*  Mrs. Maisel. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=903.48s)]
*  Oh, she's Mrs. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=904.28s)]
*  I thought you were saying something in Spanish. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=906.2s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=909.72s)]
*  You ever seen Mousy Maciol? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=910.84s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=913.4s)]
*  I literally thought you were talking about a completely different show. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=914.2s)]
*  Do you remember the ventriloquist that did a one minute set on her show? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=916.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=920.2s)]
*  Well, so like ventriloquist, now it's like, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=921.72s)]
*  it's one of those things like with Carrot Top, he's like so successful at props that no one does [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=926.36s)]
*  props anymore. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=932.68s)]
*  But when we first started out, everybody did props. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=933.88s)]
*  There was like 10 guys on a lineup of 20 guys that have props they bring with them on stage. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=937.7199999999999s)]
*  Because sometimes it was really funny. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=943.0799999999999s)]
*  Rusty Dooley. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=944.92s)]
*  Yeah, Rusty Dooley was great at it. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=945.88s)]
*  But it's like he owned that for whatever reason. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=947.4799999999999s)]
*  Because Carrot Top got so big using props, he's the only guy that still does it, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=951.0s)]
*  that he kind of owns that. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=954.76s)]
*  And then with Jeff Dunham, he got so big at being a ventriloquist. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=956.3599999999999s)]
*  There's no ventriloquist anymore. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=960.8399999999999s)]
*  We were kids, there was always comedy ventriloquist. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=963.3199999999999s)]
*  There was like Willie Tyler and Lester. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=966.4399999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=968.4399999999999s)]
*  It was a fun thing. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=970.28s)]
*  You get the dummy to say fucked up shit. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=971.8s)]
*  And then you go, I can't believe you could say that in front of these nice people. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=974.1999999999999s)]
*  And then George would be like, fuck these people. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=978.12s)]
*  He would tell everybody to suck his cock. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=981.64s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=983.4s)]
*  What's another one? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=985.4s)]
*  Woody Woody and the Hood. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=986.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=988.28s)]
*  Well, with Otto and George, it was a little different, man. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=989.08s)]
*  Because I think George, I think Otto believed that George was alive. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=991.72s)]
*  I think Otto believed there was something about George that was different than him. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=997.96s)]
*  Like he was not Otto and George. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1001.8s)]
*  He was just Otto. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1004.84s)]
*  And George only existed when George was there. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1006.28s)]
*  And it seemed like there was something going on with that. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1008.84s)]
*  And it might be just he fucking fried his brain to the point where he was connecting with, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1011.72s)]
*  you know, all kinds of energy that wasn't even there. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1018.28s)]
*  He was out there. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1022.04s)]
*  He was out there. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1022.92s)]
*  But the combination. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1023.8s)]
*  I want to smoke crack together. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1024.76s)]
*  I want to smoke crack together. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1026.12s)]
*  Yeah, he probably made George smoke it. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1027.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1029.6399999999999s)]
*  There's famous Otto crack stories. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1030.36s)]
*  He was, that guy was gone, but he was also brilliant. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1032.84s)]
*  He was really funny, man. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1035.8s)]
*  Fucking funny. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1037.3999999999999s)]
*  And we in a comics comic, like we would all sit in the back of the room to watch [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1038.44s)]
*  when he was on stage. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1042.12s)]
*  But so there's a lot of those guys that are like real genius, but they're real eccentric. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1043.72s)]
*  And for whatever reason, the general public doesn't find out about him. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1049.72s)]
*  There's not like a good vehicle, at least back then there wasn't, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1053.48s)]
*  for them to get out to the general public. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1057.0s)]
*  Like today, I would say an example that is like Brian Holtzman. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1059.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1063.8000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1064.3600000000001s)]
*  Like Brian Holtzman, we've known forever. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1064.68s)]
*  He's always been a guy we all watched. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1066.8400000000001s)]
*  He was always the guy that at the end of the night, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1069.3200000000002s)]
*  especially if something fucked up happened, like there was a plane crash, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1071.24s)]
*  like someone got eaten by a lion. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1075.48s)]
*  That's funny because you mentioned a plane crash because I was there when they did that joke. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1077.4s)]
*  I was in the back of the comedy store. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1082.36s)]
*  He said, American Airlines is hiring. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1084.1200000000001s)]
*  And then he said, and I remember who survived that airline. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1092.1200000000001s)]
*  And he said, fuck that. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1097.96s)]
*  Everybody says, how come they don't build a plane out of the black box [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1101.0s)]
*  or simulate to the back box? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1104.3600000000001s)]
*  Simulate to a fucking baby. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1106.1200000000001s)]
*  Baby survived. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1108.2s)]
*  Give me a hold of that baby, bitch. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1109.56s)]
*  A baby survived? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1111.48s)]
*  Yeah, a baby survived an airline at the flight one time and he said, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1112.8400000000001s)]
*  I want to hold that baby. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1117.16s)]
*  I want to hold somebody's baby in an airplane just in case it goes down. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1118.44s)]
*  Because if a baby survived, I'm going to survive. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1122.3600000000001s)]
*  You have to see him say it. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1124.68s)]
*  I don't think we're doing it justice. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1126.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm fucking it all up. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1127.64s)]

*  They didn't put away their blocks. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1137.6399999999999s)]
*  Those kids will not be missed. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1139.24s)]
*  The fun thing about Brian is if you know him in real life, he's the sweetest guy on earth. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1141.9599999999998s)]

*  Brian Holtzman has no enemies. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1153.6399999999999s)]
*  He's always sweet and friendly. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1155.08s)]
*  And then he gets on stage and it's like he becomes like his version of George. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1157.16s)]
*  I hung out with Brian Holtzman and his mom in San Antonio, Texas. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1163.24s)]
*  We were doing the Latino laugh festival. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1171.3200000000002s)]

*  He starts screaming and shit. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1266.52s)]
*  But it's also like he's playing this bizarre psychotic character. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1268.84s)]
*  That only comes out when he's on stage. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1273.0s)]
*  He's the most different when he's on stage. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1275.16s)]
*  And he held his job too. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1277.48s)]
*  When he had a job at the RX. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1278.84s)]
*  He always had a job. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1280.2s)]
*  That was the problem. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1280.92s)]
*  Blue collar guy. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1281.08s)]

*  He never hit, he never hit the road. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1283.16s)]
*  He stuck around the store. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1284.84s)]
*  Cause like I was saying, there's not like a path for those guys. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1285.72s)]
*  Like nobody wanted Brian Holtzman to open for them. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1289.16s)]
*  That's too weird. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1291.96s)]

*  His shows at the mothership, they're all sold out. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1300.44s)]

*  People come to see him and he didn't have a path before. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1303.96s)]
*  It was like, there was like, you know, he's too weird to put on a television show. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1307.72s)]
*  It's like, it's like you gotta, you really want to be in the room. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1311.72s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1315.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1315.96s)]

*  The discomfort, the weirdness and the way he works around it [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1320.92s)]
*  when you're in the room is so fun. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1324.6000000000001s)]
*  And every show is different. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1326.52s)]
*  Every show is different. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1327.88s)]
*  And he's always talking about new things. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1329.0s)]
*  He's like, I mean, it's really like he channels this fucking character. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1331.32s)]
*  It's like he should be two different people. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1335.48s)]
*  He should be Brian Holtzman, the super nice guy. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1338.36s)]
*  And then whatever the fuck his name is when he's on stage. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1341.08s)]
*  It's almost like he needs a second name. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1343.8s)]
*  Mitzi should have done that a long time ago. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1345.56s)]
*  Mitzi used to call Joey fat baby. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1347.16s)]
*  Do you remember those days? [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1349.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1349.96s)]
*  Someone has one of the lineups that they got from Jeff Scott and on the lineup. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1352.2s)]
*  It's got everybody's name and then, you know, 15 minutes. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1357.64s)]

*  She wanted him to be called fat baby. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1363.0s)]
*  Weird advice. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1367.56s)]
*  Sometimes, man, the managers give you terrible advice. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1368.28s)]
*  Can't listen to any of them. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1371.0800000000002s)]
*  What good advice? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1373.0s)]
*  I was bummed out one time because, you know, you have to go back and forth, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1373.8s)]
*  back and forth till they make you a regular. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1377.0800000000002s)]
*  And I was trying at the Laugh Factory. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1380.44s)]
*  And one time, James, he told me, I don't see you making it, man. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1383.48s)]
*  For another six to eight years. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1387.16s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1388.92s)]
*  And then when I finally got last company standing, I looked at him and said, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1389.64s)]
*  you're Jamie, you're about to fall asleep. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1392.8400000000001s)]
*  So 12. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1395.64s)]
*  It took 12, not six. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1397.88s)]
*  But I was bummed out when he told me that I was like bummed out. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1399.96s)]
*  You know, you get bummed out like realize you're putting all this work in it. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1402.2s)]
*  Like, you know, you can't be a regular here. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1405.3200000000002s)]
*  So you got to go back to these other rooms. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1407.8000000000002s)]
*  I talked to Brad Williams and he said, fuck that advice, bro. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1411.0800000000002s)]
*  You know what he told me? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1416.8400000000001s)]
*  He said he told me that you get all the little people I can find in Hollywood. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1418.52s)]
*  All of them are the little midgets, our little little persons and bring them to the Laugh Factory. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1423.56s)]
*  And Jamie said you can have the biggest little person show in all of Hollywood. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1429.08s)]
*  That was his advice for Brad. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1436.04s)]
*  So that's I was not feeling so bad after that. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1437.88s)]
*  Then I talked to Alonzo Bowden and he told Alonzo Bowden that he should put on shoulder pads [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1440.68s)]
*  and be a football comic. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1445.96s)]
*  So Joe, after hearing that, I don't want to cry anymore. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1451.5600000000002s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1456.2s)]
*  He had some terrible advice. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1458.2s)]
*  I think it was he was given advice. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1461.0800000000002s)]
*  I think it was he was given this advice to Todd Parker, who was telling him it was either [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1463.0s)]
*  Todd Parker or Robbie Prince, two guys that I knew from Boston. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1467.64s)]
*  One of them is telling him, I think it's Todd, you've got to be Generation X guy. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1470.68s)]
*  This is what you're going to be, buddy. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1474.92s)]
*  You're going to be Generation X guy. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1476.68s)]
*  So from Generation X, this is how I see the world, buddy. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1478.68s)]
*  Like everything was as a GenerA generation X guy. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1482.28s)]
*  Like he was like, that's the worst advice I've ever heard in my life. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1486.28s)]
*  Like, why would I do that? [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1489.16s)]
*  But people would have like schemes for you. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1490.44s)]
*  But the thing is, they're just trying to help. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1493.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1495.4s)]
*  But the no one knows how to do it other than you. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1495.88s)]
*  And you got to figure it out. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1499.4s)]
*  No one can tell you. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1500.52s)]
*  Yeah, they're like outdated, too. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1502.04s)]
*  Outdated, too. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1503.64s)]
*  Like who would have told Mitch Hedberg, wear sunglasses and sometimes turn your back to [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1504.92s)]
*  the crowd? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1509.0s)]
*  No one. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1509.56s)]
*  No one. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1510.1200000000001s)]
*  Mitch Hedberg would be killing with his back to the crowd high on heroin, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1511.0s)]
*  all non sequiturs for like an hour and a half. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1516.68s)]
*  They have stage fright? [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1519.64s)]
*  He was just crazy, you know. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1521.16s)]
*  You worked with him? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1522.84s)]
*  You met him? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1523.56s)]
*  I met him. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1524.2s)]
*  I didn't know him well, but I knew him enough that it was a bummer when he died. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1524.84s)]
*  I remember I was with Stan Hope. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1531.08s)]
*  We were filming something and we found out that he had gangrene. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1532.36s)]
*  He got admitted to a hospital. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1537.6399999999999s)]
*  He had gangrene. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1539.08s)]
*  You're like, yo, gangrene fucking kills people. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1539.8799999999999s)]
*  Like, this is fucking scary. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1542.12s)]
*  And, you know, he just had a problem. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1544.12s)]
*  He just liked that heroin. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1547.08s)]
*  And he didn't want to stop. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1549.3999999999999s)]
*  Like, people wanted to clean him up. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1550.84s)]
*  He did not want to get cleaned up. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1552.1999999999998s)]
*  He was like, I am not interested. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1553.48s)]
*  I think I was in one time, but I didn't show it up. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1555.3999999999999s)]
*  I just smoked it. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1557.8799999999999s)]
*  But I was in Amsterdam. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1559.0s)]
*  It doesn't seem like anybody has a great old time with the rest of their life [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1561.56s)]
*  once they start doing heroin. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1565.32s)]
*  It's like cocaine. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1567.48s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1568.36s)]
*  It's like I think there's probably moments of brilliance that have come out of heroin, though. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1569.1599999999999s)]
*  I definitely do. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1574.28s)]
*  And I think about 1960s music. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1575.48s)]
*  I think heroin and LSD affected a lot of rock and roll in the 1960s. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1579.0s)]
*  And cannabis for sure, too. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1584.6s)]
*  And probably mushrooms. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1586.36s)]
*  But, you know, the thing that it always kills you. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1588.2s)]
*  Like everybody always it always ruins everything. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1593.16s)]
*  They all died young. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1596.2s)]
*  Everybody like but Morrison, 27, Hendrix, 27. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1597.72s)]
*  Although there is a wild conspiracy about Hendrix. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1602.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1605.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1606.76s)]
*  Which is here. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1607.16s)]
*  That he was killed by his manager. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1607.8000000000002s)]
*  The conspiracy. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1609.88s)]
*  There was one of his bodyguards, right? [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1610.6000000000001s)]
*  Is that what it was, Jamie, that wrote this book? [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1612.8400000000001s)]
*  How did he die? [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1615.16s)]
*  He I think he died of his asphyxiation from throwing up, you know, which is one thing [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1616.76s)]
*  that can happen to people that are doing drugs. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1622.68s)]
*  But the bodyguard, I believe this don't hold me to this, but I believe the story was Hendrix [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1626.04s)]
*  was going to leave his manager. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1634.36s)]
*  His manager was mobbed up. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1635.72s)]
*  His manager was a scary guy. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1637.24s)]
*  And his manager is making a lot of money with Hendrix. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1639.08s)]
*  Hendrix is trying to leave. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1641.32s)]
*  And he's got the rights to the Hendrix catalog and he kills Hendrix. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1642.9199999999998s)]
*  So his former roadie. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1648.52s)]
*  So the thing that's compelling about this is shortly after this, his girlfriend. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1650.6s)]
*  He's happy. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1656.1999999999998s)]
*  Committed suicide, air quotes, by being thrown off a roof. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1657.08s)]
*  So they got rid of Hendrix and they got rid of his girlfriend, if that's what really happened. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1661.08s)]
*  So he was the benefactor, allegedly, of the guitarist's $2 million life insurance policy. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1665.8s)]
*  $2 million. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1673.0s)]
*  Okay, worth around $1.2 million in 1970. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1675.24s)]
*  According to Wright, Jeffrey told him about the crime in 1971, a year after the 27-year-old [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1679.24s)]
*  Hendrix was found dead in a London hotel. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1684.4399999999998s)]
*  He said, I had to do it, Tappy. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1687.1599999999999s)]
*  Wright claims the manager said, you understand, don't you? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1688.76s)]
*  I had to do it. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1691.3999999999999s)]
*  You know damn well what I'm talking about. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1692.6s)]
*  We went around to his hotel room, got a handful of pills, stuffed them into his mouth, then [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1695.1599999999999s)]
*  poured a few bottles of red wine deep into his windpipe. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1700.68s)]
*  Hendrix is found dead at the Samarkand hotel on 18th of September 1970. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1704.28s)]
*  The cause of death was recorded as barbiturate intoxication and inhalation of vomit. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1711.16s)]
*  I can still hear the conversation Wright wrote of Jeffrey's confession. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1717.96s)]
*  See the man I'd known for so much of my life, his face pale, hand clutching at his glass in sudden [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1722.44s)]
*  rage. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1728.52s)]
*  Hendrix manager died in a plane crash in 73. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1729.88s)]
*  So this guy's dead. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1733.48s)]
*  He supposedly did this. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1734.44s)]
*  Listen man, they did that back then. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1735.88s)]
*  They were gangsters. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1738.2s)]

*  Yeah man, gangsters own a lot of stuff that a lot of people wouldn't want to own like a gay club. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1747.72s)]

*  He's badass too. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1863.0s)]

*  and he's on television shaking his hips. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1960.2s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1972.84s)]

*  besides the one you have here, the rest of it. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=1995.48s)]

*  and he's fucking young as hell, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2003.88s)]
*  and the poppadood looking good, the blue are the shinies. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2005.72s)]
*  Like, bro. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2008.2s)]
*  And everybody's fainting. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2010.2s)]
*  And there was no Elvis before Elvis. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2011.56s)]
*  That's what's crazy. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2013.48s)]

*  And then he's got an evil manager. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2020.9199999999998s)]
*  And then he's doing pills. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2022.52s)]

*  And the whole world don't make any sense. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2025.8799999999999s)]

*  Wasn't that a part of the movie? [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2050.44s)]
*  And then he got that Vegas residency. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2052.44s)]
*  Bro, the Vegas residency is probably convenient [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2056.2s)]
*  because you don't have to go anywhere. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2059.8s)]
*  You know where you live. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2061.96s)]

*  But I don't think I could do that. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2065.4s)]
*  Put a few musicians though. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2068.12s)]
*  Like Elvis, it's great. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2069.88s)]

*  But even like comics can do it. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2072.2s)]
*  A lot of comics do it. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2073.96s)]

*  I lose my mind being in the same place seven days a week, 14 shows. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2081.0s)]
*  The people that live outside of Vegas love it though. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2085.24s)]

*  It's so devastating to mainstream media. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2272.52s)]
*  That was what it was. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2275.32s)]

*  And we were crazy. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2283.64s)]
*  Did you have local channels too though in your neighborhood? [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2284.44s)]

*  You need those. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2294.68s)]
*  Somebody got to play karate movies. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2295.48s)]
*  Yeah, we didn't even have cable. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2297.08s)]
*  Like it didn't exist. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2298.44s)]
*  Like you have to realize how nuts the world was when everything you watched on television [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2300.44s)]
*  was just television. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2304.92s)]
*  That's all you ever saw. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2305.96s)]
*  Like there's no cable. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2307.56s)]

*  If you're, you felt so lucky to have that fourth channel. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2310.28s)]
*  It was crazy, bro. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2313.64s)]
*  The Simpsons, Married with Children came on that channel. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2314.36s)]
*  Fox changed the whole, In Living Color, changed the whole feeling of what a channel was. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2317.32s)]
*  It's crazy that Fox is now connected to like conservative Republicans reporting the news. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2323.48s)]
*  But it's like Fox when we were kids was married with children. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2329.08s)]
*  It was, you know, it was like the Renegade shows. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2332.52s)]
*  It was The Simpsons. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2335.24s)]
*  It was, you know, there was a bunch of like fun shows that were on Fox. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2337.16s)]

*  Saturday Night Live always gets it for longevity because it's crazy. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2349.96s)]
*  They've been around so long. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2352.92s)]

*  But for like pure funny. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2354.76s)]
*  For me, it's like In Living Color and Chappelle Show. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2357.16s)]
*  I feel like you don't get Chappelle Show unless you have In Living Color first. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2360.8399999999997s)]
*  I feel like In Living Color broke open the door for chaotic sketches that were like really funny, [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2365.72s)]
*  man. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2374.3599999999997s)]

*  Especially when Damon Wayans and David Lynn Grier were doing man on film. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2390.52s)]
*  There's an episode where the camera falls. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2394.52s)]
*  They gave it two snaps. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2397.6400000000003s)]

*  First of all, I don't buy it. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2473.16s)]
*  Even if she had it turned to that photo again. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2478.92s)]
*  That's Sean Young, right? [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2482.12s)]
*  When she was hot. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2484.44s)]
*  So even if she had a dick, there's a lot of guys who'd be like, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2486.68s)]
*  listen, nobody needs to know about that dick. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2489.08s)]
*  Nobody needs to know about that, man. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2490.8399999999997s)]
*  That dick is between you and me. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2492.04s)]
*  I remember one time it happened to me, bro. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2494.7599999999998s)]
*  I just looked at it and it was a big ass skin tag you got right there. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2496.3599999999997s)]
*  Skin tag. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2501.3999999999996s)]
*  Whoo. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2504.12s)]
*  Yeah, all those shows, like, I mean, what are the other great sketch shows? [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2506.12s)]
*  Mad TV had some bangers. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2510.7599999999998s)]
*  Mad TV. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2512.2s)]
*  There were some bangers on Mad TV. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2512.68s)]
*  But it's another show that's like... [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2514.2799999999997s)]
*  Second City TV. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2515.16s)]
*  I watched that growing up. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2516.2799999999997s)]
*  Kids in the Hall. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2517.48s)]
*  Kids in the Hall. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2518.3599999999997s)]
*  Kids in the Hall. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2519.0s)]
*  Kids in the Hall was fantastic. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2519.96s)]
*  That was great. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2521.64s)]
*  I was a Kids in the Hall fan, but I didn't really start watching it, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2524.6s)]
*  really get into it until after I'd met Dave. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2529.3199999999997s)]
*  I didn't know much about Kids in the Hall. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2531.8s)]
*  I knew it was funny. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2534.2000000000003s)]
*  I knew everybody said it was funny, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2534.92s)]
*  but I don't think I'd ever even watched a sketch. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2535.88s)]
*  And then I became friends with Dave doing news radio. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2539.0800000000004s)]
*  And then I started really getting into it. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2542.52s)]
*  I was like, oh, that guy had a very unique, or still does, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2544.28s)]
*  have a very, very unique sense of humor. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2547.88s)]
*  He rewrote, like, I don't know what percentage, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2549.96s)]
*  40% of the lines on news radio, like on the set. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2553.6400000000003s)]
*  Rewrits things all the time. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2558.44s)]
*  He was always coming up with a better way to do something, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2560.36s)]
*  and always had a sense of pacing. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2563.64s)]
*  That's a totally different thing, man, when you're making sketches. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2568.6s)]
*  To be able to do that and do a lot of really funny scenarios that are unique, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2573.48s)]
*  that's a very- [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2578.68s)]
*  It's hard, right? [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2579.64s)]
*  To stand up because we want to end it, huh? [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2580.28s)]
*  Well, it's a totally different way of thinking. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2583.2400000000002s)]
*  Gillian Keeves is another fantastic one. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2585.32s)]
*  That, to this day, the problem with that show is it's got this amazing fan, [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2588.6s)]
*  core fan base, but it's way funnier than the amount of people that have seen it. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2593.56s)]
*  It's way funnier, which is crazy, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2600.8399999999997s)]
*  because Shane Gillis is one of the biggest comics in the world. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2602.52s)]
*  Yes, he's funny as hell. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2605.08s)]
*  He's one of the biggest comics on Earth. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2606.7599999999998s)]
*  He's selling out arenas everywhere. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2608.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2610.04s)]
*  But yet people don't realize how good Gillian Keeves is. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2610.44s)]
*  It's like, there's the one where they do the OnlyFans dad. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2613.7999999999997s)]
*  One of the hardest I've ever laughed in my fucking life. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2617.24s)]
*  It's so funny. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2620.7599999999998s)]
*  It's so funny and so crazy. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2622.2s)]
*  Because no one's telling them what to do, they're just doing what's funny. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2624.52s)]
*  That's what got fucked up. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2628.68s)]
*  There were so many fucking nannies around everybody, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2630.6s)]
*  telling everybody what you can and can't say, [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2633.4s)]
*  and so many subjects you can and can't cover. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2635.4s)]
*  You got to stay out of the way, just like the managers in the early days. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2638.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2642.2s)]
*  They're telling you, [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2642.44s)]
*  Be clean. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2643.08s)]
*  You need braids. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2644.04s)]
*  Braids bro with beads. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2645.8s)]
*  And you talk about the beads when you're on stage. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2647.0s)]
*  You're like, what? [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2648.68s)]
*  You need to wear a suit. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2649.56s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2650.52s)]
*  Get out of here. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2651.48s)]
*  I remember one time bro, they told me to wear a suit and I wore it. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2652.44s)]
*  And I saw Joe Deere wearing a suit. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2654.84s)]
*  I said, bro, we look ridiculous, huh? [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2656.36s)]
*  Joe Deere, he was wearing a beanie. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2659.24s)]
*  I remember I called him the Coca Cola bear. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2660.84s)]
*  He got mad. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2662.76s)]
*  Suits are a weird move, but they're sometimes fun. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2665.32s)]
*  I've worn suits on stage before. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2668.36s)]
*  It makes you feel different. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2669.96s)]
*  It does. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2671.56s)]
*  It really does. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2672.12s)]
*  You kind of change your posture or? [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2672.8399999999997s)]
*  No, you just feel like more of a motherfucking professional. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2675.56s)]
*  Bitch. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2680.04s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2680.6s)]
*  And a well tailored suit is what you really want. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2681.3999999999996s)]
*  The kind like modern suits you can move in them. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2684.8399999999997s)]
*  They have like stretch to them, which is different than, you know, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2688.2799999999997s)]
*  when I was a kid and I thought of suits, I thought of like, you're handcuffed. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2691.96s)]
*  Like you can't move good. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2695.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2696.2799999999997s)]
*  Like you can't kick someone with fucking suit pants on. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2696.68s)]
*  You know, you can't move well. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2700.04s)]
*  I know. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2701.32s)]
*  Although I always see Johnny Carson in his suits. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2701.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2704.44s)]
*  Those two suits look tight as hell. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2704.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, it's just the fabrics suck back then. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2706.76s)]
*  Especially if you're a bigger person, you know, if you lift weights or something like that, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2710.52s)]
*  if you have muscles, everything's going to be constricted and tight and all fucked up. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2713.96s)]
*  It's not going to fit good. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2719.0800000000004s)]
*  So suits now, if you get a good one, like I got mine made by David August. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2720.6800000000003s)]
*  They do them for the UFC and I've had them make a bunch of suits for me. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2725.1600000000003s)]
*  They're amazing. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2728.6800000000003s)]
*  They do it to your actual shape. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2729.72s)]
*  I mean, I don't want to be funny to the other guys, but you're announcing, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2731.8799999999997s)]
*  you know, you're a big muscle guy, but it doesn't look like you're coming out of that suit. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2738.44s)]
*  When you wear it, it looks real good on you. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2743.4s)]
*  Yes, because they make it to your shape. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2745.08s)]
*  You know, so it's real comfortable. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2747.3199999999997s)]
*  They're about to just come out and they're like fucking orangutan, brother. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2748.8399999999997s)]
*  Like, like Mr. Hyde. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2752.44s)]
*  Well, you know, a lot of those dudes are bigger than me anyway. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2756.2799999999997s)]
*  That's true. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2759.16s)]
*  There's a certain size that you get. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2760.04s)]
*  Like if you put the rock in a suit, it still looks ridiculous. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2761.4s)]
*  It's like, what the fuck are you made out of, dude? [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2764.04s)]
*  First time I met him backstage at the UFC and he had cowboy boots on. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2767.7999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2771.96s)]
*  So he's, it doesn't even seem like a real person. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2772.12s)]
*  Like when you meet him in real life, you're like, how, what the fuck are you? [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2775.96s)]
*  He's like a, like a superhero. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2779.64s)]
*  Like you're seeing like a real live superhero and a super nice guy, man. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2781.24s)]
*  He came and worked out with us. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2785.7999999999997s)]
*  We all worked out. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2787.16s)]
*  Tony Hinchcliffe, Derek, Asan. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2787.96s)]
*  We all fucking lifted weights together, hung out, gotten the sauna. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2790.12s)]
*  Shane Gillis. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2794.2799999999997s)]
*  We're all just chilling with the rock, working out with him. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2795.3199999999997s)]
*  Like no cameras, no nothing. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2798.52s)]
*  I was like, let's fuck. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2800.52s)]
*  We don't have to post this. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2801.48s)]
*  Let's just have some fun. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2802.68s)]
*  It's like, fuck yeah. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2803.64s)]
*  He was cool as shit. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2804.68s)]
*  Cool as shit, man. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2806.2799999999997s)]
*  Wow. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2807.64s)]
*  That's amazing, man. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2807.8799999999997s)]
*  It was fun. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2809.0s)]
*  I enjoyed talking to him. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2810.04s)]
*  It's a good guy. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2811.0s)]
*  I was in the airplane at the Delta and I saw Jason Momoa. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2811.56s)]
*  Oh, he's another one. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2816.7599999999998s)]
*  And I said, a little too handsome for me. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2817.64s)]
*  I just said, what's up? [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2819.3999999999996s)]
*  No, I don't know how to meet people. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2821.96s)]
*  I was always weird people. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2823.08s)]
*  I said, Jason, I just like that. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2825.24s)]
*  Jason, what's up? [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2827.16s)]
*  And then I didn't know that we were sitting almost close together on the airplane. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2829.3199999999997s)]
*  Then he saw me again, bro. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2833.24s)]
*  Then I said, what's up? [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2835.08s)]
*  Then I felt like I creeped him out again, man. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2836.9199999999996s)]
*  My wife was recording him, bro, recording him. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2840.6s)]
*  But I was on my phone. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2844.04s)]
*  He thought I was recording him. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2845.0s)]
*  I met him in a Whole Foods parking lot. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2847.56s)]
*  I met him in a Whole Foods parking lot in Woodland Hills. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2850.2s)]
*  I was going to pick up some groceries and he was there too. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2852.68s)]
*  I was like, what's up, man? [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2855.2400000000002s)]
*  How you doing? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2856.12s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2856.52s)]
*  We're talking. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2857.08s)]
*  I think that was before he did Conan, which I still say to this day, the movie's not good. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2857.88s)]
*  Conan movie kind of falls apart, but the way it looked was amazing. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2864.36s)]
*  And he played Conan and he's the perfect Conan. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2869.08s)]
*  That's what Conan would have looked like. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2871.64s)]
*  He wouldn't have looked like a bodybuilder. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2873.64s)]
*  No disrespect to Arnold, because he looked amazing. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2875.0s)]
*  But it's like Conan was just a big giant warrior. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2877.3199999999997s)]
*  And when he played that guy, what was the guy played on Game of Thrones? [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2880.2799999999997s)]
*  Cracker or something like that. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2885.24s)]
*  I can't remember. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2886.6s)]
*  He was fucking incredible at that. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2887.56s)]
*  He played with them. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2889.16s)]
*  That's Conan, man. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2890.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2891.16s)]
*  That's Conan. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2891.56s)]
*  Someone needs to do a good Conan the Barbarian movie. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2892.44s)]
*  Go back and read the Robert E. Howard books. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2896.44s)]
*  The books are great. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2899.48s)]
*  It's this super depressed dude in the 1930s writes about this barbarian. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2901.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2906.6s)]
*  Khal Drago. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2908.44s)]
*  That's right. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2909.32s)]
*  There we are. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2909.64s)]
*  Two people you're mistaken by. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2910.12s)]
*  Bro, get a photo of him when he was Conan. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2911.7200000000003s)]
*  Jason Momoa as Conan. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2915.0s)]
*  Bro, he was the perfect Conan right there. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2919.48s)]
*  That's what Conan's supposed to look like. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2921.8s)]
*  That's how I'm supposed to look too. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2923.8s)]
*  That's the perfect Conan. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2924.92s)]
*  That's the Conan you believe is real. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2926.76s)]
*  That's a guy throwing a sword around his whole life and fighting off dragons. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2928.76s)]
*  He's not a bodybuilder. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2932.76s)]
*  No. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2934.44s)]
*  He looks like that. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2934.6000000000004s)]
*  That's what it looks like in the book. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2935.6400000000003s)]
*  That's fucking Conan. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2937.0800000000004s)]
*  We're identical. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2938.36s)]
*  That's Conan. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2939.32s)]
*  I mean, the guy's still capable of playing this character. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2941.2400000000002s)]
*  Someone please. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2945.6400000000003s)]
*  Me. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2946.44s)]
*  I wish Quentin Tarantino was into Conan. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2947.8s)]
*  Quentin, if you're hearing me, please read the books. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2949.6400000000003s)]
*  Quentin Tarantino doing Conan would be the most epic thing of all time. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2952.5200000000004s)]
*  Could you imagine? [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2956.44s)]
*  He would do it right. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2958.92s)]
*  Or Beast Master. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2959.88s)]
*  If he was into it, he would have to be into it. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2960.84s)]
*  I have no idea if he's into it. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2963.56s)]
*  But if he was into it. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2964.92s)]
*  If Quentin Tarantino might do it, it'll start with the ending. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2966.84s)]
*  It'll be like the ending of the movie in the beginning and confuse us. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2972.2000000000003s)]
*  Somebody should do it. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2975.64s)]
*  The books are great, man, because it's all from the mind of this tortured, [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2977.88s)]
*  depressed dude who winds up killing himself. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2982.6s)]
*  It'll be the first time that you'll see a Conan movie with everybody saying the [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2985.48s)]
*  N-word all over and over. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2989.16s)]
*  I don't think they had that word back then. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2992.04s)]
*  I think if you want to do it right. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2993.72s)]
*  Don't make one up. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2994.9199999999996s)]
*  I think if they really wanted to do it right, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2996.2s)]
*  they should probably do it the way Mel Gibson did Apocalypto. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=2997.96s)]
*  That was a bad ass fucking movie, bro. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3001.08s)]
*  You felt that movie, bro. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3002.8399999999997s)]
*  But you know what I'm saying? [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3004.52s)]
*  Hearing the people say it. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3005.96s)]
*  Hardcore. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3007.64s)]
*  And the same thing he did with The Passion of the Christ. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3008.2s)]
*  They spoke in the language and it was all subtitles. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3010.12s)]
*  They spoke in the language. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3014.12s)]
*  So you were transmitted exactly how these people were saying. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3016.2s)]
*  You felt like it was real. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3021.0s)]
*  Like Apocalypto, you felt like it was real. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3022.52s)]
*  There was no English in that movie. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3025.88s)]
*  It is a blockbuster movie that is a wild action adventure movie. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3027.4s)]
*  That movie was hardcore, man. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3032.04s)]
*  The Passion of the Christ. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3033.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3034.44s)]
*  There's something about being sucked into hearing the actual language of the people [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3035.72s)]
*  that would be doing this that's so much better than... [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3039.7999999999997s)]
*  Whenever they do Game of Thrones or something like that in another country, [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3042.2000000000003s)]
*  also everybody has an English accent. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3045.6400000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3047.6400000000003s)]
*  That's how they do it. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3048.04s)]
*  Instead of talking like an American, you can't talk like us [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3049.1600000000003s)]
*  because that would just throw people off. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3051.88s)]
*  So you have to have some sort of a proper way of speaking. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3053.4s)]
*  Kind of like The Exorcist, man. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3056.04s)]
*  If The Exorcist, the devil, wouldn't have had an Irish accent, [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3057.1600000000003s)]
*  it would have been a totally different movie. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3060.6800000000003s)]
*  But the Latin accent, whatever Latin language... [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3062.04s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3066.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3067.7200000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3068.36s)]
*  It's like... [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3068.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3069.96s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3070.6800000000003s)]
*  You don't even know what the language is, but you're fucking scared. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3072.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3074.6000000000004s)]
*  It has to be exotic. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3074.84s)]
*  You can't have the devil going, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3075.88s)]
*  hey, you fucking piece of shit, I'm going to fuck your eyeballs. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3077.0s)]
*  You better get out of my garage. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3080.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3081.7200000000003s)]
*  You can't have the devil talking like Jerry Seinfeld. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3081.88s)]
*  I speak in absolutes. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3085.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3087.56s)]
*  You can't have the devil with a whiny voice. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3088.04s)]
*  Or a Boston accent. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3090.76s)]
*  That was the scariest thing about Mike Tyson. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3092.28s)]
*  His voice was so easy to make fun of, and he fucking murdered everybody. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3094.04s)]
*  Knocked your ass out. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3098.6800000000003s)]
*  It was almost like he was begging you to make fun of his voice. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3099.56s)]
*  Dangerous dudes. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3105.24s)]
*  Yeah, it was almost like he was begging you. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3106.6s)]
*  You're like you, bro. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3109.24s)]
*  You're like one of those guys. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3111.32s)]
*  You're like to someone who doesn't know you personally, you're like, try me. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3112.7599999999998s)]
*  No, I'm not like that at all, though. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3117.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm real nice. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3119.4s)]
*  If I didn't know you, and that's why you're walking down the street, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3119.88s)]
*  and you're not Joe Rogan, I'd be like, okay, man, this guy's a good fight. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3121.88s)]
*  He's healthy. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3126.12s)]
*  Stay away from him. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3127.4s)]
*  I'm friendly. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3128.2799999999997s)]
*  That's what we all need, my friend. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3130.04s)]
*  We need friends. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3131.7999999999997s)]
*  But you've been friendly since day one, though. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3132.36s)]
*  I was talking to your driver, Rebel, about when you gave me that solo pipe. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3135.4s)]
*  And then you say stop using it because of your chain. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3145.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3148.84s)]
*  And I remember I was telling him that the reason it's called solo pipe is because you're [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3149.96s)]
*  supposed to use it by yourself. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3155.0s)]
*  But I remember I told everybody you gave it to me, and everybody wanted to hit it. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3156.44s)]
*  Every time I got it back, it was fucking hot. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3160.6s)]
*  I remember those things. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3164.2000000000003s)]
*  I try to stay, I think if you're smoking a cigar, butane is the way to go. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3165.08s)]
*  You burn the end of it, but you don't want to keep doing it. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3171.08s)]
*  I feel like a certain amount of this is a chemical, no matter what. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3174.6s)]
*  That's a chemical. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3178.6s)]
*  You only want so much of that. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3179.56s)]
*  You really should probably have matches if you're going to smoke a cigar. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3180.92s)]
*  Matches. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3184.92s)]
*  You really should probably have matches. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3186.2000000000003s)]
*  And I think if you're a super cigar nerd, they do it even further. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3188.04s)]
*  They take cedar, and they light cedar strips, and they use that to light their cigar. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3191.48s)]
*  Those are super nerds. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3197.1600000000003s)]
*  Cedar strips? [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3199.0800000000004s)]
*  What is that? [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3199.88s)]
*  Cedar strips, dog. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3200.36s)]
*  Pieces of wood. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3201.7200000000003s)]
*  They light little strips of wood, and they light from pure wood, then they light their cigar. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3203.0s)]
*  This is super nerds when it comes to cigars. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3208.6800000000003s)]
*  Like, they get into it. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3210.84s)]
*  That's what that guy said, guys in New York. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3212.44s)]
*  Give me some ember. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3215.7999999999997s)]
*  Give me some ember? [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3218.12s)]
*  Ember? [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3218.92s)]
*  What is ember? [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3222.2s)]
*  Fire? [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3222.92s)]
*  Oh. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3223.64s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3224.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so these guys, they take little cedar strips, and they light them on fire, [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3225.72s)]
*  and they light their cigar from the cedar strips. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3230.2s)]
*  So this way, you're not getting any of the butane fumes. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3232.52s)]
*  I don't even know how much you would get. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3236.68s)]
*  Get better later? [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3242.6s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3243.56s)]
*  You know how to work it? [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3244.12s)]
*  No. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3245.0s)]
*  Think back. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3245.24s)]
*  We're probably going to find out that every time you burn a lighter near you, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3246.92s)]
*  you inhale like 10 times more than you're ever supposed to in your life. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3254.44s)]
*  We'll probably find something like that out someday. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3259.48s)]
*  It can't be so good to have convenient fire. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3262.44s)]
*  Like, fire that quickly means you've got some funky gases that you're burning. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3265.64s)]
*  You're burning some funky gases in the air. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3272.92s)]
*  Oh, horrible. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3276.12s)]
*  Because I remember lighting a match, and then you get the ugly-ass... [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3277.16s)]
*  You know what's real bad? [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3280.04s)]
*  What? [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3281.0s)]
*  Scented candles. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3281.4s)]
*  Scented candles apparently are not healthy. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3283.56s)]
*  Jamie, Google that. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3287.72s)]
*  Maybe I should say some scented candles. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3290.52s)]
*  Maybe there's a way to do it organically. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3292.44s)]
*  We should find out if that's true too, because that would be a good thing to know. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3295.72s)]
*  Because I think there's some things in some scented candles that you're not supposed to inhale. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3298.7599999999998s)]
*  And when you're a person that likes to have candles, and who doesn't? [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3304.6s)]
*  They're cool. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3309.08s)]
*  You want to have candles in your house? [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3309.96s)]
*  That's dope. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3311.16s)]
*  Like candlelight dinner with a bunch of friends is dope. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3311.96s)]
*  Right? [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3315.56s)]
*  But I think it's the scented ones... [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3316.2s)]
*  It says it's the ones that are made from paraffin. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3317.88s)]
*  The ones that are made from paraffin are the problem. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3320.84s)]
*  It's a cheap byproduct primarily sourced from the refinement of petroleum. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3323.3999999999996s)]
*  So you're burning petroleum. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3328.04s)]
*  Paraffin is the most used candle wax worldwide, according to the National Candle Association, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3329.72s)]
*  the major trade association representing US candle manufacturers and their suppliers. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3334.7599999999998s)]
*  So it's all candles made from paraffin? [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3339.3199999999997s)]
*  However, few studies on candle emissions or their potential effects on human health exist, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3343.08s)]
*  and conclusions from the research are mixed. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3348.68s)]
*  There is no overall conclusion that paraffin candles will either... [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3351.0s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3355.08s)]
*  Either will or won't harm your health, says pulmonologist Dr. Sobia Farouk, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3355.56s)]
*  a clinical assistant professor at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3361.32s)]
*  But the risks may also depend on various factors, including candle type and quality, [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3367.16s)]
*  how often and how long you're burning it, the airflow in the space where you're burning it, [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3371.56s)]
*  your health status and more. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3376.04s)]
*  Well, either it's not good for you, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3377.16s)]
*  or it's fine. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3381.16s)]
*  These are the options. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3383.0s)]
*  And it seems to me like there's a little gaslighting going on here. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3384.2s)]
*  How could it be good for you to have petroleum burning in your house? [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3387.16s)]
*  I want you to show me a study that... [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3390.76s)]
*  Measure the fucking air in the room when you have three candles. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3395.08s)]
*  Measure the air in the room when you have four candles. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3398.04s)]
*  Keep going. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3400.6s)]
*  Tell me when I'm going to get lung cancer from this shit. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3401.48s)]
*  Because... [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3405.56s)]
*  Wow. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3406.92s)]
*  Yeah. Benzene, a known carcinogen, is another VOC released by paraffin candles. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3407.8799999999997s)]
*  Hawk added, long-term exposure to this chemical has been linked to blood disorders such as leukemia. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3415.24s)]
*  When inhaled, benzene can also be a respiratory irritant, which means it can probably... [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3421.4799999999996s)]
*  Yeah. Fuck. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3429.0s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3431.08s)]
*  People think candles are cool. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3432.12s)]
*  It's like... [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3433.64s)]
*  Man. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3434.2799999999997s)]
*  But what about... [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3434.92s)]
*  What is a candle that you can use? [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3436.6800000000003s)]
*  There's got to be candles that are not bad. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3439.7200000000003s)]
*  I hope all those candles that I've got in a massage parlor were safe. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3441.88s)]
*  New candle. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3445.96s)]
*  Oh, now. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3446.76s)]
*  Candles made from soy wax, beeswax, or stearin, coconut oil, or animal fats, [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3447.32s)]
*  are often considered healthier. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3453.16s)]
*  But anything that is burned emits harmful particulates or chemicals, Evan said. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3455.0s)]
*  So these candles also release VOCs into the air. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3460.12s)]
*  It's just that paraffin wax is usually more polluting according to... [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3463.16s)]
*  Oh, great. So they all suck. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3466.68s)]
*  The risk of toxic emissions is greater when candles are scented or died, [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3468.44s)]
*  which is another reason why paraffin-free candles aren't immediately in the clear. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3472.68s)]

*  Yeah, by what ratio? [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3499.8s)]
*  I wonder how much lower. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3501.8s)]

*  First of all, you can't totally say anything's safe [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3515.08s)]

*  That's exaggerating. She burnt a wall in her house. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3524.92s)]
*  What was she doing? [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3527.88s)]
*  She just let her candles burn down and something caught fire [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3528.92s)]
*  and it lit the side of her fucking bedroom hall. Her wall was on fire. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3532.92s)]
*  She liked candles. So they're not totally safe. It's fire. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3538.8399999999997s)]
*  Fire's not totally safe. Fucking lighters aren't totally safe. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3542.8399999999997s)]

*  Otherwise, we'll have to cut this out without getting sued by the paper straw industry. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3572.52s)]
*  Oh, speaking of straws, right? Everybody knows that paper straws came around because everybody [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3577.7999999999997s)]
*  saw that video of that turtle with that straw on his nose. That's the only reason why we started [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3583.7999999999997s)]
*  looking at paper straws different than everything else, right? [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3588.2799999999997s)]
*  Paper or plastic? [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3591.96s)]
*  Plastic. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3593.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3594.12s)]
*  Plastic straws came about. Did I say paper? [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3594.84s)]
*  Plastic straws came about because of that video of that turtle with the plastic straw on his nose. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3597.96s)]
*  Remember that? [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3603.88s)]
*  Yeah. It was like in the nose, right? [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3604.76s)]
*  Yeah. Deep in the turtle's nose. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3606.76s)]
*  New studies found that 90% of paper straws tested contained forever chemicals, [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3608.84s)]
*  or PFAS, compared to 75% of plastic straws. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3614.12s)]
*  Even plastic straws have those fucking chemicals in them, but it's even worse for you to use paper [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3619.56s)]
*  straws. Paper straws assessed by researchers at University of Antwerp, Belgium, were found to [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3624.76s)]
*  contain more forever chemicals per polyfluoroalchol. How do you say that? Give it a shot. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3629.96s)]
*  Philippe? [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3639.0s)]
*  Polyfluoroalchol. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3639.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Substances or PFASs than plastic, but all of them are bad for you. What it's basically saying [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3641.48s)]
*  is that even straws, 75% of plastic straws have tested that they contain forever chemicals. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3647.3199999999997s)]
*  That's not good. So all of it's bad. We should probably abandon the idea of straws. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3655.8799999999997s)]
*  I like McDonald's straws, the big fat ones. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3660.6s)]

*  Oh fuck that. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3666.6s)]

*  With a straw? [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3674.3599999999997s)]
*  No, I haven't, but I would imagine, just because you fall with a straw doesn't mean you're an idiot. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3675.24s)]
*  People got to be aware that that's basically a metal shank that's going to go right through [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3683.4799999999996s)]

*  I know, man. You wouldn't let your baby hold that. Why are you holding it? [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3702.04s)]

*  No, I was good at playing street ball with a tennis ball and I had a good junk on a tennis ball. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3749.32s)]

*  This is funny when they take a game like this and they break it down. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3928.84s)]
*  Like these are the rules. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3931.24s)]

*  You call it a wall ball? [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3934.28s)]

*  They're open until the player touches the wall. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3942.28s)]
*  They're open to be pegged, struck hard with a thrown ball by the player who caught it. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3944.7599999999998s)]
*  If a player becomes comes into contact with the ball, but fails to catch it, [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3949.0s)]
*  they are also open to be pegged. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3953.32s)]

*  There's always this asshole kid that didn't like that kid that was going to get hit [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=3966.12s)]

*  Yeah, it's called Easy Takeout and I think they used to be the same uniforms, same stand, [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4223.88s)]
*  same burgers, but they just added a breakfast burger. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4231.72s)]
*  It's called Easy Takeout in West Covina. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4235.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4237.56s)]
*  So they copied the logo. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4238.2s)]
*  It's very similar here. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4240.04s)]
*  Oh, Lucky's. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4241.24s)]
*  Lucky's, but this is what the lawsuit's about. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4242.2s)]
*  Same city, Templeupas, Mexico. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4244.2s)]
*  Oh yeah, they even got a little gap in between it. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4246.68s)]
*  Bucky's knockout, Lucky's spotted. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4249.64s)]
*  He's lucky to have two teeth. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4252.52s)]
*  But that's the one in Mexico, right, Jamie? [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4254.2s)]
*  They both? [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4255.8s)]
*  I told you, they both are. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4256.2s)]
*  They're both. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4257.0s)]
*  But I don't think this other one is in Mexico. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4257.4s)]
*  I might be wrong. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4261.16s)]
*  A month ago, two months ago Bucky's taken legal action against Mexican cops. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4262.12s)]
*  Shut up. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4265.320000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4266.200000000001s)]
*  It's the one thing I came up with, I was looking a little further. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4266.92s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4268.04s)]
*  Well, what was that animal? [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4268.52s)]
*  The Bucky's is a beaver. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4271.88s)]
*  It's a chuca cabra. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4272.84s)]
*  Right? [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4273.4800000000005s)]
*  So what was that other animal? [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4273.88s)]
*  What was the Lucky? [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4275.16s)]
*  Who's Lucky? [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4276.52s)]
*  Is Lucky a rabbit? [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4277.4800000000005s)]
*  Like, what is Lucky? [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4278.52s)]
*  Lucky is also a beaver. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4279.72s)]
*  Okay. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4281.56s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4281.72s)]
*  No. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4282.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we have a black beard. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4282.280000000001s)]
*  He has a papadour though, right? [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4283.96s)]
*  Let me see, where's Lucky's? [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4285.0s)]
*  What a bunch of dumbasses. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4289.0s)]
*  Oh my God, it is a beaver. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4290.52s)]
*  What is it? [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4292.120000000001s)]
*  He's wearing a sword. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4292.6s)]
*  Oh, he's a raccoon. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4293.64s)]
*  Oh, it's a raccoon. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4295.080000000001s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4296.76s)]
*  No, you can't do that. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4298.68s)]
*  He has a mask, man. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4299.4800000000005s)]
*  He's a bandito. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4300.68s)]
*  Why can't you do that though? [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4302.280000000001s)]
*  Why can't you have Harry's or how about George's and have Curious George? [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4304.120000000001s)]
*  They're good, you know? [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4308.84s)]
*  Get together, a little franchise. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4309.56s)]
*  Curious George. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4312.92s)]
*  Everybody loves Curious George. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4313.56s)]
*  Would that be okay? [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4316.040000000001s)]
*  Like if they have George's, would they get sued? [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4316.76s)]
*  Or Enrique's. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4318.68s)]
*  They have a different lawsuit, let's see. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4319.24s)]
*  There is a different lawsuit. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4321.0s)]
*  Superfuel's trademark infringement. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4323.08s)]
*  Because you imagine if like the owners, whoever owns the... [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4326.28s)]
*  Yeah, this is even, this is a little different. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4329.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4330.599999999999s)]
*  Because it's like a... [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4331.4s)]
*  I think that's Superfuel's. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4332.44s)]
*  That's the one I saw, Superfuel's. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4333.4s)]
*  So it's just, they're saying it's because it's got a smiling animal. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4336.2s)]
*  And the red hat. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4340.679999999999s)]
*  See, I don't know. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4341.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm not on board with that one. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4342.36s)]
*  I'm not on board with that one. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4344.92s)]
*  I can't think that you could own the idea of having any kind of cute animal [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4346.28s)]
*  as a part of your logo. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4353.08s)]
*  That seems kind of ridiculous. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4354.28s)]
*  I don't understand copyright law, [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4355.88s)]
*  but doesn't that seem like a little ridiculous to you? [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4357.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4359.719999999999s)]
*  What if it's a cat and you make it kitties, [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4361.32s)]
*  and you have a cute little cat? [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4365.24s)]
*  Are you telling me that I can't make a business called kitties? [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4366.36s)]
*  That depends where you're doing business at [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4369.96s)]
*  and how much of a copyright you have kind of. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4371.8s)]
*  Is it nationwide? [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4375.16s)]
*  Did you have an international copyright, which is really tough? [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4376.12s)]
*  Right, but is that a copyright infringement if you have kitties? [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4378.12s)]
*  It depends on what... [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4381.16s)]
*  If you're not doing the same business... [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4381.96s)]
*  Imagine someone has a copyright to the ability... [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4383.88s)]
*  I don't understand any of this stuff. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4387.72s)]
*  So clearly I'm talking out of my ass. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4389.4s)]
*  But imagine if somebody has a copyright [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4391.72s)]
*  to just owning the ability to use a cartoon character in your logo. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4393.5599999999995s)]
*  That seems completely insane, doesn't it? [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4399.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4402.12s)]
*  What's his name? [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4403.72s)]
*  This is Comedy Club, and Tommy Teese, [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4404.92s)]
*  he used to have the Lauren Hardy, [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4407.88s)]
*  what you call it, the Lauren Hardy logos. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4411.0s)]
*  Laurel and Hardy? [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4413.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4414.12s)]
*  It was like, yeah, and for his Comedy Club. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4414.360000000001s)]
*  He got sued by Bozo the Clown. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4418.2s)]
*  He owned the... [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4421.64s)]
*  Bozo owned Laurel and Hardy? [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4423.0s)]
*  Yeah, the cartoon, anything that you put cartoon on it was Laurel and Hardy's face. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4424.84s)]
*  Imagine going back watching Laurel Hardy. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4431.240000000001s)]
*  Imagine showing somebody that had no idea about American culture at all. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4434.6s)]
*  Yes. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4437.96s)]
*  Going back and you show them Laurel Hardy, [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4438.68s)]
*  and then right after you show them Chappelle's show [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4441.160000000001s)]
*  when Dave plays the blind white supremacist that's black. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4444.68s)]
*  Yeah, that was that guy. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4449.320000000001s)]
*  But imagine seeing like what... [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4451.080000000001s)]
*  This is what comedy started out as, [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4455.160000000001s)]
*  and this is comedy later. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4457.8s)]
*  That is a wild ride. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4459.16s)]
*  Yes, man. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4461.72s)]
*  That's a wild ride. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4463.16s)]
*  The ride from like Abed and Costello. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4464.68s)]
*  Yes. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4467.0s)]
*  Who's on first? [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4467.48s)]
*  Who's on for Eddie Cantor, bro. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4468.6s)]
*  Who's Eddie Cantor? [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4471.5599999999995s)]
*  Eddie Cantor was the first comedian to do radio. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4472.2s)]
*  And he was... [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4475.0s)]
*  Because I have a history for Fools podcast, [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4476.68s)]
*  so I learned about the history of stand-up comedy. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4479.08s)]
*  Plus I read that, I watched the documentary, [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4483.4s)]
*  but he was one of the first guys, [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4485.32s)]
*  he was one of the first guys, [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4487.0s)]
*  but he was very clean, bro. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4488.12s)]
*  He sang and... [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4490.04s)]
*  Can we hear some of this? [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4492.68s)]
*  He was getting paid $500 for five-minute shows on radio. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4500.36s)]
*  The Eddie Cantor, he was the first guy to have a radio comedy show. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4509.08s)]
*  I'm trying to hear what he's saying. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4515.4s)]
*  What is he saying? [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4517.0s)]
*  He's thinking some vaudeville nonsense. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4518.52s)]
*  The dumb ones know how to make love. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4520.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4535.8s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4536.52s)]
*  The dumb ones know how to make love. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4539.48s)]
*  That sounds like something Theo would say on stage. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4542.2s)]
*  And I like them dumb. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4544.36s)]
*  He'll be on the radio, bro, talking, [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4547.8s)]
*  and then he'll pinch the chicks in their butts. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4549.48s)]
*  Oh, God. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4552.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4553.56s)]
*  And then they wouldn't say nothing, [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4553.8s)]
*  and then finally a woman says something, [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4555.72s)]
*  Mr. Cantor. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4557.48s)]
*  And he had her fired. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4559.56s)]
*  Well, you gotta remember, [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4563.0s)]
*  people back then were basically barbarians. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4565.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4567.16s)]
*  1920s people? [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4567.88s)]
*  Bro, back then it was... [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4569.0s)]
*  It's World War I, bro. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4570.04s)]
*  Back then, for a stand-up comedian, [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4571.16s)]
*  when I found out was... [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4573.16s)]
*  Imagine you do a gig, $200. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4574.12s)]
*  And the promoter says, [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4577.72s)]
*  the gangsters, I'm not gonna pay you. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4580.12s)]
*  And you don't get paid, [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4582.04s)]
*  and they go call the cops. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4583.400000000001s)]
*  You had the couple of three vagrants [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4584.4400000000005s)]
*  walking around downtown, [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4586.280000000001s)]
*  and then you're three comedians [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4587.88s)]
*  walking around town with no hotel, [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4589.0s)]
*  no pay, [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4591.16s)]
*  and they're gonna pick you up for being a hobo now. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4591.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4594.76s)]
*  You could get stiffed, for sure. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4595.320000000001s)]
*  But that was back then, bro. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4597.64s)]
*  That was a hard time. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4598.76s)]
*  Imagine from then to now. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4599.72s)]
*  Well, I think there's probably still a lot of shit [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4602.2s)]
*  like that out there for a lot of guys that are coming up. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4604.92s)]
*  But it's just now there's more real gigs. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4608.12s)]
*  Yeah, better gigs. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4610.6s)]
*  Well, comedy's more accessible, [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4612.4400000000005s)]
*  because of YouTube and everything. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4616.12s)]
*  Comedy's just way... [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4618.28s)]
*  It's everywhere. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4619.32s)]
*  Everywhere. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4620.04s)]
*  Like your special. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4620.4400000000005s)]

*  What a segue. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4623.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I have a special right now on Netflix, [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4624.4400000000005s)]
*  Raging Fool. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4626.36s)]
*  We shot at the Chris Theater in Sacramento, [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4628.12s)]
*  two shows. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4630.28s)]
*  My wife directed it and executive produced. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4630.76s)]
*  She executive produced all my specials. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4633.32s)]
*  But we shot it with our own money, [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4635.5599999999995s)]
*  and we paid everybody, [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4638.599999999999s)]
*  and then we sold it to Netflix. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4640.679999999999s)]
*  We made like a two-year deal. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4643.08s)]
*  Oh, that's awesome. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4644.759999999999s)]
*  Great. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4646.599999999999s)]
*  I love the tracksuit. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4647.0s)]
*  Yes, because of Raging Fool. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4648.599999999999s)]
*  Because of Raging Fool. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4650.36s)]
*  I love the tracksuit. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4652.84s)]
*  It's dope. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4654.04s)]
*  Because I was watching that movie, Raging Fool, [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4654.84s)]
*  and I was thinking that when Jake LaMotta [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4657.4s)]
*  had nothing left to do in his life, [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4659.5599999999995s)]
*  how to make money, [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4662.84s)]
*  he said, you know what? [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4664.6s)]
*  I'm going to be a comedian. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4665.88s)]
*  And I thought, wow. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4668.36s)]
*  He had nothing else to do with his life, [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4669.96s)]
*  so he figured, I'm going to do stand-up comedy. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4671.16s)]
*  Because that was the last thing for us. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4674.92s)]
*  It was like the first thing. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4676.76s)]
*  Well, that happens with actors sometimes, too, [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4677.96s)]
*  when their careers kind of dwindle. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4679.88s)]
*  They start doing stand-up. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4681.4800000000005s)]
*  That happens. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4682.6s)]
*  And he had like, when he was doing, [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4683.400000000001s)]
*  you saw the movie, right? [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4684.92s)]
*  Raging Fool, when he was doing stand-up. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4685.72s)]
*  And he's at a bar called Jimmy's Corner Bar, [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4687.96s)]
*  and that bar is still there. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4693.88s)]
*  You know, Stan Hope was friends with him. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4695.4s)]
*  Really? [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4697.16s)]
*  Yeah, because that guy lived down in Arizona, [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4697.5599999999995s)]
*  where Stan Hope lived. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4700.12s)]
*  Oh, that's cool, man. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4701.08s)]
*  Yeah, he's got photos of him hanging out [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4702.04s)]
*  over his house and shit. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4703.8s)]
*  That's badass. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4704.92s)]
*  Yeah, Jake LaMotta was Stan Hope's boy. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4705.639999999999s)]
*  That's a real story, man. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4708.28s)]
*  Jake LaMotta was a character. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4709.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4711.16s)]
*  That was a wild fella. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4711.8s)]
*  A wild, crazy fella. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4713.8s)]
*  And goddamn Robert De Niro nailed it. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4715.88s)]
*  Nailed it, huh? [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4719.88s)]
*  Nailed it. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4720.68s)]
*  I mean, nailed it. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4721.72s)]
*  He looked like an animal when he was Jake LaMotta, [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4724.04s)]
*  like the younger Jake LaMotta. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4727.96s)]
*  Did you fuck my wife? [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4729.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4731.16s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ, he was so scary. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4731.400000000001s)]
*  He was so scary because he was just out of his fucking mind [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4733.56s)]
*  and so dangerous. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4735.88s)]
*  And it was based on a real guy, man. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4737.64s)]
*  The movie is real close to how that guy was, [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4740.36s)]
*  Jake LaMotta, when he was in his prime. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4743.56s)]
*  He was a fucking monster, man. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4745.24s)]
*  I like when he looks at his hands [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4747.639999999999s)]
*  and he goes like he don't like his hands [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4750.04s)]
*  because they're not big, I guess. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4751.8s)]
*  He goes, I can never be a heavyweight. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4753.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4758.44s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4759.72s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4760.44s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4761.0s)]
*  That's a different kind of human, man. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4761.88s)]
*  And back then, there was a lot of people like that. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4764.2s)]
*  This is, you got to go back and put your mind [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4766.84s)]
*  into what it must have been like to be Jake LaMotta growing up [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4770.04s)]
*  and like what? [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4773.16s)]
*  So what year was Jake in his prime? [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4774.28s)]
*  What year did he fight Sugar Ray Robinson? [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4779.32s)]
*  Let's ask that. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4781.32s)]
*  Jake LaMotta versus Sugar Ray Robinson. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4781.96s)]

*  Wow. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4795.48s)]
*  You got to just put your mind into the type of people [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4796.2s)]
*  that lived back then. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4799.32s)]
*  I mean, like cars were new. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4800.679999999999s)]
*  Sewage was new. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4803.4s)]

*  in all the Italian communities, the Irish communities. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4813.08s)]
*  That was the thing. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4816.44s)]
*  42, wow. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4817.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4818.36s)]
*  This was just the United States. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4819.0s)]
*  It's like, you ever watch that movie, Gangs of New York? [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4821.24s)]
*  Yes. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4824.679999999999s)]
*  Fucking great movie, right? [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4825.5599999999995s)]
*  That's a fucking great movie. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4827.96s)]
*  And probably pretty accurate. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4829.24s)]
*  Yes. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4832.04s)]
*  Roughly pretty accurate the way life was back then. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4832.76s)]
*  Some of those gangsters that were in that movie [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4836.360000000001s)]
*  were actually real people. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4837.96s)]
*  I believe it. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4839.72s)]
*  Like that woman in that movie. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4840.360000000001s)]
*  I think you talked about it. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4841.64s)]
*  The one that used to collect ears and put them in a jar. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4842.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4845.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4845.8s)]
*  She was an actual real person. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4846.52s)]
*  She had a bar where people would just have a jar [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4848.280000000001s)]
*  full of pickled ears and noses from previous fights. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4852.52s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4856.92s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4859.320000000001s)]
*  And they'll have fights in the back with a mongoose fighting a dog. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4860.12s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4863.72s)]
*  Gangs of New York, man. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4866.2s)]
*  That movie is so, because we don't think of New York that way. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4868.12s)]
*  You think of New York as like New York City. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4871.0s)]
*  Well, it was kind of dangerous in the 70s. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4873.0s)]
*  Then Giuliani cleaned it up. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4874.84s)]
*  And then it's pretty commercialized in a lot of ways. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4877.5599999999995s)]
*  It was still a beautiful city. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4880.68s)]
*  But New York during the time of that, [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4882.28s)]
*  whenever that film was supposed to represent, [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4885.16s)]
*  was a wild, crazy, almost like wild west type place. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4887.4s)]
*  We think of those kind of scenes when you think of a wild west movie, right? [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4892.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the good, bad, and the ugly. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4897.24s)]
*  Yeah, you think of people getting stabbed and shot. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4898.44s)]
*  But that was happening over there too. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4901.24s)]
*  It's not like it never happened on the East Coast [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4903.96s)]
*  and they only did it on the West Coast. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4905.879999999999s)]
*  Kind of on people. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4906.839999999999s)]
*  It was happening in the whole country. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4908.04s)]
*  And they had just gotten, I mean, [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4910.36s)]
*  these people had just gotten done with a fucking civil war. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4913.639999999999s)]
*  Right? [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4916.599999999999s)]
*  Because back then, you got to think, 1940, [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4917.5599999999995s)]
*  you go to like the 1860s to the 1940s, [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4920.92s)]
*  that's not that much time. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4924.68s)]
*  No. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4926.76s)]
*  That's pretty quick. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4927.24s)]
*  That's 80 years. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4928.36s)]
*  80 years. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4929.48s)]
*  A lot of those fuckers are still alive. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4929.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4932.12s)]
*  Same mentality, same craziness. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4932.44s)]
*  And then you got more immigrants coming in on boats. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4934.04s)]
*  No YouTube to watch, just women of prayer. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4936.76s)]
*  Someone told them to come. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4939.96s)]
*  I always think about that man like when the- [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4941.48s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4943.48s)]
*  I always, that her. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4944.04s)]
*  She supposedly was real. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4945.0s)]
*  She was Maggie. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4946.12s)]
*  Hellcat Maggie. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4946.92s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4948.12s)]
*  I think about when the Irish are coming in [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4949.16s)]
*  at the same time that movie is happening [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4953.24s)]
*  and they told them, you want a free meal? [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4956.44s)]
*  You want to fight for your country? [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4958.2s)]
*  And they give them a uniform and their families go off to New York [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4959.8s)]
*  and they go off to fight the South. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4963.72s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4965.8s)]
*  Just imagine coming out of the boat [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4966.28s)]
*  and someone just has you a gun and a piece of bread [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4967.5599999999995s)]
*  and go, go fight for America. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4970.04s)]
*  And I think about that like, [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4971.88s)]
*  why are some hardcore people right there, man? [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4972.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4976.200000000001s)]
*  Hardcore people. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4977.4800000000005s)]
*  Different times, man. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4979.08s)]
*  Desperate. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4980.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and then people look old, older than they do now. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4981.08s)]
*  Oh yeah, they look old quick. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4984.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, like you look at a person's photo [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4986.04s)]
*  and you go, how old is that kid? [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4987.96s)]
*  He looks like 70. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4989.160000000001s)]
*  Oh, I have a 25 year old kid working in a coal mine. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4990.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4993.240000000001s)]
*  Working in coal mines, those people all got sick. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4994.360000000001s)]
*  They all got fucked up. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4997.0s)]
*  I mean, that's environmental pollution that you're signing up for. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=4998.360000000001s)]
*  You're going to go breathe coal dust no matter what. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5001.0s)]
*  They all get horrible fucking... [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5003.64s)]

*  Black lung. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5007.16s)]
*  That's terrifying, terrifying. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5007.64s)]
*  And then you've got people that just live around coal plants [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5009.24s)]
*  and they're breathing that shit [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5014.52s)]
*  and they don't even a part of that business. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5015.56s)]
*  I know, man. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5017.64s)]
*  Like Wilkes Bar, Pennsylvania. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5018.52s)]
*  Bro, there's a place that we showed a video once. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5021.24s)]
*  Was it Indiana, Jamie? [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5024.6s)]
*  Yeah? [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5027.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5027.58s)]
*  So there's like three coal plants near this city [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5028.12s)]
*  and these people, they can wipe their windshield [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5031.24s)]
*  and they have black soot on their finger. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5033.88s)]
*  Shut up. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5036.04s)]
*  It just falls from the sky. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5036.44s)]
*  Here in America? [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5037.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's in America. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5037.8s)]
*  So these people are for sure breathing that shit in. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5038.76s)]
*  For Pittsburgh? [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5041.16s)]
*  Indiana. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5042.44s)]

*  That's scary. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5045.32s)]
*  That's scary. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5046.679999999999s)]
*  And that's a fraction of what's going on in China, bro. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5047.639999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, because when I was in Seattle [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5051.08s)]
*  and I was waiting for the car to pass, [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5054.44s)]
*  I was going to my show and I saw... [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5057.32s)]
*  It was like a mile train and it was all coal. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5060.28s)]
*  Coal. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5063.96s)]
*  Real black coal coming from Minnesota. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5064.679999999999s)]
*  And I asked the cop that was standing there, [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5067.0s)]
*  I go, I didn't know we still mine coal. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5069.96s)]
*  And he goes, well, we don't use it, [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5072.5199999999995s)]
*  but it's all going to China. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5075.879999999999s)]
*  Really? [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5078.2s)]

*  and it had no cover on it. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5083.08s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5085.08s)]
*  And it was just falling off. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5085.48s)]
*  They said that, I don't know how much coal flies. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5086.92s)]
*  I don't know shit about coal, [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5089.72s)]
*  but I just know what the guy told me. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5091.16s)]
*  That was a mile train of coal coming from Minnesota [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5093.0s)]
*  on that one line and there was a boat. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5095.88s)]
*  I could see the boat where it was going. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5098.68s)]
*  Wow. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5101.08s)]
*  And it's all going to China. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5103.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5104.28s)]
*  They're full steam ahead with coal. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5104.76s)]
*  Someone should check to see if maybe they know something we don't. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5109.88s)]
*  I know, man. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5112.52s)]
*  What are they producing with that coal? [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5113.4800000000005s)]
*  They're doing a lot. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5115.88s)]
*  They produce so many of the things that we need, [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5117.72s)]
*  which is one of the craziest things that we all found out [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5119.320000000001s)]
*  when everything got locked down is you couldn't get anything [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5122.04s)]
*  because so much of what you wanted was made in China. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5124.360000000001s)]
*  They're like, oh my God, or made in Russia, [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5127.0s)]
*  or made in anywhere where they had to come in on a ship. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5129.4800000000005s)]
*  That became a real fucking problem. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5133.400000000001s)]
*  I thought it was made in Akron, Ohio. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5135.4800000000005s)]
*  They hardly make shit here. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5137.96s)]
*  In comparison to what we consume, [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5139.96s)]
*  we consume way more probably, I would guess, than any country. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5141.72s)]
*  Of a similar size. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5146.28s)]
*  Yo, dawg. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5148.84s)]
*  Still rocking the Samsung. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5150.4400000000005s)]
*  I love it. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5151.8s)]
*  I love when a comic holds out and doesn't go iPhone. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5152.76s)]
*  Oh, no, man. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5155.72s)]
*  I like the bigger phone. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5156.4400000000005s)]
*  And the little pen. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5158.4400000000005s)]
*  You like the pen. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5159.4800000000005s)]
*  I love the pen. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5160.2s)]
*  You're one of those guys. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5160.68s)]
*  Which one is that? [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5161.72s)]
*  Is that the S24? [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5165.88s)]
*  Yeah, that one. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5167.320000000001s)]
*  That one. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5168.04s)]
*  S24 Ultra? [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5168.28s)]
*  Yes. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5169.4800000000005s)]
*  Is that the newest one or the one right before it? [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5170.04s)]
*  Right before it. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5171.96s)]
*  There's a new one that just came out. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5172.6s)]
*  It's pretty dope, dude. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5174.4400000000005s)]
*  A year and a half ago, I think. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5175.32s)]
*  Yeah, that's the old one. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5177.08s)]
*  That's the S24 Ultra. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5178.2s)]
*  I have that one. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5179.48s)]
*  That one's sick. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5180.5199999999995s)]
*  It does a lot of cool shit. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5181.639999999999s)]
*  Good videos, right? [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5182.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's great at a lot of stuff. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5183.719999999999s)]
*  But the interesting thing is the AI. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5185.16s)]
*  So what I like about it is I can go to a website [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5187.24s)]
*  and if I open it up in the Samsung browser, [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5190.84s)]
*  and then I can say summarize. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5193.32s)]
*  And it'll summarize the website for me. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5195.799999999999s)]
*  Oh, I didn't know that. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5197.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so if there's some thing that's taking forever [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5198.84s)]
*  for you to get to the point, [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5201.719999999999s)]
*  because you want me to keep scrolling and scrolling [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5202.599999999999s)]
*  and scrolling and scrolling while you show ads [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5205.08s)]
*  all over the place, that's a trap. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5207.320000000001s)]
*  So it'll just tell you, oh, there's an asteroid [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5209.08s)]
*  that might hit Earth within the next fucking 60 years. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5212.6s)]
*  Like, oh, great, there's a 3%. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5215.96s)]
*  What is the percent chance? [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5217.320000000001s)]
*  Down to 1.5% today. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5218.4400000000005s)]
*  Thank God. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5220.04s)]
*  Only 1.5%. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5221.240000000001s)]
*  I think I'd take a picture of you, right? [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5222.6s)]
*  And then do that one screen. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5226.280000000001s)]
*  And then I circle it and it'll find a sweater for me. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5228.120000000001s)]
*  That's cool. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5231.08s)]
*  That's really cool. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5231.8s)]
*  I think that's available on all phones now. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5233.08s)]
*  I think the new iPhone update has that as well, [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5235.08s)]
*  where you can Google search a thing [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5237.88s)]
*  and it'll show you where to buy it. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5239.64s)]
*  My wife always wanted it. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5242.2s)]
*  She wanted to have it where you're watching television [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5243.32s)]
*  and you pause it with your finger and make a circle [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5247.08s)]
*  and then it just ships to your house. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5249.16s)]
*  You know when people are going to be fed up with that thing? [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5252.6s)]
*  When, first of all, you can only buy so much shit. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5254.68s)]
*  But second of all, what happens? [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5262.04s)]
*  You know those glasses that they wear now? [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5265.32s)]
*  Those meta glasses? [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5267.72s)]
*  Have you seen this Harvard kid? [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5268.92s)]
*  Oh, the one that we could record now? [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5269.96s)]
*  I've seen those. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5271.8s)]
*  Some Harvard kid figured out how to use [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5272.6s)]
*  facial recognition software with that. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5274.84s)]
*  So he sees you, gets a photo of you, [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5276.92s)]
*  immediately gets a Wikipedia on you [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5279.56s)]
*  or whatever the fuck is available online, [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5281.8s)]
*  sees your Instagram page, finds your address. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5283.8s)]
*  And it was wild. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5287.24s)]
*  You're like, wait, hit the brakes. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5288.28s)]
*  It's like the T-1000 Terminator. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5291.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's like hit the brakes. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5294.2s)]
*  Hit the brakes. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5296.12s)]
*  But I don't think they can. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5298.360000000001s)]
*  Was there a movie like that? [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5301.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's been a bunch of movies. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5302.52s)]
*  What about Roddy Piper was like that? [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5303.56s)]
*  Oh, they live. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5305.24s)]
*  They live! [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5306.280000000001s)]
*  They have the glasses. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5306.76s)]
*  Yes! [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5307.72s)]
*  Right. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5308.04s)]
*  Right, but that was Aliens. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5308.52s)]
*  I think about that. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5309.88s)]
*  Sometimes when you have a guest, they go, [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5311.8s)]
*  wait a minute, he's talking about those glasses [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5312.92s)]
*  from Roddy Piper? [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5314.4400000000005s)]
*  Similar. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5316.2s)]
*  I think the Roddy Piper glasses, you put them on, [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5316.76s)]
*  you could see what everybody really looked like. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5319.48s)]
*  You could see through the whatever energy field [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5321.48s)]
*  they were projecting. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5323.879999999999s)]
*  It was these alien creatures that were pretending to be people. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5324.599999999999s)]
*  And there's a lot of people that believe that now. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5327.799999999999s)]
*  I'm less inclined to believe that, but I'm open. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5330.36s)]
*  I wouldn't want to get tricked. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5335.32s)]
*  I mean, if there really are people that are actually aliens [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5336.759999999999s)]
*  that are amongst us that look like people [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5339.799999999999s)]
*  and behave like people. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5341.959999999999s)]
*  I actually, this is the guy who figured it out. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5344.2s)]
*  Try to say his name. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5347.32s)]
*  Felipe, hit me with it. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5348.44s)]
*  I create. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5351.639999999999s)]
*  What's the first one? [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5353.0s)]
*  Right there. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5355.16s)]
*  Try that. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5355.799999999999s)]
*  Oh, it's An-Fu Nguyen. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5356.2s)]
*  I think- [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5361.719999999999s)]
*  And K.N. Ardofalo. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5362.44s)]
*  I don't think they say Nguyen. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5363.639999999999s)]
*  I think they say Gwyn, right? [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5365.0s)]
*  Because there's been a few fighters in the UFC, [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5368.2s)]
*  Vietnamese fighters that have that same spelling. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5370.5199999999995s)]
*  And I think they say it as, can you find out how they say it, Jamie? [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5374.12s)]
*  So it's An-Fu Nguyen. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5377.32s)]
*  Okay, I can see it. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5378.5199999999995s)]
*  Little Dutch there. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5380.76s)]
*  And K.N. Ardofalo. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5382.76s)]
*  So they figured out how to do this. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5389.48s)]
*  Making up names now. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5391.08s)]
*  No, this is a real name, man. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5392.28s)]
*  Let's just explain. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5395.32s)]
*  Anybody can do it. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5396.2s)]
*  My name is Doshiak East. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5397.32s)]
*  Can you scroll so we can explain? [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5399.0s)]
*  How it's possible to do it today, how to remove your information. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5401.32s)]
*  Oh, geez. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5405.0s)]
*  Literally like the instructions. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5405.72s)]
*  So it's just showing how to remove your face from search engines, [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5407.4800000000005s)]
*  which you're not going to be able to do eventually. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5412.2s)]
*  It's getting weird out there, Felipe. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5416.52s)]
*  I'm a walker. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5418.04s)]
*  We're flip phones, bro. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5418.68s)]
*  It's a black face, green face, bro. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5419.8s)]
*  I had a friend of mine who came in here the other day, [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5422.04s)]
*  and he's down to a flip phone. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5423.64s)]
*  And his flip phone was interesting because it has Android on it. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5425.88s)]
*  His flip phone, you can actually get text messages on it, [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5429.16s)]
*  and you have a little tiny-ass screen on the flip phone [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5431.56s)]
*  where you can kind of clumsily type your way through a sentence. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5434.12s)]
*  So you don't have to do it with a full keyboard, like an iPhone or earphone. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5438.12s)]
*  But you also, it's inconvenient, so you don't text as much. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5442.92s)]
*  You don't go on these long-winded diatribes like a lot of people do. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5446.36s)]
*  It's just real simple. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5449.64s)]
*  The whole screen is on there, [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5450.92s)]
*  but you got to navigate all the way around to read everything? [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5452.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5455.0s)]
*  I remember those. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5455.48s)]
*  It's a tiny little-ass screen. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5456.44s)]
*  It's got regular buttons to make phone calls. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5458.5199999999995s)]
*  And then on his little tiny-ass screen, [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5460.92s)]
*  it's a tiny-ass keyboard about that big. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5462.52s)]
*  And you get in there with that tiny-ass keyboard, [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5464.76s)]
*  and you try to type a text message, and then you can press send. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5466.68s)]
*  And so it's inconvenient. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5469.72s)]
*  So you don't go on Twitter. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5471.64s)]
*  You don't check things out. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5473.4800000000005s)]
*  You just get your text messages. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5475.0s)]
*  It can do other stuff if you absolutely fucking need it to. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5477.160000000001s)]
*  But live your life, bitch. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5479.96s)]
*  And he was in here with that. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5482.040000000001s)]
*  I was like, man, that seems cool. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5483.0s)]
*  But I like watching YouTube on my phone, so I don't know what to tell you. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5484.84s)]
*  That sounds like Larry Bubbles Brown from San Francisco. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5488.040000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5491.080000000001s)]
*  He still has a flip phone. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5491.4s)]
*  David Tell? [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5493.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5494.12s)]
*  David Tell has a flip phone. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5494.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5495.639999999999s)]
*  You should see him text me. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5495.96s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5496.92s)]
*  Do they both have the original phone numbers from when you first met them? [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5497.639999999999s)]
*  No. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5500.759999999999s)]
*  No. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5501.4s)]
*  They've all changed numbers. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5501.639999999999s)]
*  You have to change every now and then. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5503.639999999999s)]
*  It's, you know, you got to purge. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5505.32s)]
*  Got to keep moving. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5508.12s)]
*  I think I still have my same phone number for the last 20 years. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5509.16s)]
*  Damn. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5515.0s)]
*  One of those dudes, a holdout. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5515.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5517.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5518.84s)]
*  Sometimes that's good, but it gets annoying sometimes. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5519.32s)]
*  You know, it's all in, you got to manage your time. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5523.4s)]
*  You change your phone number a lot? [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5526.2s)]
*  Nice people. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5528.679999999999s)]
*  People I trust. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5530.28s)]
*  You got to manage your time. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5531.24s)]
*  The thing about a guy like you is like you're headlining, you're on the road, [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5535.4s)]
*  dudes want to open up for you, you got the Netflix special, they want to hang out with you. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5538.92s)]
*  It's like you got to manage your time because you can't give your time away to everybody. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5543.16s)]
*  There's a certain amount of time you need for yourself. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5546.28s)]
*  If you don't have that time you need for yourself, you go off the rails. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5548.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5550.2s)]
*  You got to take time to recenter all the time. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5551.08s)]
*  All the time. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5555.16s)]
*  And if you're constantly getting this and that, you're constantly interacting, [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5555.88s)]
*  you're never alone, you're never fighting with people. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5559.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5562.44s)]
*  I like, I get in a sauna and I stretch out every day. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5563.4s)]
*  I get down there, I fucking stretch everything out. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5567.72s)]
*  When you're doing that, you can't do anything else. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5570.44s)]
*  You can't be scrolling on TikTok when you're stretching everything out. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5572.36s)]
*  You got to just go through your routine. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5576.52s)]
*  And then that clears my mind. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5578.76s)]
*  And I feel like if you don't make room for that, you're going to fuck your life up. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5580.6s)]
*  And I know that there's only so many people that I can entertain and help with stuff. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5585.64s)]
*  There's so many people that are just, it's a transactional kind of a conversation you have. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5592.92s)]
*  It's not fun. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5596.92s)]
*  It's not like, what's up dude? [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5597.88s)]
*  Hey, what's up? [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5598.92s)]
*  Those are great. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5599.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5600.68s)]
*  But then there's a lot of could you do this? [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5600.92s)]
*  Would you do that? [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5602.84s)]
*  Will you fly to here? [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5603.64s)]
*  And do like, hey, enough. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5604.6s)]
*  You know? [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5611.240000000001s)]
*  So you got to like know when to change. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5611.96s)]
*  What time you get up? [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5614.04s)]
*  It depends. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5615.56s)]
*  Most days eight. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5616.200000000001s)]
*  I was up at eight. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5617.160000000001s)]
*  Eight is good. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5617.88s)]
*  I tell you, I tell you like, my bro, I get up at five every day. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5618.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think that's necessary. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5623.64s)]
*  The thing that people always want to do where they want to show themselves [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5625.56s)]
*  that they have the discipline to get up. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5631.160000000001s)]
*  I respect that. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5632.76s)]

*  He likes doing that. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5693.48s)]
*  He likes doing that. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5695.32s)]
*  But he's not a comedian. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5698.679999999999s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5700.12s)]
*  I think like for a comedian, you can't be that rigid. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5700.679999999999s)]
*  You'll get a little psychotic. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5703.32s)]
*  You can't be that rich. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5705.48s)]
*  You got to have discipline, but you also got to have fun. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5706.44s)]
*  You got to. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5708.759999999999s)]
*  So I don't get up at 4 30 the fuck out of here. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5709.48s)]
*  First of all, I'm up until at least midnight, almost every night. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5712.839999999999s)]
*  Me too. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5716.759999999999s)]
*  I get like most of my best like writing done and my best ideas when everyone in the house is asleep. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5717.4s)]
*  So when everyone in my house is asleep and I'm up, I like that because I'm like, oh, cool. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5723.08s)]
*  Everybody I don't need. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5727.5599999999995s)]
*  Nobody needs my attention. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5728.679999999999s)]
*  Now I can concentrate and I get my I can't concentrate when people are in the house. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5730.12s)]
*  I feel like I should be hanging out and having fun and being with everybody. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5734.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't want to lock myself up in my office, but that's the only way to write. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5738.04s)]
*  But for me, it's like late at night is where it's at because everybody's asleep [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5742.44s)]
*  and the world feels creepy. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5747.0s)]
*  You know, at night, the world feels kind of dangerous and fucked up and stupid. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5749.08s)]
*  It's like, you know, you when you worry about war in the middle of the night, [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5753.32s)]
*  it's like one o'clock in the morning in front of your computer. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5757.24s)]
*  You're writing something on Microsoft Word. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5759.72s)]
*  You're genuinely worried about war. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5761.72s)]
*  Yeah, genuinely worried that decisions that people are making in this country are going to one day [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5764.04s)]
*  come down on us with holy terror. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5768.84s)]
*  One day just in the middle of the city, just [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5772.84s)]
*  boom, some fucking thermonuclear device that levels a place four times the size of Hiroshima [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5775.72s)]
*  instantaneously. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5784.84s)]
*  I think about that kind of shit late at night. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5786.44s)]
*  And you know, right. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5788.36s)]
*  How do you make that funny? [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5790.04s)]
*  I don't sometimes. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5791.4s)]
*  Some of it's not funny, but you there's funny things attached to it. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5795.72s)]
*  There's funny things attached to just the way we behave. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5799.4s)]
*  There's nothing funny about the potential for complete annihilation of the human race. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5803.64s)]
*  But there is something funny about this desire that we have to keep doing the same things [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5807.96s)]
*  we've always done and hope that somehow or another we get it right this time. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5815.72s)]
*  We're on the verge of war all the time. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5821.48s)]
*  And there's got to be some way to stop that other than funding more war. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5823.4s)]
*  It's got to be a better way to stop that. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5827.96s)]
*  That's funny you said the verge of war. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5829.0s)]
*  When you first started doing standup comedy, how many there's been a lot of [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5835.4s)]
*  bridges of real wars, huh? [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5839.16s)]
*  Yeah, the first war when I was. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5841.08s)]
*  So when was Desert Storm? [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5844.84s)]
*  Was that 19? [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5847.0s)]
*  Desert Shield. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5848.04s)]
*  Which one was which? [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5849.56s)]
*  We had this conversation the other day. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5851.48s)]
*  Desert Shield was with Norman Sworshkov. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5852.76s)]
*  That's Iraq and that's like 2003? [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5856.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5858.6s)]
*  Right. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5859.8s)]
*  The one I'm talking about is Desert Storm which was like 1990? [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5860.84s)]
*  Was it 1990, Jamie? [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5865.96s)]
*  That says they're the same. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5867.160000000001s)]
*  They're the same? [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5872.52s)]
*  So phases. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5873.08s)]
*  Yeah, but the first invasion before we pulled out with George W. Bush in Iraq? [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5874.68s)]
*  Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 20, 1990. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5880.360000000001s)]
*  Yes, I remember that one, yes. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5883.160000000001s)]
*  So when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, then we went to war with Iraq and I was living [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5885.0s)]
*  with my friend Jimmy and we were sitting, Jimmy D'Itilio, shout out to Jimmy, [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5891.4s)]
*  we were sitting in our apartment in the living room and the war was on TV and they're like, [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5896.04s)]
*  holy shit man, we're at war. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5901.799999999999s)]
*  I remember thinking this can't even be real. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5904.12s)]
*  Which is happening at night, right? [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5905.719999999999s)]
*  We started watching those the air raids. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5907.0s)]
*  Yeah, it started as Desert Shield and then when we started going after like Ham was Desert Storm. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5909.48s)]
*  And what year was that? [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5915.08s)]
*  That's just like a year later, it's 91. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5916.5199999999995s)]
*  So Desert Shield was to protect and Desert Storm was to destroy. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5919.24s)]
*  It was dropping off troops. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5922.36s)]
*  Bill Hicks had the best material about that. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5923.719999999999s)]
*  His material about the war was great. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5926.12s)]
*  They have such sophisticated weapons, how do you know? [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5927.96s)]
*  We got the receipts. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5929.799999999999s)]
*  We love to arm puppet dictators and then fuck them up. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5933.96s)]
*  It's like Clint Eastwood movie, pick up the gun. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5939.96s)]
*  It's like Dirty Harry. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5942.679999999999s)]
*  I tell you, I know what you're thinking. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5943.72s)]
*  Tell you the truth, I kind of forgot myself. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5947.56s)]
*  My favorite one is the unforgiving man when a guy's crying, could he kill somebody? [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5950.6s)]
*  He goes, that's what happens when you kill a man. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5957.4800000000005s)]
*  You take away all he ever wanted and all he ever had. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5961.4800000000005s)]
*  That movie was the best western movie I think ever. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5967.400000000001s)]
*  That kind of Clint Eastwood genre. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5972.28s)]
*  That was almost like he was coming back to update it. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5973.96s)]
*  Because he had all the bangers, good, the bad, and the ugly, a fistful of dollars. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5977.88s)]
*  Outlaw Josie Wells. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5983.72s)]
*  That was another level too, but then it's like unforgiven was the one where it really gave you [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5987.08s)]
*  a sense of what it must have been like living in the Wild West. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5994.04s)]
*  The people were more real. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=5998.2s)]
*  It was more updated to the movies of that era, the Morgan Freeman character. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6000.4400000000005s)]
*  It was a fucking great movie, man. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6005.080000000001s)]
*  That's a great western movie and just a hard story. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6007.8s)]
*  I like that line when he goes in there to get those people that killed Morgan Freeman. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6011.080000000001s)]
*  You just shot an unknown man. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6015.8s)]
*  He should have armed himself if he's going to decorate his place with a friend of mine. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6018.52s)]
*  That was a hardcore movie, man. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6024.4400000000005s)]
*  That was a hardcore movie. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6026.68s)]
*  You saw the... [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6028.68s)]
*  Isn't it funny that we always want to think about that kind of shit happening out west? [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6030.6s)]
*  We don't want to believe that that kind of same shit was happening out east. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6034.2s)]
*  Animals everywhere, animals. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6038.04s)]
*  Animals. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6040.76s)]
*  People were animals back then. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6041.88s)]
*  They were barely human. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6043.4s)]
*  Hang them high. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6044.36s)]
*  Can you imagine if we had to do fucking stand up in 1820? [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6046.36s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6052.76s)]
*  First of all, you're getting sick everywhere because there's no sewage. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6053.4s)]
*  Everybody's just got shit in the streets. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6056.76s)]
*  Everywhere you go, you're breathing shit fumes. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6058.68s)]
*  You're stepping in shit everywhere. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6060.52s)]
*  That's what I think about now. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6062.84s)]
*  When I watch those movies now, like Gangs of New York, I look towards somebody, man. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6064.04s)]
*  Fuck it stinks out there. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6069.160000000001s)]
*  People are ignoring the fucking stink. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6071.64s)]
*  There's a rotting body right there. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6073.64s)]
*  Bro, it probably was so rank. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6075.56s)]
*  They didn't have anywhere to get rid of their shit. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6077.400000000001s)]
*  That little napkin that they had on the big white wig people, they had a little canker [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6079.719999999999s)]
*  shift and they would just carry it, bro. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6091.8s)]
*  They would have perfume on it. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6094.04s)]
*  They would put it in their nose so they wouldn't have to smell like the poor people. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6096.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, it wasn't just that, man. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6100.599999999999s)]
*  It was the shit in the streets because they didn't have cars. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6101.8s)]
*  So they had horses. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6104.28s)]
*  The horses would shit all over the roads. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6105.32s)]

*  Is there a video we can watch on the unit? [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6599.32s)]

*  It said hot water and something else. They added some other stuff, too. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6605.4s)]
*  But whatever, man, what do we what the fuck is this it? [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6610.919999999999s)]

*  Will they put them in there alive? [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6620.68s)]
*  No, Felipe. These are dead bodies. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6623.400000000001s)]
*  They're just cooking them, cooking them up nice. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6625.8s)]
*  And that's what they get like little bones and pieces. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6628.6s)]
*  Well, I want to be cremated. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6633.320000000001s)]
*  But if that's an option, you're just talking about it. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6634.68s)]
*  Yeah, but you don't want your body being resold as fertilizer. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6637.88s)]
*  It's just weird to pour dead people on top of your fucking carrots so they grow better. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6641.72s)]
*  Speak to me. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6648.280000000001s)]

*  Like, what is the stuff they're looking for? [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6657.08s)]
*  Let's find that out. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6659.240000000001s)]
*  First of all, we don't even know if it's true. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6660.6s)]
*  Yeah, no, I don't. I wouldn't take that as truth. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6661.88s)]
*  I wouldn't even believe that. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6663.8s)]
*  How would they how would this can you Google and see if there's other stories that say that? [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6664.68s)]
*  OK, I'm not pushing you. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6669.08s)]

*  They're dead. OK, we're supposed to be different than everything else on the planet. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6677.72s)]
*  We love each other more than we love anything else. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6680.6s)]
*  You can use monkeys for experiments, but some states allow the remaining liquid with its peptides, [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6683.0s)]
*  sugars, amino acids and captured carbon to be reclaimed and repurposed as fertilizer. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6688.6s)]

*  Do they have to? [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6702.52s)]
*  You know, there's a house where someone killed his whole family in it. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6703.320000000001s)]
*  They have to tell you that you see the oak tree. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6707.400000000001s)]
*  That's Joe Diaz, by the way. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6710.52s)]
*  What? [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6713.240000000001s)]
*  No, they look like they're making them to a soil, right? [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6713.8s)]
*  So, oh, you see that tree right there? [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6717.240000000001s)]
*  We use the joy. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6720.52s)]
*  Would you do particles? [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6721.88s)]
*  That's right. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6723.400000000001s)]
*  Cocksuckers. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6723.88s)]
*  Do you think they have to tell you, though, that you're buying dead people fertilizer [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6724.84s)]
*  or they just consider it chemicals at that point? [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6729.320000000001s)]
*  How do they get away with selling you dead people? [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6732.360000000001s)]
*  Because it seems like if you had the option, hey, do you want like manure? [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6734.6s)]
*  Patsiton, 1888? [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6737.96s)]

*  They've been boiling people and turning them into fertilizer since the 1800s. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6744.68s)]
*  So we have that machine, but not no fucking sewage. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6749.08s)]
*  Wow. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6752.4400000000005s)]
*  The scary thing is what them saying that they use it for calcium deficiencies, [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6757.400000000001s)]
*  because that means you're feeding people other people's bones [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6762.76s)]
*  so they can get a source of calcium. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6766.12s)]
*  But that guy's vegan, so don't give it to him. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6767.88s)]
*  Maybe it's okay because the person consented. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6772.52s)]
*  Yeah, I'm trying. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6774.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's true. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6774.84s)]
*  Chlamyacin, so it seems like a solid place. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6779.88s)]
*  Huh. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6783.56s)]
*  So body plus 95% water, 5% alkaline, basic chemicals, [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6785.4800000000005s)]
*  either potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide or a combo, sterile effluent, water, salt, [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6790.52s)]
*  sugars, amino acids, peptides, bone fragments, calcium phosphate. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6798.28s)]
*  So that's what they get out of it. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6802.36s)]
*  So they boil it down in this solution and they get out all these different things, water, salt, [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6803.8s)]
*  sugar, amino acids, peptides, and then calcium phosphate. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6809.32s)]
*  And then I guess what do they do with the calcium? [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6813.0s)]
*  So if you're buying calcium and you find out it's from dead people, [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6815.8s)]
*  they should probably let you know. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6820.2s)]
*  You probably should have to let people know that. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6822.84s)]
*  I drink dead people. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6825.4800000000005s)]
*  You would sell a lot if you made it from dead people for sure. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6826.92s)]
*  Like if you had a skull and crossbones on the bottle, [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6830.52s)]
*  there's a lot of assholes that would buy that. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6832.68s)]
*  But then people start looking at that like they'd look at chicken. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6834.2s)]
*  How was he raised? [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6838.2s)]
*  What kind of parents did he have? [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6840.68s)]
*  Oh yeah, for sure. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6842.04s)]
*  Yeah, if you're really into... [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6843.72s)]
*  Do they have anxiety problems? [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6844.6s)]
*  Are you really into eating someone? [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6846.68s)]
*  What if they were a fucked up person and you take a little bit of their soul inside of you [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6848.36s)]
*  and you go insane? [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6851.799999999999s)]
*  Be crazy, man. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6854.12s)]
*  Well, that's got to be what's happening with the cannibals when they get that disease [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6855.5599999999995s)]

*  Did Jeffrey Dahmer have that? [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6865.96s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6868.12s)]
*  I think you have to eat spinal tissue. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6869.24s)]
*  You have to eat brain and spinal tissue. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6871.32s)]
*  And they're called prions. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6874.44s)]
*  The thing about prions is you can't even boil them. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6876.76s)]
*  If you cook them at like a thousand degrees, I think, for like hours, it doesn't kill them. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6879.72s)]
*  If you ever get to an environmental restaurant and they tell you you're a human being, would you eat it? [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6887.16s)]

*  No. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6913.8s)]

*  I saw one where a guy, a movie was called a microwave massacre. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6944.12s)]
*  Microwave massacre? [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6949.08s)]
*  And this guy murdered his wife. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6950.12s)]
*  In a microwave? [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6951.879999999999s)]
*  No, he cuts her her pieces and microwaves the body and makes lunches and he takes them [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6952.92s)]
*  to work every day. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6958.839999999999s)]

*  Real movie. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6960.759999999999s)]

*  It's a real movie called microwave massacre, but it's probably based on a real guy. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6963.32s)]
*  And he would take food that he made from people he murdered and they would eat it at work. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6966.92s)]
*  And then when they finally caught him, everybody at work was throwing up. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6972.12s)]
*  I think there was a woman who got caught eating her husband and serving him to the neighbors. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=6976.2s)]

*  Good for the soul. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7009.0s)]

*  Prions. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7011.96s)]
*  They're scary. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7014.679999999999s)]
*  That's mad cow disease. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7016.28s)]
*  That's what cannibals get. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7018.04s)]
*  It's a very sketchy disease. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7021.16s)]
*  There's another one right now that deers have. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7022.76s)]
*  It's called chronic wasting disease. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7024.92s)]
*  Same kind of deal. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7026.92s)]
*  It's a prion disease. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7028.12s)]
*  And deers are getting it and they froth at the mouth and drool and their body shrivels up. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7029.72s)]
*  Very creepy, man. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7036.04s)]
*  You can eat those? [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7037.08s)]
*  You can because there's no crossover to people, but I wouldn't suggest it. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7038.84s)]
*  I wouldn't recommend it. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7043.56s)]
*  The thing is you can test and you could find out if your deer is okay. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7047.0s)]
*  Like you can shoot them and then test them and then you know you're good to go and you can eat [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7050.4400000000005s)]
*  the deer. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7054.12s)]
*  But if it tests positive, it hasn't jumped from animal to people. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7054.84s)]
*  It's only an animal. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7059.0s)]
*  But what it does to animals is so grave. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7059.96s)]
*  Why would you take that chance? [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7063.32s)]
*  This is how I feel. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7064.6s)]
*  Why would you take a chance of consuming an animal that literally has a plague inside of it? [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7065.88s)]
*  Because for deer, that's the plague. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7070.12s)]
*  These deer, they're not even... [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7072.52s)]
*  See, the thing with people, a disease like that would spread like wildfire. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7074.4400000000005s)]
*  With deer, they're out in these big giant open areas and yet still it's spreading from their [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7079.320000000001s)]
*  saliva onto leaves and then other deer pick it up. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7086.200000000001s)]
*  It's super fucking contagious and it kills the shit out of them. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7093.72s)]
*  And if that jumps to people, that's a real problem. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7097.240000000001s)]
*  That's a real fucking problem because I don't know if they have [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7100.76s)]
*  medication that combats it in deer. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7105.08s)]
*  I don't know what research they've done in trying to figure it out. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7107.16s)]
*  But I know it's such a problem that there's a lot of places where they're killing extra deer [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7109.16s)]
*  just to try to keep the populations lower so they don't interact with each other as much. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7114.5199999999995s)]
*  And so they don't catch it from giving it back and forth to each other as much. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7118.84s)]
*  And people have this right now? [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7121.639999999999s)]
*  No humans have it yet. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7123.16s)]
*  But I think chronic wasting disease has been... [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7124.92s)]
*  It used to be one type of deer. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7127.88s)]
*  I'm not sure what deer it started out with. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7130.5199999999995s)]
*  It might have been mule deer. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7132.44s)]
*  But it's in a lot of white tailed deer in America and apparently it's made its way into other [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7134.120000000001s)]
*  ungulates. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7140.04s)]
*  Like I think it's in elk. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7140.76s)]
*  I think they might have even found it in moose. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7143.160000000001s)]
*  It's scary shit, man, because it's basically a zombie virus. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7145.8s)]
*  It turns you into a fucking skeleton and you waste away. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7149.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's horrific. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7153.0s)]
*  And it's probably some of it came from farms because they think that that's one of the ways [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7154.68s)]
*  that it's spread. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7161.72s)]
*  There's a lot of deer farms that do a great job. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7162.92s)]
*  They're very ethical. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7165.16s)]
*  So if you wanted a property and you wanted your own private hunting property and you [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7165.96s)]
*  wanted to put a high fence up, take care of the ground, put food plots in there for the [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7170.12s)]
*  animals, this is how you... [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7174.76s)]
*  You got a thousand acres, you want to fence it all in. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7175.88s)]
*  You could do that in Texas and you can buy deer. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7177.96s)]
*  So you say, okay, I want to buy 20 white tailed deer and let them loose on my property. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7180.360000000001s)]
*  You got this thousand acre spot or wherever you're at. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7185.320000000001s)]
*  Um, if you get a deer that is from a farm that's unethical, they're all going to be stacked [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7187.88s)]
*  next to each other, just like pigs. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7194.76s)]
*  When you watch fucking factory farming for pigs, they're going to be corralled and shitty. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7196.76s)]
*  Most of them don't do this, but you're always going to have people that are unethical. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7201.32s)]
*  And when people do things where diseases start getting spread and they kind of cover it up [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7205.24s)]
*  or lie about it because they don't want to lose money and then they're sending deer around. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7209.88s)]
*  There's a lot of regulations now on how you can move deer across state lines because of [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7214.200000000001s)]
*  these diseases. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7219.96s)]
*  If you have bad deer meat, can you cover it up with a bunch of good deer meat where that bad [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7221.240000000001s)]
*  meat disappears? [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7227.72s)]
*  What do you mean? [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7230.76s)]
*  Just say like, cause I remember myself cooking and I had like, um, I spilled like a shitload [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7231.56s)]
*  of garlic on my oatmeal and I was making oatmeal for 15 motherfuckers in rehab. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7238.200000000001s)]
*  So I just started putting more oatmeal, more oatmeal and more milk to hide the garlic smell. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7243.72s)]
*  In the end, everybody was farting anyway, so they still got it. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7250.12s)]
*  But do people do that? [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7253.160000000001s)]
*  What you're saying that people do that with deer meat that they cover it up? [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7254.52s)]
*  You could do that. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7257.4800000000005s)]
*  You could make sausage. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7258.200000000001s)]
*  People are not unethical. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7258.92s)]
*  They hide it by it. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7260.12s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7261.56s)]
*  So what we're talking about chronic wasting disease is it's that's different. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7262.12s)]
*  All right. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7266.4400000000005s)]
*  It probably wouldn't even affect the taste of the animal. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7266.76s)]
*  They'll probably be very lean because there's not much left of them. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7269.0s)]
*  Or they could have just gotten it and they could look, be healthy looking. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7272.5199999999995s)]
*  And they still have this disease. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7276.12s)]
*  They still test positive for it. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7277.32s)]
*  My fear would be about what that disease is going to do if it jumps to human beings. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7278.919999999999s)]
*  And if you're consuming it, are we sure that it just goes out of your system or is it just [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7284.28s)]
*  inert? [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7288.12s)]
*  It doesn't work in your system. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7288.839999999999s)]
*  Could it work eventually? [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7290.36s)]
*  Is it something that has an incubation period that maybe, maybe not now, maybe it will have [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7291.719999999999s)]
*  one in five years from now or 10 years from now. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7296.28s)]
*  Maybe the version of chronic wasting disease, if it evolves and changes, [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7297.96s)]
*  is going to be making the jump to humans. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7302.04s)]
*  That's a scary fucking disease to make the jump to humans. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7304.44s)]
*  You know, there's a bunch of those out there. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7307.8s)]
*  Like bird flu. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7309.16s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7310.44s)]
*  And then there's the ones that we make. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7311.64s)]
*  Garteria. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7315.16s)]
*  No, like COVID. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7316.5199999999995s)]
*  They fucking made that shit in a lab. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7317.96s)]
*  They made it in a lab. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7319.8s)]
*  It's spread across the whole world. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7321.0s)]
*  Like AIDS. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7322.36s)]
*  Do you think they made AIDS in a lab? [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7323.0s)]
*  Wow. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7325.08s)]
*  Did you say like AIDS? [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7325.4s)]
*  Like AIDS or something. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7326.5199999999995s)]
*  I read that somewhere. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7327.4s)]
*  Somebody say they make all that shit in labs. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7328.44s)]
*  Well. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7331.32s)]
*  Wasn't it like part of like chemical warfare, right? [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7332.44s)]
*  That is a part of chemical warfare. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7337.5599999999995s)]
*  Like putting disease blankets on natives, you know, and. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7338.839999999999s)]
*  Well, they've done a bunch of fucking studies. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7343.16s)]
*  Like that's the big conspiracy theory about Lyme disease. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7344.759999999999s)]
*  Influenza blankets. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7348.12s)]
*  That's what they had. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7349.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7350.679999999999s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7351.4s)]
*  That was smallpox. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7351.88s)]
*  Smallpox. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7353.32s)]
*  But I don't know if that's even true because I don't think they really knew what, [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7353.799999999999s)]
*  like how diseases were spread back then. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7359.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't think they knew that you could just like put scabs on a blanket and give people [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7361.4s)]
*  smallpox. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7365.0s)]
*  And if you had smallpox, are you trying to dish out smallpox? [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7365.719999999999s)]
*  Are you trying to catch it? [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7368.599999999999s)]
*  So you're handling it and then putting it in blankets. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7369.4s)]
*  It seems like an exaggerated cruelty of what happened. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7372.599999999999s)]
*  And what happened was Europeans came over here. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7376.759999999999s)]
*  The Native Americans had, you know, whatever you want to call them, the indigenous people. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7379.32s)]
*  They did not have any immunity to smallpox and it wiped out 90% of them. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7383.16s)]
*  Diseases from North Americans or from Europeans rather, coming to North America, they wiped out [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7389.879999999999s)]
*  everybody with disease. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7395.32s)]
*  It's somewhere in the neighborhood of 90% of the people that were here are gone because [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7396.36s)]
*  of disease. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7400.919999999999s)]
*  So, you know, when people want to think that there's no way to prepare like a group of [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7402.28s)]
*  human beings that has no immunity in, you know, 1492. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7411.799999999999s)]
*  There's no way to prepare. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7416.599999999999s)]
*  There's no way to prepare anybody. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7418.36s)]
*  You're coming in with these stinky European streets filled with shit water, right? [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7420.2s)]
*  Everybody's got some funky parasite, funky disease. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7426.759999999999s)]
*  They probably fucking stink. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7431.48s)]
*  They're probably infested with all. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7433.48s)]
*  They probably smell that boat of them all the way. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7435.4s)]
*  They probably have viruses, fighting viruses inside their body, coughing phlegm and blood [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7437.799999999999s)]
*  and they're drinking whiskey and they come over to the- [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7443.799999999999s)]
*  They're probably having sex with each other. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7446.12s)]
*  Yeah, and it's probably none of it's consensual. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7447.8s)]
*  It's probably animals biting each other and holding each other down, fucking each other. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7450.120000000001s)]
*  And then they come to North America and they start slaughtering people. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7454.360000000001s)]
*  And there's this one, we've talked about this before. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7457.8s)]
*  He was like a bishop or some religious man who chronicled one of Christopher Columbus's [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7462.04s)]
*  early interactions with these people. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7468.6s)]
*  And it's horrific shit, man. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7470.68s)]
*  Cutting people's arms off if they don't bring back their weight in gold. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7472.92s)]
*  And dashing babies on rocks in front of their parents. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7476.68s)]
*  Horrific shit, man. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7481.240000000001s)]
*  And those are the kind of people that brought those diseases. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7483.88s)]
*  That's like a real demon horde. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7487.88s)]
*  Crazy, huh? [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7489.88s)]
*  Crazy. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7490.76s)]

*  He was full of gonorrhea. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7512.52s)]

*  Because that's all they had. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7525.400000000001s)]
*  What a good move. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7527.400000000001s)]
*  Who invented that? [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7528.12s)]
*  What asshole was like, try mercury? [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7529.8s)]
*  He probably was on a pirate ship somewhere, made a voodoo doctor and said, [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7531.48s)]
*  mercury, put it in your dick. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7536.36s)]
*  Did mercury kill his dick? [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7537.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7539.4s)]

*  Fucking shit up. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7584.6s)]

*  But the ground all around where this temple is tests for high levels of mercury. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7606.2s)]
*  And the ancient story is that anybody who ever dared open up this temple, open up this tomb, [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7613.240000000001s)]

*  No. Imagine drowning in mercury. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7626.84s)]
*  Imagine like 2,000 years ago a dude sets up a booby trap for greedy people [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7629.0s)]
*  and sets it up where he fills the entire tomb up with mercury. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7634.04s)]
*  First of all, is that even possible? [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7638.280000000001s)]
*  How much mercury would you have to handle and how many people would have to die from that mercury? [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7639.8s)]
*  Could you imagine where first of all, where did they even get it? [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7644.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Where do they get mercury in 2,000 plus years ago? [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7647.88s)]
*  Do you know that story about that emperor and his temple? [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7651.4800000000005s)]
*  Tioti Wakan is where it says it is. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7653.4800000000005s)]
*  No. Tioti Wakan is Aztec. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7656.200000000001s)]
*  I know, but it says, well, this is like where mercury found out about temple. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7659.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's probably a common booby track, I bet. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7663.400000000001s)]
*  But this one where they found out about temple. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7666.200000000001s)]
*  Temple in China. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7670.36s)]
*  On top of Google, it says temple drowned in mercury refers to the temple of Tioti Wakan. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7671.08s)]
*  Can you say temple booby trapped with mercury in China? [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7675.4s)]
*  I think it's like the first emperor of China. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7680.44s)]
*  It says it could have been the thing that they did on earth. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7683.959999999999s)]
*  They said it was in China. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7686.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, this is the one. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7688.36s)]
*  So there's one that they have not entered into. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7690.759999999999s)]
*  And I think this is the one with the terracotta statues in front of it. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7694.759999999999s)]
*  I think this is a common thing when great people died. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7697.96s)]
*  They probably made a terracotta army for them. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7700.36s)]
*  When they find these things, it's like, here it is. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7703.5599999999995s)]
*  That's us talking about it. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7710.28s)]
*  Crazy story of first emperor of China's tomb. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7711.88s)]
*  That's me and Schultz talking about it, right? [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7714.68s)]
*  Click on that. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7717.24s)]
*  So I'll remember. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7720.5199999999995s)]
*  It's not our video. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7721.32s)]
*  It's my fucking video, bitch. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7722.28s)]
*  Somebody else's video. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7723.72s)]
*  Somebody else uploaded it. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7725.320000000001s)]
*  Well, that's ridiculous, but it's ours, right? [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7726.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7728.360000000001s)]
*  So what is this? [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7729.8s)]
*  They would have a copyright on my voice? [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7731.400000000001s)]
*  I don't want to get into it, but yeah, we probably have the revenues probably come into our thing. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7734.280000000001s)]
*  There's people claiming it, but it's up. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7738.04s)]
*  I'm just saying. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7739.72s)]
*  A lot of the clips that I watched are from other people sharing them. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7742.04s)]
*  I was just saying it's not ours, so I don't know if they edited it or not. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7745.0s)]
*  Right, right. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7747.8s)]
*  Okay, don't put it up there. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7748.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7750.360000000001s)]
*  Got it. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7750.68s)]
*  The point is there's a tomb in China that's supposedly booby trapped with tons of liquid [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7751.5599999999995s)]
*  mercury. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7757.32s)]
*  I'm sure Jamie will find it, but this area around it apparently tests high for mercury, [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7757.639999999999s)]
*  so they think that it might be a true story and they don't want to go in there. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7763.8s)]
*  They don't want to fucking open up the door and die, which is wow that this dude set this up if [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7766.84s)]
*  he did 2000 plus years ago. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7770.92s)]
*  I don't even remember how many thousands of years ago it was, but it was insanely impressive. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7773.96s)]
*  Wow, amazing to think of something like that and it still works. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7778.76s)]
*  Yeah, like where the fuck, while Jamie's looking this up, where the fuck do you think they get [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7783.8s)]
*  mercury and how much can they get? [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7787.4800000000005s)]
*  How much can they have back then? [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7789.24s)]
*  I've only seen a thermometer. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7791.64s)]
*  I know, like where are they getting it? [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7793.64s)]
*  Throughout antiquity, remember we've talked about cinnabar before? [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7795.0s)]
*  Cinnabar. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7798.280000000001s)]
*  Cinnabar. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7798.76s)]
*  It's where they got red stuff also. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7799.24s)]
*  Cinnabar in antiquity was the source of all mercury. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7802.92s)]
*  So how did they do it? [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7806.360000000001s)]
*  Did they pull of it? [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7807.32s)]
*  How did they do it? [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7810.28s)]
*  Does it say how they did it? [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7811.08s)]
*  Manos says to extract you need to roast it in air, [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7812.04s)]
*  convert the sulfur to sulfur dioxide. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7815.4s)]
*  While the mercury is released as vapor, it can be then condensed. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7817.16s)]
*  It's mercury boils at 357 Celsius. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7820.04s)]
*  It's processed in these temperatures well within. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7822.04s)]
*  They did some kilns. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7824.5199999999995s)]
*  They had those. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7825.8s)]
*  Wow, so they just cooked up mercury. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7827.08s)]
*  It's just hard to do, but they did it. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7829.8s)]
*  Wow, well if they can make a temple like this guy had, [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7832.2s)]
*  they can cook up mercury and fill that temple. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7835.32s)]
*  That is crazy to think of. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7837.639999999999s)]
*  I wish maybe there's going to be a way with new technology [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7840.2s)]
*  where they can pierce into the ground, [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7843.8s)]
*  where they can see into things without having to actually go in there physically. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7846.04s)]
*  Because I know they're doing the LIDAR stuff. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7850.28s)]
*  I know they can kind of detect where there used to be agriculture. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7852.92s)]
*  This article is someone digging into is this claim real? [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7855.48s)]
*  And this says that even if... [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7859.24s)]
*  So even though mercury either as a cinnabar or as the elemental metal has been found in tombs [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7861.8s)]
*  dating as far back as the second millennium BC, it's not clear why it was put there. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7868.6s)]
*  Might its toxicity have acted as a deterrent to grave looters? [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7873.8s)]
*  Probably not. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7877.32s)]
*  The dangers of mercury fumes were not recognized until Han times. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7877.88s)]
*  If so, it seems, there's a lot of mercury in the burial chamber. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7881.72s)]
*  It's likely to be either a preservative or an anti-theft device. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7884.76s)]
*  So the big theory is that it's an anti-theft device, [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7889.0s)]
*  and that's why people are terrified of going in there. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7893.0s)]
*  Here, hold it right here. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7895.08s)]
*  Based on estimates of mercury production from the Song era [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7896.280000000001s)]
*  and allowing for the imperfections of the earlier refinement process, [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7899.8s)]
*  he thinks the chamber might have contained at most 100 tons of the liquid metal. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7903.64s)]
*  Holy shit. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7913.16s)]
*  100 tons. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7919.0s)]
*  How did Blackbeard find this shit? [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7921.0s)]
*  Well, that wasn't Blackbeard, that was China. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7924.4400000000005s)]
*  How did he find mercury back then? [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7928.04s)]
*  Shiver me timbers. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7931.4800000000005s)]
*  They probably had a... [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7932.52s)]
*  Oh, they have like a... [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7933.320000000001s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7934.12s)]
*  That was the device they stuck in their dick? [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7934.92s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7937.4800000000005s)]
*  And that's a saying, right? [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7937.88s)]
*  Shiver me timbers? [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7939.16s)]
*  Are you surprised or shocked? [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7942.04s)]
*  I think they're saying that just for funsies. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7943.4800000000005s)]
*  They found this in Iraq. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7946.84s)]
*  Oh my God, this guy had a mercury syringe in Iraq. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7948.68s)]
*  From my peepee. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7952.200000000001s)]
*  And look, it's all rough looking and it's not even polished good. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7953.320000000001s)]
*  He probably was drawing in his map. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7957.8s)]
*  Don't go over there, man. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7959.240000000001s)]
*  If you're going to go to this island, take lots of mercury. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7960.52s)]
*  Meanwhile, they all died from that, right? [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7963.0s)]
*  Syphilis. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7965.16s)]
*  Look at this, a pump cluster, which would have been to use pump fluid into the rectum, [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7965.72s)]
*  allowing the body to quickly absorb it. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7970.280000000001s)]
*  They were taking... [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7973.16s)]
*  Like animals? [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7975.64s)]

*  They're boofing. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7977.56s)]
*  So they were doing that for drugs? [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7978.76s)]
*  Pump liquid into the... [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7980.92s)]

*  This is what I heard. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7989.0s)]
*  They pour coffee now. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7989.56s)]
*  I heard people take tampons filled with vodka and stuff from in their asshole. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7990.52s)]
*  I mean, they've been doing it since the days of the pirates. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7996.360000000001s)]
*  That's not new. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=7999.4800000000005s)]
*  There you go. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8002.04s)]

*  Bro, what the fuck is wrong with people? [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8003.08s)]
*  Severe dehydration by pumping fluid in the ass. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8004.52s)]
*  People like putting stuff on their butts. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8008.12s)]
*  And also a bloodletting instrument called a porringer. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8009.639999999999s)]
*  I had a buddy of mine and he did his medical residency in Miami in the 1980s during the [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8013.08s)]
*  cocaine times. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8018.76s)]
*  And he said, dude... [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8019.96s)]
*  That's where he did his residency. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8021.4s)]
*  So he was in the emergency room. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8022.44s)]
*  So it's like every day someone's coming in with something stuffed up their ass. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8023.8s)]
*  They're coke out of their mind. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8027.08s)]

*  Damn. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8035.639999999999s)]
*  All kinds of things stuck up their ass. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8036.5199999999995s)]
*  I did a show at Lump Bugs Day Penitentiary and one of the guards told me that some guy [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8038.28s)]
*  made a vibrator out of seven handballs. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8044.679999999999s)]
*  The void. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8053.0s)]
*  And he taped them all up. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8054.2s)]
*  And then what happened? [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8056.92s)]
*  How do you guys know? [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8057.88s)]
*  I go, well, he didn't tie them up too good. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8058.44s)]
*  They were all stuck in there. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8060.84s)]
*  He had to take them all out. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8061.8s)]
*  Oh, no. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8064.12s)]
*  He didn't tie them up good? [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8065.56s)]
*  Yeah, because he didn't put enough wrapping, I guess. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8067.0s)]
*  No. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8069.0s)]
*  So they'd go in his butt and get all those balls? [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8069.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8071.32s)]
*  How many were in there? [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8071.64s)]
*  Like five. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8072.36s)]
*  Whatever. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8073.96s)]
*  How many balls make this? [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8074.84s)]
*  And you thought he was hiding a knife? [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8080.2s)]
*  That's a hard way to go too because sometimes people die that way. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8083.8s)]
*  You get, you know, toxic shock. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8086.92s)]
*  Something goes wrong. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8088.68s)]
*  You tear your rectum. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8089.72s)]
*  You bleed out internally. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8091.16s)]
*  You stuff things up your ass like the Mr. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8093.24s)]
*  Hand story. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8096.04s)]

*  Hand story, right? [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8097.639999999999s)]
*  No. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8098.5199999999995s)]
*  There's a whole movie based on it called Zoo. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8099.0s)]
*  Zoo is a thing called Zufilia where people are sexually attracted to farm animals. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8101.4s)]
*  And so these people met up online and they found out that you're still allowed to fuck [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8106.84s)]
*  animals in Washington state. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8111.32s)]
*  So they all went to Washington state. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8113.32s)]
*  This is a movie? [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8114.92s)]
*  Washington state, right? [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8115.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8116.12s)]
*  This is based on true story. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8116.44s)]
*  All right. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8117.639999999999s)]
*  And this dude got fucked to death by a horse. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8118.2s)]
*  They had to bring him to the emergency room. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8121.0s)]
*  Like what's going on? [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8122.28s)]
*  And you know everyone's acting a little shifty and then they have to tell the whole story. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8123.5599999999995s)]
*  And they find out these people have like hundreds of hours of people getting fucked by donkeys [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8127.16s)]
*  and horses and shit. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8131.32s)]
*  And they all did this out on this weird ranch. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8132.759999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8137.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8137.96s)]
*  You know one of the- [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8138.5199999999995s)]
*  That's how the dude died. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8139.16s)]
*  One of the first books, you know, there used to be a lot of sex books when we were kids. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8140.12s)]
*  And they were all nasty books about sex. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8144.84s)]
*  The first one I ever read was about people having sex with animals. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8147.96s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8152.6s)]
*  But they were like, remember those penthouse stories or playboy stories? [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8153.24s)]
*  But these were all with animals. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8156.76s)]
*  And I remember the woman telling this whole story about having sex with a horse. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8158.92s)]
*  And like just riding that fool. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8165.08s)]
*  You never see the Mr. Hans video. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8168.52s)]
*  There's a video, one video that got leaked online way back in the day. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8170.04s)]
*  Brian Redband sent it to me. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8174.36s)]
*  And it's this dude getting railed by the horse. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8175.96s)]
*  And it's not even the one where he dies apparently. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8178.6s)]
*  He dies in another video. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8180.52s)]
*  But in this video you see the size of the horse's dick and you see his body and you see his ass. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8182.4400000000005s)]
*  And you're like, there's no way. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8186.6s)]
*  How many people helped him because it's something you can't do? [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8188.6s)]
*  One guy grabbed it and just pointed it in the right direction. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8191.64s)]
*  And the horse was one gigantic thrust of death. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8195.64s)]
*  The guy makes this horrible sound and then his friend goes too much. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8199.880000000001s)]
*  Fuck. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8204.52s)]
*  Oh he came, he came, the horse came. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8205.64s)]
*  And you're like, this is the sickest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life. [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8208.28s)]
*  And that's how that guy died. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8211.72s)]
*  That guy in that video that's getting fucked by that horse was the guy who eventually dies from it. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8212.84s)]
*  Did they put the horse to sleep afterwards? [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8217.8s)]
*  I don't think so. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8219.88s)]
*  It's not the horse's fault. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8220.6s)]
*  Fuck did the horse do? [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8221.72s)]
*  The horse is going to, you know, I wouldn't bend over in front of him. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8222.84s)]
*  He's kind of conditioned now. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8226.92s)]
*  It's not his fault. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8227.96s)]
*  The media kind of says they only found out about all this because he died. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8228.68s)]
*  Yes. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8231.48s)]
*  Like, yeah, that's what I said. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8232.2s)]
*  Oh yeah, but it's like, it's just cool. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8233.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8235.0s)]
*  That was the first time we tried with ponies first. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8235.48s)]
*  No, he had been fucked by a bunch of horses. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8238.039999999999s)]
*  Or a bunch of times by the same horse. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8240.279999999999s)]
*  But there was apparently many hours this guy getting fucked by horses. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8242.039999999999s)]
*  100 VHS tapes and DVDs. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8246.199999999999s)]
*  But it's real, right? [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8247.88s)]
*  Not like an urban legend like when people say I went to TJ and saw a donkey show. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8248.68s)]
*  You want to see it? [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8252.84s)]
*  You're going to show it? [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8254.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8255.24s)]
*  This is still my old computer I guess. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8255.74s)]
*  Oh. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8257.24s)]
*  Do you have it? [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8258.119999999999s)]
*  You can still get it, right? [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8259.08s)]
*  I don't know where to look. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8260.6s)]
*  I'll look. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8261.4s)]
*  I bet you could get it. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8262.119999999999s)]
*  I bet if you put it up on X. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8263.16s)]
*  X is one of the few places where actually it's actually illegal. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8265.4s)]
*  So maybe you can't have it on X. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8268.52s)]
*  Hold on. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8269.88s)]
*  Because bestiality, it wasn't illegal when they were doing it though. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8271.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8275.4s)]
*  There's a point. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8275.64s)]
*  Kind of. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8276.28s)]
*  No, that's what's called bestiality when you have sex with an animal. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8277.4s)]
*  Okay. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8281.24s)]
*  It's called you're fucking gross. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8281.96s)]
*  And what's the one when you have sex with dead bodies? [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8283.24s)]
*  That is... [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8286.119999999999s)]
*  Necrophilia. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8286.6s)]
*  Necrophilia. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8287.4s)]
*  Don't look on X for that. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8288.36s)]
*  Yeah, you can't find an X. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8290.2s)]
*  It's a different search result that pops up. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8291.32s)]
*  Oh yeah, they probably game the search results now, right? [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8293.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8296.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8297.56s)]
*  There's a lot of 21 older material. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8298.36s)]
*  People have sex with animals, right? [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8301.56s)]
*  Like since you want to talk about gangs in New York, how ugly it was. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8304.199999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8308.36s)]
*  People just fucked everything that was in front of them. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8309.16s)]
*  All right. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8310.92s)]
*  You found it. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8311.64s)]
*  Okay. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8312.14s)]
*  Here it is. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8312.64s)]
*  Headphones please. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8313.14s)]
*  We'll make sure it... [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8313.64s)]
*  Oh. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8314.76s)]
*  Yeah, there it is, baby. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8315.48s)]
*  I mean, you verify that that's it? [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8316.279999999999s)]
*  Oh, that's 100% it. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8318.36s)]
*  Okay. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8319.4s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8319.8s)]
*  Go full screen. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8320.279999999999s)]
*  And don't show it on screen at all. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8322.039999999999s)]
*  Mute the sound when we play this? [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8326.039999999999s)]
*  Nope. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8327.48s)]
*  Nope. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8328.44s)]
*  Let's hear it. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8328.68s)]
*  Okay. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8331.8s)]
*  It's on a porn site, I guess. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8336.199999999999s)]
*  Here we go. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8337.88s)]
*  Here's the sound. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8339.0s)]
*  That's where we reversed him. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8341.08s)]
*  So that's the guy's butt. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8342.119999999999s)]
*  The horse gets on top of him. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8343.24s)]
*  And then the guy grabs it. [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8345.32s)]
*  Look at this. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8346.52s)]
*  Watch this. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8347.0s)]
*  Look at the distance. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8347.64s)]
*  Look at the amount of tissue we're talking about here. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8348.44s)]
*  Watch this. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8350.36s)]
*  Like, long, down silver. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8351.64s)]
*  Watch this. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8352.36s)]
*  Okay. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8374.44s)]
*  This is on a loop. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8377.24s)]
*  This is repeating. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8378.36s)]
*  This is repeating, yeah. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8379.24s)]
*  This is already... [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8380.2s)]
*  The whole thing really only lasts a couple of seconds. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8381.800000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8384.6s)]
*  That guy died. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8385.480000000001s)]
*  The guy has no ass. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8386.52s)]
*  The movie's fascinating. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8387.400000000001s)]
*  Because the movie is like a documentary sort of recreation of those people. [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8388.76s)]
*  And it's not like that. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8393.08s)]
*  You don't see things. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8394.28s)]
*  But you just see how fucking bananas the whole story is. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8395.560000000001s)]
*  The horse is known for that or they just grabbed a random horse? [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8397.720000000001s)]
*  Because he needs to know what he was doing, bro. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8402.28s)]
*  He probably been fucking that guy for a long time. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8404.28s)]
*  They probably been doing... [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8406.76s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8407.720000000001s)]
*  It killed him one day. [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8408.52s)]
*  But I think he had done it a bunch of times. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8410.2s)]
*  You're not going to show that, right? [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8412.2s)]
*  No, no, no. We had a no. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8412.68s)]
*  Because Pito come after us. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8413.32s)]
*  We had a no. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8414.6s)]
*  We had a no. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8415.24s)]
*  I don't know. Who knows what I was really showing? [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8415.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. We were just making noises. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8417.24s)]
*  Cartoon. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8418.44s)]
*  That is... [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8419.800000000001s)]
*  Mr. What the... [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8422.36s)]
*  My name is Mr. Red. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8423.640000000001s)]
*  There's people out there that are out of their fucking minds. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8425.16s)]
*  They're out of their fucking minds. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8429.720000000001s)]
*  You're getting fucked to death by a horse in a grainy video. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8431.32s)]
*  You know? [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8435.960000000001s)]
*  Like what is life for you? [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8436.859999999999s)]
*  That would be crazy. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8440.14s)]
*  That's your thing. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8441.66s)]
*  You're getting off work at five. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8442.3s)]
*  And I think the guy who died was an intelligent guy. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8443.58s)]
*  Wasn't he an engineer? [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8446.38s)]
*  He worked at Boeing for over eight years, yeah. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8447.9s)]
*  Bro, he was a Boeing engineer who liked to get fucked to death by a horse. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8449.82s)]
*  That horse's dick is as long as an arm. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8455.82s)]
*  Look at how long that dick is. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8458.539999999999s)]
*  Oh, like long, long silver. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8460.14s)]
*  Do you see the size of that thing? [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8461.339999999998s)]
*  It was like 17 and a half inches. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8462.14s)]
*  It was gigantic. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8463.58s)]
*  It's probably bigger than that. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8464.46s)]
*  When it goes into his body, you're just like, where's the room? [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8465.9s)]
*  Where's the space? [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8469.98s)]
*  How? [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8472.22s)]
*  How do you warm up to it? [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8473.1s)]
*  I guess you start with fingers. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8475.26s)]
*  Then you move up to ketchup bottles. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8479.74s)]
*  The ability to experience certain sensations after a motorcycle accident. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8481.5s)]
*  Oh, so that was the only way he could feel things? [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8485.74s)]
*  Started going ham. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8487.98s)]
*  Oh, God. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8489.66s)]
*  That's terrifying. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8490.78s)]
*  That's terrifying. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8492.94s)]
*  I don't know why he started filming it though. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8493.82s)]
*  Well, you know what? [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8495.66s)]
*  That also kind of makes sense, right? [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8496.54s)]
*  Because we've talked about this many times about brain injuries. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8499.02s)]
*  About people with brain injuries, they get very impulsive and they do reckless things. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8503.58s)]
*  That totally makes sense. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8507.58s)]
*  If this guy had a motorcycle accident that fucked up the way he feels things, [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8508.62s)]
*  he probably got wrecked. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8511.9s)]
*  That's crazy, man. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8513.74s)]
*  So he got wrecked, he probably got a brain injury. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8514.54s)]
*  And it probably turned him into a wild man. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8517.1s)]
*  I twisted my ankle, man. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8519.42s)]
*  Now I want a moose to fuck me in the ass. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8520.7s)]
*  You want to get fucked to death by a wild animal? [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8523.18s)]
*  You want to be the first guy to get butt-fucked by a bear? [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8527.1s)]
*  Yeah, but you break your brain in that way. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8531.34s)]
*  Like for some people, they're just different now. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8534.86s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8537.58s)]
*  Now they're different. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8537.98s)]
*  I've seen it happen to a bunch of dudes when they've been knocked out. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8539.58s)]
*  Been knocked out really bad. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8543.5s)]
*  But that's crazy, like a kid knocked out and they're fucked out and you wake up and it goes, [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8545.02s)]
*  is there a horse nearby? [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8550.14s)]
*  Because I'm really horny right now. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8551.18s)]
*  Who knows what's going on with the chemistry of your brain? [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8553.02s)]
*  You just want experience, you want excitement. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8555.26s)]
*  You want to see if you can suck a horse's cock. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8558.54s)]
*  But that goes back to your old joke, man. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8561.900000000001s)]
*  Your old joke, you say, hey, you take a break today. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8564.54s)]
*  Yeah, take your day off. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8569.42s)]
*  You know what I said when you had that joke about the Playboy Mansion and you said that, [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8570.300000000001s)]
*  what's his name, whatever, he would have, every once in a while, a gay will pop in. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8575.26s)]
*  And then he goes, and then the punchline was, nah, man, you take a break. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8581.26s)]

*  Five inch heels. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8975.74s)]
*  Estelleros. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8977.02s)]
*  That's probably why they have better pain tolerance too. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8977.9s)]
*  They have to give birth and they wear shoes that hurt all the time. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=8979.66s)]

*  Oh, yeah. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9196.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9197.42s)]
*  And what the fuck kind of makeup did they have back then? [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9198.4s)]
*  It was probably all chemicals. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9200.48s)]
*  Cake makeup, man. [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9201.76s)]
*  That was big. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9202.72s)]
*  What the fuck did they make that stuff out of? [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9203.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9205.68s)]
*  Yeah, man, you don't have to wear that, ladies. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9207.52s)]
*  We're not that complicated. [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9210.64s)]
*  You guys gotta wear makeup when you do the UFC fights? [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9212.08s)]
*  No, I don't. [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9215.04s)]
*  I don't wear anything. [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9216.08s)]
*  I'm like, are you crazy? [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9217.6s)]
*  I have to go in there with dudes who literally have their heads split open. [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9218.8s)]
*  I have to interview people that are soaked in blood, [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9223.04s)]
*  and sometimes the blood is spitting out onto the microphone while I'm talking. [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9225.28s)]
*  That happens? [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9229.28s)]
*  All the time. [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9230.08s)]
*  I get blood on me all the time. [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9230.720000000001s)]
*  The idea of me wearing makeup to look better while I'm out there [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9233.04s)]
*  while they're dealing with people that just got their face punched in is crazy. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9236.560000000001s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9241.04s)]
*  I won't do it. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9242.400000000001s)]
*  So when they're speaking to you, like when you get a fighter that's real bloody, [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9243.04s)]
*  you're really up close to these guys. [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9249.76s)]
*  What do you see in their eyes after a fight, [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9251.92s)]
*  and they're also bleeding? [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9254.72s)]
*  Man, do you see their intensity? [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9255.92s)]
*  Do you see things other people don't see when you're interviewing them? [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9259.76s)]
*  I'm sure you see something. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9262.96s)]
*  Because you've been in a fight right in front of them. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9263.84s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're probably going to get more of a sense of how they feel after it's over. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9266.32s)]
*  There's some historic moments where you could see that when the fighter wins, [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9270.4s)]
*  it's a big fucking deal. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9274.4s)]
*  One of my favorite ones was when Israel Adesanya had his second UFC fight against Alex Perer, [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9277.36s)]
*  and he knocks him down, knocks him out, cold, beautiful, clean right hand, [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9282.16s)]
*  then finishes him on the ground, and then fires off three arrows into his body. [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9286.24s)]
*  Oh yeah, remember that guy. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9289.84s)]
*  I mean, that was a fucking classic moment. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9292.56s)]
*  And then he grabs a microphone and gives one of the most inspirational speeches. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9296.0s)]
*  Pull that speech up, because it's amazing. [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9301.76s)]
*  This is my favorite moment, I think, of anybody after they want to fight. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9304.88s)]
*  Because this was real in the moment from a guy who's the fucking boogeyman, dude. [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9309.92s)]
*  Alex Perer is the boogeyman. [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9316.560000000001s)]
*  He's the scariest motherfucker in the sport. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9318.480000000001s)]
*  He knocked Izzy out twice. [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9320.880000000001s)]
*  He left hook KO'd him in kickboxing, and then he beat him down in the UFC, [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9322.720000000001s)]
*  and then Izzy finally knocked him out. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9326.960000000001s)]
*  And when he knocked him out, when he fires those arrows into his body, [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9328.800000000001s)]
*  and then see if you can find that speech. [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9331.84s)]
*  And when you hear it, man, you're like, wow. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9334.960000000001s)]
*  That's what makes the whole career worth it. [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9337.039999999999s)]
*  These moments where you reach out. [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9342.24s)]
*  Oh, I remember that kid. [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9343.68s)]
*  And you touch the world. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9344.56s)]
*  I hope every one of you can feel this level of happiness just one time in your life. [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9345.599999999999s)]
*  You never feel this level of happiness if you don't go for something. [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9354.88s)]
*  When they knock you down, when they talk about you. [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9358.88s)]
*  If you stay down, you will never ever get that result. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9362.24s)]
*  Fortify your mind and feel this level of happiness as you rise one time in your life. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9366.08s)]
*  But I'm blessed to be able to feel this shit again and again and again and again and again. [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9371.12s)]
*  Amazing. [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9378.32s)]
*  Amazing. [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9379.44s)]
*  That's like human fuel. [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9380.880000000001s)]
*  You hear someone saying something like that after doing something like that, [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9383.52s)]
*  that can help you all throughout your day. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9386.24s)]
*  That's human fuel. [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9388.880000000001s)]
*  Amazing. [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9392.16s)]
*  Amazing. [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9395.6s)]
*  If you're going to go, go all the way or don't even try. [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9397.12s)]
*  Charles Bukowski. [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9401.76s)]
*  That guy was out there. [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9403.68s)]
*  If you're going to go, go all the way or don't even try, [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9404.720000000001s)]
*  this could mean losing girlfriends. [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9407.2s)]
*  This could mean losing wives, relatives. [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9408.720000000001s)]
*  This could be time spent in jail, lonely nights in the dark, lonely nights by yourself. [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9412.16s)]
*  But in the end, it's all worth it. [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9419.92s)]
*  I don't know the rest. [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9421.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's great. [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9422.560000000001s)]
*  Did you ever see the movie that I did on with Mickey Rourke? [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9424.24s)]
*  Both. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9426.560000000001s)]
*  They did two movies? [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9427.52s)]
*  The one with Matt Dillon called Factotum, too. [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9428.320000000002s)]
*  When was that? [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9431.2s)]
*  That came out in 2000 something and he plays them at a different... [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9432.0s)]
*  There's Barfly and there's Factotum. [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9436.320000000002s)]
*  Factotum, he plays them at that age. [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9439.28s)]
*  He's way too handsome. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9442.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but how dare he? [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9443.84s)]
*  He plays them good. [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9445.28s)]
*  How dare he? [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9446.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9446.800000000001s)]
*  He's way too handsome. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9447.2s)]
*  That's outrageous. [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9449.2s)]
*  Mickey Rourke made himself look fucked up. [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9450.960000000001s)]
*  A toast to all my friends. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9452.72s)]
*  You know, he like... [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9454.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9455.279999999999s)]
*  Chuck Bukowski is actually in Barfly. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9457.359999999999s)]
*  He's one of the one of the drugs in the bar. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9459.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9461.119999999999s)]
*  How women in the world aren't whore. [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9462.48s)]
*  Just mine. [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9465.279999999999s)]
*  You ever see one of those readings that he used to do? [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9468.88s)]
*  He used to do these readings he'd read from his books and people would yell and he fucking... [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9472.48s)]
*  You have hecklers and shit and yell out to them. [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9476.0s)]
*  He's just a guy just constantly drunk with profound... [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9479.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9483.519999999999s)]
*  When I started reading, I wanted to read books about authors that were from Los Angeles [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9485.519999999999s)]
*  like in the 40s and 50s. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9490.8s)]
*  And I said, I gotta find something that talks about these streets that I live in. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9493.359999999999s)]
*  And it was Chuck Bukowski. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9499.119999999999s)]
*  He writes about Los Angeles and I found out that his inspiration was a guy named... [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9500.96s)]
*  Man, what's his name? [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9507.119999999999s)]
*  He writes just like Chuck Bukowski. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9509.439999999999s)]
*  He wrote a book called Ask the Dust and the Adventures of Arturo Bandini. [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9512.88s)]
*  I'm lost here of his name but... [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9518.96s)]
*  John Fonte. [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9522.8s)]
*  Yes, John Fonte. [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9523.68s)]
*  John Fonte wrote books in the style of Chuck Bukowski and Chuck Bukowski, [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9525.199999999999s)]
*  when he found out about him, he helped him publish all his books again. [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9533.199999999999s)]
*  That's why I know that John Fonte exists because John Bukowski, [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9538.8s)]
*  he republished all his books for him when he was dying of diabetes. [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9542.16s)]
*  So Ask the Dust, bro, he talks about Los Angeles during 1932, bro, [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9546.24s)]
*  when Los Angeles had a metro rail and the 1932 earthquake in Los Angeles. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9551.439999999999s)]
*  It's all about this guy from Los Angeles. [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9560.56s)]
*  He talks about Armenians and working the docks in 1920s. [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9562.24s)]
*  That's a great catch. [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9569.119999999999s)]
*  I want to read that. [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9569.92s)]
*  And they're alcoholics, bro. [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9570.4s)]
*  This guy is an alcoholic and so was Chuck Bukowski. [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9571.6s)]
*  These are dudes that worked jobs and still were authors. [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9575.039999999999s)]
*  Imagine going from those guys to TikTokers at BOA. [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9578.4s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9583.6s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9585.439999999999s)]
*  These guys actually had jobs during the day. [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9586.88s)]
*  Chuck Bukowski, he worked at the post-op. [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9589.6s)]
*  He never worked, he never quit. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9591.76s)]
*  And Arturo Bandini, well, what's his name? [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9594.16s)]
*  The other guy, he started writing for Hollywood and he just disappeared. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9596.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah? [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9602.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9602.64s)]
*  Oh, like writing screenplays or something? [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9603.039999999999s)]
*  Writing screenplays, he got into under contract. [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9604.64s)]
*  Yeah, man, there's a lot of talented writers who just decide to write for a company. [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9606.56s)]
*  They just kind of like give up on the dream and do it for a job. [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9610.88s)]
*  Did you ever get hired to be a writer and then you said, this is not for me? [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9613.599999999999s)]
*  I got a book deal once and I gave them the money back because they had too much input. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9618.16s)]
*  They wanted to have too much input. [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9623.199999999999s)]
*  And then they wanted me to transcribe my standup. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9624.88s)]
*  That was one of their ideas. [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9627.44s)]
*  I'm like, that's a terrible idea. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9628.24s)]
*  They're like, George Carlin did it. [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9629.279999999999s)]
*  I'm like, well, that's fine. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9631.119999999999s)]
*  I love George Carlin, but so what? [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9632.96s)]
*  I'm not doing that. [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9634.8s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense to me. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9635.76s)]
*  Why would I want the worst version of what the ideas are, which is just print? [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9637.119999999999s)]
*  The best version is a live performed version. [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9642.48s)]
*  Second best version is a video. [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9645.52s)]
*  Worst for sure is print. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9647.44s)]
*  Audio is slightly better. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9649.279999999999s)]
*  But it's like, you don't want to do that. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9650.64s)]
*  Why would I do that? [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9651.92s)]
*  That's a dumb way to write a book. [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9652.64s)]
*  I just want to write about things that I'm thinking about. [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9653.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9655.44s)]
*  Why would you write your whole set list on a book? [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9655.6s)]
*  And then I realized if I'm going to write something, I have to want to. [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9657.52s)]
*  And it has to be something that I do because I'm controlling the entire thing. [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9660.4s)]
*  And then if they like it, they like it. [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9664.880000000001s)]
*  If they don't, they don't. [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9666.4s)]
*  But it's not something that I would ever want to have somebody help me out with. [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9667.52s)]
*  According to this article about him, part of the reason why he didn't explode when [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9672.48s)]
*  other writers did is because his publisher was in a legal battle for an unauthorized [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9676.32s)]
*  publication of Mein Kampf. [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9680.16s)]

*  Holy shit. [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9688.08s)]
*  Wow. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9691.119999999999s)]
*  The financial drain on the publisher hampered the distribution of Ask the Dust. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9692.16s)]
*  While Pham put out a short story collection, Dago read in 1940, [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9696.24s)]
*  more than a decade would pass before another Bandini novel. [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9700.48s)]
*  Wow. [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9703.76s)]
*  Yeah, he disappeared. [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9704.32s)]
*  He created a bunch of stories about this fake. [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9705.199999999999s)]
*  He used to live in Delta. [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9707.92s)]
*  He got in a legal battle with Adolf Hitler. [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9708.48s)]
*  His publisher did, but yeah. [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9711.52s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFJN50o9LM&t=9713.2s)]
