# Joe Rogan Experience #1943 - Joel Turner
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5.72s)]
*  What's up, Joel? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=14.0s)]
*  How are you? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=15.0s)]
*  Good to see you, brother. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=16.0s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=17.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me, man. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=18.0s)]
*  I'm very happy to talk to you because I think that what you teach applies to not just archery, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=19.0s)]
*  it applies to life, it applies to anxiety-filled situations, and you have figured out this [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=25.52s)]
*  one element of archery that so many people can't seem to put their finger on, and it's [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=33.12s)]
*  the anxiety of the shot. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=41.28s)]
*  You have figured this out in a way that is so useful and it's so repeatable, and I think [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=43.96s)]
*  it's so important. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=51.28s)]
*  I think a lot of people are going to go, you're going to just talk about archery shots? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=52.28s)]
*  I think this applies to life. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=57.28s)]
*  What you've done with your shot IQ system, and so let me explain to people that don't [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  understand this. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=66.4s)]
*  Bow hunting and archery, especially competitive archery, it oftentimes boils down to this [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=68.68s)]
*  one moment. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=75.32s)]
*  When you have one moment and there's so much anxiety on this one moment, people have a [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=77.32s)]
*  tendency to panic and to rush through things, and I think people have found that in life, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=83.16s)]
*  in many situations, in different occupations, in different practices and disciplines, this [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=88.6s)]
*  anticipation and anxiety of one moment where they lose their mind and they don't even remember [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=94.32s)]
*  what happened. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  It's like, oh, and they can't keep their shit together. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=99.39999999999999s)]
*  You have figured out a way to make a system where you have very clear, defined guidelines [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=103.14s)]
*  that people can follow where they could stay in the moment and not lose their fucking mind [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=111.08s)]
*  at this moment of anticipation. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=116.6s)]
*  I think the success speaks to itself. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=118.86s)]
*  Your son, who's an incredible archer, who's been taught by you, using your methods, is [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=122.02s)]
*  now, what is he number one in the world? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=127.02s)]
*  The ranking system is weird, but he's won every major indoor archery event that there [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=129.86s)]
*  is. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=137.18s)]
*  And he's 15. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=138.18s)]
*  Well, he just turned 16. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=139.18s)]
*  Oh, boy, he's old. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=140.18s)]
*  He's driving now, so that's scary as hell. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=141.18s)]
*  He won Vegas at 15. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=145.02s)]
*  He turned 15 the day before, and then he wins Vegas, which is the biggest indoor archery [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=147.72s)]
*  shoot there is. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=152.86s)]
*  It's huge. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=153.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=154.86s)]
*  I mean, to watch him up there is just amazing. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=155.88000000000002s)]
*  I can watch him, I'm like, oh, yeah, this is going in. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=159.8s)]
*  You can see it in their eye. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=163.68s)]
*  And I see this in a lot of people that they don't have that look. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=165.08s)]
*  They have that anxiety, that look. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=171.0s)]
*  It's like, oh, what's happening? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=173.16000000000003s)]
*  And they're just letting things happen. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  And with Bodhi, he's just like, this is going in. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=177.06s)]
*  It was so funny, because he just won Lancaster, the Lancaster Classic, which is another huge [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=179.84s)]
*  indoor archery shoot. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=184.70000000000002s)]
*  And when you shoot Lancaster, you're in the practice range. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=186.42000000000002s)]
*  And he came in first seed because he shot the second ever, well, there's been, I think, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=190.18s)]
*  five people now in history that have shot a, well, four people that have shot a 660 [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=195.26000000000002s)]
*  qualification round. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=199.82s)]
*  Now let's explain what that means. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=200.82s)]
*  That is hitting a penny every time, 60 arrows in a row. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=201.82s)]
*  Which is insane. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=207.18s)]
*  At 20 yards. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=208.18s)]
*  The amount of concentration involved in that. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=209.18s)]
*  And a lot of people are like, 20 yards is not that far. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=211.70000000000002s)]
*  Listen, you're shooting a penny and you're shooting it 60 times in a row. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=213.72s)]
*  Which is just the possibility of just a little fuck up. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=219.56s)]
*  And when you're at like number 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, and every one of them, flop, flop, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=224.39999999999998s)]
*  flop. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=232.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=233.79999999999998s)]
*  So he shoots his 660. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  So he shot one last year, 660 last year. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=236.2s)]
*  So he was the third one in history to do it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=238.44s)]
*  And then this year he did it again. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=240.16s)]
*  So now he's the first person in history to shoot two 660s back to back. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=242.04s)]
*  So then he comes in the elimination rounds, wins those, and so he comes in first seed [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=246.38s)]
*  for the big shoot off. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=252.34s)]
*  Which is you're up on a stage and it's just you, it's head to head. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=253.34s)]
*  So it's you and another person. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=256.65999999999997s)]
*  And when you start, you come in first seed, the person that's in front of you that maybe [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=258.74s)]
*  came in fourth, fifth, sixth, whatever, they get to shoot out on the stage against somebody. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=263.74s)]
*  So they actually get to zero their bow. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=269.65999999999997s)]
*  Because the lighting's different and it's huge. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=271.7s)]
*  I mean, you're trying to hit this penny. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=273.32s)]
*  And then they have a 12 ring that's the size of their arrow. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=275.2s)]
*  Basically it's like 27 diameter, 27, 64th diameter. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=278.92s)]
*  It's no bigger than their arrow. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=283.08s)]
*  That's off to the side. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=284.36s)]
*  And it's down below. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=285.36s)]
*  So if you miss that, you get a seven or an eight and you're out. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=286.48s)]
*  You're done at that point. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=290.0s)]
*  So he comes in first seed and he misses the X on a couple of them. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=291.12s)]
*  And then the other person misses the X. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=298.4s)]
*  And it's funny because you can see him, he's up there and he always clicks his sight. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=300.53999999999996s)]
*  And I'm like, how many clicks was that? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=304.14s)]
*  He's like, it was just enough. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=305.97999999999996s)]
*  I mean, he's like, you can't even tell what he does. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=307.38s)]
*  So he's adjusting to the lighting. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=311.18s)]
*  And so he comes and he shoots those two 10s, not a X. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=316.02s)]
*  And then he starts, then he hits an inside out and he looks, he turns, I'm in the coach's [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=320.65999999999997s)]
*  box behind him. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=326.21999999999997s)]
*  He turns me and goes, it's sighted in now. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=327.21999999999997s)]
*  And I'm like, sweep the leg, boy. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=329.9s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=331.56s)]
*  That's what I always tell him. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=332.56s)]
*  Sweep the leg. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=334.15999999999997s)]
*  And it was just donut after donut after that. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=335.15999999999997s)]
*  And then the other guy caught up, shot a 12 to catch him. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=337.03999999999996s)]
*  And so now they got three arrow shoot off. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=340.84s)]
*  And the first arrow is for score and they have that 12 ring. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=343.32s)]
*  And Bodhi is sitting there listening to the guy. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=347.52s)]
*  And Bodhi's got his stabilizer because everybody usually steps, there's a red button on the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=349.96s)]
*  stage. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=353.35999999999996s)]
*  If you hit that red button, then it's a 12. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=354.35999999999996s)]
*  Then you got to shoot for the 12. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=357.84s)]
*  He hits the red button, but he hits it with a stabilizer. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=359.74s)]
*  So the guy's explaining the shoot off and Bodhi's just hovering his stabilizer over, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=361.86s)]
*  just looking at the guy. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=364.94s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=365.94s)]
*  And he's like, are you done yet? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=366.94s)]
*  Are you done yet? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=367.94s)]
*  And finally just, and he hits that red button with a stabilized and then just shoot to 12. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=368.94s)]
*  And the other guy missed the 12. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=373.09999999999997s)]
*  So it was pretty cool. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=374.34s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=375.34s)]
*  Yeah, it was awesome to see. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=376.34s)]
*  Tell everybody your background. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=377.34s)]
*  How did you get into this? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=378.91999999999996s)]
*  Tell your background with SWAT and all that. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=381.3s)]
*  So I started shooting at a really young age, but I was obsessed with shooting. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=384.79999999999995s)]
*  When we, I have two older brothers, and when we turned nine years old, my dad would buy [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=390.03999999999996s)]
*  us a BB gun. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=393.84s)]
*  And my two older brothers didn't shoot them that much. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=395.67999999999995s)]
*  I broke both of their BB guns. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=397.64s)]
*  I shot them so much. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=399.23999999999995s)]
*  So when I turned nine, I got a daisy 880 power line. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=400.71999999999997s)]
*  By God, that is some highfalutin stuff for me. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=403.96s)]
*  So I get this 880 power line. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=406.91999999999996s)]
*  I shot it so much, I broke it. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=408.23999999999995s)]
*  Air rifles, 22 long rifles. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=410.47999999999996s)]
*  I was good, right? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=413.47999999999996s)]
*  You put me on a center fire rifle like my dad did when I was five years old shooting [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=414.9s)]
*  a 30-30. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=418.28s)]
*  I was worthless. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=419.96s)]
*  As soon as you get your sight on, man, I would just hammer the crap out of that trigger. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=421.12s)]
*  And that followed me through adolescence, early teens, twenties, right? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=426.96s)]
*  So we should explain that hammering is like you're jerking the trigger. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=432.08s)]
*  You're jerking the trigger, which- Anxiety. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=435.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=437.96s)]
*  So now I know that that's the core problem in shooting, right? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=438.96s)]
*  Your mind will not allow you to cause your body impact as a surprise. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=442.06s)]
*  And it took me a lifetime to figure out what the true problem was. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=446.34000000000003s)]
*  And that's where everybody's kind of skipped around it. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=451.14000000000004s)]
*  So there I am at five years old shooting this 30-30. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=452.82s)]
*  Oh, I pressed the trigger perfectly one time. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=454.98s)]
*  And as soon as I felt that recoil the second time, when I racked that lever and I shot [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=458.34000000000003s)]
*  it the second time, I guarantee you I closed my eyes, clenched my body as I pressed the [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=462.54s)]
*  trigger. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=467.98s)]
*  So you're worried about the recoil. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=468.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=469.98s)]
*  It all gets linked together. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=470.98s)]
*  It's smoke, fire, noise, all kinds of negative things that happen, right? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=472.92s)]
*  And I was experiencing the same thing in archery. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=476.16s)]
*  I started shooting a bow when I was seven. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=478.88s)]
*  And by the age of eight, I'm locked completely off a target, meaning I would draw the bow [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=481.12s)]
*  back and the targets level with me and I'm aiming at the floor, right? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=486.0s)]
*  And then you would jump that thing up as we see many archers do now. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=491.66s)]
*  They're locked off target. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=495.20000000000005s)]
*  They jump up and let the string go at the same time. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=496.20000000000005s)]
*  It all gets linked together so that your body can brace you for impact. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=498.68s)]
*  And people don't see archery as an explosion. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=502.74s)]
*  They see it as, well, it's just shooting a bow, right? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=505.1s)]
*  But shot anticipation or shot control is a lot easier with a firearm because the explosion [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=507.7s)]
*  happens in the apparatus. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=513.7s)]
*  It imparts recoil on you, but it's not actually the explosion is in the apparatus, whereas [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=515.7s)]
*  in archery, the explosion is in your body, right? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=521.0600000000001s)]
*  It's that sudden release of energy that happens. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=524.1800000000001s)]
*  Shot anticipation with archery is a hundredfold what it is with a firearm. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=527.08s)]
*  Well, it's also the amount of movement changes so much where the arrow goes because it's [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=530.4399999999999s)]
*  not going as fast and it's subject to all your little tweaks. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=536.68s)]
*  All the little nuances of it. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=540.56s)]
*  So all those motor programs that get linked to that punching of the trigger, that's what [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=541.88s)]
*  deviates our point of impact. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=546.72s)]
*  So there I was at eight years old just loving archery, watching that arrow fly, but not [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=548.4s)]
*  good at it, right? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=553.38s)]
*  So then I started bow hunting at 14 years old and not doing well. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=555.58s)]
*  I was locked off target on these critters and missing and missing and missing. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=560.38s)]
*  It took me 13 years to kill a bull elk with my bow because I couldn't handle it. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=564.02s)]
*  I just would lose my shit completely. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=569.42s)]
*  Like many, many, many people. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=572.34s)]
*  It was horrible. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=574.14s)]
*  So that was my background. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=575.14s)]
*  So I've got this sounding board of bow hunting where I'm failing. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=576.86s)]
*  I've got rifle hunting where I'm failing. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=580.64s)]
*  And then I decided to become a cop. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=583.92s)]
*  Right? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=585.44s)]
*  Well, before I was a cop, I was a wildlife specialist for USDA Wildlife Services where [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=586.44s)]
*  I got to shoot stuff every day. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=591.08s)]
*  Right? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=592.68s)]
*  Animal damage control, all that stuff. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=593.68s)]
*  And I got to shoot stuff every day with an air rifle. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=595.72s)]
*  So I was good, right? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=598.8s)]
*  And shotgun shooting. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=600.32s)]
*  Good at that, right? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=601.92s)]
*  But when it came to precision rifle stuff, again, I was worthless. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=603.5600000000001s)]
*  I was not your guy to be on a coyote contract when you're having to shoot coyotes in the [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=607.3s)]
*  middle of a city with a suppressed 243. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=611.26s)]
*  Right? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=613.4599999999999s)]
*  It just wouldn't work out for me because as soon as I would get on that thing, my only [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=614.4599999999999s)]
*  thought process was it's going to get away. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=619.06s)]
*  It's going to get away. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=621.1s)]
*  So that would cause that anxiety, that rush, and you would rush the shot. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=622.3399999999999s)]
*  So there I was. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=627.42s)]
*  Then I decided to become a cop. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=628.6999999999999s)]
*  My older brother was a cop. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=630.26s)]
*  My mom was in law enforcement. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=631.54s)]
*  So I decided to be a cop. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=633.02s)]
*  At the range, I knew that when I turned 21, the first thing I did was bought my concealed [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=636.24s)]
*  weapons permit in Washington, bought a pistol. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=643.04s)]
*  And for some reason, that pistol always shot low and left. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=646.0s)]
*  I'm like, what does it deal with these sights? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=648.32s)]
*  Right? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=650.4399999999999s)]
*  It's always shooting low and left. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=651.4399999999999s)]
*  So I get in the academy and I bought a different pistol. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=652.64s)]
*  I bought a 1911 that's got a much shorter trigger stroke on it. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=656.48s)]
*  And I basically fixed a mental problem with mechanical means at that point because I got [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=660.48s)]
*  through the academy, starting to realize what I needed to do to control a shot. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=664.52s)]
*  But with that pistol, it was easy. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=669.42s)]
*  And my buddy was so bad in the academy with his Glock that he had to then, he bought my [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=671.46s)]
*  pistol from me because that's the only thing that got him through the academy was buying [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=677.66s)]
*  my pistol from me. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=681.18s)]
*  I bought another one. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=682.18s)]
*  So we both fixed our mental problem with mechanical means. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=683.18s)]
*  And I ended up taking first in firearms in my academy class, not knowing how I did it. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=687.14s)]
*  That's where I started to feel this love for instruction because I got to help some people [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=694.64s)]
*  with it. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=699.2s)]
*  And so things progressed. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=700.8000000000001s)]
*  Two years in law enforcement. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=702.8000000000001s)]
*  Then I got firearms instructor because I had this interest in firearms and kind of figuring [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=704.24s)]
*  things out. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=709.84s)]
*  And then I got on the SWAT team same time, 2003. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=711.24s)]
*  So that's, you know, I spent 18 plus years on the SWAT team and ended up being the sniper [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=715.12s)]
*  team leader and then eventually the team leader for the team. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=721.8199999999999s)]
*  But it was becoming the lead firearms instructor for Washington State that got me the experimentation [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=725.66s)]
*  that I needed because I was starting to figure out how do I get somebody through a shot? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=731.14s)]
*  How do I get a police officer to concentrate on a trigger press when it's the only thing [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=735.8199999999999s)]
*  that's going to save them or somebody else? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=742.14s)]
*  And it came to me one day, it was just totally by accident because I'd heard all the normal [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=745.02s)]
*  stuff in firearms instruction. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=750.24s)]
*  Front sight, front sight, front sight. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=751.64s)]
*  You know, you stare at your front sight hard enough and things are just going to work out [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=753.52s)]
*  for you. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=756.52s)]
*  Well, that just doesn't happen because in most gunfights, most people will tell you [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=757.52s)]
*  they never even see their sights. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=760.6800000000001s)]
*  So I had this recruit that we call, we had one in every class, we call him nervous Nellie. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=762.64s)]
*  Right? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=768.76s)]
*  I mean, this guy was just super anxious and you can tell the different personalities that [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=769.76s)]
*  people have. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=773.5600000000001s)]
*  Just when you put a gun in their hand, they're nervous and this cat, all these movements [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=774.82s)]
*  were super fast and he was just a jittery dude, right? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=779.0799999999999s)]
*  Nervous Nellie. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=781.8399999999999s)]
*  And he's shooting 20 yards and he's bouncing bullets off the floor at 15. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=784.0799999999999s)]
*  So his rounds are hitting the 15 yard line. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=790.0s)]
*  And I'm like, oh my God, you know, it doesn't put a lot of confidence in the police force. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=792.88s)]
*  So I go over to this kid, I call him a kid, he was probably, I don't know, eight years [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=798.64s)]
*  younger than me or whatever. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=802.88s)]
*  And I get on the driver's side of his pistol, I'm looking at his finger, I'm like, okay, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=804.8399999999999s)]
*  I want you to press the trigger just to the pressure wall. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=809.26s)]
*  Don't make it go off. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=812.9s)]
*  He's like, okay, yes, sir. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=813.9s)]
*  And as soon as I got done with that instruction, his finger moved, right, to the pressure wall. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=816.0999999999999s)]
*  I'm like, okay, start pressing the trigger, but don't make the gun go off. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=820.66s)]
*  And so as soon as I saw his finger move, I start talking to him. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=826.4599999999999s)]
*  All right, keep pressing, keep pressing, keep pressing, keep pressing. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=829.8199999999999s)]
*  And as I'm watching his finger, I'm looking at this, I'm like, it's moving at the same [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=833.74s)]
*  rate I'm talking. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=839.6800000000001s)]
*  And he's working through it. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=841.84s)]
*  And all of a sudden, bow, it goes off to the surprise right through the 10 ring and the [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=842.96s)]
*  target. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=846.96s)]
*  He's like, sir, that scared the crap out of me. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=847.96s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, it's supposed to. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=849.88s)]
*  So then the next time he shoots again, and I changed my cadence of speech, which changed [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=852.38s)]
*  his cadence of movement. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=857.36s)]
*  And that's when the light bulb went off for me. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=859.4s)]
*  I'm like, okay, we got to figure this out. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=861.2s)]
*  I had complete control of this kid's mind at this time. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=863.34s)]
*  But I had to get him to do that. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=867.58s)]
*  And that's where this whole thing started into neuro-linguistic programming and all [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=869.58s)]
*  the sciences that we went down the rabbit holes on to really figure this stuff out. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=873.94s)]
*  And so what did you learn from neuro-linguistic programming that applied? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=878.62s)]
*  Because I didn't know what that was. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=884.0600000000001s)]
*  I'm just a simple guy, right? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=886.98s)]
*  Can we get coffee in here? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=888.46s)]
*  I didn't know what that was. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=890.76s)]
*  So I have lots of very smart friends. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=894.04s)]
*  And so one of the doctors that was on a sniper crew for a neighboring agency, he was their [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=896.98s)]
*  ER doc, because most SWAT teams have an ER doc that's assigned to the team. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=904.0799999999999s)]
*  And so I'm training him in some of this stuff. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=910.2199999999999s)]
*  He's like, oh, that's neuro-linguistic programming. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=913.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm like, standby doc. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=915.36s)]
*  That's a big word, right? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=917.64s)]
*  I got to know what that is. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=918.64s)]
*  And so I started looking into that. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=919.74s)]
*  And it was mostly like Tony Robbins, self-help, get yourself out of addiction, get yourself [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=921.54s)]
*  out of the gutter type stuff. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=927.46s)]
*  But what I took it as is it was the route to concentration. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=929.38s)]
*  Because what you say is what you think. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=933.46s)]
*  And I needed people to think and to concentrate on a specific movement. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=936.1999999999999s)]
*  And what I'm asking people to do is just shy of impossible. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=940.58s)]
*  I'm asking you to override your own central nervous system with concentration. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=948.54s)]
*  That is just shy of impossible. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=953.3s)]
*  But it's not impossible if you know exactly how to do it. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=955.66s)]
*  But when I ask that question of all the people that I train, it's like, how do you concentrate? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=958.54s)]
*  And nobody has the answer. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=964.5s)]
*  They tell me, well, you have to focus. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=966.22s)]
*  You have to block things out. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=967.8199999999999s)]
*  You have to do this, do that. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=969.06s)]
*  They never tell me how to do it. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=970.9399999999999s)]
*  I'm like, yes, that is concentration for you. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=972.42s)]
*  But how do you do it? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=975.8s)]
*  Especially how do you do it when somebody's trying to kill you? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=976.92s)]
*  How do you get that singular minded? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=980.72s)]
*  And that was the big question. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=983.56s)]
*  So that's what I took from NeuroLinguistic Programming. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=984.8s)]
*  And so I wrote what is called the Mental Mechanics and Instructor's Guide. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=988.9599999999999s)]
*  And it had kind of the sequence of drills and how to get somebody's mind into this. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=992.84s)]
*  And there was a guy at the academy that we did not like each other. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=997.8s)]
*  And for some reason, he was a kinesiologist almost. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1002.74s)]
*  He was a big martial arts guy, knew movements, knew how to train movements. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1007.6600000000001s)]
*  And he came to me one day when he became the head of the firearms program. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1012.86s)]
*  He came to me one day and said, what you're doing works, but it's not right. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1019.38s)]
*  I'm like, OK, I need to know what's right then. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1024.02s)]
*  So he goes, you got to take my class. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1027.9s)]
*  I'm like, OK, sign me up. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1029.3s)]
*  So in that class is where I learned about open and closed loop control systems. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1032.02s)]
*  I learned about visual proprioception, how you actually aim and how you don't have to [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1036.32s)]
*  put consciousness into an aim. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1040.68s)]
*  Let's explain open and closed loop systems. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1043.8s)]
*  So open and closed loop. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1047.12s)]
*  So open loop is where that's a control system in your mind that governs your movements. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1049.04s)]
*  And open loop is where your mind wants to go because it's efficient, it's smooth, it's [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1055.6399999999999s)]
*  automatic. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1060.44s)]
*  So when you first learn a movement, you may learn it in steps. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1061.44s)]
*  And it's very choppy. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1065.8600000000001s)]
*  And you have to think about each specific motor program that you're doing. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1066.8600000000001s)]
*  But then you eventually put that into a package through practice. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1071.14s)]
*  So we go from the cognitive stage of learning to practice stage with the goal of becoming [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1074.5800000000002s)]
*  automatic. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1079.46s)]
*  And that's where people, they do the same thing with shooting. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1080.78s)]
*  But in shooting, the only thing you're getting more efficient at is bracing you for recoil. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1084.52s)]
*  You're not getting more accurate. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1088.98s)]
*  I mean, there's 80 year old dudes that come to my class that have been doing it this way [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1090.8s)]
*  for 70 years, and they just get worse. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1095.76s)]
*  Right? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1100.24s)]
*  Archery is one of the only, shooting is one of the only things, the more you do it, the [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1101.24s)]
*  worse you get, especially in archery. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1104.32s)]
*  If you're doing it wrong. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1106.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1107.72s)]
*  If you just follow the natural path of the human mind and learning, you're going to get [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1108.72s)]
*  worse because you're going to get more efficient. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1112.72s)]
*  Your subconscious thinks you're getting better because you're getting better at bracing for [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1115.22s)]
*  impact. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1118.8799999999999s)]
*  That's what you're built for. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1119.88s)]
*  But consciously, we know like, I didn't control that one. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1121.42s)]
*  And then it's like, well, I control about 50% of them. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1125.22s)]
*  Right? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1127.6200000000001s)]
*  And then it just gets worse and worse. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1128.6200000000001s)]
*  So your mind open loop means your brain, and Huberman's going to kill me for this because [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1129.6200000000001s)]
*  this is so simplistic. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1135.14s)]
*  I'm sure he gets way into this. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1137.22s)]
*  But open loop is your brain sends a motor program to the effector. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1139.0200000000002s)]
*  The effector is just the muscle group that receives it. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1143.7800000000002s)]
*  So in that, the motor program is usually too fast for you to gain feedback in it. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1146.72s)]
*  Like shooting a basketball, swinging a golf club. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1152.9s)]
*  Those are all movements that have to be smooth to keep the totality of the movement going. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1156.9s)]
*  But in shooting, if you use open loop for the trigger, it's too fast and you're not [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1162.94s)]
*  doing anything to mitigate all the other muscle contractions that are coming in to brace you [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1169.34s)]
*  for impact. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1174.28s)]
*  Right? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1175.28s)]
*  All that stuff that gets put in there. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1176.54s)]
*  And so that's open loop. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1179.1399999999999s)]
*  That's where your mind wants to go. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1180.8799999999999s)]
*  It's the default. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1182.28s)]
*  If you don't think about something, you're going open loop. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1183.28s)]
*  Like when people black out and stuff, they go super efficient on the trigger. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1186.22s)]
*  They don't remember what happened because it was a negative event and it was all subconsciously [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1189.72s)]
*  driven. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1194.02s)]
*  Now, closed loop is a movement that's slow enough you could stop it anywhere within it. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1195.02s)]
*  Right? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1200.7s)]
*  There's a certain speed at which you can gain the feedback that you need to. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1201.7s)]
*  Say like in the signature test or if you're pressing a trigger, right? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1205.36s)]
*  Or if you're working your hinge, you're working that thing slow enough and you're concentrating [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1208.8s)]
*  on the movement and you're working it slow enough, you could stop it anywhere within it. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1213.24s)]
*  And that just doesn't happen. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1217.74s)]
*  It has to be decided upon. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1220.36s)]
*  Right? [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1222.04s)]
*  And that's the big kicker. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1223.04s)]
*  That's where people try to jump over the problem because you have to decide if you're doing [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1224.04s)]
*  a movement that's going to cause an explosion and you're trying to do it slow enough you [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1230.58s)]
*  could stop it, that will never just find you. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1235.04s)]
*  You have to concentrate on that movement. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1238.6799999999998s)]
*  So you got to know how do you concentrate. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1240.9399999999998s)]
*  Right? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1243.0s)]
*  Well, you got to talk yourself through it and you got to know what decisions you need [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1244.0s)]
*  to make at what moments in the shot because there are moments in the shot when autopilot [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1247.4399999999998s)]
*  is going to try to take it. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1252.52s)]
*  Right? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1253.8799999999999s)]
*  And that's what happened to me for 13 years in my bow hunting career from 14 to 27. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1254.8799999999999s)]
*  I was going completely automatic. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1260.56s)]
*  Right? [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1262.58s)]
*  I was so engulfed in trying to kill that critter or aiming good or whatever it may be, my mind [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1263.58s)]
*  was never in the movement that it needed to be. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1271.4199999999998s)]
*  So that's the difference between open and closed loop. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1275.1799999999998s)]
*  And when that guy told me what you're doing works but it's not right, he taught me about [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1277.34s)]
*  open and closed loop control systems but what he never taught me and what I noticed from [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1282.1s)]
*  all the textbooks and all the stuff that we did, it had never really been put into shooting. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1287.12s)]
*  It had never truly been put into shooting. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1294.0s)]
*  So he kept asking me, what's this decision you keep talking about? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1296.1599999999999s)]
*  What's this decision? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1298.84s)]
*  I said, well, you have to decide to go closed loop. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1299.84s)]
*  It's not just going to happen. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1302.56s)]
*  He's like, I don't think so. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1303.7199999999998s)]
*  I'm like, let's go to the range. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1305.1999999999998s)]
*  Right? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1306.4399999999998s)]
*  So we go to the range and he did the same thing that everybody else did. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1307.4399999999998s)]
*  He couldn't get himself to go closed loop because he just kept trying to do it. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1310.24s)]
*  And he understood this. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1315.48s)]
*  He understood it but he didn't understand the mental portion of it. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1316.84s)]
*  Because everything that he'd ever taught was basically closed loop to start with because [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1320.76s)]
*  it's always martial arts movements. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1325.28s)]
*  It was always closed loop to start and then you move into open loop and that's the good [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1326.6399999999999s)]
*  stuff. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1331.24s)]
*  Right? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1332.24s)]
*  Whereas in shooting, that's why we use shooting for such concentration practice because there's [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1333.24s)]
*  nothing like it. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1337.32s)]
*  There's really nothing like it. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1338.6s)]
*  I'm glad you brought up martial arts because martial arts is closed loop when you're learning [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1340.2s)]
*  it. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1344.36s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1345.36s)]
*  It's an application. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1346.3799999999999s)]
*  So you learn all these movements and then in the fight, things just happen. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1347.3799999999999s)]
*  You just throw the kick and you don't even know what's happening. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1352.82s)]
*  It's happening and you're staying in this sort of empty Zen mind space where you're [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1355.2199999999998s)]
*  just trying to utilize the techniques and know you know what to do. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1361.6999999999998s)]
*  Your body's trained and then you react and you move accordingly. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1366.3799999999999s)]
*  But the problem with that is that is the worst mindset possible for bow hunting. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1370.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1374.6999999999998s)]
*  Which is crazy. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1375.8400000000001s)]
*  It's completely opposite. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1376.8400000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1378.32s)]
*  Now getting yourself to concentrate, and martial arts has used mantras for thousands of years. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1379.32s)]
*  Right? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1384.68s)]
*  This sound means this. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1385.68s)]
*  This sound increases power. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1386.68s)]
*  Whatever it does. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1388.0s)]
*  So you are talking yourself through it but when it comes to the actual application of [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1389.0s)]
*  the action like you're talking, you can't get conscious with it. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1393.64s)]
*  You have to keep your conscious mind out of it. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1397.64s)]
*  Like it's the science of choking. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1400.56s)]
*  So the basketball player, he's shooting a free throw and he's got this routine. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1403.26s)]
*  Right? [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1408.14s)]
*  He spins the ball, bounces it three times, shakes his ass a little bit and then he shoots. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1409.14s)]
*  Right? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1413.34s)]
*  Well then it comes to the game winner. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1414.34s)]
*  He bounces, spins the ball, he bounces it three times, shakes his butt. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1416.2s)]
*  Okay, I got to break the wrist perfectly. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1419.46s)]
*  And so he adds consciousness to a movement that should be open loop and that's why they [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1422.16s)]
*  miss the game winner. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1426.94s)]
*  Right? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1428.38s)]
*  So when Cody's shooting the 60th arrow for his 660, that's where most people screw up [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1429.38s)]
*  because they change their thought process. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1435.48s)]
*  Right? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1438.0s)]
*  Well, with shooting and what we teach, it's how do you stay in that shot process no matter [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1439.0s)]
*  what. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1445.0800000000002s)]
*  Right? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1446.0800000000002s)]
*  So... [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1447.0800000000002s)]
*  It applies to so many things. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1448.0800000000002s)]
*  It does. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1449.4s)]
*  It really applies to pool. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1450.4s)]
*  In a huge way. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1452.24s)]
*  You know, I play pool a lot and there are shots that are difficult shots and they're [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1453.24s)]
*  game winning shots and you have to stay in that moment. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1459.02s)]
*  You can't go, I hope I don't miss. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1464.54s)]
*  If you say, I hope I don't miss, you miss every fucking time. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1467.06s)]
*  You have to stay in the movement and you have to do exactly what you teach with archery. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1470.74s)]
*  You have to say, here I go. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1475.9s)]
*  You have to do your warm up strokes. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1477.62s)]
*  You have to make sure the shaft is going in a direction that you want the cue ball to [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1479.26s)]
*  travel and then you have to go, here I go and release. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1484.1s)]
*  And you have to know that you're shooting a perfect shot. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1488.08s)]
*  And you could still miss because it's fucking hard. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1490.92s)]
*  But at least you're missing the right way. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1494.16s)]
*  And the problem is, like with me, on this journey, 2008, I shot the first controlled [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1497.2s)]
*  shot I'd really ever shot on a game animal. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1504.6s)]
*  But I didn't blueprint it. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1507.6399999999999s)]
*  And that's the problem. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1510.56s)]
*  How so? [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1511.56s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1512.56s)]
*  People have success. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1513.56s)]
*  They won the game with that shot, but they don't blueprint how they did it. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1515.3799999999999s)]
*  So they can't possibly repeat it. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1520.12s)]
*  It's a mystery. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1521.6599999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1522.6599999999999s)]
*  So in 2008, I shot this big old hog and I shot, I'm like, oh, yay me. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1523.6599999999999s)]
*  I finally controlled myself on a shot, but I never blueprinted it. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1528.3s)]
*  So 2009 comes along. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1533.26s)]
*  I shot a couple bulls in 2009, one in New Mexico, one in Arizona, punched the crap out [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1535.6999999999998s)]
*  of the trigger on both those bulls. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1540.34s)]
*  But I was successful, right? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1542.9399999999998s)]
*  2010 comes along. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1545.12s)]
*  I shot my first controlled shot on an elk with my longbow, 41 yards with my longbow. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1546.8799999999999s)]
*  It was the most gorgeous arrow flight. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1551.84s)]
*  I mean, it was perfect, but I never blueprinted it. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1554.56s)]
*  It was just another yay me moment, right? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1558.04s)]
*  So 2011, 12, 13, and 14 come along. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1560.6799999999998s)]
*  And I killed a bunch of critters in that timeframe, but I wasn't controlling my shot still. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1565.56s)]
*  But I was at least present enough to be aiming and all those things, but I still wasn't getting [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1571.7s)]
*  through my shot, essentially punching the trigger. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1576.16s)]
*  So December 14th, 2014 was my big, that was, I shot a big black tail buck and I didn't [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1579.04s)]
*  control my shot. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1586.54s)]
*  I shot him at eight yards, shot him right in the heart and it was raining and it was [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1587.54s)]
*  right before dark. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1591.1200000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, I was happy that I shot the buck good, but I was pissed because I didn't [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1592.64s)]
*  control my shot again. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1600.1200000000001s)]
*  And realized that by this time, I'd been a SWAT sniper since 2003, right? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1601.26s)]
*  Scared to death. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1607.38s)]
*  Scared to death on how it was going to go because all that time between 2003 and 2014, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1609.02s)]
*  thank God I didn't get in any tactical situations where I had to actually press a trigger because [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1616.98s)]
*  it would have been just like a coyote. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1622.22s)]
*  I guarantee you it would have been just like a coyote. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1623.82s)]
*  And that's where a lot of cops are these days. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1625.9s)]
*  They don't know what's coming and they don't know how to control themselves at this moment [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1628.18s)]
*  of truth. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1633.0s)]
*  So I've got this sounding board of bow hunting where I'm still, some are good, some are not [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1634.1200000000001s)]
*  good. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1639.96s)]
*  It's still a mystery to me because I never blueprinted it, right? [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1640.96s)]
*  So December 14th, 2014, I shot that buck and I was pissed and I sat in my tree stand. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1644.0800000000002s)]
*  Now it's dark and it's raining. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1650.24s)]
*  I'm like, I got to figure this out, right? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1651.64s)]
*  Because it's just a ticking time bomb in the tactical world for me to be in a tactical [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1653.96s)]
*  situation. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1658.66s)]
*  So I sat there in that tree stand like, what was it about that shot in 2008? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1660.22s)]
*  And what was it about that shot in 2010 when I actually controlled myself? [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1665.22s)]
*  And I was so conscious in those two shots that I'm like, it was the decisions. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1669.74s)]
*  It was the decisions that I made. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1676.42s)]
*  Because I remember on the hog in 2008, I drew back and I had the same anxiety and all [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1678.54s)]
*  the craziness going on. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1684.22s)]
*  It was the same feeling of weakness that I wasn't going to perform well, but I was at [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1686.7s)]
*  full draw. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1690.7s)]
*  Now I'm locked off target, which hadn't happened in a long time. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1691.7s)]
*  But I was so conscious in that shot for some reason, I don't know if I was pissed off or [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1695.18s)]
*  what it was, but I went, I ain't doing this again. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1700.1s)]
*  And I let that shot down. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1703.44s)]
*  And the next time I drew my bow back, I'm like, I'm shooting the shot perfectly or I'm [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1704.86s)]
*  not shooting it at all. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1710.1999999999998s)]
*  And that was the first time that it ever meant more to me to stay in the shot process than [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1711.78s)]
*  it actually killed the critter. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1717.3799999999999s)]
*  And that was a huge thing for me. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1719.4199999999998s)]
*  But again, I never blueprint it. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1720.9799999999998s)]
*  And then I remember on that hog, so the second time I drew my bow back, before I drew my [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1722.3799999999999s)]
*  bow back, I said, I'm shooting this shot perfectly or I'm not shooting it at all. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1726.6599999999999s)]
*  And I started to draw my bow back. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1731.34s)]
*  And as I drew my bow back, I felt it slipping again. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1732.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1735.22s)]
*  I said, nah, I'm going to do this right. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1736.22s)]
*  That was another decision that I made, which up my presence. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1738.18s)]
*  Didn't know that at the time that up my presence. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1741.94s)]
*  So I got the full draw. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1743.6200000000001s)]
*  Now I'm aimed exactly where I need to aim. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1745.52s)]
*  All I gotta do is let the arrow go. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1747.26s)]
*  It's aimed perfectly. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1748.6000000000001s)]
*  All I gotta do is let the arrow go. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1749.6000000000001s)]
*  But because I'd up my presence so much, I remembered, oh yeah, stupid, you got to pull [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1751.5s)]
*  through the clicker. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1757.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1758.0s)]
*  So I got a little clicker device on my longbow, which when you expand through that, it clicks, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1759.32s)]
*  mechanoreceptive trigger, all that stuff. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1764.4s)]
*  So I'm at full draw. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1766.76s)]
*  Here I go. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1770.06s)]
*  That was the first time I'd ever said, here I go, in a shot. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1771.06s)]
*  I said, here I go. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1774.44s)]
*  And that reminded me, oh yeah, I'm supposed to talk myself through this. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1776.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1779.54s)]
*  This is 2008. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1780.54s)]
*  So I was starting to figure some stuff out in the firearms world. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1781.54s)]
*  Keep pulling, keep pulling, keep pulling, keep pulling. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1783.78s)]
*  Click, boom, I shot that shot. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1787.08s)]
*  It was perfect. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1788.54s)]
*  But again, like I said, never blueprinted it. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1789.54s)]
*  2010 comes along, same thing. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1791.84s)]
*  I'm behind this screen of pines. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1794.7s)]
*  There was a hole. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1796.32s)]
*  This bull comes down, water hole, turns broadside, looks the other way. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1797.32s)]
*  My buddy gives me numbers. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1800.6399999999999s)]
*  He says 41. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1801.96s)]
*  I'm like, at 41, I know I gotta put my point 18 inches over that bull's back. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1802.96s)]
*  And so I remember I'm on my knees. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1808.32s)]
*  I'm like, I'm shooting this shot perfectly or I ain't gonna shoot it at all. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1810.44s)]
*  Up my presence. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1815.36s)]
*  Made that decision. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1816.36s)]
*  The original decision. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1817.36s)]
*  Started drawing my bow back. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1818.36s)]
*  Felt it slipping again, right? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1820.32s)]
*  And you know that feeling where it starts to go. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1821.74s)]
*  You're like, nah. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1823.6s)]
*  I'm like, nah, I'm gonna do this right. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1824.6s)]
*  I got the full draw. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1826.52s)]
*  I put that point 18 inches over his back. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1827.52s)]
*  Here I go. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1829.8999999999999s)]
*  Keep pulling, keep pulling, keep pulling. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1830.8999999999999s)]
*  Click, boom, I shot that arrow. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1833.1599999999999s)]
*  I can see it to this day. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1834.6s)]
*  It was just gorgeous. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1835.6s)]
*  I mean, I X-ringed him at 41 yards with my long bow. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1836.6s)]
*  It was so cool. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1839.1999999999998s)]
*  But again, I didn't blueprint it. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1840.8s)]
*  So sitting in that tree stand in December of 2014, that's when I said, I gotta figure [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1841.92s)]
*  this out. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1849.76s)]
*  And that's what I figured out was the decisions. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1850.76s)]
*  I mapped the decisions it took to keep myself present so that I could concentrate. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1852.8000000000002s)]
*  And that day I said, I'm never doing it again. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1860.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm never shooting another uncontrolled shot on a critter or whatever it was. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1862.9s)]
*  You know, I'm still a cop at that point. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1867.88s)]
*  I'm like, I'm gonna do it right no matter what. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1869.32s)]
*  No matter what. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1872.6799999999998s)]
*  And so what was the process of figuring out a repeatable blueprint? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1873.6799999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1878.8799999999999s)]
*  The blueprint was, so I started thinking about this so that I could actually blueprint these [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1880.1599999999999s)]
*  things. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1884.84s)]
*  I'm like, okay, what is it? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1885.84s)]
*  The blueprint is this. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1887.6399999999999s)]
*  It's four questions. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1888.6399999999999s)]
*  So when you shoot that perfect shot, question number one, what was I thinking about after [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1889.6399999999999s)]
*  here I go? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1895.6s)]
*  Because all the stuff up to here I go is pretty much the setup of the shot. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1896.6s)]
*  You've got your aim. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1899.52s)]
*  You've got tensions. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1900.52s)]
*  Maybe you roll to the click in your hinge. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1901.52s)]
*  What am I thinking about after here I go? [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1904.6399999999999s)]
*  And what you need to be thinking about is nothing other than that shot activation movement. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1906.8999999999999s)]
*  What is the movement that's going to cause this explosion? [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1911.26s)]
*  Where do I need to put my concentration? [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1914.6799999999998s)]
*  It's got to be in nothing other than the movement. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1916.12s)]
*  But you'll find in archery and shooting, most shooting sports, people leave their thought [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1918.32s)]
*  process in the aim, where it does you no good. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1922.3s)]
*  Right? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1925.4399999999998s)]
*  Question number one, what was I thinking about after here I go? [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1927.0800000000002s)]
*  Question number two, what was I saying after here I go? [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1929.44s)]
*  What words or sounds did you use to guide your concentration? [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1933.1000000000001s)]
*  So you now know what you need to be thinking. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1937.02s)]
*  You know exactly what you need to be saying or what sound you're using if it's a hum [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1939.1000000000001s)]
*  or an audible exhale or whatever it may be. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1943.16s)]
*  Question number three, could I have stopped it? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1946.64s)]
*  Were you so keenly concentrated on your shot activation movement that you could have stopped [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1949.2s)]
*  it anywhere within it? [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1953.46s)]
*  And if you can say yes to that, that's a big ask, right? [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1955.52s)]
*  But if you can say yes, I could have stopped it. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1958.2s)]
*  That means that you were truly in a closed loop control system. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1961.02s)]
*  And the only way to get into that is by having enough determination to make a decision so [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1964.46s)]
*  that you're present, so that you can concentrate. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1969.9s)]
*  So those are the fundamentals of precision shooting. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1972.56s)]
*  Right? [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1976.44s)]
*  So what am I thinking after here I go? [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1977.44s)]
*  What am I saying after here I go? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1979.56s)]
*  Could I have stopped it? [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1981.32s)]
*  And finally, what decisions did I make to get myself in the process for this one shot? [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1982.32s)]
*  Because it all only lasts for one shot. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1988.28s)]
*  And then your mind completely resets it and like, I didn't like that. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1990.24s)]
*  You surprised me with an explosion. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1993.5s)]
*  Got me this time, not happening again. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1995.76s)]
*  So you have to go through the same process over and over and over. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=1998.1399999999999s)]
*  And the decisions get easier to make, but they still have to be made. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2001.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, this is why I think this is important. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2005.52s)]
*  And this applies to so many things in life, because so many movements and things and actions [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2008.8s)]
*  in life are, they're sort of powered by anxiety. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2015.04s)]
*  They're powered by like, you just look, you spaz out because you're not in the moment, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2022.28s)]
*  you're just reacting. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2027.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2029.36s)]
*  Whereas what you're doing and what you're teaching with archery, and what I've learned [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2030.36s)]
*  from you is that if I say to myself while I'm shooting, if I'm talking to myself and [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2035.44s)]
*  I go through this whole list, center the bubble, center the sight, relax the shoulder, draw, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2043.96s)]
*  pull, pull, pull, release. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2052.16s)]
*  And when it releases, I'm in control of the whole thing from top. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2055.6s)]
*  these anxiety driven thoughts to just get it out. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2060.72s)]
*  Just do this. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2066.3599999999997s)]
*  He's going to get away. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2067.3599999999997s)]
*  Something's going to happen. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2068.3599999999997s)]
*  You're going to miss. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2069.3599999999997s)]
*  But if you stay in your own thought process and talk to yourself. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2070.3599999999997s)]
*  So like when I'm at full draw on an animal, I'm like pull, pull, pull, plop. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2075.52s)]
*  All I'm thinking of is these mechanics of making that shot release. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2080.7599999999998s)]
*  Instead of all that other shit by forcing myself to say pull, pull, pull at the final [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2085.96s)]
*  things I eliminate any possibility of shit going wrong because all I'm thinking of is [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2091.28s)]
*  those words. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2096.64s)]
*  All I'm thinking of is that movement and those words and it's magic. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2097.84s)]
*  And so many people in the world of bow hunting don't know this. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2103.16s)]
*  More people know this now because of you. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2108.88s)]
*  But I remember when I first found your stuff online, I was like, okay, this makes sense [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2111.44s)]
*  because I knew it was a mind fuck and I was shocked at how mind fucky it is because I'm [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2116.96s)]
*  a martial artist. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2123.6s)]
*  So I'm used to just reacting to things. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2124.6s)]
*  I'm used to relying on training and this moving automatically. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2126.08s)]
*  But you cannot do that with archery. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2131.84s)]
*  It requires stillness and calmness and being centered and in the moment in a very unusual [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2134.68s)]
*  way. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2141.9199999999996s)]
*  That's like pull. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2142.9199999999996s)]
*  And that moment of everything relying on this one thing that you're doing, all your success [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2143.9199999999996s)]
*  and failure, you might have shot thousands of arrows in practice, but that doesn't mean [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2152.16s)]
*  jack shit. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2156.44s)]
*  Right now you have to get this one arrow out perfect. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2157.52s)]
*  It might be a giant animal that's a screaming bull and you're shooting through a window [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2162.32s)]
*  of two trees that's 12 inches wide at 50 yards away and you're like, holy shit. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2167.32s)]
*  There's so much like, oh, don't hit the tree. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2172.72s)]
*  Oh, don't fuck this up. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2175.2s)]
*  Oh, you fucked it up last time. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2176.7599999999998s)]
*  You can fuck it up again. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2178.4s)]
*  Don't miss. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2179.64s)]
*  And all those different things. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2180.64s)]
*  If you just have this thought process in your head, going through your pre-shot routine [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2182.4s)]
*  perfectly, pulling back on the bow, centering your bubble, centering your P, pull, pull, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2190.36s)]
*  pull, swap. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2198.1200000000003s)]
*  It just goes off. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2199.1200000000003s)]
*  It's so unnatural for you to control an explosion. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2202.04s)]
*  There's also this thing where you want to pretend like you know how to do it now. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2206.56s)]
*  I got it. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2210.6800000000003s)]
*  I got this. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2211.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't have to think about that anymore. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2212.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't get target panic anymore. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2214.6800000000003s)]
*  I've got this. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2216.88s)]
*  If you do, you'll mind fuck yourself and then it'll happen again. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2218.72s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2222.16s)]
*  It's waiting. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2223.16s)]
*  It's always, it's the default. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2224.16s)]
*  You punching the trigger is the default. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2225.6s)]
*  We watch this all the time with professional archers. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2227.3599999999997s)]
*  Their career does this. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2230.08s)]
*  It's up and down. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2231.6s)]
*  And to a point where people sometimes are like, oh, the commentator's like, oh, God. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2233.52s)]
*  Because their thumb's not even on the button. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2239.72s)]
*  Like, oh, my God. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2241.4399999999996s)]
*  If he can just get his thumb on the button, he'll be okay. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2243.2799999999997s)]
*  It's like, man. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2246.88s)]
*  And then they super weight their bow because they don't necessarily understand how their [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2248.36s)]
*  eye actually works. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2251.6s)]
*  They use stabilizers to calm their mind. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2253.8s)]
*  It's completely opposite of how things actually work in your mind. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2257.32s)]
*  But when you think about the history of instruction, I mean, archery is a martial art in some cultures, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2261.32s)]
*  right? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2269.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2270.8s)]
*  It is a martial art. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2271.8s)]
*  I think of it as a martial art. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2272.8s)]
*  Some of the texts that are associated with that, it's this blank mindedness and all the [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2273.96s)]
*  stuff. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2279.28s)]
*  However, most of those cultures use what's called a mechanoreceptive trigger. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2280.28s)]
*  And people never knew about it, right? [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2287.32s)]
*  Why is it in Kudo archery that the tip of the arrow is so much bigger than the arrow, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2288.96s)]
*  than the arrow shaft itself? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2294.2400000000002s)]
*  And in those old texts, the arrow is not ready to be loosed until the point touches the knuckle. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2295.96s)]
*  Right? [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2301.92s)]
*  So mechanoreceptors, I'm sure you know this, but they're sensory receptors in your skin [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2303.4s)]
*  cells that give stimulus. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2307.28s)]
*  So like if you and I are sitting here BS and I put my hand down on a hot stove, the mechanoreceptors [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2309.96s)]
*  in the skin cells of my hand send this into my brain, that's hot. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2314.56s)]
*  My brain then sends the motor program that gets my hand off the stove. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2317.44s)]
*  It's how Olympic archers shoot with a clicker, right? [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2321.3s)]
*  So they draw their arrow back and they've got it underneath the clicker. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2323.48s)]
*  And then as they pull the tip of the arrow out from underneath the clicker, it click [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2326.64s)]
*  against the side of their bow. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2330.32s)]
*  That sound wave is picked up by the hair cell, the mechanoreceptors in the hair cells [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2332.4s)]
*  of the ear. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2335.88s)]
*  It sends the stimulus to the brain. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2336.88s)]
*  The brain sends the release motor program. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2337.88s)]
*  So you'll watch them, they're expanding through it, click, boom, they'll shoot the shot. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2340.32s)]
*  Same in Kudo archery, same in Bhutan, right? [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2344.7200000000003s)]
*  In Bhutan, they tie a wire underneath their arrow. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2347.2000000000003s)]
*  They'll wrap a little piece of wire or a piece of wood on there like a toothpick that will [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2350.48s)]
*  touch their knuckle. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2355.44s)]
*  Right? [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2356.6800000000003s)]
*  There's been these ways of doing things for millennium, right? [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2358.6s)]
*  But we all want to be more pure, right? [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2363.44s)]
*  We all want to, oh, traditional archery is just drawing back your long bow and letting [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2366.3199999999997s)]
*  it fire. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2371.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, that's, I mean, you go to any traditional archery event and you see most people don't [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2372.2799999999997s)]
*  even get the full draw before they let it go. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2377.16s)]
*  It's sad. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2379.64s)]
*  It's sad to watch. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2381.08s)]
*  I had a moment in South Texas recently where I was hunting Neil Guy. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2382.48s)]
*  And Neil Guy are a particularly fascinating animal because they evolved around tigers. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2388.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2394.6s)]
*  They're jumpy as hell. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2395.6s)]
*  I've never seen an animal move that fast. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2396.6s)]
*  I've never seen an animal so jumpy other than Axis deer, which also evolved around tigers. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2398.92s)]
*  So I have this bow that has set up a Garmin sight, which I love. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2404.48s)]
*  And what a Garmin sight is, it's a range-finding bow sight that uses a dot. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2412.44s)]
*  So instead of having a pin, so just explain it to people at home. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2418.0800000000004s)]
*  The way you sight an archery bow, a bow for bow hunting, a bow for archery is there's [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2422.0400000000004s)]
*  a program that you run the arrow weight through, the speed of the arrow, you shoot your arrow [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2427.32s)]
*  through a chronograph, the weight of the arrow, the draw length, and all these different components [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2434.6400000000003s)]
*  go into a program called archery advantage. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2442.28s)]
*  And that program will give you a sight tape. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2444.64s)]
*  You put that sight tape on your bow and it's calculated to the weight of the arrow, the [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2447.48s)]
*  speed of the arrow, and it shows how much drop the arrow is going to have over 20 yards, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2452.6s)]
*  40 yards, 50 yards. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2458.8s)]
*  And it'll show you exactly where that pin has to be. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2460.92s)]
*  So you would have to range with a laser range finder, you get your number, oh it's 56 yards [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2464.04s)]
*  away, and then you dial it perfectly to 56 yards and that will calculate exactly where [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2469.4s)]
*  that arrow is going to be when it gets to 56 yards. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2474.8s)]
*  What I love about this Garmin sight is at full draw you just press a button and it ranges [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2478.2400000000002s)]
*  and then it gives you a pin. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2485.08s)]
*  Well, I'm at full draw on this Neil guy and I've had a couple of problems with this bow [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2486.96s)]
*  sight where it didn't range. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2492.36s)]
*  So I'm at full draw and I have a 90 pound bow, so it's a lot of weight, it's very heavy, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2496.24s)]
*  and I'm pulling it, it's not a heavy bow physically, but it's heavy to pull back, and I'm holding [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2501.6s)]
*  it back and I press it, nothing. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2506.2s)]
*  And I press it again, nothing. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2508.6s)]
*  So then there's all this shit in your head, it's like, oh Jesus, he's going to get away, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2510.16s)]
*  oh no, you're going to make a bad shot. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2514.8399999999997s)]
*  And I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2516.68s)]
*  And then the third time I press it, finally I get a pin. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2519.9s)]
*  And I'm like, pull, pull, pull, fwap. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2523.48s)]
*  And this arrow flies perfect. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2526.64s)]
*  It hits this animal quartering away, broadside, punches straight through the animal and the [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2529.48s)]
*  arrow goes 30 yards away. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2535.08s)]
*  But the Neil guy runs like nothing's wrong with it. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2537.2799999999997s)]
*  In a full sprint when the arrow hits it, I'm like, oh no, I'm like, how am I even going [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2540.84s)]
*  to find this thing? [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2545.52s)]
*  A hundred and thirty yards it went until it died, but we didn't know where it went because [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2546.8s)]
*  It's heavy brush in South Texas. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2550.96s)]
*  And I'm talking to the guide and he's like, when we shoot them with rifles, we have the [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2553.44s)]
*  guide, we have the client who has a round in his rifle and then the guide also has a [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2557.92s)]
*  round. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2564.48s)]
*  So the client shoots the Neil guy and then the guide will do a follow up shot because [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2565.48s)]
*  that's how tough they are. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2570.56s)]
*  I'm like, maybe you should have fucking told me that before because I was not even with [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2571.56s)]
*  him. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2576.28s)]
*  I had snuck away. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2577.28s)]
*  I'm going to try to move around these bushes and get within bow range. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2578.5600000000004s)]
*  And so I'm thinking, boy, I'm pretty sure I made a great shot. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2583.0800000000004s)]
*  Like I have to, I don't know. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2587.88s)]
*  So luckily we map the area, we do a grid and we find the animal. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2589.7000000000003s)]
*  It's only 130 yards away. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2595.92s)]
*  It's a perfect shot. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2597.36s)]
*  It went straight through. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2598.36s)]
*  These animals don't bleed. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2600.0400000000004s)]
*  They're the weirdest animal. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2602.4s)]
*  When you shoot an elk at 30, I think this was a 52 yard shot. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2605.0s)]
*  If you shoot an elk at 52 yards, when you go to the spot where it hit, you're going [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2608.8799999999997s)]
*  to find drops of blood and you're going to be able to do a blood trail and you'll be [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2612.7599999999998s)]
*  able to find your animal. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2615.92s)]
*  And they don't run like Neil guy run. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2616.92s)]
*  This thing runs at a cheetah clip. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2619.04s)]
*  I mean full blast, full sprint and just till it died. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2621.64s)]
*  But it was a perfect shot. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2626.16s)]
*  And it would not have been, I mean the anxiety of the site not working, me pressing the button, [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2627.48s)]
*  nothing. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2632.6s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2634.16s)]
*  And I'm at full draw here and I'm like trying to stay calm and stable and then finally press [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2635.16s)]
*  the button and get the thing. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2640.88s)]
*  But if it wasn't for being conscious in the shot, pull, pull, pull, and I hear that whap, [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2642.6s)]
*  you know that sound that you hear when it hits the vitals, when it goes through the [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2650.68s)]
*  ribs, through the body and it went out the front shoulder. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2655.72s)]
*  I mean it was a perfect shot. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2658.72s)]
*  But it was because of your program. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2661.44s)]
*  It was because of your teaching. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2663.48s)]
*  And this was after I'd already worked with you and Peter Atiyah at his house and we were [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2665.76s)]
*  messing around. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2670.4s)]
*  So I had it very keenly in my head what needed to be done. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2671.4s)]
*  But you practice it, right? [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2675.52s)]
*  So the difference is that you're a very determined person and that's the missing ingredient in [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2676.88s)]
*  most people is they're not determined enough to actually make the decision. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2681.6s)]
*  And so they go shoot their bow. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2686.76s)]
*  And they shoot their bow and they're punching the trigger maybe just a little bit, right, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2688.8s)]
*  in practice. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2692.2400000000002s)]
*  So they're literally practicing their own failure in a high stress event, right? [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2693.44s)]
*  So they're punching a little bit, little bit and their mind's just making them a little [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2698.36s)]
*  bit more efficient, more efficient and they're practicing this efficiency. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2702.28s)]
*  They're practicing their open loop trigger work. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2705.88s)]
*  And then it comes to a high stress event and then at all they go ultra efficient and none [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2709.2400000000002s)]
*  of that stuff that you're talking about is in their head. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2714.84s)]
*  They're only thinking, holy shit, I don't have a pin. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2716.88s)]
*  We'll just make things happen and your autopilot will take it away from you like that. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2721.1600000000003s)]
*  But you, because you practice making decisions, you practice finding determination. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2725.6400000000003s)]
*  These are strange things to practice, but we're just using archery or shooting firearms [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2732.6800000000003s)]
*  or whatever it is. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2738.56s)]
*  We're using those as the medium for practice of these very mental things. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2739.56s)]
*  You use your bow to practice your concentration, right? [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2744.06s)]
*  You saying pull, pull, pull doesn't just happen. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2748.06s)]
*  It has to be decided upon. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2752.52s)]
*  And that's what long ago that guy at the academy could not figure that out and his ego was [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2754.62s)]
*  too high to actually go, oh, maybe what you're saying actually has some merit because what [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2759.5s)]
*  am I? [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2764.46s)]
*  I'm just a dumb cop, right? [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2765.46s)]
*  So it was, it's very interesting, but I see people all the time go to the range and they [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2766.46s)]
*  practice their own failure. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2771.74s)]
*  Even professional archers do the same thing. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2774.18s)]
*  And then they meet, then they meet Bodhi and the shoot off and Bodhi's going to shoot his [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2776.2799999999997s)]
*  process no matter what. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2780.8599999999997s)]
*  Right? [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2783.06s)]
*  So it's, it's really cool to see that and to know like you put Bodhi on a critter, it [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2784.06s)]
*  is done for because Bodhi is a stone cold man. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2788.74s)]
*  Well, the fact that you've trained him since he was a young boy, yes. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2792.9399999999996s)]
*  And this has been the way he's learned archery. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2796.74s)]
*  With his age, at your understanding of it, it all came about really at the perfect time. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2800.24s)]
*  It was the perfect storm. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2805.8399999999997s)]
*  And I, you know, Bodhi started shooting a bow at 10 and a half months old. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2806.8399999999997s)]
*  I mean, I had, at two weeks old, I had him in a front pack and, you know, shooting. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2811.24s)]
*  He's seen thousands of arrows go down range. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2816.08s)]
*  I had a bow in his crib and at 10 and a half months, he finally picks that thing up upside [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2818.12s)]
*  down, right? [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2822.68s)]
*  Prop himself up against the couch, draw back, fall over and then, you know, shoot his little [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2824.12s)]
*  string off. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2829.8399999999997s)]
*  But then he, at two and a half, he's shooting balloons, flying balloons with his bow in [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2830.8399999999997s)]
*  the kitchen, suction cup arrows. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2834.48s)]
*  At three years old, I buy him his first compound and index finger trigger at three years old. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2836.7999999999997s)]
*  And he's punching the crap out of that thing. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2842.98s)]
*  Of course. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2845.16s)]
*  At three years old, that's what it's, that's all his mind knows, is to brace for impact, [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2846.16s)]
*  right? [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2849.68s)]
*  At three, I bought him a tension-activated release. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2851.24s)]
*  And what that did, just like me in the academy, I fixed a mental problem with mechanical means. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2854.6s)]
*  So at that age, you know, what does a three-year-old have for determination decision-making skills? [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2859.6s)]
*  Nothing, right? [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2864.56s)]
*  So even up into early teens, these kids today don't have enough determination to override [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2865.7599999999998s)]
*  their own central nervous system. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2871.8799999999997s)]
*  So you put them in a tension-activated release that makes decisions for them. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2873.7999999999997s)]
*  Push the safety in. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2877.64s)]
*  Draw the bow back and aim it. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2878.7s)]
*  Safety's still on. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2880.92s)]
*  That's the calming effect. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2881.92s)]
*  Safety's still on. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2883.12s)]
*  Weapons not even hot yet. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2884.12s)]
*  They get their aim done, and then they separate from that by letting go of the trigger, or [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2885.3799999999997s)]
*  letting go of the safety. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2889.8799999999997s)]
*  And then if they don't pull, their bow's not going off. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2891.7999999999997s)]
*  So it makes the decision for them. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2894.56s)]
*  So from about three years old to about nine years old, that's what Bowdy shot, was a tension-activated [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2896.8399999999997s)]
*  release. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2900.8399999999997s)]
*  Until I saw it in him that that's all he knew, and that he could run anything, right? [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2901.8399999999997s)]
*  And he's heard me do the speech so many times that I didn't sit Bowdy down and go, okay, [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2907.68s)]
*  boy, this is how we're doing it. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2911.56s)]
*  He just heard it so many times, and me teaching other people, and me showing him, like, we [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2913.48s)]
*  don't do that, to the point where he would go to the range. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2919.16s)]
*  Little tiny kid, right? [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2922.52s)]
*  And he'd look up at somebody, ooh, you punched that one. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2923.52s)]
*  Like, boy, that guy's way bigger than your old man, so let's just, hee hee, on that, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2926.68s)]
*  right? [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2932.2s)]
*  But it was so funny, but now it's just, you know what's happening in Bowdy's mind, and [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2933.24s)]
*  you can see it in his eyes, and you see that squint, you know the concentration is there. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2937.2799999999997s)]
*  And the only advice that I ever give him is keep it moving. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2941.6s)]
*  Because I know that if he keeps his release moving, I know that his conscious mind is [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2945.0s)]
*  in his release, and it's not in the aim. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2948.68s)]
*  People, they are so infatuated with the aim, it's just, it's crazy. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2952.08s)]
*  They all try to control something that they have no control over. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2956.58s)]
*  Once you put the pin on there, it's done. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2960.16s)]
*  Just watch it to keep it, right? [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2963.64s)]
*  Watch the picture. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2966.2599999999998s)]
*  And people are like, do I concentrate on the pin, or do I concentrate on the, you know, [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2967.2599999999998s)]
*  the target? [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2972.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm like, you don't concentrate on either one of those, you just watch the picture. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2973.3199999999997s)]
*  Make it so they're both fairly in focus, they're on different focal planes, they're not both [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2977.3599999999997s)]
*  going to be in focus, but they are so infatuated with it. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2980.7999999999997s)]
*  That's why they weight their bow up so much. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2985.16s)]
*  They can't step away from it. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2987.58s)]
*  Certain personalities have a difficult time stepping away from the aim. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2989.08s)]
*  They want to control that. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2992.36s)]
*  You can't control it. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2993.72s)]
*  No matter which way it moves, its next movement is always back to the middle. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2994.84s)]
*  So let it do its thing, and don't slow it down too much. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=2998.16s)]
*  So you know where you want to hit. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3001.04s)]
*  And just concentrate on that spot. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3003.88s)]
*  Just watch it. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3006.0s)]
*  Don't concentrate on it. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3007.0s)]
*  If you put mental concentration into it, like if you're thinking about like, oh, I gotta [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3008.0s)]
*  get it right now. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3013.0s)]
*  It's never going to happen because you're going to go open loop on the trigger. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3014.94s)]
*  If your thought process is in your aim, you will go open loop on the trigger. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3017.96s)]
*  You will punch the trigger every single time. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3022.64s)]
*  The weird thing about it is it's so counterintuitive to not worry about your pin moving around. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3025.2s)]
*  Because your pin is going to move. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3031.7200000000003s)]
*  It's impossible to be perfectly still when you're holding a bow and you're drawing back. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3033.84s)]
*  It's like there's going to be a minimal amount of movement, no matter what. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3041.2s)]
*  But your subconscious mind will always bring that pin back to where you want it to go. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3045.44s)]
*  And you just have to trust in that process. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3051.2000000000003s)]
*  And that is a mindfuckin' people. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3052.96s)]
*  Because you're like, no, no, no. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3055.7200000000003s)]
*  When a pin gets there, that's when I'm going to release it. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3057.44s)]
*  But you can't do that. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3059.56s)]
*  It's not actually there anymore though. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3061.52s)]
*  By the time you process that, and that's why people super weight their bows. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3063.56s)]
*  Like you'll see a lot of pros have like 50 ounces of weight on their bow. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3067.44s)]
*  And that's strictly for their human psyche. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3072.88s)]
*  That is to calm themselves down because they see that slow pin movement. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3075.2s)]
*  But what we're trying to get is a surprise break. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3078.92s)]
*  You're trying to concentrate on this movement so you don't know when your bow is going off. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3081.24s)]
*  So your mind can't put the pre-ignition movements in there. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3085.16s)]
*  But then you couple that with this super slow pin movement. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3088.96s)]
*  Well, now it's in the nine ring. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3091.7599999999998s)]
*  And if you keep going, you have this surprise break. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3093.48s)]
*  If it breaks in the nine, and it is a nine, like on a Vegas face target. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3096.2799999999997s)]
*  If it breaks in the nine and it is a nine, it lands in the nine. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3100.48s)]
*  Then your bow is obviously too heavy. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3104.0s)]
*  You've slowed the rate of return down too much. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3105.76s)]
*  It's just like, you know, you have to be able to break a shot in the nine and it still hits [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3108.16s)]
*  a 10 if not an X. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3113.64s)]
*  And that's how we tune Bodhi's bows. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3115.04s)]
*  Everybody's like, oh Bodhi's so steady. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3116.72s)]
*  He's not that steady. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3119.24s)]
*  People think that because they don't see a stabilizer moving very much. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3121.36s)]
*  But he keeps them light so that his pin can break anywhere in the gold and it'll hit an [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3124.88s)]
*  X. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3130.72s)]
*  That's how we do that. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3131.72s)]
*  We're not trying to catch it because that's open loop trigger work. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3133.48s)]
*  But some guys do catch it. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3136.64s)]
*  They do. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3138.08s)]
*  And some of- [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3139.08s)]
*  This is what's weird, right? [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3140.08s)]
*  There's some guys like Tim Gillingham and Kyle Douglas who are like elite world-class [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3141.08s)]
*  archers who hold their bow steady. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3145.56s)]
*  They put the pin right there and then they pop. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3148.44s)]
*  They hit it. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3150.72s)]
*  So when you- [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3151.72s)]
*  Very contentious issue. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3152.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3153.72s)]
*  So they, when you talk to those people, they are of a very specific personality. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3154.72s)]
*  They're calm dudes, right? [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3159.3s)]
*  I talked to them all the time. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3160.64s)]
*  They're calm dudes. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3161.76s)]
*  They're good dudes. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3162.76s)]
*  They're just calm. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3163.76s)]
*  They have a specific personality. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3164.76s)]
*  So they super weight their bow and they're able to process that and they get it there. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3166.48s)]
*  But it bites them in the butt every now and again, right? [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3171.6400000000003s)]
*  And you can't stop that because you don't know what pre-ignition movement's coming. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3175.8s)]
*  And you see that in the shootoffs where they shoot amazing to get to the shootoff, but [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3179.76s)]
*  then there's one in there that they didn't catch, right? [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3185.0s)]
*  That they went open loop on. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3187.6800000000003s)]
*  Well they go open loop on all of them, but there's one that they got a little too efficient [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3189.7999999999997s)]
*  with it, right? [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3193.68s)]
*  And this is nothing against those guys. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3194.68s)]
*  They're amazing shooters. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3196.7999999999997s)]
*  That is the other way of archery, right? [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3198.84s)]
*  Super weight your bow and catch it when it's in the middle. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3201.14s)]
*  But you have to have a super light trigger to do that so that your pre-ignition movement [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3203.72s)]
*  is minimal, right? [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3208.48s)]
*  So you don't have to have much of a movement. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3209.48s)]
*  I mean it's so light when you actually work on their triggers. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3211.24s)]
*  That's the other way of doing it. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3215.12s)]
*  That's not what we do, right? [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3217.2s)]
*  I want fast pin movement and I want closed loop movement on the release. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3219.3999999999996s)]
*  And that seems to be a higher level. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3224.9199999999996s)]
*  Like when you go to Vegas now, there's a whole other level, right? [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3227.16s)]
*  You have to be on your game. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3231.06s)]
*  It is very high level now. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3232.8799999999997s)]
*  So what they're doing is almost like, obviously, they're amazing archers. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3235.64s)]
*  They're so good at what they do. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3240.9199999999996s)]
*  And they have sort of decided to eliminate some of that anxiety by having a very hot [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3244.12s)]
*  trigger and just getting it so they know they can get that pin right there and just touching [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3250.2400000000002s)]
*  it when it's there, which works a lot, but not always. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3256.2400000000002s)]
*  Not always. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3262.2400000000002s)]
*  Not always, which is a mindfuck. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3263.2400000000002s)]
*  Like how can you be one of the best in the world and be doing something wrong? [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3265.2000000000003s)]
*  It's not wrong. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3268.96s)]
*  It's just a different way of doing it, right? [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3269.96s)]
*  It's not wrong by any stretch of the imagination. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3272.6s)]
*  I don't know that it has the potential of closed loop release movement. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3275.2799999999997s)]
*  It's close. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3280.6s)]
*  So they could do everything they're doing, but incorporate closed loop movements and [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3281.6s)]
*  it would be even better. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3289.12s)]
*  Well potentially, they would have to probably lighten their bows up and become friends with [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3291.12s)]
*  the movement. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3295.56s)]
*  Because if you have that super, like their pin moves really slow. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3296.56s)]
*  So if they have it moving slow and they continue with that movement, if it breaks in the nine, [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3300.34s)]
*  it's going to be a nine because it can't get back to the middle fast enough with how they [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3305.34s)]
*  have it weighted. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3308.42s)]
*  They have to have the pin movement so slow that it comes into the middle and there's [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3309.58s)]
*  enough time for them to recognize, okay, it's in the middle, send the signal to the release. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3314.7000000000003s)]
*  And this is all happening in thousands of a second, but it's only there for a microsecond [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3319.98s)]
*  until it floats out. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3327.1000000000004s)]
*  The problem with that system is if you go open loop on the trigger, you don't know what [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3328.86s)]
*  pre-ignition movement's coming. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3333.2200000000003s)]
*  Is it a micro collapse? [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3335.42s)]
*  Do you grab your bow slightly? [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3336.7400000000002s)]
*  Do you winch your face? [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3338.2200000000003s)]
*  All those are going to deviate your point of impact and you're trying to hit a penny every [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3340.54s)]
*  time. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3344.7000000000003s)]
*  That's just an indoor archery. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3345.7000000000003s)]
*  If you're shooting like safari, you're shooting 101 yards. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3346.7000000000003s)]
*  If you go open loop on the trigger with that, who knows? [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3349.9s)]
*  Your miss could be bigger. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3353.82s)]
*  Archery is such a proving ground for mental control and it's one of the things that I [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3356.98s)]
*  love about it. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3361.58s)]
*  One of the things that I love about it is archery doesn't give a fuck how many people [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3362.58s)]
*  like you, whether your friends text you back, whether your wife is upset with you. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3367.46s)]
*  Archery doesn't give a fuck. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3374.54s)]
*  If you don't do it right, it doesn't land where you want it to go. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3376.34s)]
*  And I know that sometimes I can do it right. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3380.9s)]
*  And so there's this mind fuck where I'll just be like, I have to stop practicing sometimes [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3384.26s)]
*  because my shoulders are sore. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3388.7400000000002s)]
*  I've shot hundreds of, I've been out there for hours. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3390.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm like, okay, now your body is not recovered enough to do this. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3392.5s)]
*  You got to stop. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3397.6600000000003s)]
*  I get obsessed with it. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3398.78s)]
*  And what I'm obsessed with is this ability to recreate the movements and the mindset [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3400.78s)]
*  in order to do it efficiently and accurately and then do it again and again and again. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3409.98s)]
*  And then you also have to avoid this thing where I like to sometimes I'll make a shot. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3416.86s)]
*  It's a perfect shot. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3422.66s)]
*  And I'm like, good, I'm dialed in. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3423.86s)]
*  And then I don't do all those things when I'm drawing back. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3425.3s)]
*  I just draw back. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3428.5s)]
*  I center my peep and I just fire another arrow. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3429.66s)]
*  And it doesn't matter if it went in there. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3433.06s)]
*  I'm like, don't do it that way because you're not doing it the way you're going to have [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3434.86s)]
*  to do it if you're on a big bull in the woods. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3439.02s)]
*  If you see a big bull in the woods and it's the 16 yard gap in between two trees and that's [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3442.78s)]
*  where his vitals are, you got to have all your I's dotted and your T's crossed. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3448.1800000000003s)]
*  You can't just rely on the fact that you've already shot 50 arrows in a row because you [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3453.42s)]
*  haven't. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3458.2200000000003s)]
*  You've hiked up this mountain. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3459.2200000000003s)]
*  You're exhausted. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3460.2200000000003s)]
*  There's all this shit going on. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3461.2200000000003s)]
*  It's such a mindfuck. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3463.98s)]
*  Almost nothing else I've ever done. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3465.86s)]
*  Because, besides pool, which is also a mindfuck, but in pool you get to shoot a bunch of other [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3467.9s)]
*  shots. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3474.34s)]
*  You get to shoot the one ball to the two ball. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3475.34s)]
*  You're warmed up to the three. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3477.42s)]
*  You get good position on the four. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3479.34s)]
*  You're rolling. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3480.9s)]
*  With archery, every shot is the nine ball. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3483.5s)]
*  Every shot is the money ball. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3486.46s)]
*  And you only get one shot. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3487.94s)]
*  You might go five, six, seven days without shooting any shots because you're out there [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3489.78s)]
*  hiking and carrying your bow and trying to sneak up and get downwind. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3495.1000000000004s)]
*  There's so much going on that that moment is so hypercharged. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3499.54s)]
*  It's like no other thing that I've ever done. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3504.1000000000004s)]
*  It's using the shot though. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3507.78s)]
*  That shot where you had that shot was perfect. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3509.86s)]
*  Like, okay, I'm good. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3512.3s)]
*  And then you shoot again. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3513.6200000000003s)]
*  The difference was you didn't decide on that next shot. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3514.96s)]
*  You didn't make the decision that made your presence increase so that you could remember [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3520.02s)]
*  to do all those steps. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3523.46s)]
*  It's using the shot and using the stress. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3525.8199999999997s)]
*  When I go elk hunting, it's just I'm using that elk for a stress test. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3529.66s)]
*  It's so powerful to be able to control your mind in such a situation. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3536.18s)]
*  It is amazingly powerful. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3541.48s)]
*  It makes other decisions in life so much easier. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3543.54s)]
*  If you're getting ready for a presentation, if you're doing surgery, whatever it may be, [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3548.86s)]
*  you can get your mind where it needs to be. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3554.5s)]
*  It's so funny because I have some surgeons come to me for shooting practice and we do [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3555.94s)]
*  the signature tests. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3561.14s)]
*  I'm like, do you hack on people with a scalpel like that, doc? [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3562.14s)]
*  They're like, no. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3566.14s)]
*  I'm like, how about we buckle down and do it like you may do a cut, an incision? [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3567.14s)]
*  Like, okay, I get it now. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3571.38s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3574.62s)]
*  Any type of precision professional that has to do a movement in a high stress event, how [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3575.88s)]
*  do you get yourself to concentrate? [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3581.04s)]
*  It's even more important when you're on the instructor end of things. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3583.8s)]
*  How do you get this other person to do it? [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3586.6s)]
*  Getting them to talk themselves through it, getting them to make the decisions. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3590.6400000000003s)]
*  That's what we've done. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3595.12s)]
*  We've mapped all this stuff out so you can get other people to do it for themselves. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3596.12s)]
*  We just use archery because like you said, there's nothing like it. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3601.02s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3604.1600000000003s)]
*  It's such a crazy thing to be able to control a movement that causes an explosion. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3605.44s)]
*  What's fascinating to me is it's made my rifle shooting so much better. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3611.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3615.08s)]
*  I'm so confident with a rifle. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3616.08s)]
*  When I zoom in on something with a rifle, when I'm looking down that scope and I've [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3618.2s)]
*  got that crosshairs on it, I know all I have to do is just pull, pull, pull, pull, pull. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3621.72s)]
*  And especially if I have a rest. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3627.04s)]
*  Oh, sure. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3628.3599999999997s)]
*  Like if I'm prone and I'm like laying the rifle over my backpack and you know, you have [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3629.3599999999997s)]
*  all these points of contact, it's so much easier. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3634.8799999999997s)]
*  It's so different. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3638.52s)]
*  And that the difficulty of archery, it enhances and educates all these different aspects of [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3640.12s)]
*  your life when it comes to dealing with stressful, high pressure situations. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3650.2799999999997s)]
*  It makes you stay in the moment because you have to stay in the moment in stand up comedy [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3655.22s)]
*  too. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3658.4399999999996s)]
*  When you're doing stand up comedy, you can't think like, oh, I hope they laugh at this [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3659.72s)]
*  next one. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3663.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh, I hope I don't fuck this joke up. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3664.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh, I might be losing the crowd. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3665.7999999999997s)]
*  You can't think any of that. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3667.64s)]
*  You have to be, if I'm talking about coffee or something like that, whatever I'm talking [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3668.8799999999997s)]
*  about on stage, I have to be thinking about that coffee. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3672.4399999999996s)]
*  If I'm not, that audience knows it. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3676.4399999999996s)]
*  They smell it. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3678.3599999999997s)]
*  They're animals. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3679.4399999999996s)]
*  They're like, this motherfucker's not even thinking about what he's talking about. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3680.4399999999996s)]
*  They know it's a weird thing. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3683.56s)]
*  And it's the same kind of thing. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3686.16s)]
*  Like you have to be in that mindset. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3687.96s)]
*  And I've had shows before where maybe I was too relaxed or too confident or too whatever. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3690.7s)]
*  And then you'll stumble a little bit and then you got to reestablish where you're at and [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3698.98s)]
*  you got to stay and like, oh, oh, oh, oh, we're losing control here. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3703.74s)]
*  You might have fucked that joke up. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3708.2999999999997s)]
*  Get back in the mindset. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3710.06s)]
*  Think about what you're talking about. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3712.14s)]
*  Bring these people back to you. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3713.66s)]
*  Get in there. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3715.9399999999996s)]
*  Kind of, it applies to so many high pressure situations is that the mind gets away from [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3717.34s)]
*  you. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3724.38s)]
*  You see it in traffic accidents where people panic and they hit the gas instead of the [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3725.38s)]
*  brakes or they just fucking, they don't know what to do. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3728.7000000000003s)]
*  They freak out because they can't stay calm in the movement, in the moment and just concentrate [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3731.9s)]
*  on what they're supposed to be doing rather than the desired result they want to achieve. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3737.82s)]
*  That's why I think archery is one of the ultimate proving grounds for mental control. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3743.8199999999997s)]
*  Like I said, they may have done it before. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3749.14s)]
*  They may have done it before, but they never blueprinted how they did it. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3752.62s)]
*  And that is so huge. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3756.8599999999997s)]
*  How do you get yourself in that zone before your deal on stage or whatever? [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3758.6s)]
*  You know how you do it now because you've done it hundreds, if not thousands of times. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3763.14s)]
*  But when it comes down to life or death stuff, that's where you're a very determined person [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3767.3s)]
*  just in the way you live your life. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3774.2200000000003s)]
*  It's Cam, very determined person. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3776.38s)]
*  So that's how you get to where you get to. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3779.26s)]
*  It's the first ingredient in this whole control factor is having enough determination to do [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3782.2200000000003s)]
*  that. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3787.7400000000002s)]
*  And you have a why. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3789.2200000000003s)]
*  You have a why as to why you're doing this. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3791.34s)]
*  My why was I was scared to death, man, in the sniper world. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3793.18s)]
*  I was like, man, I hope it doesn't go bad. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3797.94s)]
*  And I'm like, that can't be the mindset. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3800.62s)]
*  Holy mackerel. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3802.58s)]
*  But it is the mindset of most cops because they don't have a why. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3804.02s)]
*  If a cop's never been in a gunfight or a shooting, their why is artificial. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3808.46s)]
*  And it's scary the first time that you do that. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3814.8999999999996s)]
*  Having that why and seeing like I was in an HR where I had to use lethal force on a [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3819.48s)]
*  person that was I had to put around this far from another human being's face. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3825.08s)]
*  And it was that's my why. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3831.28s)]
*  So when I do training on the team, it's like you guys don't understand when you see, when [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3833.3s)]
*  you're looking through your optic at a reticle and there's somebody's face on the edge of [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3838.34s)]
*  the, I mean, their face is fully in your scope. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3845.12s)]
*  And the reticle is right on the edge. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3849.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3850.96s)]
*  And you have to put the round past their head. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3851.96s)]
*  That's your why. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3854.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3855.0s)]
*  So that's your why for all this tactical training that you do. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3856.0s)]
*  But if you've never been there and done that, you have to learn how to manufacture determination. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3858.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3863.68s)]
*  Can you imagine what failure would be in that situation? [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3864.8s)]
*  Well tell the story if you don't mind. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3867.92s)]
*  The story you told me about the guy who was methed out. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3870.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3873.2s)]
*  So got a SWAT call out of a hostage rescue. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3874.2s)]
*  He was an unarmed barricaded subject with a hostage. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3877.28s)]
*  And you never know. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3881.4s)]
*  That's all the information you get on the call out. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3882.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3883.92s)]
*  So we go there. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3884.92s)]
*  I get there and it was weird because on the brief, I walked up to the house and the SWAT [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3885.92s)]
*  commander briefed me at the head of the garage there and it was light colored concrete. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3891.6000000000004s)]
*  It's dark. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3898.84s)]
*  You know, we didn't have a bunch of lights on because the operation is active in that [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3899.84s)]
*  house right there. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3903.1400000000003s)]
*  But the room was in kind of the back of the house. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3904.1400000000003s)]
*  I remember he's talking to me, telling me the situation and I'm looking on the ground [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3906.96s)]
*  and I'm like, what is all that stuff on the ground? [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3911.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3914.76s)]
*  And I'm looking at these dark patches on the ground. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3915.76s)]
*  So I turn my flashlight on and it's blood. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3917.68s)]
*  There's blood all over the place on this, on the walkway down from the garage. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3920.56s)]
*  I'm like, what is up with that? [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3925.04s)]
*  And he's like, well, this guy stabbed his cousin and then took his own daughter hostage. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3927.16s)]
*  There's a human shield with a knife to her. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3933.88s)]
*  So that's how SWAT got called and all this stuff. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3937.2400000000002s)]
*  So I get there and I got to be, I'm up on a ladder over a wood fence and we're about, [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3939.52s)]
*  I'm only like 15 yards from the window, but we can't see anything in the window. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3945.76s)]
*  And the negotiator is on the phone with this guy and he's not really making a lot of sense. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3951.36s)]
*  He wants to talk to his girlfriend, blah, blah, blah. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3956.4s)]
*  He's got his daughter in there with him and we can hear her through the wall. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3958.56s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3962.6800000000003s)]
*  And we can hear her. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3964.48s)]
*  Sometimes she's screaming, sometimes she's crying, sometimes she's laughing. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3965.48s)]
*  So we don't know what is going on in there. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3968.72s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3970.72s)]
*  And this goes on for the negotiators are on the phone with them for a while. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3971.72s)]
*  And then finally the decision's made, like we have to get in there because it's starting [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3975.24s)]
*  to go south in negotiations. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3979.08s)]
*  And we lost calms with the guy. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3981.64s)]
*  So you're worried he's going to stab his daughter. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3983.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3984.96s)]
*  Well, we don't, I mean, he's already done that to his cousin. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3985.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3987.96s)]
*  I mean, stabbed him in the face and legs and the arms, big K-bar knife. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3988.96s)]
*  It was not a good situation. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3992.44s)]
*  So yeah. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3994.8s)]
*  And he's already used her as a human shield. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3995.8s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3997.32s)]
*  When the cops, what happened is there was a big fight went on. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=3998.32s)]
*  The cops got in, got everybody out. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4002.12s)]
*  Then they realized the daughter was hiding behind a couch. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4004.56s)]
*  So they go back in, they restack up, they go back in. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4009.44s)]
*  Now he's got the daughter around the waist using her as a human shield, knife to her, [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4011.6s)]
*  and he kicks the door shut on a bedroom. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4016.12s)]
*  That's what starts the SWAT call out. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4018.96s)]
*  So I'm looking in this window, it's got blinds on it. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4021.44s)]
*  You know, negotiations are going south. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4025.56s)]
*  We lose calms with the guy. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4027.0s)]
*  So finally we're like, we got to get calms with this dude. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4028.44s)]
*  So we're going to put a throw phone in. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4031.48s)]
*  So we put a throw phone. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4032.68s)]
*  Throw phone's like a, it's like a box. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4034.48s)]
*  It's got a phone in it so the negotiators can talk to the dude. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4036.52s)]
*  And so we put that in there. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4041.2000000000003s)]
*  My buddy rips the blinds out. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4043.78s)]
*  When we rip the blinds out, there's the dude again. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4045.28s)]
*  I can't see him because I can only see like half the room. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4048.2s)]
*  And he's on the right, he's in the right corner of the room and I'm over this fence. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4052.6s)]
*  And the window guys are yelling at him to drop the girl, drop the knife, you know, to [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4058.72s)]
*  get him on the commands. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4064.52s)]
*  And he's kind of working his way along the wall. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4065.52s)]
*  He's got her around the waist so he would hold her up above, you know, so they can't [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4067.16s)]
*  get a shot. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4072.92s)]
*  And so he's moving his way across the wall and then he moves his way across this wall [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4074.36s)]
*  and ends up in this corner, sits down and pulls her up over the top of him. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4078.04s)]
*  And so the window's on the same wall as this corner and I can't see any of this stuff. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4084.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm the sniper team leader. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4089.48s)]
*  So I work my way around and I get to this gate. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4090.6600000000003s)]
*  I'm like, they called fire priority to the window team. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4095.84s)]
*  I'm like, I'm on the wrong team. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4098.6s)]
*  Because these guys, there's like six dudes at the window and nobody's shooting. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4101.16s)]
*  I'm like, why in the F are these guys not shooting? [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4105.6s)]
*  Because I couldn't see what they saw, but it's just what's going through my head. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4108.84s)]
*  So I get off the ladder, I run to this gate and it's weird, the stuff you remember, they [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4112.200000000001s)]
*  had this, it was like one of those latch type of locks and it had a bolt through it with [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4118.12s)]
*  the nut all the way buried. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4122.84s)]
*  And this bolt was like, it felt like it was this long, right? [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4124.64s)]
*  So I'm having to unscrew this freaking bolt, right? [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4127.12s)]
*  I'm screwing, it's the finest threads I've ever felt, right? [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4130.12s)]
*  So I'm unscrewing this bolt, finally, bing, I get that. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4132.96s)]
*  I go through the gate, I come around, I come up to the window and there was another officer [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4135.8s)]
*  that had basically his face planted against the window so that he could just barely see [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4142.92s)]
*  through this sliver because it was on the same wall. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4147.96s)]
*  And he wasn't shooting and I'm like, why are you not shooting? [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4154.5599999999995s)]
*  And so we actually ended up having to remove him off the ladder because I don't know what [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4157.72s)]
*  he was thinking, he wasn't hearing us, we were given the commands to get off the ladder [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4161.320000000001s)]
*  so I could get up there and evaluate the situation. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4164.360000000001s)]
*  And I'm shooting my sniper rifles, it was a gas operated .308 and lowest power on the [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4167.56s)]
*  scope was four and a half. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4173.76s)]
*  And I told the admin years ago, I'm like, I need lower power because it's going to be [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4175.84s)]
*  close probably when it does happen and sure enough it was. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4179.4800000000005s)]
*  So I get up on this ladder and I put my face against the wall and I can just see through [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4183.88s)]
*  the sliver, I can see him sitting and I can see her sitting in his lap basically and he's [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4188.32s)]
*  got his arm around her. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4194.32s)]
*  And so the team keeps giving them commands and I'm looking at this shot and I'm evaluating [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4196.96s)]
*  what's going on and I'm thinking to myself, I'm going to have to shoot him left handed. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4201.3s)]
*  And I'm thinking lowest power is four and a half. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4208.24s)]
*  So I do an optic check on the wall, I'm like, that ain't going to work. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4210.76s)]
*  So I'm thinking to myself, I'm going to have to shoot him with my pistol. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4214.24s)]
*  When you say optic check, is it because it's moving too much? [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4216.64s)]
*  No because it's too much magnification. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4219.2s)]
*  So there was a picture of something on the wall so I brought my rifle up and looked at [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4221.68s)]
*  him like, that ain't going to work. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4225.68s)]
*  It was just blurry, it's four and a half power, the shot's only 11 feet, like 12 feet, 11 [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4226.68s)]
*  feet. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4232.16s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4233.16s)]
*  So I'm like, I don't have the right tools so I'm thinking, I'm going to have to shoot [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4234.16s)]
*  my handgun. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4237.8s)]
*  And then I'm thinking, I always preach, handguns suck for killing stuff, right? [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4240.0s)]
*  So that's why I always tell my guys, handguns suck for killing stuff. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4244.76s)]
*  We don't use handguns if we don't have to. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4247.08s)]
*  But I'm thinking, I got the wrong tool. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4248.56s)]
*  What am I going to do? [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4250.16s)]
*  So I'm thinking, wait a minute, stupid. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4252.56s)]
*  There's six guys standing at the window that have the right tool, right? [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4254.78s)]
*  Because they all have their assault rifles. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4258.84s)]
*  And so the first guy, and it just happened to be the guy that we pulled off the ladder, [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4261.68s)]
*  I'm like, give me your rifle. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4267.4s)]
*  He's like, what? [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4268.4s)]
*  Give me your rifle. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4269.799999999999s)]
*  So we swapped rifles and he says HK416. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4270.799999999999s)]
*  And the reason he said that was because on an HK416, if you flip the safety twice, you [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4274.679999999999s)]
*  go to full auto, right? [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4279.679999999999s)]
*  So don't want to do that in a precision environment, right? [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4281.78s)]
*  So I'm like, Roger that. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4284.92s)]
*  And so I got up and the window's broken at this point. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4286.98s)]
*  So when you step up to the window, you're literally walking on broken glass. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4291.799999999999s)]
*  So I step up, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4296.52s)]
*  the glass all pops underneath my feet. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4298.52s)]
*  And I push the rifle, I got to shoot left handed, right? [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4302.52s)]
*  So I pushed the rifle in and I come around the corner. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4305.24s)]
*  Now the rifle butt is in my bicep with somebody else's rifle, right? [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4307.32s)]
*  But I know this rifle is zeroed because it has to be zeroed because to get through my [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4311.94s)]
*  qualification a month earlier, it had to be zeroed, right? [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4316.28s)]
*  So I knew that things were good. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4319.3s)]
*  But I also knew that you got to aim two and a half inches higher than where you want to [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4321.6s)]
*  hit because that's a mechanical offset, right? [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4324.32s)]
*  Difference between bore height and sight height, two and a half inches. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4326.639999999999s)]
*  So I push the rifle in the window and I come around the corner and I look and the little [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4329.599999999999s)]
*  girl's looking right at me, right? [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4334.28s)]
*  Because all the broken glass. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4335.799999999999s)]
*  So she's looking right at me and I bring the reticle up and it's full pop brightness, right? [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4338.139999999999s)]
*  I can't see anything because he had it set for a white light shot. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4344.92s)]
*  So when you turn your super bright flashlight on, on your rifle, it will blur out your reticle. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4349.32s)]
*  So you got to have your reticle turned way up. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4357.44s)]
*  Well, he had it set for a white light shot, but I wasn't going to do a white light shot. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4359.12s)]
*  So I looked at him like, oh no. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4362.88s)]
*  So just like you're thinking your thing didn't turn on when you're looking at this nil guy, [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4365.82s)]
*  I'm looking at this red sun in a dimly lit room and I'm like, this ain't going to work. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4369.719999999999s)]
*  So I pulled the rifle back out of the window. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4375.96s)]
*  And now I got to work on the buttons on this site. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4379.08s)]
*  Well, this isn't my rifle, right? [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4380.88s)]
*  So now I got to find the button that dims the dims the red dot. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4382.62s)]
*  So I'm messing around with this thing and the whole team is outside and they're watching [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4386.38s)]
*  this, right? [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4391.16s)]
*  Because they're going to go on my shot. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4392.16s)]
*  Now this dude had the had the door barricaded with a TV and a TV stand, all that stuff. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4393.16s)]
*  So they were going to have to hit the door hard, but they were going to get a running [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4398.04s)]
*  start at it. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4401.1s)]
*  But I moved them out because they were right on the other side of the door, but I didn't [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4402.1s)]
*  know if my round was going to go through the wall or not. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4405.04s)]
*  So I moved them out. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4407.0s)]
*  So we got them out. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4409.04s)]
*  So they're all watching this shit show basically of me on this optic and they're thinking, [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4410.04s)]
*  what are you doing Turner? [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4415.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4416.08s)]
*  And I'm thinking, I'm like, I just got to get this thing turned down. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4417.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4419.52s)]
*  So I mess with the buttons and I finally get to the right one. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4420.52s)]
*  So I'm like, okay, good. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4423.56s)]
*  So I go back up to the window, you know, glass breaks again, pop, pop, pop underneath my [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4425.54s)]
*  feet. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4431.0s)]
*  I come around the corner. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4432.0s)]
*  Does this guy know you're there? [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4433.0s)]
*  I don't know because he was, I mean, who knows what kind of mental state he was in. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4434.5s)]
*  And I was trying not to be too, that's why I didn't turn on any lights or anything. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4440.66s)]
*  So I come around the corner again and I look in there. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4445.38s)]
*  I'm like, okay, I got the right brightness, but it's too close. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4448.62s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4451.26s)]
*  Like her head was like an inch because what I'm looking at is this. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4452.26s)]
*  So like, this is the back of her head. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4454.98s)]
*  I'm looking at his eyeball. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4456.58s)]
*  So I got like an inch. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4458.58s)]
*  I'm like, nah, it's too close. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4460.06s)]
*  And remember that almost, so this was in December, a year earlier, it was 364 days after I made [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4463.32s)]
*  that decision in that tree stand when I mapped things. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4472.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4476.0s)]
*  So now between 14, December of 14 and December of 15, now I have control of what's going [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4477.0s)]
*  on and I made that vow, right, long ago that I'm not going to shoot an uncontrolled shot. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4484.0s)]
*  So I come around the corner and I'm looking and she's of course looking at me and it's [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4489.66s)]
*  close. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4494.54s)]
*  I'm like, nah, I ain't going to do that. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4495.54s)]
*  So I'm waiting and then he moves his head back. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4497.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4500.7s)]
*  I'm like, okay, two and a half inches of mechanical offset, but his face is all covered in hair, [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4501.7s)]
*  like this giant mop of hair. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4506.66s)]
*  So I couldn't see the geography of his face at all. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4509.04s)]
*  Like I'm going, I want to put it in his eyeball, but I don't, I can't see it. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4511.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4515.86s)]
*  So I'm going by the curvature of his, of his forehead. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4517.259999999999s)]
*  I know I got to aim two and a half inches over that. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4520.099999999999s)]
*  So I put it up there, safety's off, fingers on the trigger. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4523.0599999999995s)]
*  It's a two stage trigger. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4526.54s)]
*  So I took the first stage out. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4527.66s)]
*  Here I go. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4529.82s)]
*  I remember saying that. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4530.82s)]
*  And then when I'm, when I'm working on rifle stuff, it's, it's kind of an audible exhale. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4532.32s)]
*  So right. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4536.139999999999s)]
*  So I, that's my, that's my concentration guidance. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4537.139999999999s)]
*  So I put it two and a half inches over where I wanted to hit, safety's off, takes the stage [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4541.82s)]
*  out of the trigger. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4546.58s)]
*  Here I go. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4547.62s)]
*  And he moves his head back. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4548.62s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4551.3s)]
*  And he pops it back against the back of her head. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4552.3s)]
*  And it's funny, the stuff you remember, because I remember his hair swishing. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4556.5199999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4559.9s)]
*  And he's, so now he's back and it's too close again. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4560.9s)]
*  So I'm like, I'm waiting. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4563.96s)]
*  He moves his head back again. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4566.22s)]
*  So he moves his head back again. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4568.3s)]
*  Now I've got better, you know, it's faster for me to aim where I need to aim. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4569.3s)]
*  So I put it where I need to. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4573.38s)]
*  He's out. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4575.5s)]
*  Here I go. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4576.5s)]
*  And the shot broke and the rest is history. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4577.5s)]
*  So it, but worst case scenario in terms of tension, in terms of consequences, messed [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4579.38s)]
*  up guy, knife to this girl. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4588.5s)]
*  I mean, it's just the whole, that was the culmination of everything. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4591.42s)]
*  That was the start of shot IQ. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4597.0s)]
*  Cause now I'm like, this is no bullshit, right? [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4598.7s)]
*  This is how to concentrate in high stress events. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4602.74s)]
*  Right. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4606.14s)]
*  So, and it was cool because I had, I had lots of high level military operators that I was [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4607.14s)]
*  able to bounce ideas off of, like, cause I'm not getting in gunfights every day. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4611.34s)]
*  So I go, Hey man, is this real or is this not real? [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4615.860000000001s)]
*  Like, yeah, how'd you figure that out? [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4618.38s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4619.58s)]
*  I'm just a dumb cop, man. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4620.58s)]
*  Just thinking, you know? [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4622.62s)]
*  And so I was able to bounce things off of people that were actually, that had been there [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4623.7s)]
*  and done that. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4627.56s)]
*  Cause you know, when you're looking for solving a problem, you have to find those people that [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4628.56s)]
*  have solved it before, but it's so rare to find somebody that's solved it before and [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4634.72s)]
*  blueprinted how they did it. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4639.280000000001s)]
*  You know, that's what's rare in the instruction and just in life in general, you know, there's [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4641.64s)]
*  lots of mentors out there that have been there and done that and whatever field you're looking [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4646.0s)]
*  for, but did they blueprint it? [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4649.92s)]
*  I know a lot of bow hunters just bow hunt a lot and that's their blueprint. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4652.64s)]
*  A lot of these guys are like very effective trigger punchers. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4658.08s)]
*  And one of the reasons why they could do it is because they're shooting at animals all [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4661.68s)]
*  the time. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4665.88s)]
*  I mean, I know guys that hunt 200 plus days a year. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4666.88s)]
*  So the time between the last arrow they shot on an animal is very small. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4670.48s)]
*  So they're more calm. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4675.94s)]
*  They're more prepared. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4677.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4678.2s)]
*  They've inoculated themselves to it. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4679.2s)]
*  But when you ask these people, even if they're trigger punchers, they will still do a couple [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4680.66s)]
*  very specific things. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4686.48s)]
*  They will separate from the aim somehow, however they do it. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4688.04s)]
*  And they all say something. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4692.12s)]
*  Every one of them to a person. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4694.24s)]
*  I've interviewed hundreds of snipers, successful rifle hunters, successful bow hunters, and [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4695.5599999999995s)]
*  they all say something at full draw. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4700.759999999999s)]
*  Because that's what keeps you in the present moment. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4704.36s)]
*  That is what keeps you in a closed loop. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4706.36s)]
*  That is their decision, right? [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4707.86s)]
*  Whatever it is, right? [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4709.759999999999s)]
*  Whatever they say. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4710.799999999999s)]
*  When you look at these people, like, how did you figure out who taught you how to shoot? [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4712.92s)]
*  Well, my grandpa, my dad, whatever it may be. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4717.04s)]
*  But nobody ever teaches that because we don't ask the right questions. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4720.08s)]
*  We don't go, hey, professional archer, what are you thinking about when you're at full [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4724.4s)]
*  draw? [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4728.96s)]
*  And most of them couldn't even tell you. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4730.4s)]
*  So you ask the question, what do you say? [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4733.2s)]
*  Oh, I don't really want to tell you. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4734.5199999999995s)]
*  It's kind of embarrassing, whatever. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4735.92s)]
*  They all say something. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4737.48s)]
*  It's always different. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4739.4s)]
*  But they all say something. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4740.639999999999s)]
*  What's the pattern of success? [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4741.96s)]
*  I asked Remy Warren about this. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4743.56s)]
*  And one of the things Remy says is he goes, it sounds crazy, but I try to be the arrow. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4745.4800000000005s)]
*  Sure. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4751.76s)]
*  I mean, it's really, I love that. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4752.76s)]
*  Like you are the arrow. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4755.2s)]
*  Like the arrow goes where you want it to go. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4756.52s)]
*  So be the arrow. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4758.36s)]
*  So he's shooting, he's not going, oh, I hope it hits. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4760.88s)]
*  He's like looking at that animal. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4763.8s)]
*  He's like, that's where I'm going to hit. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4765.4800000000005s)]
*  Does he say that? [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4767.32s)]
*  I believe so. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4768.32s)]
*  I mean, you have to ask him. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4769.32s)]
*  I'm pretty sure that's what he says. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4770.32s)]
*  That's the thing, man. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4772.08s)]
*  Everybody says something. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4773.719999999999s)]
*  So that's how he gets his consciousness into whatever that is. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4774.719999999999s)]
*  Now if we take that and we refine that and put it into the actual movement that we want [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4779.24s)]
*  to happen, that's when you get to that higher level. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4783.96s)]
*  It's so fascinating how the mind is geared to survival, geared to react quickly to high [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4787.639999999999s)]
*  stress panic situations, the adrenaline pumps. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4794.719999999999s)]
*  But you don't have an operator's manual on how to navigate the various stages of anxiety [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4798.92s)]
*  and these states that only occur rarely under very high pressure situations. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4809.16s)]
*  And you don't have a lot of experience with them. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4815.52s)]
*  Like you see that in street fights where people who don't have training, they have no idea [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4817.400000000001s)]
*  what to do. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4821.92s)]
*  And you see the walls just close in on them. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4822.92s)]
*  I'll never forget this. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4825.68s)]
*  This is a clearly untrained person. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4828.24s)]
*  We were at the Comedy Store and the Comedy Store is on Sunset in Hollywood and there [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4831.0s)]
*  was a fight that was taking place across the street. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4836.88s)]
*  And there was all these cars that were passing by while watching these guys yell at each [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4841.32s)]
*  other and push each other. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4845.36s)]
*  And then I see this one guy whose eyes are squinting and he's decided to engage in this [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4847.32s)]
*  guy and I don't know if he's intoxicated, I'm sure he's intoxicated, but they're talking [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4856.64s)]
*  shit and they're pushing. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4861.360000000001s)]
*  And then all of a sudden I see him literally like closed eyes like squinting head up in [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4862.96s)]
*  the air and he's swinging like with open hands. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4869.56s)]
*  And then a bus goes in between him and I and the guy's fighting. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4872.0s)]
*  And then when the bus passes, he's out cold. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4876.52s)]
*  He's out cold and the other guy walks off. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4879.56s)]
*  And I'm like, wow. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4881.320000000001s)]
*  Watching that guy panic and watching that guy in a situation where he'd probably never [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4882.68s)]
*  been before, didn't know what to do, had talked himself into this terrible situation where [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4889.08s)]
*  he's an untrained fighter, an untrained guy who's fighting with another person. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4894.8s)]
*  And this guy's also untrained. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4900.0s)]
*  They both sucked. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4901.160000000001s)]
*  But this one guy kept it together slightly more and cracked this dude with a haymaker, [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4902.3s)]
*  I guess. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4908.08s)]
*  I don't know, but he was just out cold on the street. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4909.24s)]
*  And I remember thinking, wow, anxiety is crazy. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4912.84s)]
*  It's those the heart beating, the adrenaline pumping and all that stuff. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4916.6s)]
*  It's like those moments overwhelm people where they can't stay in the moment. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4922.36s)]
*  And I think what you've done with your Shot IQ course is you've given people not just [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4929.44s)]
*  the tools to be effective at archery, but the tools to understand how to control your [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4937.2s)]
*  mind during high pressure situations and stay in the moment and do the thing that's difficult [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4943.679999999999s)]
*  to do under those high pressure situations. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4950.4s)]
*  And not just want it to be over with quick. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4953.72s)]
*  You just want it to be over with. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4955.4s)]
*  And you see that in fights too where guys swing when the guy's nowhere near them. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4957.84s)]
*  They'll just do stuff because they just want to. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4961.76s)]
*  They leave their face exposed and they throw technique out the window. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4964.84s)]
*  It's just anxiety. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4968.68s)]
*  And knowing that these things exist and having a followable course where you can, this is [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4970.64s)]
*  what's going on in your mind. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4979.28s)]
*  This is how you control your mind and you have to talk to yourself. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4981.76s)]
*  You have to be able to stay in the moment. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4985.22s)]
*  And the best way to stay in the moment is to actually have words going off in your mind. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4988.64s)]
*  I get the opportunity to talk to psychologists and I just had one at the house that came [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=4995.2s)]
*  for a clinic. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5001.36s)]
*  And he, it's funny when you talk to these people because it's hard to find a psychologist [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5003.12s)]
*  that has been there and done the things that we're talking about. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5009.76s)]
*  And they usually go too deep. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5013.599999999999s)]
*  So there's a depth that you can't go past because it becomes intangible. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5015.5599999999995s)]
*  I asked the doctor, like, Doc, am I right when I say this? [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5023.360000000001s)]
*  And he's like, oh yeah, that's this and this and this and this. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5027.04s)]
*  I'm like, is that how you teach it? [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5029.160000000001s)]
*  Well, yeah, that's what I talk about. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5030.280000000001s)]
*  Well, it's too deep, right? [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5031.92s)]
*  It's intangible. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5035.88s)]
*  When you talk about... [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5037.08s)]
*  But people aren't going to carry it with them in a high pressure situation. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5038.68s)]
*  How do you increase confidence at the moment of truth? [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5042.08s)]
*  How do you get your conscious bubble to get the same size as your self-image bubble? [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5045.320000000001s)]
*  It's all intangible stuff, right? [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5049.400000000001s)]
*  This is what I'm talking about is how do you get it? [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5051.92s)]
*  It's tangible. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5055.64s)]
*  This is the tool that you need to use. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5056.4400000000005s)]
*  This is why you're using it. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5058.36s)]
*  And this is what happens, right? [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5060.52s)]
*  And people take instruction and they're looking for the magic pill, right? [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5062.2s)]
*  Like, oh, if I take your course, is this going to fix me? [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5066.36s)]
*  Not if you have that approach, it's not, right? [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5070.12s)]
*  Because I can't teach you determination. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5072.36s)]
*  I can help you find it, right? [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5074.52s)]
*  Like in SWAT training, a lot of times we have to run 100 meters and shoot 100 meters. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5076.12s)]
*  Standing unsupported, 8-inch steel plate. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5081.36s)]
*  Doesn't sound that hard, but when you're huffing and puffing and if you go open loop, you're going to miss. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5084.12s)]
*  So I remember this one time, one of my snipers is he'd run 100 meters, get to where I was, shoot, pal, miss, 20 push-ups, right? [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5089.96s)]
*  20 push-ups, run 100 meters, down and back, come up, pal, miss. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5098.5599999999995s)]
*  And I'm like, 20 push-ups. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5104.4s)]
*  So he does 20 push-ups, come back down, pal, miss, 20 push-ups. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5105.92s)]
*  This time I got down on the ground with him, I said, what's your job? [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5110.44s)]
*  He said, sir, my job is to hit the target. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5113.44s)]
*  I said, that's not your job. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5115.36s)]
*  Your job is to move the trigger slow enough you could stop it. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5116.839999999999s)]
*  That's your job, right? [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5120.12s)]
*  If you do that, there's no way you can miss the target. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5122.04s)]
*  And so then after that, there was no more misses. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5125.719999999999s)]
*  But he didn't have his job defined, right? [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5128.36s)]
*  Your job is not to kill the bull elk. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5131.2s)]
*  Your job is to, not even to shoot the shot. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5134.4s)]
*  Your job is to move your trigger slow enough you could stop it. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5137.28s)]
*  When you do your job, your actual job, the results take care of themselves. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5141.5599999999995s)]
*  And there's a lot of stuff that we have no control over. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5145.36s)]
*  You can't control that access to your jump and your string, right? [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5147.28s)]
*  You can't do that. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5151.599999999999s)]
*  You have to stay in your job, but you gotta have defined, what is that? [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5152.5199999999995s)]
*  What is the true problem here, right? [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5157.92s)]
*  And I was just like anybody else trying to figure out this shot control thing, [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5161.04s)]
*  but I didn't know what the problem was. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5165.6s)]
*  Nobody had actually defined the problem. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5168.04s)]
*  Your subconscious mind will not allow you to cause your body impact as a surprise. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5169.96s)]
*  That's the problem in shooting in general. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5175.200000000001s)]
*  Anticipation. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5177.400000000001s)]
*  And once we figured that out, now we can start to attack. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5178.4800000000005s)]
*  What sciences do I need to figure out that deal with this stuff? [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5181.4800000000005s)]
*  And I was lucky to have the right people in the right places to figure this stuff out. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5185.160000000001s)]
*  But it's putting it in that package so that you can define your job. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5188.360000000001s)]
*  And then how do you attack it, right? [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5193.88s)]
*  So. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5196.08s)]
*  It's such an amazing thing that you've done that I really feel like it should be mandatory. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5197.08s)]
*  I really do. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5204.96s)]
*  I think there's so many people that go out into the woods to hunt archery, and they don't [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5205.96s)]
*  know what's going to happen when they pull that trigger the first time. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5212.28s)]
*  They've never done it before. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5216.28s)]
*  So the first time they ever do it, it's like, whoa. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5217.96s)]
*  If they knew what you're teaching, I really think that the rate of success would go up [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5222.72s)]
*  exponentially and the rate of bad shots taken would go up as well. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5229.52s)]
*  That would go down. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5233.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5234.96s)]
*  I really believe that people would be far more effective. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5235.96s)]
*  And just trying to erase the mystery in it, right? [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5237.88s)]
*  Like when you shoot your next shot on whatever hunt you're going on or whatever you're doing, [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5240.16s)]
*  you know how it's going to go. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5244.4800000000005s)]
*  There's no mystery to it. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5246.280000000001s)]
*  You know you're going to draw back an aim. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5247.76s)]
*  You know that you're going to roll to the click in your hinge. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5249.780000000001s)]
*  You know you're going to say, here I go. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5252.24s)]
*  You know you're going to say, pull, pull, pull. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5254.08s)]
*  There's no mystery to it anymore. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5256.0s)]
*  Whereas most people, they have mystery in their shot. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5258.2s)]
*  They don't know how it's going to go. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5260.84s)]
*  They hope it goes well. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5262.5199999999995s)]
*  And then there's this thing that people do where the moment the shot goes off, they move [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5264.0s)]
*  their bow because they want to see. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5269.44s)]
*  Sure. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5271.16s)]
*  That's a pre-ignition movement. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5272.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5273.16s)]
*  They call it peeking. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5274.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5275.16s)]
*  And it's a real problem with bow hunting. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5276.16s)]
*  If you stay in the process we're talking about, you can't peek because you don't know when [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5278.84s)]
*  your bow is going on. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5282.719999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5283.719999999999s)]
*  So your body doesn't know when to do that. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5284.719999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5285.719999999999s)]
*  It doesn't know when to do all these weird pre-ignition movements that it does to brace [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5286.719999999999s)]
*  you. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5289.4s)]
*  And you don't even know you're going to do it until you do it. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5290.4s)]
*  And then you're like, what the fuck is wrong with me? [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5292.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5295.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5296.48s)]
*  I remember being there, man. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5297.48s)]
*  I remember I missed so many. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5298.48s)]
*  I mean, I'm a two-time World Elk Calling Champion. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5299.48s)]
*  I can call Elkin like a chicken on a string, but I could not hold myself together. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5301.679999999999s)]
*  It was ridiculous, man. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5306.48s)]
*  Some of the shots I took, I'm like, what just happened? [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5308.719999999999s)]
*  It's like somebody else shot the shot for me. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5311.44s)]
*  Complete blackouts, all this stuff. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5314.2s)]
*  It's amazing that there's all these different people that come up with all these different [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5316.08s)]
*  methods to try to beat target panic. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5319.44s)]
*  And one of the things they do, they work on the mechanics by blind bailing. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5322.759999999999s)]
*  And what blind bailing is for the people who don't understand archery is you literally [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5326.96s)]
*  stand in front of a large target like a bale, like a bale of hay, and you stand close to [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5330.799999999999s)]
*  it, and all you're doing, you're not even thinking about where you're going to hit. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5336.04s)]
*  A lot of times you close your eyes and you're just going through the mechanics of the shot [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5338.92s)]
*  so that the mechanics of the shot get programmed into your system, which gives you a little [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5343.4s)]
*  more confidence that you know how to do the mechanics. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5348.92s)]
*  But it doesn't stop you from freaking out at the moment. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5351.92s)]
*  It just doesn't. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5355.6s)]
*  And so all these people that have all these different methods, it's really like someone [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5356.84s)]
*  who doesn't understand what's really going on trying to explain it to someone who also [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5362.72s)]
*  doesn't understand what's really going on. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5367.08s)]
*  You know? [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5369.360000000001s)]
*  Like, is that good for defining and refining your movements as an archer? [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5370.360000000001s)]
*  Certainly. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5375.6s)]
*  You should teach someone how to blind bail when you're first learning archery because [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5376.6s)]
*  you want them to be able to understand how the shot should break. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5380.76s)]
*  But without the knowledge that you're presenting of what's going on in that high pressure situation, [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5384.52s)]
*  they're going to spaz out and they're going to go open loop. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5393.240000000001s)]
*  But in the instruction for decades, that's been it, right? [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5397.56s)]
*  We've blind bailed. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5400.320000000001s)]
*  And people spend months like, you should blind bail for six months or maybe you start with [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5401.320000000001s)]
*  a close target and then you move it out slightly, slightly, slightly. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5405.52s)]
*  All that is trying to get you to do is separate from the aim. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5409.6s)]
*  So just let's cut to the chase, man. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5412.360000000001s)]
*  Don't waste six months of your life shooting a blind bail. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5415.080000000001s)]
*  Let's shoot a good shot, blueprint it, understand exactly how you do it. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5418.0s)]
*  And then you have to test it on a target. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5422.02s)]
*  And some people are like, well, as soon as I, and this is even in my course and I have [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5425.38s)]
*  to take this out because I filmed that course in 2015 and 16 and since then, the online [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5429.38s)]
*  course, I've got lots of updates to it. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5436.06s)]
*  But there's one portion of it that I need to take out because in there I say, and this [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5438.780000000001s)]
*  is how it was when I first started, when it was in its infancy, if you detect an error, [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5443.740000000001s)]
*  let the shot down. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5448.620000000001s)]
*  Right? [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5449.620000000001s)]
*  That makes sense, right? [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5450.620000000001s)]
*  So let it down. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5452.22s)]
*  I don't say that anymore because now every time you detect an error, like let's say that [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5453.22s)]
*  you draw back and you're like, oh man, I'm really shaky. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5459.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh wait, I'm not supposed to be thinking about my aim. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5461.14s)]
*  Let it down. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5463.82s)]
*  Right? [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5464.82s)]
*  Well, your subconscious just won that shot. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5465.82s)]
*  It's like, oh, if I get Joe to shake and recognize that, he'll bail out of the shot. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5468.38s)]
*  Your subconscious does not want you to create an explosion in your body. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5475.7s)]
*  It never just intuitively wants that. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5480.179999999999s)]
*  So if it can get you to bail out of a shot, it will. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5482.46s)]
*  So now when you detect an error, when you are training, when you detect an error, you're [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5485.94s)]
*  not allowed to let down. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5491.179999999999s)]
*  You have to stay at full draw and fix it in the shot. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5493.299999999999s)]
*  Recognize the problem, understand how to fix it. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5497.96s)]
*  Maybe another here I go to increase your presence so that you can concentrate. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5500.379999999999s)]
*  But you have to fix it in the shot. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5504.62s)]
*  We don't let people let down anymore. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5507.16s)]
*  Archery instructors are going to lose their mind when they hear, oh my God, Turner's telling [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5509.82s)]
*  people not to let down. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5513.66s)]
*  I let down in tournaments if I have a shot that went stale because I wasn't thinking [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5514.82s)]
*  about the right movement. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5519.74s)]
*  Shot maybe goes stale. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5521.9s)]
*  You'll see Bodhi do that every now and again. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5522.9s)]
*  There's a certain point of pressure in the bow where you're not going to hit the X. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5525.139999999999s)]
*  There's too much pressure built up. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5530.139999999999s)]
*  Right? [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5531.94s)]
*  You're just not going to hit the X. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5532.94s)]
*  So if you have time to on the clock, you let it down. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5533.94s)]
*  But recognize what was the problem there. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5537.339999999999s)]
*  I wasn't thinking about the movement. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5539.78s)]
*  I was thinking about my aim or whatever. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5540.78s)]
*  Very interesting when you look at Bodhi's interview from Lancaster in 21 or 22 actually [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5542.42s)]
*  when he shot that 660 because they interview him right after that shot and he let it down [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5549.74s)]
*  before he actually shot his 60th arrow for the 660. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5555.58s)]
*  And he tells you exactly what's going through his head. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5560.42s)]
*  He says, oh man, my pin was jumping from red to red. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5563.0199999999995s)]
*  He left it at that. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5568.1s)]
*  I'm like, well, that's why it went stale because you're thinking about your pin shaking on [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5569.1s)]
*  a target so you're not thinking about moving the release. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5572.38s)]
*  And then they ask him about the next shot. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5575.66s)]
*  Well, it was good enough so I just kept my release moving. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5577.26s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5581.9800000000005s)]
*  That's where the mind needs to be. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5584.58s)]
*  But it's so counterintuitive. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5585.58s)]
*  It is. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5586.58s)]
*  But it's just the way it works. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5587.58s)]
*  So just cutting to the chase and cutting out all the crap and giving people a specific [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5590.14s)]
*  blueprint to eliminate the mystery in your shot or in your whatever you're doing. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5595.86s)]
*  Whatever a precision professional needs to concentrate, this is how you do it in a tangible [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5602.5s)]
*  way. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5607.299999999999s)]
*  And I feel like there's a way to translate this to many other things. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5608.299999999999s)]
*  I don't feel like this is just limited to archery. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5612.42s)]
*  And I think it's like I said that it's like the ultimate proving ground for being able [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5614.86s)]
*  to overcome anxiety and be able to stay in the moment. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5620.24s)]
*  But I feel like that could be like the principles that you're applying could be given to all [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5623.34s)]
*  sorts of other high stress occupations. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5630.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5633.18s)]
*  Anytime anytime somebody has to concentrate for whatever it may be, this is how you do [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5634.46s)]
*  it. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5641.14s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5642.14s)]
*  And it may be for a movement. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5643.14s)]
*  It may not be. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5644.14s)]
*  It may be a major decision that you have to make. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5645.14s)]
*  It may be a surgeon. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5646.9400000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5648.74s)]
*  It may be a pilot. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5649.74s)]
*  It may be a jet mechanic. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5650.74s)]
*  It could be anything where you have to concentrate on a movement where there are consequences [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5653.3s)]
*  if you screw it up and concentrating on those movements in the mind and talking yourself [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5657.700000000001s)]
*  through the movements rather than don't fuck this up. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5664.06s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5667.1s)]
*  I hope I don't crash. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5668.1s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5669.1s)]
*  I don't cut the wrong artery. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5670.1s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5671.1s)]
*  I hope I don't do this. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5672.1s)]
*  It's like the self-talk is so important because if you don't have a positive self-talk like [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5673.1s)]
*  a constructive technical self-talk, you're going to allow the mind to have a bunch of [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5680.42s)]
*  other shit to think about and concentrate on and focus on. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5689.18s)]
*  And a lot of that is counterintuitive. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5692.66s)]
*  A lot of that is counterproductive. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5694.54s)]
*  And it's very strange how the mind will sabotage you, but it just will. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5696.58s)]
*  It just will because your mind's not designed to shoot arrows. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5702.14s)]
*  Your mind's designed to run away from a cheetah or something. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5705.62s)]
*  If someone's trying to eat you or a warring tribe member is chasing after you, you're [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5708.98s)]
*  like, ah, you gotta run. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5713.62s)]
*  You gotta get out of there quick. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5714.62s)]
*  You can't think. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5715.62s)]
*  Yeah, it's that fight or flight stuff. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5716.62s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5718.0199999999995s)]
*  You're overriding that every time you shoot an arrow. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5719.0199999999995s)]
*  And yeah, it's just powerful stuff. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5722.339999999999s)]
*  I know guys, they take drugs to try to get past it. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5724.9s)]
*  They take beta blockers to try to kill all their anxiety and kill all of their nerves [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5727.9s)]
*  and their adrenaline. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5735.78s)]
*  You can't rely on that. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5738.0599999999995s)]
*  And not only that, they test for those things. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5740.179999999999s)]
*  Yes, they do. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5741.98s)]
*  At the archery competitions. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5742.98s)]
*  Yes, they do. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5743.98s)]
*  Which is fascinating. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5744.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5745.98s)]
*  It's so interesting that people have been bow hunting for so long and then you come [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5746.98s)]
*  along with this one method that really changes everything. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5753.58s)]
*  And I really think it does. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5758.7s)]
*  There's been great archery coaches that have come up with ways to overcome target panic. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5760.38s)]
*  John Dudley came up with this hinge, or rather this silverback release. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5767.34s)]
*  Tension activated relationship. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5776.06s)]
*  That is completely tension activated. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5777.06s)]
*  And what that is, if people don't understand, is you don't know when it's going off. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5778.54s)]
*  So you pull and it's set to a few pounds over the draw weight of your bow. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5782.1s)]
*  So you pull all the way back, you're holding it in place, and then you release the safety, [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5788.18s)]
*  and then you pull slightly harder and it goes off. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5794.34s)]
*  But you really don't know when it's going to go off. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5797.9400000000005s)]
*  But you are anticipating that it's going to go off. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5800.56s)]
*  And sometimes you're just like, oh, when's it going to go off? [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5803.74s)]
*  When's it going to go off? [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5806.06s)]
*  Oh, jeez, I hope it works. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5807.06s)]
*  And then it goes off. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5808.06s)]
*  It could work or it could not work. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5809.7s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with the tension activated release. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5813.18s)]
*  It's a great release. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5815.66s)]
*  But it would be way better if you knew what the process was, what's going on in your mind [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5817.54s)]
*  as you're doing it. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5823.9s)]
*  If you say, here I go, and then you pull, pull, pull, bang, and then it goes off. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5824.9s)]
*  Instead of all that, oh my God, what's happening? [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5831.62s)]
*  I don't fuck this up. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5834.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't miss. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5835.0199999999995s)]
*  Don't wound the animal. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5836.0199999999995s)]
*  Don't fucking shoot over his head. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5839.0199999999995s)]
*  Don't look like an asshole. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5841.5s)]
*  Don't hate yourself again. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5842.78s)]
*  Yeah, there's all that stuff. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5844.14s)]
*  The tension activated release was quite an invention. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5846.0199999999995s)]
*  It changed. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5850.14s)]
*  Like I said- [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5851.14s)]
*  Was the evolution the first one of those? [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5852.14s)]
*  I believe so. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5853.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5854.660000000001s)]
*  I think Dudley was involved in that. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5855.660000000001s)]
*  That's the one I bought Bodie when he was three years old. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5856.660000000001s)]
*  And it separates it for you. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5859.18s)]
*  It's a mechanical fix to a mental problem. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5861.46s)]
*  The problem is that it's so based on preload, how much you're pulling when you let that [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5864.58s)]
*  safety off, that there's no professional archer out there that shoots a tension activated [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5869.9800000000005s)]
*  release. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5875.3s)]
*  Right. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5876.3s)]
*  Because it's not the most accurate system, but it's the easiest one to control because [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5877.3s)]
*  of that safety. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5880.6s)]
*  Right? [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5881.6s)]
*  So that's the decision for you because if you don't pull, your bow's not going off. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5883.06s)]
*  So what I do in my clinics, when I have somebody that's not determined enough to make a decision, [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5885.88s)]
*  they just keep punching the trigger like, I don't know why this isn't working. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5891.68s)]
*  It's because nothing works for you in shooting, right? [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5895.6s)]
*  In shot control, nothing works for you. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5898.200000000001s)]
*  You have to work for it. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5900.280000000001s)]
*  The only thing we're teaching you is what work needs to be done and how to do the work. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5901.280000000001s)]
*  But you take this tension activated release, if they just won't stop punching whatever [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5905.88s)]
*  other release they're doing, I'll take that tension active release and I'll screw that [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5909.82s)]
*  sucker down where it won't go off. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5913.759999999999s)]
*  Right? [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5915.78s)]
*  So, okay, here's how it works. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5916.78s)]
*  I tell them how it works. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5918.7s)]
*  Push safety in, draw back an aim, then take the safety off and you got to pull. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5919.7s)]
*  Okay, yeah, no problem. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5922.7s)]
*  So they push the safety in and this may be a person that hasn't even been able to aim [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5923.7s)]
*  yet. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5927.179999999999s)]
*  Like they're always locked off target. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5928.179999999999s)]
*  Safety's on, they draw back, and now all of a sudden they can aim because the safety's [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5929.62s)]
*  on. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5934.0199999999995s)]
*  Right? [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5935.0199999999995s)]
*  So now they can separate from that aim. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5936.0199999999995s)]
*  They kind of timidly take the safety off. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5938.26s)]
*  I'm like, okay, now all you got to do is pull. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5940.14s)]
*  Here comes the flood. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5942.3s)]
*  So they start pulling. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5943.7s)]
*  And they're just pulling a little bit and all of a sudden, they give it this big old [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5945.3s)]
*  yank but it doesn't go off. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5948.06s)]
*  Right? [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5949.86s)]
*  So I'm like, okay, push the safety in, let it down. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5950.86s)]
*  What were you thinking about? [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5954.06s)]
*  Well, I was thinking about pulling and then there's always a and then I started thinking [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5955.22s)]
*  about when's it going to go off? [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5961.44s)]
*  How much is it going to take? [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5963.3s)]
*  Why hasn't it gone off yet? [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5964.54s)]
*  And that's the moment at which autopilot, the subconscious comes in and gives it that [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5966.339999999999s)]
*  big old help. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5969.419999999999s)]
*  Right? [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5970.419999999999s)]
*  So then I have them, okay, here's what you need to do. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5971.419999999999s)]
*  Here I go. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5974.379999999999s)]
*  Take the safety off. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5975.379999999999s)]
*  Then say, here I go to up your presence and then talk yourself through movement. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5976.379999999999s)]
*  Okay, yeah, sure. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5979.62s)]
*  Here we go. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5980.62s)]
*  So they do it. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5981.62s)]
*  They take the safety off and they start pulling. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5982.62s)]
*  And then you can see the change. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5984.66s)]
*  We're like, okay, I guess I just got to pull. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5986.139999999999s)]
*  So they keep pulling and pulling and pulling and pulling. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5988.78s)]
*  They're just shaking like crazy but it doesn't go off. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5990.58s)]
*  Safety in, let it down. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5992.98s)]
*  What are you thinking about? [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5993.98s)]
*  What are you thinking about? [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5995.0199999999995s)]
*  I was just thinking about pulling. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5996.0199999999995s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5997.62s)]
*  Now we can start. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5998.62s)]
*  Right? [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=5999.62s)]
*  Until you get them singular minded, then we blueprint. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6000.62s)]
*  How did you get yourself to do that? [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6002.459999999999s)]
*  What were you saying? [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6003.9s)]
*  What were you thinking? [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6004.9s)]
*  What were you saying? [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6005.9s)]
*  Could you stop it? [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6006.9s)]
*  What decisions did you make? [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6007.9s)]
*  Right? [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6008.9s)]
*  I was using attention activated release for a while. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6009.9s)]
*  And I was using attention activated release with your principles. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6012.9s)]
*  And I shot one of the best shots I've ever shot. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6016.62s)]
*  And there's a photo out there with me and Cam with this elk. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6018.299999999999s)]
*  Perfect shot. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6021.7s)]
*  67 yards, 10 ringdom. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6022.7s)]
*  And it was in that thing. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6025.42s)]
*  Because I knew Cam was filming it. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6027.099999999999s)]
*  And it was a lot of pressure. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6028.58s)]
*  He's one of my best friends. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6029.58s)]
*  Sure, sure. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6030.58s)]
*  He taught me how to shoot. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6031.58s)]
*  He's right next to me. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6032.58s)]
*  And it's like this big fucking elk. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6033.58s)]
*  It just got done fighting this elk and he moves and he moves broadside. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6035.62s)]
*  And Cam's like, take the shot. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6040.179999999999s)]
*  So I draw back, I center it, I pull it through and it was just perfect. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6041.58s)]
*  And I'll never forget watching that arrow because I have a green luminoch. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6045.5199999999995s)]
*  And I'm watching that green luminoch just swap. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6049.679999999999s)]
*  It was right in the spot. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6052.46s)]
*  And after that shot, it was a perfect shot. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6054.580000000001s)]
*  But after that shot, I realized that's not the most accurate way to do this. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6056.820000000001s)]
*  That I feel like there's something about the tension activated thing. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6062.3s)]
*  I need to apply that now to a trigger into a hinge. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6066.1s)]
*  And so I started moving to that. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6070.38s)]
*  And it was this thing like, boy, now this is a totally different thing. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6072.740000000001s)]
*  But go through the same principles again. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6076.580000000001s)]
*  And it's helped me tremendously. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6078.9400000000005s)]
*  It's made such a big difference to know that you have to control those movements. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6081.34s)]
*  And you have to have that self-talk. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6086.62s)]
*  You have to have that mantra. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6088.18s)]
*  You have to have that thing in your mind where you stay in the presence. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6089.9800000000005s)]
*  You should be able to control any release. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6092.78s)]
*  I should be able to fill this table with releases and go, there you go, Joe. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6095.1s)]
*  And just index finger trigger, thumb button, hinge, tension activated. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6099.5s)]
*  Pick it up, understand how the trigger works, and control it. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6105.14s)]
*  And is that possible even with an index trigger? [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6108.24s)]
*  If you're just pulling the trigger. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6111.06s)]
*  So even an index trigger, a full draw, if you're just like pull, pull, pull, pull, pull, [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6112.580000000001s)]
*  pink, with the finger. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6117.54s)]
*  You can, usually. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6118.54s)]
*  So what we do is we teach people to open their whole hand and just wrap their finger around [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6120.22s)]
*  the trigger. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6125.8s)]
*  And then pull their hand through the strap. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6127.02s)]
*  They're not moving their finger at all. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6129.06s)]
*  They're just pulling their hand through the strap. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6130.26s)]
*  It's easier to control this bigger movement, right? [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6131.780000000001s)]
*  So when they do that, that's plenty of motion to be able to do that. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6134.3s)]
*  And so they just hook in. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6138.26s)]
*  Here I go. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6139.74s)]
*  Pull. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6140.74s)]
*  But there's a desire to pull with the finger. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6141.74s)]
*  Right. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6144.7s)]
*  Though there is, right? [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6145.7s)]
*  But when you, that's why we use index fingers. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6146.7s)]
*  Like if people bring me the worst piece of crap with a whole bunch of travel, gritty, [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6148.94s)]
*  sears, all kinds of nastiness, right? [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6154.34s)]
*  I'm like, perfect. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6156.46s)]
*  Because when you control that one and you understand how you did it, the world is yours. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6158.38s)]
*  And then you get into selecting a release. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6163.38s)]
*  Like, okay, this release, I can go close loop on this easier. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6165.78s)]
*  I can evaluate the movement, the pressure increase without a bunch of travel. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6168.98s)]
*  So now once you have this knowledge, you can actually pick a release that you can evaluate [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6173.139999999999s)]
*  best, right? [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6177.459999999999s)]
*  And it's, you know, it may be a thumb button, it may be a hinge, it may be an index finger [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6179.0599999999995s)]
*  trigger. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6182.9s)]
*  There's all kinds of releases out there. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6183.9s)]
*  But the whole archery industry is built around target panic. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6184.9s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6189.179999999999s)]
*  It's crazy, man. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6190.5599999999995s)]
*  Well being you and having come up with this system and recognizing that, what's interesting [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6192.5s)]
*  to me is I see resistance. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6198.6s)]
*  And I see people that they get upset. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6200.96s)]
*  They don't do it your way. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6205.0s)]
*  So they get upset that you're teaching this and they're like, no, no, no, no, no, I don't [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6206.4400000000005s)]
*  believe this and I don't believe that. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6211.0s)]
*  But it's fascinating because you see that with all sorts of other things where there's [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6213.120000000001s)]
*  a high rate of failure. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6217.72s)]
*  When someone comes up with a solution, everyone wants to think they have the solution. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6219.240000000001s)]
*  I don't want to mind fuck myself. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6223.120000000001s)]
*  I already got it figured out. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6224.64s)]
*  I'm a stone cold killer. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6226.240000000001s)]
*  I'm on the target I'd never miss. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6227.64s)]
*  And they say that to themselves because they want to believe that. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6229.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6232.8s)]
*  And I'm not trying to change. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6233.8s)]
*  If you are a stone cold killer and you have a system on how you do it, that's awesome. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6235.280000000001s)]
*  But it's when you try to put it to somebody else. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6242.320000000001s)]
*  I didn't grow up being a good shot. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6245.6s)]
*  I grew up being a horrible shot, but just loving shooting so much that I wanted to figure [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6247.88s)]
*  it out. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6251.96s)]
*  And then I had these sounding boards of my determination well was deep with the sniper [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6252.96s)]
*  stuff, but I had the sounding board of bow hunting where I was constantly failing. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6257.12s)]
*  So if you have a system and you know how you do it, if you know exactly how you're going [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6261.36s)]
*  to shoot your next shot, then you don't need to change a thing. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6267.28s)]
*  But if you don't know, if there's any mystery in that, then that's a problem. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6270.88s)]
*  I mean, do you want to be the person that somebody calls you in a big old bull or whatever [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6276.04s)]
*  and you botch a super easy shot that you certainly should have made? [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6281.28s)]
*  There can be no mystery. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6286.28s)]
*  So if you don't have mystery, more power to you. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6287.48s)]
*  If there's any mystery in it, you better get it out. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6290.679999999999s)]
*  Because there are unique individuals that just keep their shit together. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6295.44s)]
*  Sure. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6298.5199999999995s)]
*  That's a personality thing. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6299.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6300.5199999999995s)]
*  And it is like these very calm people that just know how to stay calm. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6301.5199999999995s)]
*  But good luck teaching that. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6305.36s)]
*  You can teach someone to not be calm, but to work their way through it and still execute [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6308.32s)]
*  a perfect shot. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6313.48s)]
*  I don't usually put relaxation in any portion of the instruction because it's probably not [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6314.679999999999s)]
*  going to happen. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6318.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6319.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6320.24s)]
*  I don't, okay, this is the relaxed state. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6321.24s)]
*  This is the stage you, how are you going to do that? [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6322.24s)]
*  Well, you can do things to control your breathing and you can do things to control your heart [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6323.639999999999s)]
*  rate. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6328.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6329.12s)]
*  So that breathing and I don't know if it was on your podcast, but Huberman was talking [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6330.12s)]
*  about that. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6334.639999999999s)]
*  You inhale through your nose and then you give it an extra inhale. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6335.799999999999s)]
*  So you inhale to the top and then you do it again, which inflates different stuff in your [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6339.88s)]
*  lungs. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6345.240000000001s)]
*  Well, we always did combat breathing, right? [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6346.240000000001s)]
*  In through the nose for four, hold for four, out through the mouth for four, hold for four. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6348.400000000001s)]
*  That was what we always did in tactical stuff and that's the only breathing techniques I've [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6353.320000000001s)]
*  learned. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6358.0s)]
*  I listened to Huberman's thing and I used it at Vegas this year because Vegas, indoor [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6359.0s)]
*  archery is strange because it is just a yellow line on the floor. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6364.8s)]
*  It's the only thing that makes me nervous. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6371.2s)]
*  I shake like a dog crapping tax when I'm on that yellow line and say, this is your first [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6373.400000000001s)]
*  scoring in and everybody knows what that means. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6377.68s)]
*  I mean, it is a thing in indoor archery because your target is so small, right? [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6380.56s)]
*  And if Bodhi misses the 10 ring when he's shooting for his 900 in Vegas just to get [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6385.28s)]
*  to the shoot off, if you miss one time, your weekend is done. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6391.0s)]
*  You just lost six figures with one shot. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6396.88s)]
*  So much pressure. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6400.12s)]
*  So it's just indoor archery and I shoot bare bow and it's very competitive, but it's not, [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6401.76s)]
*  I mean, I can miss, I don't have to hit the 10 ring every time, but for some reason, I [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6407.68s)]
*  don't know if it's the expectation, but I shake like crazy in indoor archery and I invite [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6413.12s)]
*  it. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6418.96s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, this is a concentration test. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6420.12s)]
*  Now I'm getting through my fricking mechanoreceptive trigger no matter what. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6422.8s)]
*  I mean, you see people shoot their name tags and shoot them into the bleachers and it's [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6426.76s)]
*  dude, it's crazy. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6431.6s)]
*  It is a massive shit show in indoor archery. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6433.6s)]
*  It is amazing what that yellow line does to you on the floor. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6436.92s)]
*  But if you listen to your body when you're on that yellow line and it's for score, you [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6440.14s)]
*  can learn so much, right? [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6444.36s)]
*  At Lancaster, I get to shoot 60 arrows in a day on that line. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6447.240000000001s)]
*  And Vegas, I get to shoot 30 arrows a day, right? [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6452.280000000001s)]
*  You get to shoot one, two, maybe three arrows a year at Big Bull Elk and that's more than [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6455.04s)]
*  most people get, right? [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6460.04s)]
*  Most people get one shot in 10 years. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6461.52s)]
*  How in the world do you practice what's going to happen to your body? [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6463.8s)]
*  So getting on that line in indoor archery, I highly recommend people do that and shoot [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6467.8s)]
*  it for score. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6473.52s)]
*  Put some pressure on yourself, right? [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6474.52s)]
*  There's a lot of money at stake with these things and it's just, I can't find it anywhere [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6476.4s)]
*  else. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6481.599999999999s)]
*  But after doing Huberman's breathing technique, that was pretty cool this year. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6482.599999999999s)]
*  It was different. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6486.5599999999995s)]
*  And I watched that for some reason. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6487.5599999999995s)]
*  I watched it right before I was on the line in Vegas. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6488.839999999999s)]
*  So what is the specific thing that you do? [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6492.28s)]
*  So you breathe in through your nose to the top and then you give it an extra and you'll [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6494.12s)]
*  feel the tension, right? [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6500.639999999999s)]
*  And then it's a long exhale through the mouth and it's, I'm sure it does the same thing [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6502.1s)]
*  that combat breathing does, that box breathing, but it worked better and it's faster, right? [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6508.18s)]
*  Box breathing is, you've got several four counts in there. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6514.84s)]
*  We may not have enough time for that. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6518.22s)]
*  So I found it very valuable. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6519.9800000000005s)]
*  It was really cool stuff. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6521.900000000001s)]
*  Are you surprised that you're the only one that's put this to archery? [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6523.820000000001s)]
*  That you've mapped this out and we're talking about who knows how many hundreds of thousands [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6529.58s)]
*  of people are involved in competitive archery and bow hunting. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6535.3s)]
*  Are you surprised that the amount of time that people have been doing this and the amount [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6539.5s)]
*  of time that people have been dealing with it, as you said, there's like an entire industry [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6544.7s)]
*  that's built around target panic, but that no one has ever gotten to the root cause of [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6548.54s)]
*  recognize that not only is this applicable to archery, it's applicable to all high pressure [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6555.34s)]
*  situations where you have to physically perform. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6562.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6564.78s)]
*  So I think it was the perfect storm of the jobs that I had, right? [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6565.78s)]
*  Again, the sounding board of bow hunting, the job of tactical work, that's a rare combination. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6571.66s)]
*  So I think I needed it the worst because I was not good. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6580.94s)]
*  I was not good. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6584.82s)]
*  I was not in a good place in shooting. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6585.82s)]
*  I needed it the worst. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6588.0199999999995s)]
*  And that's what sent me down. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6589.299999999999s)]
*  I don't know why anybody didn't come up with that core problem because when you talk about [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6591.0599999999995s)]
*  it and you talk about it to very smart people, they're like, okay, why didn't I think of [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6596.78s)]
*  that? [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6602.299999999999s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know why you didn't think of that, but you didn't. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6603.299999999999s)]
*  And now it's copyrighted. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6605.54s)]
*  Thank God you did. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6609.900000000001s)]
*  You changed the way I shoot. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6612.5s)]
*  I know you've changed the way a lot of people shoot. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6614.46s)]
*  I've talked to people that use your program and I've talked to Peter Atiyah, who is one [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6616.700000000001s)]
*  of the most brilliant guys I know, is 100% all in on what you've taught and not just [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6620.740000000001s)]
*  with that but also with pistol shooting. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6626.04s)]
*  He's like, it's completely changed the way I shoot my pistol. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6628.14s)]
*  Completely changed my accuracy. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6631.9800000000005s)]
*  The results have been phenomenal. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6633.64s)]
*  And he's like, it's just so amazing that a person who, and I think it's very important [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6635.66s)]
*  that you experience so much failure because you had to come up with a method. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6643.5s)]
*  You weren't like a natural. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6648.139999999999s)]
*  You weren't like a naturally calm guy who just figures it out. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6649.38s)]
*  You're just this stone cold guy that under pressure, your heart never beats over 50 beats [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6653.0599999999995s)]
*  a minute. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6657.139999999999s)]
*  It's not you. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6658.139999999999s)]
*  So it's really kind of an amazing thing that sometimes you'll have these complex problems [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6659.14s)]
*  in these industries that are overwhelmed with people. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6666.5s)]
*  It's not like there's a tiny amount of people doing it, but one person finds this doorway [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6669.780000000001s)]
*  like, hey guys, there's a way out of this. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6675.54s)]
*  We've got to go this way. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6678.06s)]
*  And if enough people listen to you, again, one of the reasons why I want to talk to you [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6680.06s)]
*  about this is you're going to have a whole fucking show on archery. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6684.1s)]
*  Yes, but no, because I think it applies to so many things in life, the ability to stay [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6687.38s)]
*  in the moment and not lose your shit and have in your mind the very specific task you're [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6695.34s)]
*  trying to do and think about that only and do so with words, do so in your mind with [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6701.9800000000005s)]
*  words. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6708.900000000001s)]
*  So even though your fucking heart is racing, anxiety is at an all time high, there's all [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6709.900000000001s)]
*  this adrenaline you still can execute. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6715.82s)]
*  You still can do the thing that you want to do. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6718.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's powerful stuff, man. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6721.66s)]
*  It's powerful stuff, man. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6723.3s)]
*  Is it does it feel shocking that you're the guy that's figured this out? [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6725.66s)]
*  I can't believe I'm sitting here talking to you right now. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6731.0599999999995s)]
*  So it's I don't know, man. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6735.86s)]
*  I just I tried everything. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6739.3s)]
*  But it's the problem is I only tried. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6741.9s)]
*  Everything is not strong enough to override your central nervous system. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6744.74s)]
*  And that's what most people are looking. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6747.74s)]
*  They're just trying to do it. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6748.98s)]
*  I'm trying to get better. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6750.42s)]
*  I'm working on it. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6751.5s)]
*  This is not something you work on. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6752.5s)]
*  Either you do it or you don't. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6754.38s)]
*  We just had to figure out what the problem was, you know, and then figure out it's it's [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6755.94s)]
*  not it's it's simple, but it is not easy. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6761.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good way to put it. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6764.5s)]
*  Do you find that that applies to other things in your life that you've used these principles [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6767.099999999999s)]
*  in other ways? [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6773.3s)]
*  In other high pressure situations? [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6774.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6776.34s)]
*  Well, you know, coming into this this studio and seeing how much culture you have, like, [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6777.34s)]
*  man, I've lived a very narrow life. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6782.18s)]
*  So, I mean, my whole life has been about shooting. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6784.74s)]
*  It's been about archery. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6787.82s)]
*  Every job I've ever held has had to do with shooting. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6788.86s)]
*  And it's I use it, but I find decisions much easier now. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6792.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't have to say, oh, gee, should I do this? [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6797.78s)]
*  Should I do that? [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6800.0599999999995s)]
*  What's the problem? [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6801.0599999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6802.0599999999995s)]
*  What is the actual problem? [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6803.5s)]
*  What's the depth I need to get to in this problem? [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6804.9800000000005s)]
*  And then has anybody solved it before? [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6807.34s)]
*  And did they blueprint it? [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6809.740000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6811.14s)]
*  So figuring out problems in your life is so much easier now because people figured out [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6812.14s)]
*  most things, right? [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6817.38s)]
*  They just didn't happen to figure this one out. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6818.38s)]
*  So it's, you know, good for me, I guess. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6821.02s)]
*  But it's I use it. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6824.5s)]
*  But I'm a I'm a very determined person. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6826.660000000001s)]
*  I just didn't know where to put it. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6828.34s)]
*  You know, I was I've always been determined. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6830.38s)]
*  But didn't know where to put it. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6833.04s)]
*  So I have to show people how do you manufacture determination? [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6834.32s)]
*  Like how do you get enough determination to your cold plunge every day? [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6838.68s)]
*  Right. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6842.0s)]
*  That doesn't just happen. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6843.0s)]
*  You decide to do that. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6844.04s)]
*  So where is your determination come from? [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6845.98s)]
*  What is your why? [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6849.14s)]
*  And my why was that HR that I was in. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6850.5199999999995s)]
*  That was my why. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6853.9s)]
*  I knew that was going to happen. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6854.9s)]
*  I mean, it's probably going to happen. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6855.9s)]
*  So you have to be ready for it. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6858.26s)]
*  That's my why. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6860.2s)]
*  And it came to fruition. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6861.2s)]
*  And here we are. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6862.48s)]
*  But it's people got to figure out their why on on what they're doing. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6863.48s)]
*  And once they do that, they'll figure it out. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6868.04s)]
*  Have you talked to people that have applied this stuff to other things that have told [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6869.78s)]
*  you that this helps you with other things? [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6874.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6875.72s)]
*  So we're trying to figure I mean, I'm constantly racking my brain like how can I have the most [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6876.72s)]
*  impact? [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6880.88s)]
*  I've had a lot of impact on the shooting world. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6882.24s)]
*  How can I have impact on on other things? [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6884.84s)]
*  And I've had people tell me they use it for presentations. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6887.32s)]
*  I've had them tell me they use it for closing sales. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6890.56s)]
*  I've had them talk about just how they use it in business. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6894.120000000001s)]
*  Maybe a CEO making a decision. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6898.080000000001s)]
*  Surgeons I had a like I said, I had a surgeon come to me and he said he completely changed [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6901.72s)]
*  how he instructs surgery after the signature test and after learning. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6906.88s)]
*  He already knew open and closed loop control systems, but doctors seem to learn that stuff [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6913.120000000001s)]
*  very early on and it's not used that much in medical fields. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6917.4s)]
*  So it's way back in med school. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6922.799999999999s)]
*  So they don't really it was something they just kind of stored away and they don't think [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6925.599999999999s)]
*  about it anymore. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6928.639999999999s)]
*  But now when they have to teach somebody how to do something and they see the right movement, [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6929.839999999999s)]
*  they got to how do I keep that person in that movement? [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6934.88s)]
*  But you got to know how to translate this. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6938.0s)]
*  And it comes, you know, guides use it especially right hunting guides. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6940.88s)]
*  You've seen guides like shoot, shoot, shoot and their clients like, oh my God, you know, [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6945.12s)]
*  they just spent fifty thousand dollars on a doll sheep hunt and the guides yelling at [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6952.2s)]
*  him to shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6956.4s)]
*  Now hurry up. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6957.68s)]
*  Right. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6958.68s)]
*  What's the what's the client's mind going to do? [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6959.68s)]
*  They're going to go open loop like crazy. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6961.32s)]
*  I mean, guides deal with a way over 50 percent miss rate in any field that they do. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6963.64s)]
*  So I do a guide school where I teach guides how do you transfer this to a client instantly. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6969.54s)]
*  Right. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6974.879999999999s)]
*  When they're losing their mind, how do you get their consciousness into the trigger press? [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6975.4s)]
*  Because that's where it needs to be. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6979.799999999999s)]
*  So it's it's just it's amazing how how to do this stuff. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6981.599999999999s)]
*  It is amazing. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6985.5599999999995s)]
*  And I really feel like this could be expanded. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6986.599999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6989.36s)]
*  That you could expand this to many different things and that you could come in and explain [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6990.36s)]
*  to almost through archery. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6994.5599999999995s)]
*  You could explain this to people and they could apply it to other things in their life [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=6996.5599999999995s)]
*  because I find myself using it in other things where I'm in high pressure situations where [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7001.08s)]
*  I just talk myself through it and I stay in in my words and in my conscious mind and it [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7006.0s)]
*  makes a big difference. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7011.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7013.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7014.48s)]
*  There's there's lots of expansion to do and we're working on that right now. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7015.48s)]
*  Why do you shoot a long bow? [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7018.84s)]
*  Because to me when we practice, you're like what the F are you doing? [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7020.96s)]
*  You've abandoned technology in favor of this primitive device. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7025.2s)]
*  So basically concentration practice. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7029.96s)]
*  It's so much harder to shoot a stick bow like I have at my disposal. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7033.200000000001s)]
*  You know lots of people send bode bows right. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7039.320000000001s)]
*  So I have a garage full of compounds. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7041.68s)]
*  I shot my last critter with a compound in I think 2009. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7044.4400000000005s)]
*  Actually no that's a lie. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7049.320000000001s)]
*  I I shot a critter with a compound dish this past season just for it was a particular type [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7050.320000000001s)]
*  of bow that I wanted to shoot a deer with. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7056.620000000001s)]
*  So but compounds in general I shoot so much that they don't give me the challenge that [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7058.34s)]
*  I'm looking for. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7064.9800000000005s)]
*  As far as you know shooting competing. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7067.4400000000005s)]
*  I love to watch my arrow fly. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7071.06s)]
*  It is mystical to me like Ted Nugent right. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7073.26s)]
*  The mystical fly the arrow. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7076.34s)]
*  That's been real for me since I was seven years old. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7077.54s)]
*  So for me to come to control a shot with a long bow is the ultimate for me. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7080.38s)]
*  And like I said I mean I do lots of elk calling. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7088.5s)]
*  I call them in close. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7090.42s)]
*  It's a very effective weapon in my hands. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7092.4400000000005s)]
*  But a lot of people pick it up for the wrong reasons. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7095.36s)]
*  They pick it up because they want the simplicity. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7098.58s)]
*  They want the tradition. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7100.78s)]
*  They want all that stuff. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7101.78s)]
*  But then they lose any skill level that they have in their shot. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7102.78s)]
*  And it's you know I originally started shooting bare bow years and years ago with no sights [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7106.86s)]
*  because I could never put a pin on the target. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7112.5s)]
*  So were you shooting a compound bow instinctively. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7115.34s)]
*  Yeah I know Nugent shot like that for a long time. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7118.5599999999995s)]
*  And that's where I got it from. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7120.679999999999s)]
*  I watched his Spirit of the Wild VHS tape when I'm like 10 years old. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7121.76s)]
*  I'm like I want to be like Ted Nugent. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7125.48s)]
*  So I started shooting a compound bare bow and I couldn't put my sight on it anyways. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7127.679999999999s)]
*  My mom bought me a Martin Lynx Magnum. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7132.8s)]
*  I had sight pins on it and I'm like I can't even you know like I can't even get these. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7136.16s)]
*  It was a nightmare. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7141.36s)]
*  Shoot with your fingers you know your brains connected to your release. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7142.36s)]
*  So it's just it's the ultimate challenge for me to shoot these long bows. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7145.98s)]
*  And I've I've harvested lots of critters now and I'm constantly using them for concentration [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7150.0199999999995s)]
*  practice. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7155.7s)]
*  I just love shooting stick bows man. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7156.7s)]
*  It's so cool. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7159.139999999999s)]
*  I know the people that do it the people that shoot recurves and traditional long bows they [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7160.139999999999s)]
*  say that there's nothing like it. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7165.82s)]
*  They say that once you develop accuracy with that. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7167.639999999999s)]
*  That it's like Aaron Schneider who's an amazing shot. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7171.5s)]
*  He shot for a few years. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7175.599999999999s)]
*  He only shot with a recurve bow because he wanted to show everybody that he could be [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7176.959999999999s)]
*  just as effective as hunters are with you know traditional with compound bows and high [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7181.719999999999s)]
*  tech equipment. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7187.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7188.679999999999s)]
*  That he could do it with old school. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7189.679999999999s)]
*  It's it's a lot harder because I mean you imagine those bowls coming in. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7190.679999999999s)]
*  You can't draw and hold it right. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7194.0s)]
*  So your timing of your draw is is much more. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7196.32s)]
*  How long can you hold your bow back. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7199.5599999999995s)]
*  I can hold for about 30 seconds and to and shoot a controlled shot. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7201.820000000001s)]
*  But I'm shaking like a dog crapping tax because you pull the people need to understand is [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7206.42s)]
*  that a compound bow is very difficult to pull back in the beginning. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7211.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7214.820000000001s)]
*  The nature of the cam system and the mechanics involved in it. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7215.820000000001s)]
*  It has a very high let off. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7219.1s)]
*  So a lot of bows have like an 80 percent let off which means for the people just listening [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7221.02s)]
*  it's 80 percent less hard to hold it than it is to pull it. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7227.18s)]
*  So when you're at full draw I can hold a full draw for a minute and a half two minutes and [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7231.88s)]
*  just and stay there as long as I'm not completely trying to be absolutely steady and aiming [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7236.679999999999s)]
*  like I can hold a full draw and just relax my arm and then lift it up and then go through [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7242.4s)]
*  my shot process and I'm not compromised. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7247.48s)]
*  Right. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7249.599999999999s)]
*  But you can't do that with no it just gets it just gets harder and harder. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7250.599999999999s)]
*  So your your body mechanics come into play and you know a holding position and all that [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7254.24s)]
*  stuff and then you know there's this there's this purity of traditional archery where people [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7259.42s)]
*  like they don't want to shoot with a mechanoreceptive trigger like they don't want to shoot with [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7264.0599999999995s)]
*  a clicker they don't want to shoot with. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7268.259999999999s)]
*  I've come up with all kinds of tabs here grips here internal triggers feathered and knows [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7269.98s)]
*  all this stuff that's all in the online course but people don't want to shoot it because [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7275.0599999999995s)]
*  they don't think it's pure. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7279.54s)]
*  Right. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7281.42s)]
*  But they are really chasing the ghost like I've come up with some new triggerless ways [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7282.42s)]
*  to shoot triggerless that are really cool where we incorporate like a safety system [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7287.400000000001s)]
*  but it's it's very difficult to shoot a stick bow just by allowing your subconscious to [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7290.96s)]
*  tell itself when to let go. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7298.24s)]
*  You are constantly dealing with pre-ignition movements. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7299.76s)]
*  Yeah that's what I don't understand because I would think that with you when you want [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7302.400000000001s)]
*  the surprise shot when you're shooting traditionally and I know you were using a thumb ring for [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7307.06s)]
*  a while like the Mongols do. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7312.8s)]
*  There's something to that too right where it like passes over it. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7315.32s)]
*  No you how does that work. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7318.66s)]
*  I mean you're just basically holding on to that thing you've got the ring that covers [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7320.139999999999s)]
*  the pad of your thumb and your index finger goes over the top of it but you have to release [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7323.139999999999s)]
*  that as well. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7327.7s)]
*  You have to release it. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7328.7s)]
*  So we use mechanoreceptive triggers like a grips here so a grips here would be like [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7329.7s)]
*  you put your fingernail on the edge of the riser so you draw back an aim and then you [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7335.42s)]
*  start pressing that like a like you would roll your release you just start pressing [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7341.1s)]
*  that when that pops off of there pops off the edge of your riser you know you really [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7345.02s)]
*  the mechanoreceptors send the signal your brain your brain sends the release motor program [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7348.68s)]
*  so it's like pop boop off it goes then your surprise break happens. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7352.820000000001s)]
*  But you're still releasing it consciously. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7357.02s)]
*  No no your subconscious it's just sends that motor program which is open loop but it can't [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7359.780000000001s)]
*  get in the middle of that. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7365.5s)]
*  When that pops this thing releases to the point where it can't the subconscious can't [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7368.18s)]
*  get in the middle. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7374.18s)]
*  Why did the Mongols choose to shoot bows that way? [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7375.24s)]
*  So it's all based on mounted archery so when you shoot when you shoot I mean their arrows [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7379.26s)]
*  on the other side of the bow so when you when you're riding your horse with no hands right [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7383.58s)]
*  you've got your bow on one hand you've got your arrow in the other and those come together [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7389.16s)]
*  they didn't go over the bow they brought them together and then they grab on to the arrow. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7393.18s)]
*  Their arrow was on the right side of the bow even if they were right handed? [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7396.98s)]
*  Well yeah so they're right handed arrow comes in this way so then they grab on to the arrow [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7399.94s)]
*  remember they're riding their horse right so they're bouncing up and down and then they [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7405.5s)]
*  grab on to it and they push the arrow forward and they knock it and they put their thumb [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7409.219999999999s)]
*  around it and it's the pressure of their finger against the knock that holds it against the [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7413.459999999999s)]
*  bow. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7419.219999999999s)]
*  So if they're shooting right handed is their arrow on the right side of the bow so it's [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7420.219999999999s)]
*  not on the left side of the bow like a compound bow? [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7423.54s)]
*  It's on the right side of the bow. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7425.419999999999s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7426.86s)]
*  And it's the pressure of your finger that holds it against there so that when they're [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7427.86s)]
*  riding they shoot. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7430.7s)]
*  But why a thumb why can't you do that with with like detritional finger tabs? [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7432.78s)]
*  Because when you when you grab on it with your fingers it's you're pushing you're not [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7437.84s)]
*  able to push it not put enough pressure on it to hold it in there and it's it has to [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7442.9400000000005s)]
*  do with arrow paradox and it's all kinds of weird stuff so when you'll see a horse mounted [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7448.1s)]
*  archer when they shoot they'll actually flip their bow because those bows aren't cut to [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7452.42s)]
*  center so they're cut the arrows pointed way to the right like a right-handed shooter [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7456.74s)]
*  their arrow is pointed way to the right because that bow if you notice it's not narrowed at [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7461.86s)]
*  all or it's very narrow I mean just a little bit. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7465.62s)]
*  So the width of the bow forces the arrow off the side. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7468.9400000000005s)]
*  So that arrow is pointed way out to the right so you have to actually flip it so that the [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7471.54s)]
*  string comes behind the arrow so it shoots straight where you're looking it's called [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7476.34s)]
*  Oh wow. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7480.219999999999s)]
*  So there's I mean it's so cool how they did that stuff they are so much smarter than we [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7481.219999999999s)]
*  are now. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7487.62s)]
*  Well it's I mean it was out of necessity right because they're using them for war and for [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7488.62s)]
*  hunting so but the thumb thing had other people figured that out? [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7493.46s)]
*  Well it was mostly in the Asian cultures and because it was mounted archery the Japanese [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7499.98s)]
*  have Kudo archery and that's what we know now is basically on the ground a martial art [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7505.28s)]
*  type of archery but it was original I mean the Yumi bow has got a short bottom limb so [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7510.599999999999s)]
*  that it could maneuver over the horse. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7514.76s)]
*  So all that stuff was all war driven and with these with your thumb you can draw back so [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7517.4s)]
*  much farther I mean you've got short little people that are with a 34 inch draw length [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7523.36s)]
*  right because you have extra inches with your thumb right you got I mean when I shoot my [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7528.84s)]
*  thumb my draw length is two and a half inches longer than with my fingers so I can get into [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7533.18s)]
*  way better alignment and yeah it's really cool stuff. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7537.5s)]
*  And then the Mongols figured out a way they made was it out of bone the thumb ring that [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7542.1s)]
*  they had? [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7547.38s)]
*  Ivory jade they made it out of all kind of brass whatever they had. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7548.38s)]
*  So you can find Jamie you can find Mongol archery thumb rings because. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7551.700000000001s)]
*  That is a different than that. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7557.740000000001s)]
*  Oh look at that guy. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7559.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah you see how his bow is tilted that way? [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7560.820000000001s)]
*  So that he has produced Katra with that. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7563.179999999999s)]
*  So this man is shooting as he is bow flip like that? [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7566.099999999999s)]
*  As he's riding a horse. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7571.0599999999995s)]
*  Now the Comanche were particularly adept at shooting while on horseback as well. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7572.599999999999s)]
*  Did they use a similar method? [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7579.139999999999s)]
*  They have there's been so many different holds on a string and it was all based on basically [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7580.78s)]
*  wartime and did they have to shoot off a horse or not. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7586.179999999999s)]
*  There was pinch draws there was different ways of holding a bow upside down there was [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7589.28s)]
*  I don't know specifically what the Comanche did but all kinds of different ways of holding [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7593.84s)]
*  the string and it was all based on necessity or the length of the bow you know particular [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7598.759999999999s)]
*  length of the bow so it could be over a horse shoot it mounted shoot it you know like what [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7603.32s)]
*  we do now we have bow or blinds that are too short for stick bows so we shoot shorter shorter [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7607.219999999999s)]
*  recurves you know. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7612.719999999999s)]
*  So it's always fashioned to what the game is. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7614.32s)]
*  The Mongols would shoot while the horse was in the air like they would time the shot so [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7618.26s)]
*  that as the horse was leaping in the air there was less impact. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7624.14s)]
*  So that's when they would drum drum drum. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7628.52s)]
*  That's when they would they would release the bow. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7632.22s)]
*  It's all a feeling that comes up and you feel that impact and it becomes a timing thing [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7634.34s)]
*  and when you're I mean you can your subconscious can put so many things together but you know [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7637.9800000000005s)]
*  you take that that style of archery and you put it into precision it's very it's pretty [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7644.14s)]
*  difficult do you find Mongol thumb ring this is it's a very interesting thing when you [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7649.54s)]
*  see what it looks like it's a thing that sits on your thumb yeah that almost looks like [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7655.860000000001s)]
*  the bottom of a spoon. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7660.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7662.18s)]
*  So that's a leather one. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7663.18s)]
*  If you have like custom thumb rings like there's another one. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7664.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7668.5s)]
*  So there's one that bone one right there that you see over there on the right hand side. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7669.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7672.34s)]
*  So you just that that sits on that ledge which makes it illegal for competition but you can [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7674.3s)]
*  hold the legal and competition you can't shoot rings and competition. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7680.02s)]
*  Why is that because they considered a release aid because they've never shot one they don't [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7683.26s)]
*  know how difficult it is really interesting. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7687.7s)]
*  But so that hooks onto that ledge and you can hold so much weight because the weight [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7689.82s)]
*  I mean some of these guys are shooting like one hundred and ten pound horse bows and you [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7695.58s)]
*  know that's a leather one there. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7700.62s)]
*  Are you allowed to use a leather one. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7703.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7704.26s)]
*  So you can shoot a leather one but you can't use one of the bone ones because of that little [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7705.26s)]
*  ledge where the string sits. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7708.900000000001s)]
*  Yep. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7711.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7712.46s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7713.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7714.46s)]
*  It's pretty cool. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7715.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7716.46s)]
*  And so you said it's all Asian cultures that mostly yeah mostly but and they're all different [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7717.46s)]
*  types like every culture had a different like the Ottomans had a certain one and they had [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7721.02s)]
*  a thumb ring as well. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7726.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7727.62s)]
*  The Ottomans the Turks. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7728.62s)]
*  I mean it was all it's all different types the gosh there's all kinds of them. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7729.86s)]
*  Do we know the history of the thumb release. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7734.5s)]
*  Do we know like when that started. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7736.78s)]
*  I mean they found it in tombs. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7738.299999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7741.139999999999s)]
*  It's old. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7742.139999999999s)]
*  I mean it's how archery started as far as I know. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7743.42s)]
*  So I just I love shooting that way. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7746.86s)]
*  It's really the sight picture that you get when your arrows on the other side of the [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7749.54s)]
*  bow and when you have a modern bow that's cut to center you don't have to do the contra [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7752.42s)]
*  thing. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7756.5s)]
*  So when I draw back like so when I hunt with my thumb I don't have to judge range because [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7757.5s)]
*  I'm looking at the arrow from the side right. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7762.74s)]
*  Like my eye is not 12 o'clock on the arrow it's at 10 o'clock so I pull it back to where [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7765.62s)]
*  the arrow is off to the side slightly looking right down. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7769.82s)]
*  I'm looking down like at 10 o'clock. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7774.74s)]
*  My eyes like at 10 o'clock on the shaft so I can see the ramp from the side so I can [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7776.9s)]
*  see the pitch and because the bows cut past center I can still put the point directly [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7780.42s)]
*  It's like a triangulation type aim. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7786.62s)]
*  It's really cool man. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7788.179999999999s)]
*  And are you thinking about it the same way you think about throwing a rock or a baseball? [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7789.42s)]
*  If you throw a baseball you kind of know how what the arc of the ball is going to be if [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7795.139999999999s)]
*  you throw a lot of baseball. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7801.46s)]
*  So you can kind of like throw it into that very specific spot. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7802.46s)]
*  But you're setting it. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7806.62s)]
*  I mean you're literally setting it on the trajectory path and you've seen it thousands [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7807.62s)]
*  of times. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7811.38s)]
*  You can draw back and like that's going to do it right there and they just drop in. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7812.86s)]
*  It's so cool. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7817.06s)]
*  It's got to be something that you must practice more than a compound bow then right to get [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7818.06s)]
*  that feel of it. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7822.9800000000005s)]
*  Your mind picks up the trajectory path very quickly and then the control is the same. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7824.5s)]
*  You have to talk yourself through specific moments but the anxiety is higher because [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7829.9400000000005s)]
*  your body is under more tension. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7833.66s)]
*  It's the ultimate in concentration practice as far as I know. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7836.9400000000005s)]
*  A lot of people use it as a method of meditation. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7840.86s)]
*  It is a martial art but for a lot of people there's something about and I think this with [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7846.3s)]
*  a compound bow as well. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7851.42s)]
*  There's something about the concentration that's required to shoot a great shot that [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7853.0199999999995s)]
*  clears your mind of everything else. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7859.259999999999s)]
*  It's almost like a cleaning. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7862.0199999999995s)]
*  Like a cleaning of the subconscious and all the stuff that's bothering you. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7864.9s)]
*  You get out there and it frees your mind. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7869.66s)]
*  If you don't free your mind then you're going to go open loop. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7872.0199999999995s)]
*  So you're practicing clearing the slate every time. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7876.0599999999995s)]
*  Every time that you knock another arrow it's a whole other thing. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7880.46s)]
*  You got to make the same decisions. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7885.54s)]
*  You got to do the same concentration. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7886.98s)]
*  All that stuff. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7889.38s)]
*  It's a fascinating thing isn't it? [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7890.38s)]
*  It's such a fascinating thing where you take difficult tasks and use them as a vehicle [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7895.26s)]
*  for developing your concentration, your potential and other things. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7902.820000000001s)]
*  It's the same thing we do with cold plunging. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7907.54s)]
*  But you don't have to make, when you do your cold plunge, get out of that and shoot an [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7911.820000000001s)]
*  arrow instantly. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7916.06s)]
*  Then that's when you're constantly bringing your mind back. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7919.06s)]
*  You're shooting on one foot. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7923.34s)]
*  You're shooting on balance balls. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7924.7s)]
*  So you get practice in bringing your mind back where it needs to be. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7926.0199999999995s)]
*  A lot of people don't do that. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7930.62s)]
*  They just shoot and shoot and shoot. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7931.62s)]
*  One of the things that bothers me is there's celebrities out there that will take instruction [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7933.22s)]
*  from somebody and I watch them shoot and they punch the trigger. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7940.38s)]
*  Their first time they're doing it I'm like, oh god. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7944.3s)]
*  So when someone's teaching someone how to shoot a bow, yeah they always punch the trigger. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7948.0199999999995s)]
*  And they hit the balloon or whatever. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7951.98s)]
*  That was awesome that you did that and that you got into archery and you're understanding [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7956.339999999999s)]
*  some of these things. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7959.179999999999s)]
*  But man, you're on a bad path. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7960.179999999999s)]
*  But the thing is it's very difficult for those people if you have an elite bow hunter to [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7965.58s)]
*  explain that to this beginner they're giving a bow to. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7972.259999999999s)]
*  They just want them to feel good about hitting the target. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7975.219999999999s)]
*  And that's all good. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7978.78s)]
*  That's all good stuff. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7979.78s)]
*  I analyze everybody's shots and I'm like, oh god. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7981.38s)]
*  Right, I know. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7984.62s)]
*  It's just this thing where you know that this is going to lead down a very particular path [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7986.02s)]
*  that you've been and I've been and so many other people have been. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7991.14s)]
*  You don't know what you're getting into here. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7994.54s)]
*  I know guys that are sort of aspiring bow hunters and I see them practice and I watch [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=7998.02s)]
*  them on Instagram and I'm watching practice and I'm like, eee. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8006.66s)]
*  They're practicing their own failure. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8009.9s)]
*  They're hammering it buddy. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8011.379999999999s)]
*  And you're shooting 20 yards away so you're getting into a reasonable range of success [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8013.78s)]
*  and like, look at my group. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8018.7s)]
*  I'm like, good job. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8020.66s)]
*  Good job. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8023.4s)]
*  I don't want to dissuade people from that. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8024.4s)]
*  Right. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8026.66s)]
*  But we gotta talk. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8027.66s)]
*  Do you think that someone can be a trigger puncher, meaning command that trigger, but [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8028.66s)]
*  so along with these principles where you're like drawing back and aiming, setting it in [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8036.74s)]
*  and just pull, pull, pull, pull, pull with your finger and have it go off. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8044.54s)]
*  Yeah, but you wouldn't be punching it. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8049.26s)]
*  You wouldn't be punching it. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8051.7s)]
*  If you can work an archery release, index finger trigger, like you would a fine rifle [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8053.46s)]
*  trigger, then more power to you. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8058.1s)]
*  It takes massive mental fortitude to do that. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8061.14s)]
*  So we usually start people with the pulling where you hook in and then you pull your hand [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8063.42s)]
*  through the strap. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8067.74s)]
*  And then once they gain control of that and they blueprint it, then we move them on to [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8069.06s)]
*  what we call the power squeeze, which is you link a couple of motor programs. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8072.54s)]
*  So you actually, you're increasing expansion and you're moving your finger and it, one [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8076.22s)]
*  gives the other guidance and you're guiding them both through words or sounds. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8081.9800000000005s)]
*  And that's more accurate because the main thing with release aids that people need to [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8087.1s)]
*  realize is no matter what the movement is, it's got to be closed loop and it can't move [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8091.38s)]
*  the head of the release. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8097.3s)]
*  Like if you are, like let's say you're shooting your hinge and you're pulling on it, but you're [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8099.38s)]
*  not actually rotating it. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8103.38s)]
*  You may be pulling but not rotating. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8105.58s)]
*  So you're just increasing pressure in the bow. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8107.74s)]
*  That arrow is not going in the X. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8110.02s)]
*  Right. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8111.34s)]
*  Right. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8112.34s)]
*  So you have to be able to link those things up and know what the movement actually is [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8113.34s)]
*  that you need to do. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8118.9400000000005s)]
*  Lee Likoski, he takes his, he has a Carter Target 4 and he loops his hand around the [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8120.700000000001s)]
*  trigger and he makes a fist. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8128.34s)]
*  That's how he does it. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8130.34s)]
*  So instead of pulling the trigger or punching the trigger, he just squeezes his fist and [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8131.38s)]
*  he knows it's going to go off eventually. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8136.3s)]
*  That's an easy movement to evaluate, right? [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8137.860000000001s)]
*  Like I said, I don't care what the movement is as long as it's closed loop and it doesn't [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8139.96s)]
*  move the head of the release. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8143.4400000000005s)]
*  That's why we don't pull on hinges. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8145.1s)]
*  Usually we roll it with our fingers. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8146.820000000001s)]
*  That seems to be more accurate. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8148.62s)]
*  Thumb buttons, there's all kinds of different movements you can do on a thumb button. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8150.14s)]
*  As long as it's closed loop, then pick the one you can evaluate the best. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8152.9800000000005s)]
*  Do you find that you get a lot of resistance to this? [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8157.22s)]
*  Do you find that people are upset at some of the things you teach? [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8162.02s)]
*  People that are very successful? [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8165.18s)]
*  Have you found any of that? [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8166.18s)]
*  Not so much because when I explain it to them, they're like, because I'm talking about exactly [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8167.700000000001s)]
*  what they do and I know what's going through their head. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8173.54s)]
*  If they are, I know where their success is. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8177.42s)]
*  Is it very high level? [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8181.18s)]
*  There's no question that you're going to do it or is there still some mystery in your [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8183.34s)]
*  shot? [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8187.02s)]
*  It's easy for me to explain because of where I've come from. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8188.02s)]
*  I've been in the trenches, right? [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8191.7s)]
*  I was not good at this stuff. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8193.9s)]
*  I don't think there are any natural born shooters. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8196.54s)]
*  I think there are natural born decision makers. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8198.54s)]
*  That's where you get these determined people that make decisions and they can be successful [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8201.9s)]
*  in whatever their field is, especially if it's shooting or whatever. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8207.619999999999s)]
*  If you don't have enough determination, and that's where young people fall off because [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8212.82s)]
*  they haven't seen the adversity. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8218.1s)]
*  They don't have the perspective. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8220.46s)]
*  They don't have the determination to actually override their own central nervous system. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8221.66s)]
*  You see lots of little kids that start out punching the trigger and their parents don't [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8226.5s)]
*  know what to do with them and the kids just get frustrated and then they leave. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8230.22s)]
*  Archery just lost another one. [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8236.26s)]
*  Whereas if you get them in control, then archery becomes this really cool thing that you can [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8238.38s)]
*  do and you can be really good at. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8244.58s)]
*  Maybe you're not good at other sports, but you can damn sure be good at archery if you [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8248.119999999999s)]
*  know how to control your mind. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8252.14s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't require a lot of athleticism. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8253.14s)]
*  It just requires very specific movements that almost anybody can get their body to do. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8255.82s)]
*  I think it's such a valuable tool for life. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8261.58s)]
*  I really do. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8264.86s)]
*  I think archery in general, but concentrating on a specific thing that's difficult to do [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8266.3s)]
*  is so valuable for life. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8274.02s)]
*  Because if you can do that, it makes other things that seemed to be difficult before [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8276.34s)]
*  extreme difficulty of archery, it makes them seem easier. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8282.44s)]
*  I think that's the key to life is to do difficult things. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8286.6s)]
*  Because if you do really difficult things, it makes other things less difficult. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8290.36s)]
*  You see it on the internet everywhere. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8295.800000000001s)]
*  It's becoming an industry. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8297.36s)]
*  Motivation is becoming an industry. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8299.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's a problem because a lot of these people are motivating people who haven't done [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8300.720000000001s)]
*  jack shit. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8304.08s)]
*  That drives me nuts. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8305.08s)]
*  When I see these people, I'm like, what have you done? [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8306.08s)]
*  I want to see you under pressure. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8309.04s)]
*  Show me what you've done when your fucking back is against the wall. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8310.800000000001s)]
*  Don't just tell people what they can do. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8314.48s)]
*  I want to know what have you... [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8316.16s)]
*  If I hear motivation from David Goggins, I'm like, okay, I'm listening. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8317.800000000001s)]
*  He's done it. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8322.32s)]
*  I hear motivation from Cam Haynes. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8323.32s)]
*  That's a guy who's talking from experience. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8324.54s)]
*  That's what I want to hear. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8327.0s)]
*  The problem with motivation is that there's a desire to be motivated. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8328.18s)]
*  So there's people that want to meet that desire and some of them are just unqualified. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8333.4s)]
*  It's like bad martial arts instruction. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8337.84s)]
*  There's a lot of it out there because people want to learn how to fight and some are like, [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8339.88s)]
*  oh, I know what I'll do. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8343.279999999999s)]
*  I'll teach people how to do martial arts. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8344.279999999999s)]
*  But they don't even know what the fuck they're doing. [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8345.64s)]
*  So you see fake martial arts techniques. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8347.199999999999s)]
*  You have to research your instructors. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8350.0s)]
*  If they haven't been there and done that and if they haven't blueprinted it, then it's [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8353.56s)]
*  a problem. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8359.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8360.72s)]
*  How long did it take you to blueprint the Shot IQ system? [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8361.72s)]
*  Because it's a very comprehensive system. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8364.119999999999s)]
*  For people that don't know, if you go to Joel's website, shotiq.com, there's a whole series [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8366.44s)]
*  of things that you have to go through and steps. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8373.16s)]
*  I'm going to be honest, I didn't go through most of them. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8377.36s)]
*  I went through some of them and I kind of got the gist of it. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8379.4s)]
*  But then talking to you, when you maybe do the handwriting thing, I'm like, okay, now [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8382.08s)]
*  I understand what he's saying. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8386.800000000001s)]
*  You have to be very specific about each individual fine motor skill that's involved in this. [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8388.04s)]
*  And I'm like, okay, I get it. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8397.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8398.48s)]
*  I mean, it took me a lifetime. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8399.48s)]
*  On December 14th, 2014 is when I realized the decisions that were made to make those [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8401.16s)]
*  two shots successful and conscious. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8407.16s)]
*  And that's right after that, I'm like, okay, how do I blueprint this? [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8410.359999999999s)]
*  What decisions do I need to make? [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8415.199999999999s)]
*  When do I need to make them? [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8417.119999999999s)]
*  And how do I carry them out? [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8418.4s)]
*  How did you go about mapping it out and writing this program? [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8419.64s)]
*  Because your program is so comprehensive. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8423.0s)]
*  It seems like there was a lot of refining involved in this. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8425.0s)]
*  It basically, I mean, I shot those, it all comes back to those two shots because I'm [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8428.92s)]
*  like, okay, I said this at this moment. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8433.84s)]
*  I said this at this moment. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8436.72s)]
*  And I said this at this moment. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8438.56s)]
*  And that was the mapping of the decisions. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8440.52s)]
*  And then once you do that, then you just, how do you put this, where do you need to [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8443.52s)]
*  put the concentration? [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8447.8s)]
*  You need to put it in shot activation movement. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8448.8s)]
*  How do you put it there? [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8451.68s)]
*  Or making a sound. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8454.32s)]
*  Could you stop it? [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8456.32s)]
*  That's the test, right? [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8457.32s)]
*  You're not truly in closed loop if you couldn't stop it in the middle of it. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8459.2s)]
*  And then what decision did I make? [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8462.36s)]
*  And that, those four questions basically encompass the blueprint. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8463.68s)]
*  If you can answer those four questions, you know exactly how you did it. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8467.2s)]
*  Then and only then can you repeat it. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8472.52s)]
*  So and like I put it in this analogy of the shot control house. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8475.52s)]
*  So if you are about to shoot a shot and you know what this moment feels like, you're like, [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8480.68s)]
*  oh my God, this is going to happen, right? [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8486.4s)]
*  That bull's coming in and it just turns broadside or you're standing on the line of baggage [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8488.48s)]
*  like, okay, this is it. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8492.36s)]
*  You are now on the porch of the shot control house, but you don't get inside because the [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8494.800000000001s)]
*  door is closed. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8499.720000000001s)]
*  Your shot process lives inside the house. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8500.720000000001s)]
*  And so there you are on the porch. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8503.56s)]
*  How do I get the door open? [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8505.92s)]
*  You got to decide, right? [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8507.36s)]
*  The door is open doors in the shot control house. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8509.08s)]
*  So I say to myself, I'm shooting this shot with control no matter what. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8511.68s)]
*  Because it used to be, I'm going to shoot this shot perfectly or not at all. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8515.48s)]
*  But that was a bailout. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8519.0s)]
*  Remember the let down thing, right? [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8520.2s)]
*  That was a bailout. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8521.76s)]
*  That gave me that option of letting down. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8522.76s)]
*  I don't say that anymore. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8524.4s)]
*  Now it's, I'm shooting this shot with control no matter what. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8525.48s)]
*  Because no matter what is a determined statement that we use in everyday speech. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8528.88s)]
*  Yeah? [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8532.36s)]
*  So I'm shooting this shot with control no matter what. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8533.36s)]
*  Door opens, right? [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8536.32s)]
*  And then you drawing your bow back as you stepping through the door. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8537.92s)]
*  The first room that you walk into is the aiming room. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8540.78s)]
*  And everybody wants to stay in there. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8544.16s)]
*  That's where all your buddies are, right? [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8545.6s)]
*  Like, hey Joe, what's up? [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8547.2s)]
*  Stay in here with us, right? [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8548.68s)]
*  There's all kinds of craze. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8550.04s)]
*  There's disco balls and all kinds of things going on in there. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8551.16s)]
*  And you're like, man, this is pretty cool. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8554.16s)]
*  I think I'll just have a seat on the couch. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8556.48s)]
*  And that's what most people do is they sit on the couch in there and they never get out [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8558.08s)]
*  of the aiming room. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8561.0s)]
*  So what I want people to do is get your aim done quickly. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8562.38s)]
*  Don't be bringing your pin up from the bottom or down from the top. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8565.08s)]
*  You shouldn't be able to tell me what position or what direction your pin comes from. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8567.96s)]
*  Just stick the damn thing on the target and then watch it to keep it. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8572.0s)]
*  So don't linger in the aiming room, right? [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8576.02s)]
*  Don't look at the pictures on the wall. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8578.48s)]
*  Don't sit on the couch. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8579.76s)]
*  Don't talk to anybody in there. [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8580.76s)]
*  Just put on the blinders and walk through the room. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8582.12s)]
*  Why watch it to keep it? [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8585.0s)]
*  Because that's how visual proprioception works, right? [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8586.84s)]
*  You watch the system and it will automatically center itself. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8589.18s)]
*  So you just watch the picture and it will stay in the middle. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8593.46s)]
*  Yes, it's going to move around, but whichever way it moves, its next movement is always [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8596.5s)]
*  back to the center, right? [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8600.3s)]
*  So you don't need to talk to anybody in the aiming room. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8602.46s)]
*  That's going to happen, right? [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8604.759999999998s)]
*  Just walk through it. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8606.119999999999s)]
*  So you on a hinge release, you rolling to the click, right? [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8608.24s)]
*  That is you closing the door. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8612.779999999999s)]
*  In fact, that click that it makes is not the click on the release. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8614.66s)]
*  That's the click of you closing the door on the aiming room, right? [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8617.859999999999s)]
*  So now you're out of that room. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8621.38s)]
*  You don't have control of what happens in that room, but man, it sounded so fun in there, [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8623.08s)]
*  right? [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8628.12s)]
*  So your mind wants to go back in there and check on it. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8629.12s)]
*  So you don't let it go back in there. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8632.08s)]
*  You lock that door with here I go, right? [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8634.02s)]
*  But you're still looking at where you want to hit. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8636.24s)]
*  Sure. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8638.44s)]
*  Oh yeah, you should keep watching the picture. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8639.44s)]
*  It's like you're looking in the aiming room, but you're not in the room anymore. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8640.44s)]
*  You're looking through the window, right? [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8644.12s)]
*  You're keeping an eye on things in there, but you don't really have control of what [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8646.14s)]
*  goes on in that room anymore. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8649.36s)]
*  So you lock the door with here I go. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8651.6s)]
*  Here I go also opens the door on the concentration room, right? [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8654.24s)]
*  But here's the problem. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8657.960000000001s)]
*  The concentration room is on fire. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8659.24s)]
*  How much determination would it take for you to walk into a room that's on fire knowing [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8661.960000000001s)]
*  that you're going to get burnt? [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8667.800000000001s)]
*  For most people, it takes a loved one in that room, right? [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8669.76s)]
*  The task is no different. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8673.12s)]
*  Walking into the room is no different. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8674.68s)]
*  The task itself is the same, but your determination level is different, right? [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8676.76s)]
*  You have a loved one in that room. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8683.28s)]
*  Now your determination to get in there and save that person is through the roof, right? [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8684.56s)]
*  That's the determination that has to be manufactured for you to walk into the concentration room, [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8689.92s)]
*  right? [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8694.72s)]
*  And when you walk in there, here's the other bad part about it. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8695.72s)]
*  You're getting burnt constantly. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8698.32s)]
*  When's this thing going to go off? [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8699.92s)]
*  Oh my God, it's a seven by seven. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8700.92s)]
*  I'm going to be a hero. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8702.4s)]
*  Cam Haynes is watching me, right? [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8703.880000000001s)]
*  You've got all these thoughts that are coming in and you can only walk through that room [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8705.72s)]
*  slow enough you could stop your step anywhere within it, all the time you're getting burnt, [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8710.56s)]
*  right? [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8715.679999999998s)]
*  So that's why you have to be the loudest one in the room because to do that, to walk through [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8716.679999999998s)]
*  a room slowly while you're getting burnt, you would have to concentrate on your movement, [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8720.119999999999s)]
*  right? [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8725.199999999999s)]
*  And that's where you've got to talk yourself through your walking. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8726.199999999999s)]
*  That's you rolling through that hinge, right? [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8729.08s)]
*  Roll, pull or roll or whatever you say to yourself to direct your concentration. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8731.24s)]
*  So there you are and you're working through that, getting burnt the whole time, but you're [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8736.64s)]
*  the loudest one in the room and pop, it breaks. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8740.6s)]
*  That's you jumping out the back door of the house, right? [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8743.56s)]
*  When you knock another arrow, you got to walk around to the front yard and you got to step [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8746.28s)]
*  up on the porch again, right? [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8750.72s)]
*  All the doors close in the house. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8753.88s)]
*  So you got to make the same decision to get through the door. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8755.88s)]
*  But what I want for people is I want them to kick everybody out of the aiming room, [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8758.08s)]
*  right? [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8763.0s)]
*  Because the more you do it, the more that you just put your pin on it, done with it. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8764.0s)]
*  The more you do that, the more you walk through that aiming room, the less and less people [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8768.28s)]
*  there are, right? [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8771.78s)]
*  And then all the pictures come off the wall, all the furniture is gone, right? [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8773.2s)]
*  It becomes a blank room. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8776.28s)]
*  You still have to walk through it, but there's no distractions in there anymore, right? [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8777.74s)]
*  And then ultimately what I want you to do is I want you to blow the door off, the front [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8781.82s)]
*  door. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8785.96s)]
*  I want you to put an explosive charge on that sucker and turn into splinters. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8786.96s)]
*  Because when I shoot in front of you, I don't have to go, okay, I'm going to shoot this [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8790.64s)]
*  shot with control no matter what. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8794.259999999998s)]
*  Because that's a principle by which I live, right? [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8796.22s)]
*  I don't have a front door on my shot control house. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8798.279999999999s)]
*  I step right up on the porch and I walk right in. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8800.919999999998s)]
*  That's where I want people to be. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8803.679999999998s)]
*  There is no mystery to this house anymore. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7q6vUJCbA&t=8805.119999999999s)]
