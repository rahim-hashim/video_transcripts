# Joe Rogan Experience #1435 - Suzanne Santo & Gary Clark Jr.
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [March 03, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhRRq6SXSB8)
*  Hello everybody.
*  That was so natural.
*  That's how we do it here on a Monday afternoon.
*  What the fuck has happened?
*  Thank you guys for being here. I'm very excited.
*  I was looking forward to this one.
*  Me too.
*  Oh man. This is an intense one. I'm very excited.
*  Giant fans of both of you and I'm glad we could do this.
*  Same.
*  Likewise.
*  What's up?
*  So much.
*  So you guys want to start with a song?
*  Yeah.
*  Let's start with a song.
*  We'll start with a song.
*  Bad Beast?
*  Bad Beast.
*  I love this song.
*  Alright.
*  Okay.
*  This is the first time we've done this together.
*  Holy shit.
*  Look out, folks.
*  I'm so scared.
*  We're good.
*  We're good.
*  Alright, you ready?
*  Alright.
*  I'll give you an inch or you'll go for miles
*  Dragging me behind you like I'm your child
*  Kicking and screaming, stuck on your leash
*  The kid with the cream just licking his teeth
*  God damn
*  I'm so scared
*  I'm so scared
*  I'm so scared
*  I'm so scared
*  I'm so scared
*  I'm so scared
*  I'm so scared
*  I'm so scared
*  I'm so scared
*  I'm so scared
*  I'm so scared
*  Could beudent
*  I'm so scared
*  I'm so scared
*  I'd simply tell you
*  There's a bad beast
*  Livin' in me
*  Chaining me up
*  Makes me free
* Êìç drawin' over and over again
*  To keep me down low
*  Damn if I give in
*  How the hell was it then?
*  Yeah, I tried to rise above, I tried playing dead, even tried calling up
*  That ghost in my bed, he just laughed
*  Couldn't catch his breath, said he won't know a match
*  For that angel that death got down
*  There's a bad beast living in me, chaining me up
*  And sending me free, saying dude, over and over again
*  Keep me down, damned if I give in and damned if I don't
*  How the hell was it then?
*  Yeah, how the hell was it then?
*  This'll bury me one day on Sunday, Mama won't you pray for me
*  This'll bury me one day on Sunday, Mama won't you pray for me
*  This'll bury me one day on Sunday, Mama won't you pray for me
*  I don't think that I'm weak.
*  I don't think I'm unfit.
*  I don't think I've even seen the thick of this shit.
*  So I'll roll with the dirt, these bulldozing me.
*  It'll hurt like a hearse carrying my grief, goddamn.
*  There's a bad beast living in me, chaining me up,
*  and setting me free, so he'll do it over and over again
*  and keep me down low.
*  Damn if I give in and damn if I don't.
*  Well, the hell with it then.
*  The hell with it then.
*  That was so dumb.
*  That was so cool.
*  That was fucking awesome.
*  Oh, man, Gary.
*  That was fun.
*  It was fun.
*  We should do that again sometime.
*  Yeah.
*  How many times you guys performed together?
*  Not many.
*  Maybe once at the Jamison thing.
*  That was the first time?
*  This is the second time, yeah.
*  That was it.
*  I just run into Gary at parties and festivals.
*  That's so crazy.
*  You guys never fucked around together.
*  Nothing before that one moment?
*  No.
*  I mean, we played a show.
*  The first time we met was over 10 years ago.
*  And we were just babies.
*  That show was so dope.
*  It was really fun.
*  That show that you guys did, that Jamison thing,
*  was so dope.
*  Well, you remember that you were there.
*  And then Jamison was like, why is this video going viral?
*  Because you tweeted or you posted it on your Instagram.
*  And then they were all asking us about PR and stuff.
*  It was hilarious.
*  Midnight Rider is one of my all time favorite songs.
*  So when you guys went into that randomly, I'm like, oh my god.
*  When I used to get up in the morning, whenever
*  I used to have to do morning radio, morning radio
*  was like, you've got to be funny at 6.30 AM.
*  And you've got to shake the cobwebs off.
*  You might have just went to bed like four hours ago.
*  Move around a little.
*  So I would hit a joint and listen to Midnight Rider.
*  You would?
*  Always.
*  That was my morning song.
*  Midnight Rider was my morning.
*  Because when you're high first thing in the morning
*  on your way to the radio, there's
*  a feeling you get when you listen to that song.
*  These guys were just out there.
*  It's a cruiser.
*  Oh my god.
*  But they were free.
*  The music then was so free.
*  There was something special about that era of music
*  and that song.
*  And then to see you guys doing it together
*  and to give it that Gary Clark Jr. sound.
*  Yeah.
*  It's OK.
*  You've got a sound.
*  You've got a sound, man.
*  It's amazing with all the fucking people playing guitar.
*  I hear your sound.
*  You have a sound that's special.
*  It's very different.
*  Agreed 100%.
*  I don't know what the fuck you're doing, man.
*  I don't either.
*  I keep trying to steal his tricks.
*  I don't know.
*  You know what?
*  I have no idea what I'm doing.
*  It's ignorance and a lot of fuzz and some reverb.
*  Keep it up.
*  And good vibes.
*  Let's be honest.
*  I'm having fun getting to do it.
*  You know what I mean?
*  You guys together with Ben.
*  It was Ben and there was someone else, right?
*  Our drummer, Connor, I believe.
*  That's right.
*  Yeah.
*  That's right.
*  And you guys together.
*  God damn, that was fun.
*  It was fun.
*  Y'all were kicking, too.
*  Thanks.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know when Honey Honey's going to play again,
*  but we had a lot of fun.
*  You guys made some awesome songs.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Shout out to Ben.
*  Shout out to Ben.
*  I heard.
*  E-hug to you, fella.
*  He feels that.
*  Yeah.
*  I forgive it.
*  It's real.
*  It's a real one.
*  It's a nice one.
*  Love that, dude.
*  Oh, man.
*  So that's crazy that you guys had never done that before,
*  that one night.
*  Well, you brought us on.
*  You bestowed a great gift on Honey Honey by,
*  because you played at the Ace that day or that night.
*  And then we were brought in by Gary to do this after party.
*  Sponsored by Jameson, hence all the Jameson barrels
*  and all the stuff.
*  And it was so much fun.
*  I mean.
*  And it was in downtown LA, which adds to it.
*  Because downtown LA is straight up Blade Runner these days.
*  Yeah.
*  You're going through streets.
*  You're like, what is going on here?
*  There's tents and homeless people by the thousands
*  and gangs and weird graffiti.
*  And dudes are lifting and closing garage doors
*  in the middle of the night.
*  And they're filled with people inside.
*  Yeah.
*  I went down there the other day, man.
*  I took my wife to some nice restaurant.
*  And the driver was like, bro, don't go anywhere else around.
*  Oh, my god.
*  Just stay right here.
*  And then call it.
*  That's so crazy.
*  That's true.
*  We filmed Fear Factor there.
*  We watched people smoke crack.
*  Yeah.
*  Jesus.
*  Or meth, whatever they were smoking.
*  They were smoking something.
*  And they were just doing it openly in the street.
*  We were elevated in one of them little crrrrrrrr
*  on those cane buckets.
*  And we were looking down.
*  Oh, my god.
*  And the contestants were watching people smoke crack.
*  We're like, this is crazy.
*  Right there out in the street.
*  Yeah.
*  Those little vials, broken vials would be everywhere.
*  It's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like Mad Max.
*  But it is.
*  And it's also beautiful buildings.
*  They've also built these insane apartment buildings there.
*  It's gorgeous office buildings.
*  It's very strange.
*  It's like there's a concerted effort
*  to try to turn it into some, like to gentrify downtown.
*  I mean, it's happening.
*  But when you're in California, do you really
*  want to live in downtown LA?
*  Eddie Bravo loves downtown LA.
*  He doesn't live there, but he has his Jiu-Jitsu headband.
*  You hang there, but you don't live there.
*  Oh, is that the move?
*  Yeah.
*  It's a fun hang.
*  But I want to, I don't know, I want to be in the canyons,
*  the rolling hills of Los Angeles.
*  Of course you do.
*  Perhaps a beachfront property.
*  A little bit of you.
*  Me and Brad Pitt, remember?
*  A little bit of you.
*  That's right.
*  You and Brad in your dream.
*  I had a dream that I was late for the Joe Rogan podcast.
*  And I also had a dream that Brad Pitt and I were dating.
*  And I was, in fact, late, as we've talked about.
*  So I can't see any reason why the other one,
*  the other part of my dream isn't going to come true.
*  If you're a fan of nice ladies and good music,
*  I got one for you.
*  Har-rrr.
*  Oh.
*  Did you see that Quentin Tarantino movie?
*  I did.
*  It was incredible.
*  How weird was the violence?
*  Oh, god.
*  It was tough.
*  I watched it with my parents.
*  And what was ironic is they knew who all the characters were.
*  Like my dad said, oh, I'll bet that's Tex.
*  I'll bet.
*  Because those were real people.
*  Still are, some of them.
*  And that was kind of chilling to me
*  to think about the fact that they knew by name who
*  these Charlie Manson heads were by watching this movie.
*  Because it's way before my time.
*  What super, super popular story.
*  And the other part about it is those people
*  that killed those folks, you know how the story turned out.
*  So you're expecting it.
*  I love the happier ending.
*  It's way better.
*  It's like Inglourious Basterds 2 or just other Brad Pitt movie.
*  Am I just plugging this one or what?
*  He's a wizard.
*  He's the last guy allowed to make a movie like that.
*  When I said the violence was shocking,
*  I don't mean necessarily that it's bad.
*  I'm not saying that.
*  I'm saying shocking that in a movie in 2020,
*  you could have a dude smash some girl's head.
*  Exactly.
*  I mean, like, woo.
*  This is wild.
*  But he's grandfathered in.
*  I think Tarantino's grandfathered in.
*  Because everybody has always known him
*  for having the wildest, craziest fucking, from Pulp Fiction,
*  straight on his whole career.
*  It's kind of to be expected.
*  Yeah.
*  The fucking Uma Thurman with the injection and the hearts.
*  I mean, so many of his movies are like, what the fuck?
*  That guy goes deep.
*  He goes deep.
*  Nobody goes deeper than Tarantino.
*  But the thing is that he can still
*  do a super ultra violent movie.
*  And people consider it great art.
*  And I think that's getting harder and harder to do.
*  I think he's sort of like, everybody knows,
*  that's the Tarantino movie.
*  You're going to see some madness.
*  But I think if a new person tried to do it,
*  they would hit more woke reaction.
*  More people like, are we really celebrating a scene
*  where a guy smashes a woman's head into pulp?
*  He does a good job of getting the good guy to win.
*  And we all want that.
*  100%.
*  So badly.
*  So if anything, he's got a formula that continues to work.
*  Yeah, I want to see the bad guys get the shit kicked out of them.
*  There's justice.
*  Yeah.
*  It's fucking great.
*  It's fun entertainment.
*  But there's a sort of a resistance
*  to certain narratives and certain kind of scenes,
*  certain kinds of depictions of violence.
*  Although you shouldn't even have it for entertainment's sake.
*  God damn, it's so nice having someone like him around.
*  Yeah.
*  You should bring him on the podcast.
*  I would love to.
*  I met him at the comedy story.
*  He's super nice.
*  Cool.
*  But he makes madness.
*  You leave a Tarantino movie, you're like, what the fuck?
*  Pretty soon, Joe, you're going to be in the next Tarantino movie.
*  No, I'm not into movies.
*  You keep talking like this.
*  I'm not trying to be in any movies.
*  I just like to watch.
*  I'm just appreciative.
*  That's great.
*  Yeah.
*  No, I'm with you.
*  That's one of the reasons why I'm appreciative of music, too.
*  I have no idea what's going on.
*  Neither do we.
*  Clearly, you do.
*  The sounds are consistent.
*  You say you don't know what's going on.
*  I think you get a better knowledge of music than I do.
*  Wow, Gary.
*  Gary, I don't really know how to take that.
*  Gary, how many instruments do you play?
*  Just the guitar, or do you play others?
*  I just play this well enough to keep the lights on.
*  Oh my god.
*  He's humble, folks.
*  So humble.
*  I like to mess around on drums, but you're a multi-instrumentalist.
*  Master of none, though.
*  Master of none.
*  It's been fun, though.
*  I started practicing every day.
*  I really love it.
*  I used to practice because I was afraid of sucking.
*  And now I practice because I really just want to play.
*  And I think there is a threshold that I crossed a little while back.
*  But I just want to get so much better.
*  I'm sure you could relate to that.
*  It's hard to be satisfied.
*  Do you find a struggle between being a person who concentrates on one aspect of music, or
*  one who concentrates on a bunch of different kinds of instruments?
*  It's hard.
*  Yeah.
*  I haven't picked up my banjo in a year.
*  But also, I think when your muscles are strong and you play one of them, all the string instruments
*  are kind of like cousins.
*  The violin is the hardest one.
*  When I step away from it and then I come back, you know.
*  That makes sense because it's such a crazy motion.
*  Yeah.
*  It's an emotional instrument, too.
*  Like, yeah, you totally got it.
*  You're crushing it.
*  You're so good at the violin.
*  That's because I've been making fun of people crying for so long.
*  I know.
*  You're going to be okay.
*  I develop skills.
*  My mock violin game is strong.
*  It's going to be all right.
*  I'm going to be okay.
*  I'm going to be okay.
*  I'm going to be okay.
*  I'm going to be okay.
*  I'm going to be okay.
*  I'm going to be okay.
*  I'm going to be okay.
*  I'm going to be okay.
*  The face.
*  Oh, man.
*  It's true.
*  It's such a weepy instrument.
*  It's a beautiful instrument.
*  No one's ever like, oh, sadness.
*  It's just so nice that those wizards of the past figured all these fucking things out.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, man.
*  Could you imagine being there when the first person sat down at the piano and was like,
*  oh my God.
*  Yeah.
*  Imagine a life where people only could make noises with their mouth.
*  But they were crazy people like Mozart and, you know, Beethoven.
*  They went nuts.
*  Wouldn't you go nuts if you were smart and you lived back then?
*  I'm going to.
*  I only hope that'll be my future.
*  How about what do you dummies figure out a toilet?
*  We want to all die of dysentery.
*  You know.
*  That life back then.
*  Instead of working on your concerto.
*  But everybody was thought to be crazy that had any idea outside the system.
*  You know, they put Galileo under house arrest because he was figuring shit out about the
*  universe.
*  Did they really?
*  Like he ended his life on house arrest.
*  He couldn't go anywhere.
*  It's like one of the most just because it was heresy.
*  You piece of shit.
*  Yeah.
*  He was challenging the orthodoxy.
*  It's funny how that stuff manifests today.
*  You know, the same sort of same thing.
*  It's a part of people.
*  We'd like to control how people think and behave.
*  And if we could do it under the guise of religion or under the guise of the correct politics
*  or under the guise of social media, anything, anything we can do, it's just a pattern of
*  human behavior.
*  You see it with, you know, right wing people who want to get people fired.
*  You see it with social justice warriors who want to get people fired.
*  It's a pattern of human behavior.
*  There's people that are the most aggressive soldiers for a cause.
*  And they're at the front line of anything good or bad.
*  And sometimes, you know, people get fired.
*  People get in trouble.
*  Chaos ensues.
*  Well, I just feel like these days I really struggle with like, you never really know
*  the truth.
*  It's hard.
*  It's so frustrating because I want to be on the front lines of information and know what's
*  going on in my country and the world.
*  But I get so fucking frustrated.
*  And I'm really struggling with it, to be honest.
*  You should.
*  It makes me insane.
*  You know, and it's hard to put things into perspective, too.
*  Yeah.
*  Like this coronavirus thing is a good example of that.
*  It's got everybody on edge.
*  And we all should be on edge for diseases.
*  Don't get me wrong.
*  Why are we not on edge that 500,000 people die every year from cigarettes?
*  They die prematurely from cigarette.
*  That is an insane pile of bodies.
*  That happens every year.
*  We're barely worried about that.
*  Like, yeah, you should probably quit smoking.
*  But would I ever live your life, sister?
*  Yeah, but I mean, there's a difference between catching the coronavirus.
*  Oh, Gary, you smoke.
*  I haven't left the house for a week.
*  I've been sitting outside smoking cigarettes trying to avoid the coronavirus.
*  I get it.
*  I get it.
*  I get it.
*  I get it.
*  I get it.
*  I get it.
*  I get it.
*  I get it.
*  I get it.
*  I get it.
*  That might be the way to do it.
*  Maybe you burn it.
*  Maybe there's like some good antioxidants in whatever brand.
*  Oh, there's a solid point there.
*  It's a good point.
*  Oh, man.
*  Yeah.
*  Man.
*  They're good for your brain.
*  I've had a couple of cigarettes.
*  I've had them with my friend Tony Hinchcliffe right before I went on stage.
*  And I was like, whoa.
*  And then I had when I worked with Chappelle, I smoked a cigarette with him before every
*  show.
*  And I was like, oh, I get it.
*  I see what's going on.
*  I just thought it was stupid.
*  But it's like a little drug.
*  It's a little woo.
*  No, having a good cigarette from time to time.
*  Yeah.
*  They say it's a nootropic.
*  That nicotine actually enhances brain function.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  That it has a similar effect to other nootropics.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Like alpha brain or any of those.
*  But like one cigarette?
*  Yeah.
*  Kind of like an occasional cigarette?
*  Is that what we're talking about?
*  Nicotine in and of itself is a stimulant that I'm saying cigarettes, what I really mean
*  is nicotine, but that nicotine in any form, whatever you can get it, if you chew, if you
*  smoke a cigar, if you get it out.
*  Which I totally chew.
*  It does something to your brain.
*  It actually enhances the way your brain functions.
*  Maybe a little bit of your memory, maybe a little bit of your verbal, your dictionary,
*  maybe it'll pull words quicker.
*  Well, here's a crazy story.
*  I don't think so.
*  You don't think so?
*  Doesn't work for me.
*  Well, maybe it's because you've been doing it a long time.
*  Well, what else do you do?
*  You do it.
*  I think you've probably like, you probably flatlined.
*  My grandmother had a brain aneurysm when she was like in her 40s.
*  And she, my family's in the restaurant business in Cleveland and they just opened a new store
*  and the story goes like this.
*  They weren't up to code or something and they needed to like clean the shit out of this
*  place so they could get their license or whatever.
*  So she was really stressed out and she felt a pop and heard, she said it sounded like
*  running water in her ears.
*  And she called my uncle George and she smoked a cigarette outside and waited for him and
*  went to the hospital.
*  Sure as shit she had a brain aneurysm.
*  The doctor said that the cigarette was probably, it probably saved her life because your blood
*  vessels, they constrict, right?
*  Who's the doctor here?
*  Oh, I am.
*  What do you need ma'am?
*  Okay, Dr. Rogan.
*  I know I'm going to get in trouble for this.
*  Oh don't worry, I'm a doctor.
*  But anyway, she survived the brain aneurysm.
*  It was like, you know, but the story is that the cigarette had a lot to do with her making
*  it to the hospital alive.
*  You sure that she didn't make that up?
*  Well, she probably, she also did a couple rails of cocaine and sorry dad, I know he's
*  going to listen to this.
*  Nicotine causes your blood vessels to constrict or narrow, which limits the amount of blood
*  that flows in your organs.
*  Wow.
*  So folks, if you have an aneurysm, start smoking.
*  You never, quick get to the closest pack of Marlboro's.
*  No, no, no, you want to go Camel's, no filter, right?
*  That would be the whole another.
*  I'm so sorry.
*  When I used to hang out in the pool hall, the dudes who would smoke those filterless
*  cigarettes were the most savage humans.
*  I knew a guy would break the filters off.
*  Then you just get a bunch of tobacco in your mouth.
*  He didn't give a fuck.
*  He was there to gamble.
*  He didn't care.
*  How were his teeth?
*  They weren't that good.
*  I would imagine so.
*  They weren't that good.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That was a, it was a guy that I met when I was in a pool hall in White Plains, New York.
*  It's one of the first times I really understood what gambling addiction is.
*  I used to pass it off as being no big deal, but being around like real gambling addicts.
*  Oh yeah.
*  And the really ones that I liked, like they're nice guys.
*  This White Plains Charlie was a nice guy.
*  He couldn't stop gambling.
*  He couldn't stop gambling.
*  And he was a pretty decent pool player.
*  And he would win occasionally.
*  But he would always want to play people for money.
*  He always want other people to back him.
*  Like, come on, get behind me.
*  I can fucking beat this guy.
*  And he, no matter what it was, he had to be in action all day long.
*  And in New York, you can bet on horse races.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Somehow or another, they won't let you have casinos in New York City, but you could go
*  to these off-track betting places.
*  This fucking guy couldn't stop gambling all day long.
*  And then I started to study him as his friend.
*  He was quite a bit older than I was.
*  When I was in my 20s, he was probably already 60.
*  Did you file that under the what not to do category of your studies?
*  File that under, oh, I didn't know that was a thing.
*  I didn't grow up around gamblers.
*  So watching this guy, I was like, whoa, this is crazy.
*  Like, these guys are all addicts.
*  Well, like the old folks that like the slot machine addiction, they also have screen addictions.
*  Oh, of course.
*  But this guy would snap the filters off cigarettes.
*  Fuck you.
*  Oh, gross.
*  I've been in it for a long time.
*  Where is he now?
*  He's dead as fuck.
*  I'm sorry to hear that.
*  Yeah, he's dead as fuck.
*  I feel like I'm not surprised.
*  I enjoy this company for the brief amount of time that I get to hang out with him.
*  And he's kind of a legendary character around White Plains, New York, Poo Halls.
*  Yeah, he was a great guy.
*  That's where when I first moved from Boston to New Jersey, I was around a lot of these weird characters at this one particular pool hall.
*  Is this from like comedy stuff or just from?
*  Well, one part of it was from comedy stuff because my friend John Tobin, who was also a stand up comedian, I was friends with him first.
*  And he started working at this pool hall.
*  OK.
*  And then I'm like, wow, well, let's go fucking play some pool.
*  So you've been like pool sharking for a long time.
*  Yeah, but it was just being around weirdos.
*  Yeah.
*  This is the point.
*  I'm not that good a pool player.
*  The first time I played pool with Joe, he put a glove on and I'm like, what the fuck is going on here?
*  What is this?
*  It was very intimidating.
*  It's embarrassing to hear.
*  And you were like, we're very serious.
*  I take it seriously.
*  I love playing.
*  I mean, I'm not trying to do anything to you.
*  It's the balls.
*  Like I have to play the balls correctly.
*  Yeah.
*  They demand respect.
*  Don't I know it?
*  That was the first time I was ever.
*  Terrible.
*  People want you to take it easy on them.
*  That was the first time I was ever around like around like legitimate.
*  I realized I definitely had a point somewhere at the beginning of this, but I've lost it.
*  No.
*  How you were meeting all these characters in New Jersey and like pool halls and comedy and.
*  People understanding addictions, gambling addictions.
*  I don't know how we started on gambling.
*  This is all ridiculous.
*  But I just didn't think it was real.
*  I think that's what it was.
*  Oh, the addiction.
*  Oh, totally.
*  I thought they were just being weak and then being around people that were like really addicted to gambling.
*  I'm like, this is just like a drug.
*  This is like a drug they're giving themselves.
*  It's an escapism.
*  It is that.
*  But it's also they don't go to the drug store.
*  They go to the oh my God, what the fuck have I done store?
*  And it just gets them all day like fuck.
*  And then occasionally they win.
*  Yeah, fuck you.
*  High highs and high lows in low lows.
*  You know, it's it's a thing.
*  Oh, I am a gambler.
*  You know, I big time damn.
*  How much have you lost?
*  Um, not a lot.
*  I play poker regularly.
*  What's the big hit?
*  What's the number one hit?
*  I mean, like I don't have a lot of money.
*  So I don't know.
*  Even if it's one hundred dollars, then I want like the most I won in one sitting was like literally five hundred bucks.
*  Just like I was at a three card poker table.
*  Um, but I like home games.
*  I like playing poker with my friends.
*  You are taking your friends money.
*  Yeah, 100 percent.
*  Yeah, that's a sure.
*  That's a hard yes.
*  You find a lot out about someone when you beat them at a game.
*  Well, it's a mental game too.
*  They get pissy with you in real life.
*  No, I like that.
*  You know what?
*  You don't want to play cards with someone who's going to be a dick.
*  It has to be fun.
*  But it's interesting.
*  It is.
*  It's interesting.
*  They get angry after the game's over.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  No.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  Some dudes could lose 20 bucks.
*  Yeah.
*  And be pissed at you for a year.
*  Yeah, that's fun.
*  Good times.
*  It's a little gratifying.
*  But it's weird that we get so personally invested in the way cards lay out.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think it's like, fuck you, you're always getting these fucking aces.
*  Well, it's half that.
*  And it's also you're, you know, this game and you have to read people and like you can
*  see how people hold their hand.
*  I can usually tell if someone's got cards, you know, you just pay attention.
*  Do you think that's what poker is?
*  It's like part like amateur psychic part, a game of craft and skill.
*  Yeah.
*  I also just like the hang of when my landlord has a card game downstairs and I just walk
*  with a bottle of tequila and have so much fun and don't need to leave the house and
*  make a couple hundred bucks and then go back upstairs in my apartment.
*  You know what makes me think it's hypnosis is those dudes that wear sunglasses at the
*  table.
*  Right.
*  The threat of looking like a douche is nothing to them in comparison to the threat of someone
*  looking into their eyes.
*  They would rather have that extra shield.
*  It seems to me a wise move.
*  I respect it.
*  I respect that.
*  So you're saying I should wear sunglasses the next home?
*  Always.
*  Okay, fine.
*  I saw Jay-Z in the crowd at the UFC once.
*  Nighttime sunglasses.
*  Of course.
*  I'm like, yep, I get it.
*  You don't want anybody looking at your eyes.
*  You say, Jay-Z, it must be annoying.
*  I got a record.
*  You're like, I got a record.
*  There's a bunch of dudes.
*  You can hide.
*  Why would I be annoying him all the time?
*  Yeah.
*  That's how I feel about wearing hats on stage.
*  I feel like I can get out of here.
*  Perfect.
*  That's the move right there.
*  I feel like he could wear better sunglasses.
*  No, no, no.
*  Those are perfect for his look.
*  Are they?
*  Yeah.
*  He's got everything around his neck, the beads, everything.
*  Mardi Gras beads?
*  He's partying.
*  That's a fat sack of chips.
*  So he showed his boobs for those?
*  No, he's got money, baby.
*  He's got money.
*  Look at all them chips.
*  There's something pretty spectacular about one of those guys that can win those fucking
*  World Series of Pools shit.
*  You know who does that?
*  Who?
*  Bruce Buffer.
*  Bruce Buffer from the UFC.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, giant poker player.
*  Loves that shit.
*  He's always in like that.
*  Poker or pool?
*  You said poker.
*  Did I say pool?
*  I was thinking of things rolling.
*  I didn't mean to, bro.
*  Yeah, it was distracting.
*  Chips.
*  I meant chips.
*  But Bruce Buffer's a killer poker player, like a legit one.
*  He gets an old World Series of poker event.
*  I feel like you'd be really good at poker.
*  No chance.
*  Really?
*  Zero desire to be sitting.
*  Nothing's happening.
*  You move the paper.
*  But you can...
*  I'm bored.
*  Oh, okay.
*  That's fair.
*  That's fair.
*  I feel like if you were a martial artist who your mind game is such a big element, I feel
*  like you would crush it at a poker table.
*  Probably not.
*  Hashtag powerful.
*  It's not fun to watch for me.
*  If I watch it, I go, I get it.
*  I get sucked into that trap.
*  Look, I won't push it on you, but I might call you the next time we have a home game.
*  It'd be really fun to have you there.
*  I'm terrible.
*  I'll just talk shit.
*  I'll just go there and talk shit until people lose or until I lose.
*  I'm not good at it.
*  It's just because...
*  Same with golf.
*  I've been told to try golf, and I'm like, I'm not interested.
*  I can't see you as golf.
*  I can't.
*  I don't want to get into it.
*  I don't want to get stuck.
*  You guys are stuck.
*  You guys are stuck in something that takes eight hours to do.
*  I'm not trying to be up there.
*  I'll putt-putt, but I just won't golf.
*  My comedian friends would get into golf.
*  They'd go on the road together with fucking giant golf bags and shit and travel across
*  the country.
*  Hey, we'll do golf in the day, and then we'll do jokes at night.
*  They're always exhausted.
*  You're walking around all day with clubs and shit.
*  Is there a workout element to it?
*  If you're poor, because you've got to carry your clubs.
*  It's also just the whole thing.
*  You're walking around this course for hours and hours, and you're lining up shots and
*  then moving to the next shot, and you're concentrating all day.
*  Shit takes forever.
*  Guys love it.
*  They love it.
*  Especially rich dudes, like rich old dudes who do business love to play golf.
*  They get together and they fucking swat that ball around and chase it.
*  Things that require an investment in the gear.
*  Bro, we got virtual reality now.
*  You're out there walking around on the field looking for a ball.
*  You mean like golden tee?
*  I get it.
*  It's a super skillful game, but to me, it's interesting as an outsider who's never been
*  bit by the bug.
*  I know that if I tried it, I'd probably get bit by that golf bug.
*  It seems like everybody does.
*  It's an amazing game.
*  Do you have an extracurricular sport that you're into?
*  Like tennis?
*  No, never done.
*  That seems to me a recipe for meniscus damage that I need for other stupid shit I do.
*  I need to keep my meniscus healthy for other stupid shit.
*  I love tennis.
*  I would get so mad if I couldn't do jujitsu because I played tennis.
*  I'd be like, oh.
*  That'd be a major hit.
*  That'd be so stupid.
*  This ball doesn't mean anything.
*  I don't care.
*  Get the ball.
*  Wait a second.
*  Take the fucking ball.
*  Okay.
*  Take the ball, not my meniscus.
*  I don't care about the ball.
*  I don't care about that ball.
*  That's a solid reason not to play tennis.
*  For real, imagine what it must have been like the first time a human being invented a musical
*  instrument.
*  For real.
*  Imagine how crazy it is.
*  Maybe.
*  Probably.
*  Animal skin.
*  Maybe some sort of a reed that someone blew wind through, made sound, mimicking what the
*  wind was doing.
*  Or bird calls trying to lure that turkey in.
*  I don't know what they sound like.
*  Some guys can do that insane.
*  Yeah, you would know.
*  All your hunting buddies and stuff.
*  They have legit turkey calling contests and elk calling contests.
*  Or men.
*  That's insane.
*  Or men who vote and pay taxes.
*  Are screaming.
*  Is it televised?
*  Oh my god it is.
*  No.
*  Maybe the Sportsman's Channel might have some footage on it.
*  But mostly you can find it on the internet.
*  It's these dudes.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  These dudes.
*  Yeah, of course.
*  They have these turkey calling contests.
*  Oh my god.
*  And they try to sound the most like a turkey.
*  Do they do it with their voices?
*  Yeah, they can do it with their voices.
*  Or instruments or what?
*  They can do it.
*  I can't do it with my voice, clearly.
*  I don't know.
*  I feel like that was pretty good.
*  And the elk one, they put like a little thing in their mouth.
*  It's almost like a reed.
*  It's like a flat reed and it sits on the top of your mouth.
*  And they blow into a tube and make these sounds like a really horny male elk.
*  And they have contests.
*  Who's judging us?
*  I know.
*  It's crazy.
*  Who is?
*  Yeah.
*  How do you know?
*  How do you know if it's a good call or not?
*  It's a good question.
*  It's a good question.
*  Wow.
*  It's a really good question.
*  Yeah, wow.
*  But it's an art form.
*  For sure.
*  It is.
*  When you hear it, there's dudes who can do it and make it sound exactly like an elk.
*  And you're like, wow.
*  And they can talk.
*  They've been around elk for decades.
*  So they can kind of talk elk shit.
*  And they're also attracted to them a little bit.
*  A little bit.
*  Probably a little bit.
*  Well, they're beautiful majestic animals.
*  Don't get weird.
*  Okay.
*  I'm not getting weird.
*  Who's getting weird?
*  But sounds.
*  Like, that's probably one of the first sounds, right?
*  I mean, mimicking animals.
*  Yeah.
*  But then someone figured out how to make a fucking guitar.
*  And no one's taught that shit since.
*  Stop and think about that for a while.
*  Whoever the fuck made the guitar, that person nailed it.
*  Well, they were made out of like cat gut or like animal intestines for the strings in
*  the beginning.
*  I know that.
*  Imagine how bored you have to be before you start doing that.
*  How does anyone invent anything?
*  I mean, that is nuts.
*  Cat gut.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm going to dry it out.
*  I don't even know how they do it.
*  It's a fucking big old wooden thing that I hollowed out for a year.
*  Yeah.
*  When did like the scales, like when did tone become a thing?
*  This is fascinating.
*  It's a weird thought.
*  I feel like I should know this.
*  I feel like I should too.
*  I don't think it's possible to know.
*  I guess we got some homework to do.
*  Should we write it on the Staples notepad?
*  Learn about where the sounds came from.
*  What do you think the ear was?
*  Who created the cat gut strings?
*  Was it like the Egyptians?
*  Like, who was the first musical instrument creator?
*  Was it the Egyptians that we know of?
*  Like where there's a depiction and an image of a musical instrument?
*  Was it like a harp or something like that?
*  When do you think that would have been?
*  Well, I would think, yeah.
*  I mean, what year timeframe are we talking here for Egyptians?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't either.
*  Well, Egyptians, it was a long, long empire, but they were alive.
*  This is how crazy it is.
*  Cleopatra was closer.
*  Her life existed closer to the birth of the iPhone than it did to the construction of the pyramids.
*  What?
*  Yes.
*  What?
*  Yes.
*  How?
*  Because Egypt has been around for a long fucking time.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  2500 BC is the estimated year that they built the Great Pyramid of Giza.
*  And Cleopatra was like, I think she died.
*  She died in AD and she died closer, again, closer to the iPhone.
*  She died like the first couple centuries or something, AD.
*  So the Egyptian Empire had been around for fucking thousands of years.
*  Do you ever think about, in the alien sense, all the conspiracies surrounding the pyramids and things,
*  do you ever wonder about more of the extraterrestrial affiliations with the Egyptians?
*  Not just the Egyptians, but with human beings.
*  And this is why.
*  Because it sounds ridiculous.
*  It sounds ridiculous when you talk about it.
*  And because it sounds ridiculous when you talk about it, people don't like to talk about it.
*  Right.
*  So it doesn't get considered as being a potential reality.
*  But we're so different than every other thing on this rock.
*  There's nothing even close to us.
*  We're so weird.
*  We make music.
*  We can talk.
*  We can send video through the sky.
*  We understand humor.
*  We understand nuance.
*  We understand chaos and peace and love.
*  And we're constantly making newer and better shit.
*  And there's nothing like us.
*  Everything else is just trying to mate.
*  Eat and mate.
*  That's it.
*  Right?
*  Even dolphins.
*  Dolphins are as smart as us, apparently.
*  Or maybe even smarter.
*  They have a giant head.
*  They have huge brains.
*  They have all this shit that we can't even comprehend.
*  Their language is complex.
*  We don't even know what it is.
*  We know they have a language, but we don't even know what they're saying.
*  They also like to play.
*  They have games.
*  Same with a lot of birds.
*  Crows like to play.
*  But we're so different.
*  Yeah.
*  We make crazy shit.
*  We can nuke us.
*  We can nuke each other.
*  We can fucking power our phones with the sky.
*  I mean, we're weird.
*  We're like, this fucking wind.
*  I want to turn that shit into electricity.
*  We figure out how to make windmills and planes that soar through the atmosphere.
*  Everything else is just fucking and eating.
*  Well, sometimes we're going crazy.
*  All the way nuts.
*  Well, like, back to where did music come from.
*  You know, sometimes I wonder if the people that came up with these things.
*  Obviously, you can go to school and learn a trade or become a master of your craft or engineering.
*  But sometimes I wonder if it's just some weird other dimensional source that comes out of nowhere.
*  That's what I think ideas are.
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
*  Ideas, 100%.
*  I've been saying this for a long time.
*  I think we should think of ideas as a life form that's trying to propagate itself because everything that you see came from an idea.
*  Everything.
*  Yeah.
*  Every invention, every everything, every song that you've ever written and sang, every book that's ever been read, all that stuff.
*  Every book ever written came from an idea.
*  And then, boom, it's a real thing.
*  Like, imagine if ideas because we don't know where they're coming from.
*  I feel like that when I write sometimes I'm like, what the fuck?
*  Do you ever feel like that was almost like a gift, like something's given you a gift?
*  Yes, like it was a channel of sorts.
*  Yes.
*  But it's weird.
*  I don't want this to be misinterpreted.
*  Like, I 100% give you credit for creating it.
*  That's not what I'm saying.
*  Yeah, we can cut that bullshit.
*  But I'm just saying that to people that might get weird about this, that don't get where I'm coming from.
*  What I'm coming from is everybody that I know that creates things has a very similar narrative.
*  They're like, it's coming out of nowhere.
*  I just have to be there to get it.
*  You know, there's a thing where you in the group and particularly if you spend a lot of time on it and you're working at it and you're passionate about it and you're focused on it.
*  It's almost like a muse, even if it's not real, it's still real.
*  Because there's an accuracy to like if you pretended that there was some God that was bestowing upon you these amazing ideas if you focused on it.
*  And if you led the correct life and lived the right path, then it would give you these gifts if you focused on your art form.
*  And that would be like if someone told you that there was a God doing that, you're like, oh, God, it's so ridiculous.
*  What do you give a shit? Who's doing it?
*  It's the same thing.
*  It's like a God's doing it for you.
*  It really does work.
*  Like if you focus on what you're trying to do, these weird moments do come out where creativity like pops up and you don't know where it came from.
*  An idea will come to you.
*  I think it's equal, not equal parts, but it's, you know, when you put in the effort to like keep the muscle flex like the creative one where you're writing regularly or you're practicing regularly.
*  And then you also kind of let it, you know, sort of come in.
*  Yeah, it's you know, I saw Dan Harmon speak once at one of Duncan Trussell's live podcasts and he had this he said he called it the gingerbread man theory.
*  And he said it was almost like he was a giant.
*  I don't know why this was what he said, but he was a gingerbread man.
*  And there was a big hole in the top of his head and there was all this shit falling into this hole from somewhere.
*  And every once in a while, about 10 percent of it would lightly dust the rim inside of the gingerbread jar.
*  And that was him. And the rest was other stuff.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  I know, right?
*  I love Rick and Morty.
*  I love Rick and Morty so much.
*  But you know, think about that and then watch Rick and Morty if you do, you'll be like, oh, I get it.
*  I totally get it.
*  You get it. Yeah, I do get it.
*  But you also have to like put in an effort to inspire yourself, inform yourself, read, learn, grow, live.
*  And then you put all that together.
*  And, you know, have you have we ever talked about the war of art?
*  Steen Pressfield book for anybody that's into it's not just like writing, but it's kind of about writing.
*  But it's also about like I think everything is a weird thing that we call that, you know, we call procrastination.
*  And he calls it resistance in the book.
*  It's really interesting because you realize like what is this weird thing that tries to keep people from being their best at stuff.
*  There's like a weird confusion and stress about it that keeps you from focusing on what you really need to do to be a true professional.
*  And he sort of lays it out in the book in a way that makes you go, oh, yeah, I never thought because he figured it out like when he was like 40 years old.
*  Yeah.
*  Figured out what he had been doing wrong, changed his direction and then became like super successful as a writer and is like really respected as a writer.
*  And this book is one of the most interesting things because you know, like his history that he kind of figured out how to get out of his own way.
*  He simplifies it. Yep.
*  And puts in the work.
*  Well, because I think a lot of it's subconscious, too.
*  It's like you want to succeed and you want to, you know, grow and evolve.
*  But then there's these obstacles of like, but you know what?
*  Today I'm going to do this.
*  I'm going to, you know, you know what?
*  I got to, I got to, you know, you just kind of procrastinate in this.
*  It's a powerful force, you know, and that can grow into so many things.
*  You know, your self-doubt.
*  They know I'm not ready. I can't do that.
*  I'm not ready.
*  I can't play that show or whatever.
*  You know, I'm not that's not a good example.
*  But it seems like there's a wrestling match in creative people's heads, particularly like performance artists like you guys are like comedians or singers, anybody where there's a wrestling match between like creating stuff and, and, and being disciplined, putting in a lot of, a lot of work or slacking off and feeling like, oh my God, I got to get back to work again.
*  And then being really excited to work hard and get going again.
*  And some people fall too far into one way or the other.
*  And there's like a weird balance in there.
*  Like you almost like have to be scared.
*  Yeah, fuck.
*  Yeah. You know what I'm saying?
*  Yeah. I think that because that's that's your vulnerability is a big part of, of, you know, giving an honest thing to a crowd when you're playing music or comedy.
*  You know, I think that.
*  Sorry, I feel like I'm talking too much Gary.
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't worry about it.
*  Well, we're all going to talk for a long time.
*  Yeah, we are. Yeah, we usually do.
*  Just express yourself. It's okay.
*  I I've played music with folks and I don't want to like say say this in a in a knock against conservatory students and things like that.
*  But I found that people that are really, really smart in the musical education element.
*  And, you know, again, I got a lot of friends and I hope I'm not stepping on any toes.
*  But it's almost like harder for them to vibe out because they're so smart and they're they're almost mathematical with their playing.
*  Whereas like Gary, like let's just fucking rock.
*  Like, let's hang out and like find the thing where I think sometimes I've felt like when I've played with people that I know I'm going to get so much shit for this.
*  I'm so I'm like kind of embarrassed to say.
*  You're a nice person.
*  That's not always the case.
*  I'm trying to I'm trying to find the middle ground.
*  That's like, you know, I'm not going to piss off too many people.
*  It's not always the case.
*  There are some brilliant but like the vibe is where it's at.
*  So what I'm trying to say is, yes, you can go to school and be the smartest and know the map frontwards and backwards.
*  But if you can't feel it when you're playing live and playing with other people, then there's a huge missing element.
*  That's what I want to say.
*  I'm not I don't want to.
*  But I think that you almost have more of an obstacle when you are you have that kind of intelligence with music because it's upstairs.
*  Do you agree with that or is this fighting?
*  You guys fighting?
*  No, I'm going to be the referee.
*  I hope not.
*  No, but I think I understand exactly what you're saying.
*  But I kind of simplify it like this.
*  I think of it like a radio like like, you know, back in the day when you would tune a radio, you try and dial in whatever station and you get that clear channel.
*  Sometimes you'd have to move yourself.
*  Sometimes you'd have to just, you know, get yourself in that place.
*  And I think that as a musician, for me, what I'm trying to do is gather information around me, gather little things and not consume myself with it.
*  So when I'm in that place to receive that inspiration or that that thought or that melody, whatever that is, I'm not clouding myself with doubt or this isn't what this person's doing or whatever.
*  I'm just I'm here in this with everybody.
*  But I'm like, I'm going to dial this in.
*  So the noise goes away a little bit.
*  You're a good listener.
*  I don't know if this makes sense.
*  But that's how I see it.
*  It's like, how can I as an artist, how can I dial into that channel that how can I be the receiver and get that clear thing?
*  And and whatever you were talking about with the ginger, you know, they're saying like that little that little piece of you at the top is like you're holding on to that thing.
*  Yeah.
*  And, you know, putting that all out there as a as a force.
*  It makes sense to me, but that sounds stupid.
*  No, it doesn't sound stupid.
*  It's like some people are so consumed with giving what they know.
*  Right. Right. Right.
*  And and pushing everything out there that they're not taking the time to sit back and listen.
*  Yeah.
*  And like, just shut the fuck up for a minute.
*  Yeah. Listen to this beautiful inspiration that comes out of nowhere.
*  Yeah. Just like listen to yourself, your inner boss, that being, you know, that's so when you show up to a place and you know, you're jamming, of course, you're going to.
*  It's going to be somebody who just comes in and go just gives you everything that they know.
*  Right.
*  Like, you know, I just crushed this without without accepting the fact that like there's a collective here.
*  Yeah, there's other people playing.
*  We're trying to all tune into the same station.
*  And that's when that magic happens.
*  That's when you let yourself go and be that it's writing or jamming or playing whatever recording.
*  Can I ask you this approach, something that you've evolved or something you knew intuitively from the jump that this is how you need to like tune out and like look at things from don't get to like the way you're describing your ability to shut the fuck up and look at the world and draw inspiration from the world.
*  Is that something that came to you in time or is it something that you always kind of intuitively knew?
*  I just I think it goes back to like sitting around smoking weed with my friends and just like, you know, not getting caught up with the bullshit, not getting caught up with the bullshit, not putting so much pressure on myself to be what it is that, you know, is happening.
*  That's such a gift.
*  Be this type of an artist to be this.
*  It's like, just who listen to my who am I and listen to myself.
*  I feel like is listening to the, you know, this is going to sound and tuning in that channel.
*  This is going to sound goofy, but that's what comes out in your music.
*  When you did that Midnight Rider car Jamie, find that shit.
*  Oh, no, we must play it.
*  It was such a wonderful moment because I hate using the word wonderful, but I really mean it's the only word for that spot.
*  You know, this is going to be a big resurgence of the whole cell phone thing again.
*  They don't understand.
*  You never know rehearsal.
*  You guys never sang together.
*  You didn't do shit together.
*  You guys bust out Midnight Rider.
*  I couldn't. I love that song.
*  I couldn't tell you the fucking words.
*  If I had to sing it right now, I'd be like, oh, I might fuck it up.
*  I don't.
*  I say, you know, like I said, that was my early morning smoke weed and go to the radio song.
*  That's a fucking amazing song.
*  Oh, my God.
*  This is one of my happiest moments as an audience.
*  That's Gary Clark Jr.
*  Sound right there.
*  Texas, baby.
*  What are you playing at 335?
*  That's yours.
*  That's ours.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I know.
*  Oh, God.
*  Fuck that.
*  Good.
*  Damn, that was fun.
*  That was fun.
*  That's what I was talking about.
*  You have a sound, man.
*  If somebody played me that riff, I'd be like, that's Gary Clark Jr.
*  100 percent.
*  Really?
*  Or someone pretending to be him.
*  Well, that's cool.
*  I'd like to piggyback that because when you're playing a song, you're playing a song.
*  You're playing a song.
*  You're playing a song.
*  You're playing a song.
*  You're playing a song.
*  You're playing a song.
*  I'd like to piggyback that because when you came in and played on my tune in July, you
*  were just straight into the amp.
*  And you were doing things with the guitar that I was like, how the fuck is he doing
*  that?
*  And it's you, it's this guitar, but you didn't have any pedals.
*  You were just straight in.
*  Yeah, I was just out there.
*  It was great.
*  I have video of you playing and I love it because you're just so sweaty.
*  I was a hot, sweaty man.
*  Well, it's a good story because I'm just so grateful it worked out.
*  But my dear friend, John Spiker, who produced the record, he's a hell of a guy.
*  And it was like the whole day we had texted about you coming in and you were flying in
*  from Austin with your family and you said, I think I'm going to make it.
*  And then you said you couldn't make it.
*  And John Spiker, he also plays bass in Tenacious D.
*  And Tenacious D. was having this secret show happening for Kyle Gass' birthday in Burbank.
*  And John was kind of like M.D.ing the whole night and all this stuff.
*  And so I was like, Gary, can't make it.
*  And then like a little while later, you're like, I can make it.
*  I'm getting in an Uber. I'm headed to the studio.
*  And then I was like, shit, John, we got to go.
*  We got to go to the studio.
*  And I couldn't get a hold of him because he's in soundcheck.
*  So I'm like calling all his friends and I'm like, we got to go.
*  We got to go. And then finally he's like, I'll be there in 20 minutes.
*  I was like, me too.
*  And we get to the studio and the air conditioning wasn't quite on.
*  So and it was in July.
*  So it was like 100 degrees outside and it was very hot in there, like, like kind of kind of insane.
*  And we had a half an hour for Gary to play.
*  You did like seven passes and it was so amazing.
*  I have video of this and I can't I haven't sent it to you.
*  I have to because it's so great.
*  And you're just fucking shredding and sweating.
*  And then when you left, you're like, I feel like I just played a show because it was so hot.
*  And it was great. It was one of my favorite days.
*  And then I got to go watch Tenacious D playing the shitty bar.
*  And it was honestly I was just like this was a great day.
*  That's amazing. We've been trying to do something together.
*  So yeah, I'm I'm so stoked.
*  The song is fire. So I appreciate you.
*  Thank you. Likewise.
*  But yeah, great guitar is something that's been a part of this.
*  You know, the music history of great guitar is it's a crazy history.
*  You know, it's it's one of this absolute most powerful inventions that human beings ever created was the guitar and then the electric guitar.
*  Because some of the fucking inspiration has come from some songs that just just make you just jump and scream and dance around your house and stop and think about it.
*  I mean, there's the vocals for sure.
*  There's there's the singing, there's the bass, there's the drums.
*  But goddamn, a fucking electric car guitar needs to be there.
*  It has that's the one variable you can't remove.
*  Guitarists change lives.
*  They do. Yeah, agreed.
*  They make you fucking pumped.
*  You can be on an elliptical machine ready to quit and kickstart.
*  My heart comes on.
*  Come on.
*  Oh, God.
*  Come on.
*  That will fire you the fuck up.
*  You'll find that extra juice.
*  Right. That's hilarious.
*  That's so funny that you say that is what motivates you.
*  Because when I'm like on tour and I don't want to work out, I think about you saying conquer your inner bitch and I'll be like fucking got to get to that gym downstairs.
*  We all have that inner bitch.
*  Oh, sure.
*  All have that bitch is like, come on.
*  Some of us have an outer bitch too.
*  You just need your rest.
*  You need to sleep 10 hours.
*  Yeah.
*  Yep.
*  Yep.
*  Let's have a coffee.
*  Let's just have a let's eat something and then let it digest and work out later.
*  Right.
*  We all play little weird mind games.
*  That's that's your inner bitch.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, in all transparency, though, to the per the workout, you know, portion of this conversation, I definitely at this point in my life work out harder than I ever did in my 20s.
*  Wow.
*  I love it.
*  It's awesome.
*  It makes me feel so good.
*  Would you start doing?
*  Well, you know, I last year when I played with Hozier, the Irish dude, you know, we had a lot.
*  We had a big tour and one of the girls in the band, Rachel Beauregard, this amazing woman, she's a yoga instructor and just like kind of an like natural athlete.
*  And she would just work us out almost every day.
*  And so every day we would do like just about every day, you know, yoga or like circuit training or she'd like have a group text in the gym.
*  And it just like my my mental game alone was just just to have that release almost every day was it was great.
*  And I used to be pretty lazy with it was working out.
*  And so now I do I work out almost every day, if not every other day.
*  I like take a day off every other day.
*  That's fucking awesome.
*  It's yeah. Thanks.
*  Trying to make you proud.
*  So much better.
*  Yeah.
*  Across the board.
*  Just but like, you know, I love my body, but I also love like the just the effort, you know.
*  Yeah, I feel good.
*  And then I can, you know, go drink as much as I want and I don't feel bad about it.
*  Well, there goes that health endorsement.
*  No, I'm going to get like a Buffalo Trace endorsement.
*  That's what I'm really angling for.
*  Come on now.
*  I think the real problem is drinking and not working out.
*  I really hate that.
*  Yeah, by the way, cheers, everybody.
*  Salute.
*  Love you guys.
*  I love you guys, too.
*  That's hilarious.
*  It's fun.
*  But it's I mean, so many people that are suffering from depression that don't work out.
*  I'm like, please, people, please, please.
*  It's a world changer.
*  It's better than a drug.
*  That meditation.
*  Yeah.
*  But you can just you don't even have to fucking go somewhere, man.
*  There's so many videos online.
*  If you if you're depressed, just please, please just try something physical.
*  Try.
*  There's a drug that comes out when you do something physical and you could do like simple burpees in your apartment.
*  You could you could do something.
*  But there's something that happens when you work out.
*  It's not just like, you know, like a vanity project.
*  There's actual like benefits to your outlook, you know, and that's what people there's people that make rationalizations and they base those rationalizations off the worst negative stereotypes of someone who works out all the time.
*  Crossfit bros or bodybuilder dudes.
*  Most of those people are like pretty happy, you know, a lot happier than you.
*  Yeah, it's true.
*  It's totally true.
*  Yeah, I was like, you really pointed to me and I was like, wait a second.
*  I meant that person out there critiquing and criticizing them.
*  That's what I meant.
*  There's so many people that, you know, I think we have requirements.
*  I think our body has requirements in terms of like energy expenditure and also threat.
*  There's worry and like about nature itself.
*  And when that doesn't exist anymore, I think the best thing that you could do is challenge yourself all the time with stuff.
*  And like one of the best way to challenge yourself is like do something that's difficult.
*  And do something physical because physical things are always difficult.
*  So if you do something difficult, meaning something that you have to concentrate on getting better at and think about and then also do something physically difficult so that your body gets its demands and you can see things more clearly.
*  Right.
*  Because there's the people that don't ever get a hold of their body also don't get a hold of their emotions.
*  Right.
*  They spaz out.
*  Well, you know, per the the Crossfit thing, too, it's like there's a sense of community there, too.
*  Like these folks are they have each other's backs.
*  They're motivating each other.
*  And, you know, a lot of times when you kind of are like, I'm going to hit the gym and you kind of go solo, there's a different trajectory.
*  I think, you know, I mean, some some people can do a really good job at that.
*  I personally can't.
*  I will crap out pretty early and just be like, yeah, it's pretty good.
*  You know, but if someone's pushing me, then I'll stick with it.
*  I couldn't agree more.
*  Yeah, I couldn't agree more.
*  It's the best way is for a class.
*  It's fun.
*  Like a jujitsu class or MMA class or a crossfit club.
*  I know there's F 45 and orange.
*  Yeah, my friends are into that.
*  Yeah, a lot of people are into that because a bunch of people working out together.
*  It's motivation.
*  But I don't I don't do well when someone like kind of like makes fun of me for not keeping up.
*  Like I was in a spin class once and this this and I've never really spun before.
*  And I was it was hurting my back for some reason.
*  Like I don't think I have my bike at the right height or whatever.
*  Not to make an excuse for myself, but I wasn't keeping up and the instructor kept calling me out in the class and being like, I know you hate me there in the back and the red pants.
*  I was like, yes, I do, bitch.
*  I fucking hate you.
*  I'm never coming back here again.
*  So there's something about people making fun of people that they think is effective.
*  I didn't like to get you to get going.
*  I'd rather have positive reinforcements.
*  That's usually doing good.
*  Let's keep going.
*  See, that would have been the middle of a fucking class.
*  You're vulnerable.
*  You're exhausted.
*  So vulnerable.
*  You know, but that's that's a physical and it's also like a social experience.
*  Like when you do a class with a bunch of folks because you kind of feed off each other's energy, whether you like to admit it or not.
*  You know, you kind of like it's fun.
*  You see everybody's pushing.
*  Yeah.
*  So I feel about yoga class.
*  I could do yoga by myself, but I like it a lot better if I'm in a room full of people.
*  We're all in this fucking struggle together.
*  Yeah.
*  Ninety minutes of bullshit.
*  Yeah.
*  Speaking of yoga, I took a yoga class yesterday, walk out of my class in Silver Lake.
*  Duncan Trussell stand in there.
*  I think he was there for the afternoon mindful meditation.
*  That sounds like Duncan.
*  Yeah.
*  Probably high as fuck.
*  Yeah.
*  I didn't even know if you were really honestly, I said hi and he went, hey, and looked away.
*  And I took my sunglasses off and I was like, hey, it's me, Suzanne.
*  He was like, oh, I don't think he actually thought you were a CIA plant.
*  I'm trying to drag him away from his happy family.
*  Sorry, Duncan.
*  Love you, buddy.
*  Duncan Trussell is one of the great influencers.
*  He's amazing.
*  I did his podcast a couple months ago.
*  It was really fun.
*  He might have the best Twitter page in the known universe because he's the only one that's
*  never succumbed to taking anything seriously.
*  Yeah.
*  Like he has the most preposterous like suggestions for the future in the world.
*  Yeah.
*  And his fucking Twitter page is amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  It's so fun.
*  He's a funny dude.
*  He's so smart, too.
*  What is he got?
*  I don't know.
*  Is that on his page?
*  It's a bloody dick.
*  What is that?
*  It looks like.
*  Yo, what the?
*  What is that?
*  I took the fake salami challenge.
*  I don't know what that is.
*  I don't know what it is either, but I'm disturbed.
*  Yeah, I don't know what's happening.
*  I don't know what's happening.
*  That looks like.
*  I don't know.
*  That's Duncan.
*  That's a good detour.
*  Yeah.
*  His whole fucking Twitter page.
*  He's a fascinating fellow.
*  He's hilarious.
*  He's a hilarious comedian.
*  Duncan and I became friends when he worked at the Comedy Store.
*  He was one of the people.
*  He was a comic there, but he was also the dude who you would call in.
*  If you're in town, you say, hey, man, I'm in town Monday and Wednesday, and they put
*  you on the lineup.
*  So I'd call Duncan.
*  I would give him my days, and then we would wind up talking on the phone for fucking hours.
*  Like, dude, do you know about Aleister Crowley?
*  Of course.
*  Oh my God.
*  Crazy conversations about witchcraft and fucking psychics, UFOs, and the reptilians.
*  Oh my God.
*  Oh my God.
*  And then we just became tight just from talking on the phone when I would call in for my reservations
*  or the days that I was in town.
*  And then we started doing gigs together.
*  He's one of the most interesting people I've ever met in my life.
*  I don't know anyone like him.
*  He's incredible.
*  He's fascinating.
*  100% unique.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know if it's okay to say this on air.
*  Don't say it.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah, keep it together.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I will.
*  I will.
*  No, but he continues to like ... He's like ... Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  There's no one like him.
*  No.
*  Yeah.
*  He's a truly unique gem.
*  Yeah.
*  And his podcast ... I'll tell you that story later.
*  Yeah.
*  I think I know the story.
*  That's why I told you.
*  He cease and desist.
*  Pull out.
*  Pull out, soldier.
*  Oh man.
*  Yeah, good catch.
*  The bullets are flying by.
*  He barely got out of that fucking ...
*  I never know because I forget sometimes that this is a televised platform and we have to
*  keep some cars for ourselves.
*  This goddamn buffalo trace ...
*  Keep some cars for ourselves.
*  ... fucking with your mind.
*  I'm not mad at this buffalo.
*  I love this stuff.
*  It's pretty good.
*  Do you know this company was ... It sounds commercial because I do commercials for them,
*  but it's real.
*  They were founded in the 1700s.
*  It's the same company.
*  What?
*  They even operated through prohibition.
*  They had medical weed licenses for people in California.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Okay.
*  You know they had medical weed licenses for people in California.
*  Thank you though.
*  I know what you're doing.
*  You can try to get my back.
*  For people in California before it was legal, right?
*  Before alcohol was legal, you could get a medical, medicinal alcohol use license.
*  Right.
*  This is still in prohibition.
*  So if you had a dirty doctor ...
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  If you had a dirty doctor during prohibition, the man gets shakes.
*  The only thing that can help him is the whiskey.
*  Is whiskey.
*  And it's like you're right on some scroll and hand it to you.
*  God, what a racket.
*  But this fucking company did that all through prohibition.
*  So they've been making whiskeys for 300 fucking years.
*  I love that.
*  It's bonkers.
*  It's a good story.
*  Well done.
*  I read that there was a religious exemption also.
*  For wine.
*  For Judaism, if you were a rabbi.
*  I don't know the way you could disperse alcohol, but there were also no limitations into what
*  it took to become a rabbi.
*  What about Catholicism?
*  Yeah, blood of Christ.
*  Anybody could become a rabbi though.
*  There were hundreds of rabbis pop up everywhere.
*  Oh, just so you could get a whole whiskey?
*  That's incredible.
*  That's a good move.
*  Wow.
*  There's a great podcast.
*  I would turn to a rabbi, but that's a lot of work.
*  I don't think they were working.
*  I think they were just.
*  Okay.
*  Can you be an honorary rabbi like you'd be an honorary doctor?
*  Because to be a rabbi and to go through all of the literature.
*  Would you?
*  Is the question.
*  Well, whether you would or not, if you wanted to do it, it's no moral judgment or ethical
*  judgment.
*  It's a fucking immense amount of work.
*  To go from learning Judaism to be a fucking rabbi.
*  That's not an easy path.
*  They make this shit hard.
*  That's kind of like in the Terrence McKenna book, True Hallucinations, where he goes to
*  Tibet and he's trying.
*  I'm going to totally butcher this because I literally read it this morning.
*  He's trying to go to this.
*  This is so bad.
*  Okay.
*  Help me out if you remember what I'm talking about.
*  I haven't read it since 2002.
*  Somewhere in that range when I first started really getting into McKenna.
*  I don't necessarily.
*  I mess that up with food of the gods too all the time.
*  Help me out here.
*  If he's studying Buddhism, but he's really trying to get to this top level.
*  Was that the I Ching when he was interested in the I Ching?
*  No.
*  He's trying to get to.
*  It's almost like a heretic cultish area of shamanism that also involves psychedelics.
*  He had all these preconceived ideas about what they were doing.
*  It was sorely frowned upon for him to go study with these people, but he needed to learn
*  the language first.
*  Does that make sense?
*  I'm just butchering this.
*  We should delete this later.
*  What was the point though?
*  What was my heart struggling to remember?
*  The point is he was posing as a student studying one thing, but he really wanted to get to
*  this other thing that had primarily to do with psychedelics and was frowned upon in
*  that religious community.
*  It's bad.
*  Are you looking at his cheek?
*  No, no, no.
*  He was into that with almost every religious community.
*  He had a pretty firm belief that all religious experiences initially were the result of psychedelics.
*  He was big on this theory that he had that his brother actually does almost a better
*  job of explaining called the stoned ape theory.
*  His theory was that humans became human because of psychedelic mushrooms and that the psychedelic
*  mushrooms are the aliens and that psychedelic mushrooms exist in other planets and they
*  came over here on asteroids and slammed into the earth because the spores can survive in
*  a vacuum.
*  And so this weird life form that actually breathes air like us.
*  Yeah.
*  No, you exist almost instantaneously.
*  Yeah.
*  They're they're weird.
*  Like to deny that that mushrooms are weird, like you definitely haven't done them then
*  because if you don't think that might be alien life, like you haven't done them if you haven't
*  done enough.
*  I'm not mad at that.
*  You into psychedelics, Gary?
*  That might be where the aliens.
*  You into psychedelics?
*  So, so the story about people being like created people by aliens that we're talking about
*  earlier, maybe the aliens, the mushrooms.
*  And that's what McKenna believed.
*  McKenna had this theory that and he had a bunch of like fucking science behind it and
*  weird and way I say fucking science should show you.
*  I have no idea what I'm really talking about.
*  It's a great theory about the reason why humans went from lower hominids to human beings
*  was because we ate mushrooms.
*  The reason why the human brain doubled over a period of two million years was the regular
*  consumption of psilocybin mushrooms because it existed all around us and that we ate them
*  all the time and then eating them all the time literally caused some sort of fucking
*  neural enhancement of the animal.
*  It's a super controversial theory.
*  But when you listen to his brother, Dennis, talk about it.
*  Dennis is, you know, he's alive and well and a super brilliant guy.
*  And he explained it to me in semi scientific terms.
*  I say semi because I don't know what the fuck he really meant.
*  But the way he explained the development of language and that the reasons why psilocybin
*  could actually have enhanced the development of language.
*  Yeah, it could make sense.
*  I mean, the the core of their mission when they went into the Amazon in the 70s with
*  no cell phones, no sat phones with I mean, they could like there could have been two
*  dozen things that could have killed them on their way to this village is like profound
*  in and of itself.
*  Yeah.
*  And the dedication to their study is like is blowing my mind.
*  And it makes me feel like I haven't lived at all.
*  But when you hear that, did you ever hear the La Trujera story where Dennis McKenna
*  talks about eating so many mushrooms that he literally like lost all knowledge of who
*  he was and what life was for weeks?
*  Whoa, I don't know.
*  I didn't get to that part of the book yet.
*  Crazy breakthrough slash breakdown slash expansion contraction.
*  Yeah. Supernova inside of his brain that left like fucking reeling for a long period of
*  time. I don't want to say how long it was, but Terrence described it and he described
*  it like he just went bonkers.
*  Yeah. He ate so many mushrooms like he crossed over to the other side and then he came back.
*  I mean, I've never done like I've never done like heroes dose.
*  You know, like I well, that's not true.
*  But I think that like there's this part of me that's like, you know, that a God's dose.
*  Oh, I think I think it was Thor.
*  The Thor shits on heroes.
*  Oh, my God. He did.
*  He did. Oh, my God.
*  Dose of mushrooms.
*  It that's yeah.
*  Because if he was by himself, would he have remembered to eat?
*  Would he remember to go to the bathroom?
*  Would he have remembered to take showers?
*  People with him? Who knows?
*  I'd have to review the story, but.
*  He's so fucking smart. It's confusing.
*  He's one of those dudes you talk to him like, how do you remember all this stuff?
*  Like, what do you talk to me about the actual origins for speech and like why it could have
*  been connected to psilocybin and the impact that psilocybin has on the brain?
*  And then it's this weird thing.
*  It's like that's a comforting thought, though.
*  The man has done so many drugs that he's still like on top of his intellect.
*  You know, easy to talk to.
*  That's really cool.
*  He's a super, super, super nice guy, too.
*  But it's almost like there's a key slot in our brain for mushrooms.
*  It's like, oh, hey, you got clunk.
*  It just fits right in.
*  It just locks right in place.
*  And it might be the reason why we are who we are.
*  And somewhere along the line, we forgot.
*  You know, I've definitely.
*  OK, if this isn't OK to say on the air, we can take it.
*  It's totally. But I've microdosed, you know, after Taurus.
*  Who are you? What have you done with your hand?
*  I just decided to choose that this was the time to not talk about my terms.
*  But like when I was sad after Taurus, like, I don't know, Gary,
*  if you if you get like this, but I have this like come down of like
*  depression for a couple of weeks after the road.
*  And like there's that initial excitement to be home.
*  But then your body isn't used to the non momentum.
*  You're you're like, you know, like the train stop.
*  But you kind of keep going another, you know, 100 yards or 500 yards or whatever.
*  And I I would get really sad and I come home and sort of feel like
*  I didn't know how to come back to my reality.
*  And it's lonely. It's kind of, you know, whatever.
*  But I would microdose a little bit and it would just kind of
*  get me out of my depression.
*  The tiniest bit, I wouldn't even trip.
*  I would just take a little bit of, you know, and I think there's
*  obviously like this is nothing new.
*  But dozens of people are doing that.
*  But it is something that I like, I think is is really
*  profound and helpful, has been in my life.
*  But a lot of people agree with you.
*  It's so funny that I thought after all we've been talking about,
*  this is the moment where I'm going to get a phone call from the feds.
*  I think I'm drunk.
*  Well, we definitely had a little bit to drink.
*  I'm happy with it.
*  You know, that's on the ballot to make the decriminalized mushrooms. Right.
*  I know you. I don't know much about it, but you're trying to.
*  Push it through. And thanks to people like Maps, you know,
*  who this that organization run by Rick Doblin is doing all this crazy work
*  to try to show the benefits of psychedelics, particularly with MDMA
*  and soldiers who have PTSD and other people in DMA and soldiers.
*  Yes. MDMA and people, victims of violence, victims of auto accidents,
*  a really common one for PTSD.
*  A lot of people get in auto accidents and have that. Yeah.
*  And they're doing this work with PTSD and MDMA,
*  and they're trying to show like this is a legitimate therapy.
*  That's probably like highly effective.
*  We should look at it like that instead of looking at it
*  like some some illegal drugs. Right. Only terrible. Right.
*  And so you got pharmaceutical companies that are are going to want their,
*  you know, take on it, which is the problem is that they have influence.
*  Yeah. The problem is not that they exist because they make a bunch of amazing shit.
*  Pharmaceutical drug companies make amazing shit and it keeps a lot of people alive.
*  It keeps a lot of people healthy.
*  But they also are invested in making tremendous amounts of money.
*  And they're like cell phones.
*  If they find a threat to that money, then they move in politically
*  and they try to stop that threat.
*  And they'll hold back certain drugs from being turned legal
*  that are really beneficial that might cut into their profit margin.
*  Well, I briefly told you about Saraset, the sleep therapy I did.
*  Yeah. Tell me more about. Oh, my God.
*  So I have had insomnia for over a decade.
*  Like most months I could look back and tell you what days on.
*  I could count on one hand that I slept like eight hours.
*  So I would fall asleep and then wake up three hours later
*  and just kind of deal with the night and in and out.
*  And it was it is and was a really tough way to live.
*  You know, you kind of just it sort of rules your world.
*  A really good friend of mine,
*  my friend Jake, I met with him in December and he said,
*  I really think you should try this this program.
*  It's called Saraset.
*  And what it is is he he helped me obtain a
*  like a mobile device for my house.
*  But you can they have facilities all over the country.
*  And what it is is these sensors are you wear this headband
*  and it has sensors on your frontal and temporal lobes.
*  And it comes with a tablet that is basically
*  bouncing sound waves off of your skull.
*  So you listen to these series of tones that are like,
*  there's no order to it.
*  And it is it is sort of measuring the the brainwave activity
*  inside your skull and then evening it out right or left brain.
*  It sounds so crazy. It sounds so crazy.
*  All I can tell you is that I dedicated myself to it for five weeks.
*  You don't have any alcohol.
*  You don't have any marijuana, not even CBD.
*  Yeah. You feel me, not. Yeah. Can you do it?
*  I know you can. You do your sober October. Yes.
*  So I can do it. I I was the first two weeks were horrible.
*  The first two weeks were like it got worse before it got better.
*  But I can tell you right now, for the first time in over a decade,
*  I'm sleeping through the night. Whoa. Like like I never was.
*  I mean, obviously, if I'm like partying with my friends,
*  I'm not going to sleep through the night. But I have like did it.
*  It's so different. My life is like and I have a different
*  like my anxiety is kind of chilled out.
*  Because of sleep. That makes sense. Yeah.
*  But also recovering better.
*  So something I learned through Sarah said was that they like I talked
*  to this woman in Indianapolis that was helping me like with the program.
*  And she had, you know, she was like, have you had any significant
*  head injuries, which I have?
*  I had like a jet ski accident when I was 22 and I got fucked up.
*  I got concussed and I had like two points of impact.
*  It was really bad.
*  And she said you would be surprised at how that can have an effect on
*  on your like flight mode.
*  Like I've been in like run from a tiger mode kind of thing.
*  And, you know, basically the program is tailored to people with PTSD,
*  head injuries or just high stress levels.
*  And yeah, man, it's been great.
*  That's amazing. I'm so and I'm really grateful that I had a friend
*  who was looking out for me to help me with it, because, I mean,
*  I was just kind of getting used to not sleeping, you know, regularly.
*  A woman used to fight for the UFC.
*  Her name is Kat Zingano, a badass chick from San Diego.
*  And she had a fight with Amanda Nunes, who's the UFC
*  current Bantamweight champion.
*  OK. And this is before she was a champion.
*  And Kat actually won a winning the fight, but she got battered
*  in the first round, like really bad.
*  And her brain was fucked up for a long time after that.
*  Like she had like significant imbalances in her hormone levels.
*  And it was like legitimate brain damage.
*  Like she had issues to the way her brain got rocked so hard in the first round.
*  And she actually came back and stopped Amanda Nunes, which is crazy,
*  considering how much damage she had taken in that first round.
*  But she went to this place in San Diego that treats soldiers.
*  And I can't remember the name of the place.
*  Do you remember the name of that place, Jamie?
*  And they use some something similar, where there was magnets,
*  like very, very powerful magnets.
*  And through some way, it stimulates the areas of the brain.
*  It's been damaged and it regenerates the tissue.
*  Yeah. Or regenerates the, you know, the use of that part of the brain.
*  I don't understand. I don't understand it either.
*  But like, you know, sound is vibration.
*  So it's it's doing something.
*  I mean, all I can say is that like I feel a dramatic difference.
*  That's amazing. That's so crazy.
*  Yeah. And this is not an ad.
*  It's not. I'm not getting paid for it.
*  How does someone find out about this?
*  What's the website?
*  You could just probably Google.
*  Sarah said it's C-E-R-E-S-E-T.
*  And they have facilities that are kind of popping up all over the place.
*  There's there's another company.
*  I'm not sure what they're called.
*  The place you went to is this something?
*  No, this is a this is a really good friend of mine who was just looking out for me
*  and knew how bad my insomnia was.
*  And he had a similar version of insomnia.
*  And everybody's different.
*  You know, everybody's got their different like some people can stay awake all night.
*  You know, how long before our robot overlords take control of our brains?
*  I don't know.
*  Us from all the pain and suffering that it is to be human.
*  I know. I was I was worried I was going to turn into a cyborg.
*  I know. How long?
*  Now I am bionic.
*  The more I think about aliens, the more I think they're us in the future.
*  That's one of the theories that has always been bounced around,
*  because if you look at what a human looks like versus what a gorilla looks like,
*  if you keep going with that, it'll be some weird skinny thing that doesn't need any muscles.
*  It has a big giant head that controls space and time around it.
*  You know, that that's probably what we're turned into.
*  And we're going to do it through electronics.
*  We're going to introduce something into our brain, whether it's that Elon Musk
*  thing they're trying to do with drilling holes and putting wires in your brain.
*  Neuralink, it's going to be you to have like super fucking accelerated ability
*  to access information.
*  It'll be always at the tip of your fingers.
*  I'm guessing, you know, eventually.
*  I mean, how long before we're robots?
*  We already are going to give up.
*  We are. It's already like, I don't know.
*  It's just going to give you love 24 7 through an IV drip.
*  And you're going to take it over real life.
*  I mean, you don't think this is a simulation right now?
*  It might be. It might be.
*  It might be or it might not be.
*  And that's the problem.
*  The problem is, it's so weird, it might as well be a simulation.
*  It's so bonkers.
*  It might as well be a simulation.
*  It is. It's weird.
*  We're watching some political Game of Thrones type shit.
*  Oh, my God. On television.
*  That's a scary way to put it.
*  It's fascinating. It is.
*  It's fascinating. Yeah.
*  Now what do we do? What do we do now?
*  It's so weird. It's so weird.
*  I. Yeah.
*  Every once in a while, I wake up and I'm like,
*  I think I just woke up in a different dimension, like.
*  I know that sounds crazy.
*  It doesn't sound crazy, though.
*  It is. Some of this stuff is so overwhelming.
*  The way we're changing so quickly.
*  Yeah. And the information that's coming at us that I don't know
*  if I'm shutting down or if I'm just like going to another place.
*  We are currently alive and conscious on a raft headed to a waterfall.
*  Cool. That's what's going on.
*  We're waking up as this is happening, going, holy shit. Great.
*  What the fuck? Yeah.
*  We're what's changing so quickly. Yeah.
*  We're going 25 miles an hour straight to our towards a goddamn waterfall.
*  It's definitely going to kill us.
*  I you know what, though? I don't.
*  Gary, how are you doing?
*  Gary's empty. We need to get Gary's refill.
*  I could probably choose to to pee.
*  I don't have to pee. Yeah, you can go pee.
*  Can I? Yes. Thank God.
*  Thank God.
*  I will see nice things about. Oh, God, I hope so.
*  We're only about positivity these days.
*  After this conversation, we're going to try to figure out some sort of a
*  like a national mantra.
*  We could keep it positive people probably play another song.
*  Of course, some of us. Fuck. Yeah.
*  Oh, you. You're fine.
*  He wants to go. You're fine.
*  No, I don't know.
*  That's how I don't know if I want to.
*  Mass cows. Dangerous.
*  Do you want to open up this stuff?
*  This is the stuff that Suzanne brought for roses. Small batch.
*  Yeah, I'm up for that. OK.
*  You know, for that, please hand me your glass. Kind, sir.
*  Jamie, we we need to get some sort of
*  glasses made out of animal horns up in this bitch.
*  Makes it not a glass, though. Whatever, bro.
*  So some gotta be some gotta be technical.
*  I was thinking I was thinking like glasses, like like
*  Jamie's all fucking technical shit.
*  You guys cool if I doodle a little bit?
*  Do please do.
*  In here, please do.
*  Oh, I owe you that guitar.
*  I told you they only made them in yellow.
*  Dude, I don't care what color any guitar you want to bring here is.
*  It could be bright pink.
*  I'll put that motherfucker on the wall right next to Richard Pryor.
*  Oh, yeah. Right there. Pow. Bam.
*  Whoa. Be nice.
*  Let's make it happen.
*  I got one for you.
*  Did I ever tell you the story about my friend Phil Hartman
*  when he was a kid?
*  He was a roadie for Jimi Hendrix for one night.
*  He was like, whatever you would call it, a grip.
*  Someone who's a stage tech.
*  Yeah, stage tech. Yeah.
*  Stagehand. Yeah.
*  And he was he was a teenager and Hendrix is at the whiskey.
*  And he's there putting his hands on the speakers,
*  making sure they don't fall over because they were kind of perilously close
*  to the edge and Hendrix is just fucking going off.
*  He was just going off right in front of him.
*  Wow.
*  Right in front of him, right in front of him.
*  And he said, dude, he goes, he was feet away from me.
*  I could have touched him.
*  He was Hendrix.
*  Phil Hartman told me with great me and Phil Hartman got high a couple of times
*  when we did his radio together.
*  It was one of the only couple of times that I got high during that era.
*  It was it wasn't much. He got high.
*  He got high a lot.
*  Matter of fact, I might not have even gotten high.
*  I definitely got drunk anyway.
*  He was telling me about when he was a teenager that he worked with Jimi Hendrix.
*  He was a stage tech at the whiskey.
*  Wait, so how old was Phil then?
*  He must have when I met him.
*  I want to say he was 46 when I met him coming off a Saturday night.
*  So like 90s, 94 is when I met him.
*  OK, I don't want to say he was like late 40s.
*  So when he was a teenager, Jimmy died in late 70s, right?
*  He died in 1970, I think.
*  Oh, early 70s. Yeah. OK.
*  So how old was Phil?
*  So when I met Phil, it was 94.
*  That was 24 years later.
*  Does that make sense if he was like 19 at the time or something like that?
*  Wow. So anyway, he's a kid and Hendrix is right in front of him.
*  And his job is to make sure that the speaker doesn't fall into the crowd.
*  So he's standing there and he's looking up at the stage,
*  standing in front of the stage and fucking Jimi Hendrix is right in front of him
*  in this prime.
*  You know, when when everything is going down, you couldn't believe he was real.
*  You couldn't believe he's standing right in front of you.
*  Like Hendrix didn't exist before.
*  There was no there's no pre Hendrix.
*  There's just Hendrix and everything else is like what like
*  you read about Eric Clapton, like Eric Clapton's quotes
*  about seeing Hendrix play for the very first time.
*  It's fascinating. Yeah.
*  Because you realize like with his top of the food chain, guitarist
*  go to see Hendrix and they go, what the fuck are we doing?
*  What are we doing? What is he doing?
*  What the fuck is happening here?
*  And then Phil said it was happening right in front of him.
*  Phil, you know, would dabble in music for fun.
*  He really enjoyed like playing guitar and fucking around.
*  So for him to be a kid and to be standing right in front of Hendrix
*  performing was like, whoa, did he did he know at the time?
*  Did he say he knew at the time that that was like?
*  Well, he was a fan at the time, you know,
*  but I mean, this is like I guess it has to be like 69 or 70.
*  Whenever that that day was Jimmy's like rain,
*  you know, when before he was like playing clubs and then playing,
*  you know, to the magnitude that question.
*  That's a good question.
*  Mm hmm. I'm not sure exactly.
*  I know he just made records for a handful of years before, like
*  really getting out there and playing live.
*  I think playing live and stuff is like he's doing like the chillin
*  so I could play with the Isley brothers, right?
*  And people like Little Richard being like the backup guitar. Right on.
*  OK. They didn't like him doing all that fancy with his teeth
*  and behind his head.
*  Bullshit. So they fired him.
*  Quick draw attention to yourself.
*  Wow. That's amazing.
*  No, don't be great on my stage, but I don't want to go somewhere else with that.
*  There's some sounds, you know, like one of my
*  one of my favorite influences of Jimi Hendrix is Steve Ray Vaughn.
*  One of my absolute favorites, because he managed to mimic
*  Jimi Hendrix in a tribute way, but also make it kind of his own.
*  Like he did some shit that was clear.
*  Like he had a sound.
*  Steve Ray Vaughn had a sound. Yeah.
*  But he was a clear Jimi Hendrix fan, like a super fan.
*  Like there was a giant influence of him, you could tell.
*  But yet he was different. Like it wasn't offensive.
*  It's like when he did Voodoo Child,
*  Steve Ray Vaughn's Voodoo Child is fucking slamming.
*  Have you ever heard it? I mean, whoa.
*  Yeah, I mean, not enough. Amazing.
*  Steve Ray Vaughn's Voodoo Child is amazing.
*  It's not better, but it's fucking amazing.
*  That's right. It's a it's a it's a Steve Ray Vaughn.
*  Almost like a tip of the hat.
*  Yeah, it's a tribute in a way. Cool.
*  It's got a but it's got fucking force behind it.
*  Yeah. Oh, it's good.
*  It's good. It's another great workout song. Yeah.
*  Right after kickstarting.
*  You're starting a whole playlist for everybody right now.
*  Child with Stammer.
*  Yeah, man.
*  Oh, did someone mix it together?
*  There's a video on YouTube with both of them back to back.
*  Oh, wow. That's too much.
*  I can't take it.
*  Or I really might mix them together, I think.
*  Damn. Wow.
*  Well, that's another guy that like there wasn't a Steve Ray Vaughn
*  before Steve Ray Vaughn. He's a unique human.
*  Yeah, like he had a very, very unique sound.
*  Yeah, there's and cactus shirt. Let's be honest.
*  He's just all around. I would wear that.
*  Yeah, I've watched.
*  I've seen this video multiple times for over 20 something years.
*  I never noticed the cat. Gary, come on.
*  You're a very fashionable man.
*  Is he from Austin? Where's he from?
*  Oak Cliff, Dallas, Texas.
*  Dallas, Dallas, Dallas, Dallas, beautiful boys.
*  God damn a lot of good shit comes out of Texas.
*  Sure does. Yeah.
*  Exhibit A. Freedom.
*  Chaos. Great spot.
*  It's all there.
*  Well, they took a good chunk of the fucking country and claimed it is.
*  Yeah, there's not a lot going on.
*  I have a love hate relationship with Texas.
*  I don't want to say hate, but it's you know, yeah.
*  It's so hard to talk about this hate real quick.
*  Too hot. It's too hot, Gary.
*  That's why it's not.
*  Can we talk about that?
*  I'm not going to get political.
*  I'm not going to. I'm just like as a as a texture.
*  That's too hot.
*  It's too hot.
*  That's too hot as a security system to keep too many people from moving in.
*  Fuck's sake. I mean, you can't even go outside.
*  That's why it's so good.
*  It's perfect. If you could take that sauna heat.
*  Yeah. Just just just condition yourself.
*  Sure. Get a sauna in your house.
*  OK. And get you saluted down.
*  Now it's romantic.
*  Yeah, that's great. I love it there.
*  I love doing stand up there.
*  Like main main spot. That's your main hub.
*  Yeah. Texas. Yeah.
*  That's the main home.
*  Austin, Texas is one of the best places on the planet Earth.
*  Yeah. And everybody knows it now, unfortunately.
*  You get on the highway like, oh, the word got out.
*  Well, yeah, the traffic's no no joke on there.
*  Yeah, it's pretty.
*  Some people say like Houston fucked Austin.
*  So you mean Houston?
*  Houston fucked Dallas.
*  Yeah. A few Houston fucked Dallas and made Austin.
*  That's what I should say.
*  That's what they say. Yeah.
*  I've heard that before.
*  Hmm. Austin is a weird spot, right?
*  It's like Austin is somehow or another.
*  It's not it's not as watered down as the last one.
*  It's in between.
*  You know, there's the desert out out west and there's New Orleans and Louisiana.
*  Yeah. But Austin is particularly artistic.
*  Some weird way, not entirely, but there's a giant chunk of artists
*  out of Austin, like fierce artists.
*  Yeah. Weird like there's a lot of in Austin.
*  There's a lot of focus on independence
*  and a lot of like rewarding independent artists and independent musicians
*  and appreciating like real shit. Right.
*  But Austin, that's one of the things about Austin.
*  It's like if 100 percent more than I think any other city in the country
*  favors real shit, it favors authentic food, authentic music.
*  It's it's a it's a different kind of town.
*  Oh, yeah. Oh, definitely. Yeah.
*  It's a different kind of town.
*  They're not buying the normal bullshit there in bulk.
*  It's a different spot.
*  You know, and I hate to say it because they'll get swarmed.
*  Yeah. How do you feel about like
*  what's happened to it since it's like people like found out about it?
*  How do I feel? Yeah.
*  I live a few miles away.
*  Yeah, that's good. That's good.
*  So you're not you're not in the belly of the beast.
*  No, you know, but I love I grew up there.
*  I was a teenager there running those streets and, you know,
*  ran into the same faces every day for 15 years.
*  It's nice to see somebody else. Yeah.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And for those young musicians out there who would, you know,
*  have to deal with the bucket and play out there for tips
*  and have these people from all over the place come in and they can, you know.
*  It almost feels kind of global.
*  Did you do that?
*  Well, you play with a bucket in front of you.
*  Yeah, you did. You were a busker.
*  I was a cool and that was called that's the official.
*  Turn in clubs like, you know, like in bars or whatever.
*  Hang out and play for four hours.
*  What? Sometimes you play.
*  That's so cool.
*  And then you make six dollars.
*  Yeah. Four people.
*  Damn. God damn.
*  But yeah. What are we talking when this was happening?
*  Ninety.
*  Ninety eight through.
*  2010. That's amazing.
*  Really? When did things happen for you?
*  When did things like legitimately happen?
*  Twenty ten. Twenty ten.
*  Yeah, I got a call up from Eric Clapton said, come play my festival.
*  And it kind of changed my whole. Holy shit.
*  So I went from. Yeah. Holy shit. Yeah, man.
*  So yeah, man.
*  Burning candles, you know what I mean?
*  Eric Clapton.
*  So yeah, it was a but so I don't mind the the folks coming through.
*  You know what I mean? Yeah, I feel like if you're intimidated,
*  somebody's going to come take your spot and step your fucking game up.
*  Yeah. You know what I mean? That's how I feel.
*  But it's happening everywhere.
*  You know, it's like the people coming in and I like how much you share.
*  You're really good at your like, I don't know, you're a generous man.
*  What do you mean?
*  Like, I feel like you have this ability to like when you were talking about
*  you know, tuning into the radio, like you're a good listener.
*  That's that's what that means.
*  You know, as a musician.
*  Well, I was a middle child, so it's never been about me.
*  It's perfect.
*  Damn, yeah, that's perfect.
*  That's so good. Middle child's have a chip.
*  No, but I mean, like that's a really positive way to look at
*  rapid change, like a city like Austin that, you know, you could say
*  it's being inundated with just like this huge volume of people coming in
*  and it makes your life whatever.
*  But instead, you're like, no, come on.
*  Like that's that's a good attitude. I salute that.
*  But it's different.
*  You know, I'm a little bit more comfortable now and able to stay out of the madness.
*  Yeah, that's a great attitude for all aspects of life.
*  Yeah. The idea that someone's going to take your spot,
*  like they're not going to take your spot.
*  That's not it's not what's happening. Right. Right.
*  Well, you know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah.
*  It's like, yeah, I know exactly.
*  I think we're conditioned to feel that way, though,
*  that someone's going to take your spot.
*  And that's a that's a fucked up way to live.
*  You know, you're just scared.
*  I think for a long time, people, you know, really dealt with scarcity.
*  Yeah. You look back at people that lived in like the 1920s and 30s.
*  They weighed like 110 pounds, like all the men, the little tiny men.
*  Like everybody was barely eating.
*  They didn't work out. They were barely eating.
*  They worked. You know, people were like hoping they didn't starve to death.
*  You know, through the 20s, like the roaring 20s and then the depression
*  I mean, what, you know, people starved to death.
*  It was like a regular occurrence.
*  And there's parts of the world that's happening right now. Yeah.
*  We we're we're a weird animal. Yeah.
*  We really are. Yeah.
*  And what we are today is just so much different than what we used to be.
*  Like at lightning speed. Mm hmm.
*  Isn't it funny to think about like the gym and all of the intricacies?
*  You heard me. Can't even talk.
*  But but no, no, no.
*  Like to like our physicality and how we tailor our bodies and workouts.
*  And then just what you said, like 1910 and people are weighing 110 pounds.
*  And like, you know, they're just eating, trying to get enough money to eat.
*  And then like we have these lifestyles of like to a science or exercise
*  and our diets. And it's fucking fascinating.
*  Yeah, we're just trying.
*  But also people around the world are are still living like that.
*  We're trying to not eat too much. Yeah.
*  That's what we're trying to do.
*  They're trying to stay alive.
*  We're trying to not eat too much. Oh, my God. It's so hard.
*  Crazy. No, I mean, like, let's take a minute.
*  It's so funny. But you know, hard is not eat.
*  You fucking. How is it hard to not do a thing?
*  That doesn't even make it's hard to do things.
*  Yeah, it might be hard mentally to not do a thing. Yeah.
*  That mental struggle is real as fuck, though, right?
*  Yeah. I think I think there's like a weird line of being like conscious of that
*  and then feeling worthy of your own lifestyle and your own life.
*  That's where your weird robot overlords.
*  Hell, yeah. Comes in place. Yeah.
*  Because that shit keeps me up at night.
*  It charges your brain, fixes you, straightens your own.
*  Calm the fuck down, Suzanne.
*  Become one. Become one with the vibration, Suzanne.
*  There's no there's no reason to be a rebel.
*  I don't know about that. Stay with us. Stay with us.
*  Stay tuned. Stay tuned.
*  I'm ready to change some shit.
*  The narrative, I don't know. I don't like it.
*  What narrative do you not like?
*  Um, you know, music industry stuff, I think.
*  I've been working really hard to go against the grain of like right now.
*  I'm self released, like I don't have a record company and I'm self funded.
*  And it's really hard.
*  But it's also really gratifying at the same time, because, you know, right now,
*  I since I left Honey Honey,
*  you know, like Honey Honey's kind of on ice for, you know, sort of.
*  Yeah, you didn't nuke the territory.
*  No. Just moved out of the building.
*  Yeah. Well, we we're figuring it out, you know.
*  Well said. Well said.
*  Oh, my God.
*  But, you know, the the battle is getting ahead, you know,
*  and being a woman and being in my 30s.
*  And and not like, you know, no one wants to hop on board until they know it's working,
*  even though I made this incredible record and it's so well received.
*  And then folks are like, yeah, well, you know, call us when it's when it's working,
*  rather than like get in now. Right.
*  And, you know, I feel I don't feel discouraged by that.
*  I feel informed.
*  But that that's also a business move, you know, because it is
*  we're taking art and turning it into commerce.
*  And no one wants to bet on a horse that's not winning yet.
*  You know, and, you know, I'm pretty I feel pretty good about what I'm doing.
*  I don't think I should be doing something else, but it's still a struggle.
*  You know, so when I said I want to change the narrative, it's it's sort of like
*  I want to kind of prove to myself and others that like you can do it,
*  like you find a way, you know, and it's it's really hard,
*  but you can do it, you know, and you get help from your friends.
*  Like this is so cool to be here with you guys.
*  Like, I don't know if I could really convey that enough that this is a huge help
*  to what I'm trying to do right now.
*  But yeah, also, this is the thing that keeps me up at night of being like,
*  oh, my God, this is hard.
*  But at the same time, you know,
*  the the music industry, I'll just speak to that right now. It's tough.
*  Well, it seems to me if I as an outsider, there's no business in the music business.
*  When I look at it, I feel like it's a big ship
*  that had to like cut parts of itself off.
*  And now it's a smaller ship.
*  Yeah. And now it's like, whoa, it's still a pretty big ship.
*  But it's not what it used to be.
*  The money doesn't come in anymore in the form of record sales.
*  So it's it's entrenched its tentacles deeper into the industry
*  and other things like merchandise and live shows and all these different things
*  to stay alive. And maybe it helps. Yeah.
*  Maybe it doesn't. It depends entirely upon the artist.
*  But what you're doing at your point in your life, we like, look,
*  this isn't fucking working.
*  Like what what do I need to do?
*  Like being attached to this group is not doing it.
*  Being attached to that group is not doing it.
*  What the fuck's doing it?
*  Let me just try to not be attached to someone. Yeah.
*  And through the Internet, you have the option to put your stuff out there.
*  Yeah. And it gets a reaction from people with stuff like this. Yeah.
*  And then they go, oh, shit, this bitch is talented.
*  Well, you know, and I'm thanks.
*  First of all, it's sweet.
*  You know, I love you. I love you, too.
*  I it's not like I want to like take over the world.
*  I just want to like make a good living doing what I love.
*  That's all I want. You know, and it's it's fucking hard.
*  I know it's hard, but it's also
*  yeah, like it in it.
*  You know, I want to capture that thing.
*  I want to get into the right tune into the right radio station
*  and also not have to worry so much
*  about like not having enough to get by, you know, that kind of thing.
*  And it's it sounds silly, but it's not like that.
*  That is my reality.
*  What what is the major function of a record label?
*  Not hating, just wondering what's the major function of a record label
*  when you're not really necessarily selling records?
*  So they are trying to blow up anybody's business.
*  Well, you you can you want to weigh in on this?
*  I can give a little bit. Yeah.
*  Uh, they're for marketing promotion, marketing.
*  Um, they're the folks who help you with budgets for tour.
*  They're a bank.
*  So when it says like, yeah, just for tour, is that because you have to lay out
*  money in advance to set up a set and to make sure that everybody gets to the place?
*  They have the money to get to the event and set everything up.
*  And then then they would reap some of the reward.
*  So it's almost like an initial investment and then based on return from ticket sale.
*  Right. So, yeah, so like, you know.
*  But it's it's expensive to be out on tour.
*  Right. Yeah, it's it's a lot to be out.
*  And you're paying for the.
*  Anything and everything, you're paying to play, basically.
*  And so what they do is they come in and they'll help you with things like that.
*  And and and.
*  But sometimes it doesn't work for people, you know, and that's that's the thing is like.
*  People come into this thing going, oh, I made it.
*  I've got this this deal.
*  But if your record doesn't hit or whatever doesn't hit,
*  then they've invested all this money.
*  So it's kind of it puts this extra pressure on you to figure out what you need to do to make it.
*  And I think some people go down a different route and would change up, switch up their thing.
*  And and and but they they can be very helpful.
*  Yeah. It depends on your attitude, too.
*  A lot of it is your attitude and what you think of like, you know, are you being taken advantage of?
*  Or is this an investment?
*  It's going to pay off because there's so it goes so up and down, you know, depending on.
*  I would imagine it would be hard to be free and creative and having a good time with it.
*  If you feel like you're being taken advantage of, it would put a dark cloud over it.
*  Well, there's that. And I think there's also the misconception that once you get a big record deal
*  and I've had a few where you think all of a sudden, like you have to stop doing something
*  and they're going to do it for you.
*  That is like the biggest mistake you could ever make.
*  And if anything, you have to work harder and prove to them that like you're kind of worthy of their time and money.
*  You know, sometimes it depends. It depends on the company.
*  But, you know, essentially, like when you sign a deal with with these folks,
*  like they have a lot of your creative integrity in some ways, depending on the deal and how it's shaped.
*  And, you know, they own your copyright if they want to own your record,
*  depending on your deal, sometimes you have more leverage than others.
*  And, you know, if that's the case, like, fuck, yeah, good for you.
*  That's so weird that they own the whole thing that they could ever own the whole thing.
*  Well, I sell I sell for these sell it for an exorbitant amount of money.
*  The idea that you would own the whole song, they would own the writing, the music,
*  not the writing. No, not that.
*  Not that. Copyright and publishing are different things.
*  OK, so you could still have someone else do that song.
*  So OK, so I self released my last record, Ruby Red, and I learned a lot
*  because I hired my own PR and distribution companies.
*  And I really got into the nuts and bolts on how all this shit works.
*  And I'm not sure if this has changed because sometimes this is,
*  you know, going back and forth.
*  But when you own your copyright, the digital return on things like Spotify and iTunes are 10 to 1.
*  So when the record companies own your copyright and all of your streaming,
*  is is like kicking, like just fucking taking off.
*  They're making tons of money on your streaming.
*  Ten times more than you are. Yes. Jesus Christ. Yes.
*  I know. Crazy.
*  Wow. Major labor is now earning over one million per hour from streaming.
*  That's fucking insane.
*  Shit. So they figured it out.
*  They figured out how to get deeper into the arteries, like real close to the heart.
*  But the the hustle is like trying to get there.
*  But they also they also have the keys to a lot of doors.
*  It's like a weird trade off.
*  They do. But I have a feeling if you just look at the landscape,
*  that that is less and less of an issue almost every year.
*  They don't know if they know.
*  As long as you don't create feuds, I don't think they necessarily have the keys to arenas.
*  I think if you go through major agencies, that's that's solved.
*  And I think distribution over the Internet, just through people
*  finding out about it and sharing it, tossing it around,
*  is probably as useful, if not better than anything.
*  Because I'll find out about it.
*  Podcasts find out about it.
*  People on Twitter find out about it.
*  They retweet shit. People Instagram repost stuff.
*  And then it hits millions and millions and millions and millions of people.
*  100 percent organic.
*  And it happens all the time, which is good.
*  I mean, it's almost like you're you're bank rolling
*  on it not being a good idea if you do it with somebody else.
*  It's like what you're doing is like bank rolling on yourself.
*  Yeah. Like I believe in myself.
*  Let's just put this out.
*  Whereas if you do with a label, you have to so many people have to be.
*  And there's nothing wrong with it.
*  I'm sure it's worked out great for both you and on numerous occasions.
*  But someone has to believe in you.
*  You have to you have to work with someone.
*  There's a lot involved.
*  And I'm sure like, well, first of all, there are some great companies.
*  I don't know what like, you know, what what label you work with.
*  But yeah, we're good. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  See, like some of them.
*  And obviously, because you're fucking amazing and you're crushing it.
*  And, you know, like some companies, that's not the case.
*  And, you know, people's jobs depend on your success.
*  And if they're scared and they go in in this in this way that it's not like
*  it doesn't hit.
*  Yes. Or something like they drop you fast. Yeah.
*  And, you know, I'll I'll speak. Oh, yeah.
*  Maybe not.
*  I guess that's twice.
*  Hold it together.
*  Well, you remember when Prince had to change his name to a fucking symbol?
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
*  Exactly. That is the perfect example.
*  That's the perfect example.
*  Yes. Imagine you are trying to keep.
*  Yeah, that's just business.
*  G.O.A.T.s of all time.
*  Yeah. Come on.
*  I mean, all time goats.
*  He's he was androgynous before anybody knew what the fuck it was.
*  He was dancing around with high heels.
*  No one could say shit because it was so good.
*  Think about all the homophobia.
*  We're talking about transphobia.
*  Homophobia. Think about all the shit.
*  And he must have endured in like 1988 or whatever the fuck it is
*  when he put out that first album.
*  And it didn't matter.
*  And everybody it was so good.
*  Everybody just had to step the fuck back.
*  Like Purple Rain.
*  It was the way he was dressed was ridiculous.
*  Imagine if Ryan Reynolds was in a movie about a singer who dressed like
*  a madman.
*  It was he he's so good he gave himself a handicap.
*  He said, I'm going to dress like a goddamn king.
*  And you're going to say shit because my fucking music is so good.
*  He would drive up in a motorcycle helmet.
*  Shut the fuck up, bitch.
*  I'm doing that where I want to.
*  Prince. Yeah.
*  He was on another planet.
*  Like, come on.
*  That goes on.
*  He was on another planet.
*  Rarely, rarely people like this exist.
*  You ever get to meet him, Gary?
*  No, I fucked up one time.
*  No, I came back from tour and I got an invite.
*  He's like, he wanted me to come out the next day.
*  And I was jet lagged and dealing with family stuff.
*  And I was like, I can't make it tomorrow. But.
*  Damn. So my bad.
*  But such a big fan.
*  I think he's yeah, I think.
*  I mean, I thought it was once I had a chance to see him at the hard rock in Vegas.
*  Yeah. Like when he was just starting to do music again and tour again.
*  Yeah. And it was really late.
*  It was like after midnight, I was tired.
*  I do some shit in the morning.
*  Yeah. It's like I want to work out.
*  Fuck this.
*  The fucking workout.
*  Such a meathead.
*  You guys. Dummy.
*  Gary, come on.
*  I think we should all work out tomorrow.
*  Actually, let's work out tonight.
*  Let's drink one more whiskey.
*  We'll hit the gym outside.
*  I've done that before.
*  Jamie, you win.
*  Ari, Bert and I got into a fucking bench press competition,
*  drunk as fuck after a podcast.
*  How'd that go?
*  It's crazy. Yeah.
*  I was worried I hurt something.
*  Did I hurt something in my leg?
*  I hurt like a pop of muscle in my leg or something.
*  Your meniscus?
*  No, that was like my hammy.
*  Somewhere in my lower hammy.
*  From.
*  Fucking so when you get drunk,
*  it's it's the bane of all existence, but it's the source of so much pleasure.
*  How dare you?
*  It is.
*  I'm having a great time.
*  It's the rocky seas.
*  That's what whiskey and all booze in general is the rocky seas.
*  It's like you have great moments.
*  But you also have times when you're going to puke off the side.
*  Oh, yeah. It's the rocky seas.
*  OK, when was the last time you guys went to Pukey Town from drinking too much?
*  From drinking, it's been a long time, but I puked from stomach virus just four days ago.
*  What? Yeah.
*  Oh, my God. In between shows at the improv.
*  Jesus. How about this?
*  My whole family had it.
*  One of my daughters, my wife had it first, then one of my daughters had it.
*  And then I'm like, I don't get that shit, bitch.
*  And you sure did.
*  Of course. Oh, my God.
*  And then I'm in the bathroom at the improv.
*  I do not feel good.
*  And I'm like, I think I might puke.
*  I had to go up in 15 minutes.
*  I'm like, why don't I just make myself puke?
*  And I'm like, all right, let's make myself puke.
*  So I shoved three fingers down my throat, like way down my throat.
*  And I didn't puke.
*  I'm like, God damn it.
*  And then and then all of a sudden, my body was like, oh, you want to party?
*  I lifted up the bowl just in time for the most violent stream, like cartoonish.
*  Just
*  I mean, fucking cartoonish, like down to the core of my lower lower spinal column.
*  Like, oh, wow.
*  Like I was worried I was going to pull muscles.
*  I'm crying a little bit.
*  I puked and I stepped up and I washed my hands and I went right back in.
*  I puked again.
*  So I got two off in between.
*  I did a show like that once.
*  And then I did a show and then I drove home and on the way home,
*  I was like, keep it together, bitch.
*  Keep it together.
*  It was on the way home.
*  It was touch and go.
*  What car were you driving?
*  The Tesla.
*  I was going nice and slow, though.
*  Tesla's nice.
*  It's a comfortable ride.
*  So very advanced ride.
*  So keep you away from those horrible bumps.
*  It might disturb you.
*  I barely got inside my house and just
*  I mean, violent, violent, like the most violent throw up I think I've ever had in my life.
*  It was spectacular.
*  Have you ever had a show like that?
*  Have you ever had a show like that?
*  Yeah, I've had a show.
*  I did two shows.
*  I did the second show that night that way, too.
*  But I made it to the second show with no problem.
*  That's the worst.
*  Me and my friend, we were in Austin playing it.
*  Antones.
*  Yeah, Antones.
*  And we just got back from the tour.
*  It was like a holiday show and everyone's there.
*  And we went got some pizza from this.
*  Oh, no.
*  So me and my tour manager at the time, we sit on the bus and we look at each other like.
*  At the same time, no words, no words.
*  We both like hopped up.
*  We're like, oh, just hit.
*  We're like side by side.
*  Five minutes.
*  Hey, guys, you guys ready to go?
*  Oh, you guys ready to go?
*  No, man, I'm not hurting.
*  So I get up, I get up on stage.
*  I know I'm just dragging breath and people in the front.
*  Oh, no.
*  Did you tell him?
*  No, no, I didn't.
*  But it was pretty obvious.
*  Yeah.
*  That I was.
*  Why am I that sweaty?
*  And I haven't hit a note yet.
*  Oh, my God.
*  But we also had a thing over in Europe.
*  A couple of friends of mine, these guys in my band had some oysters and.
*  Oh, no.
*  We had to fly the next.
*  You know, like in Europe when you travel and it's like my whole family got it off the oysters once.
*  Oh, my wife and my kids got it off.
*  Oysters occasionally like food poisoning is rough because did you know that when you get food
*  poisoning on a boat, they try to quarantine you?
*  No, I didn't know that either.
*  Yeah, food poisoning apparently can spread from person to person.
*  Never knew that until this year.
*  Weird.
*  No, I didn't know that either.
*  Someone someone got food poisoning on a boat and they couldn't leave the boat.
*  Find out if that's true.
*  I'm pretty sure it is.
*  I love it.
*  I'm pretty sure it is.
*  I'm pretty because we were trying to figure out because the oyster things tell how it spreads.
*  But then my wife was like, I think that shit is actually contagious.
*  If you're on a boat.
*  It's a bacteria, essentially, right?
*  Exactly.
*  But you could say the same about.
*  You can get it on your hands.
*  You can get it on other things.
*  Yeah.
*  You can touch those things.
*  Right. Right.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  It's terrifying.
*  And they they want to make people dirty bitches.
*  They don't want people coughing on their hands and touching things.
*  Then everybody gets food poisoning.
*  Like you literally can't happen that way.
*  My last Honey Honey show, that was the it was Puke City.
*  I don't know what it was.
*  I it started in the middle of the night before the show.
*  And, you know, it was it was a pretty big playing gig that for us that we couldn't turn down.
*  And they had a bucket for me backstage in case I needed to like ditch.
*  Does it affect your vocals?
*  Yeah, it affected everything.
*  It was well, first of all, I would imagine the fact that noise is I'll be honest.
*  You know what happened?
*  Ben graciously let the crowd know, hey, Susie's not feeling so well, everybody.
*  Like, just want you know, we're going to give you the best show we can.
*  But like, give her some love.
*  And I could feel it.
*  I could feel their support.
*  And I whether it was adrenaline or what.
*  And I basically played in my pajamas.
*  Like I didn't do anything to my face.
*  I didn't wear it. I was wearing like I just went out there.
*  I was like, like I was dead.
*  I was lying on the couch and they're like, we got to go.
*  And I'm like, OK.
*  And it was a really intense show.
*  But also in like a kind of beautiful way.
*  Like it was our last like scheduled show together.
*  And. You know, Ben and I were like crying and stuff and like we had this whole thing,
*  but the crowd really held me up.
*  They really did.
*  I didn't puke during the show, ironically, but I was sick for like days after that.
*  And then I flew to Dublin the next day to to join the hosier band.
*  So it was like a weird mindfuck.
*  I don't I don't know.
*  A part of me wonders if it was some like weird, like mental thing,
*  because no one else got sick.
*  But I mean, I was really sick.
*  I doubt it was a mental thing.
*  I like to doubt that.
*  I bet it was a mental thing, though, that that crowd raised you.
*  Yeah, you know, there's a real thing to that, right?
*  You know, they talk about like one of the worst things that happens to people
*  in terms of like illness and disease is loneliness.
*  One of the worst things like there's something about people that are lonely and sad.
*  It's it's one of the worst things in terms of like indicators of overall health.
*  Right. Like you just you just don't have a reason to go.
*  You feel bad. People get real sick.
*  It's real. It's real bad for your immune system.
*  Yeah. But on the other hand, when people love you and you go out there
*  and they know you're sick and they love you and they send you there's a it sounds hippie and woo woo.
*  But there's a feeling that you get.
*  That's not hippie at all. I believe in that.
*  It's it's a similar feeling to that feeling you get when Kickstarter.
*  My heart comes on the fucking machine.
*  Keep coming back.
*  It's not hard to never stop.
*  Baby. Oh, my God.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  Oh, my God. It's real.
*  It's the truth. Honestly, it's real fuel.
*  100 percent concur with you.
*  Hunter Thompson had a great quote about music being fuel.
*  Yeah. He looked at it like fuel.
*  What is that fucking quote?
*  Oh, my God. Music saved my life.
*  Like me, too. Like my sadness, my joy, all of it.
*  My inspiration changes how you feel.
*  Yeah. You hear a great song and it changes.
*  It's a fucking drug. It's just like a drug.
*  It changes how you feel.
*  Music has always been a matter of energy to me, a question of fuel.
*  Sentimental people call it inspiration.
*  But what they really mean is fuel.
*  I have always needed fuel.
*  I am a serious consumer.
*  On some nights, I still believe that a car with gas needle on empty
*  can run about 50 more miles if you have the right music.
*  Very loud. That's cool.
*  Agreed. Forgot the perfect fucked up.
*  But, you know, music as a writer and as a listener has saved my life.
*  Well, it's made people do more work.
*  You like music changes like the way.
*  First of all, how many people at their job,
*  they have some bullshit as fucking job, but music gets them through
*  like warehouse workers, people that are doing shit,
*  but they can hear music in the background.
*  Music gets them through the oh, shit, not this one.
*  And they yell it out to their friends and everybody's having a good time
*  while they're working.
*  I mean, that's just a fact. Right.
*  It's every bullshit job.
*  If you can listen to music at a bullshit job, empowering.
*  It's what it's it makes that job way better.
*  Yeah. Construction gig.
*  They suck when the fucking foreman comes over and says no music, guys.
*  Yeah. Like what? No music.
*  What is what is television or movies without music?
*  Oh, you know, dog shit.
*  Like there's a whole bunch of dead space, but you also have that sort of like,
*  you know, music score to your life.
*  Yes. You know, you have those moments in your life
*  where you're going through a breakup or you're going through whatever
*  or you're empowered and you, you know, throw on some run the jewels.
*  That's my. Yes.
*  Shout out to Killer Mike. Yeah.
*  Have you had Killer Mike on? Yes, I have. Yeah.
*  I was just texting him the other day. Get out of here.
*  Yeah. He's the crazy fucking speech at the Bernie Sanders rally.
*  Get out of here.
*  Like one of them goose bumpy speeches like, who?
*  He when I listen to run the jewels, I get goosebumps.
*  I get like a physical reaction to their music.
*  It's so powerful.
*  And Killer Mike, if that wants to run for president.
*  Killer Mike runs for president.
*  Everybody better be real hopeful, real hopeful.
*  He just enjoys his rap career.
*  He'll be real hopeful.
*  He keeps doing what he's doing because if that guy runs for president, he's going to.
*  Whoo. Oh, my God.
*  It's a powerful human being. Yes.
*  He's a powerful orator.
*  Like like a fucking new age preacher when he was doing it that Bernie said,
*  I texted him like, dude, that's some serious shit.
*  You know, like he was he was spitting flames.
*  Just whoa. Yeah.
*  Who is a brilliant man.
*  There's something about people that can do that, right?
*  They can have those fucking giant speeches.
*  And that's one of the reasons why Trump is successful is his ability to stay in
*  in front of large groups of people and get big reactions.
*  But he says dumb shit. He does.
*  But it's all in who's your audience.
*  You know, it's all in like who's there and what else have they heard that night?
*  Right. That might be the most fun shit they've heard that night.
*  If it's like if you're a bad comic, you know, a lot of bad comics do.
*  They have terrible comedians open for them.
*  So they have like just like the audience is just in a coma by the time they get up.
*  In a sense, that's what Trump is.
*  Trump's a comic who said nothing but shitty comics on before.
*  So all the politicians before him, even the most interesting ones,
*  are really boring to listen, talk to for long periods of time.
*  But Trump goes up there and makes fun of Mike Bloomberg's hype
*  by ducking under the fucking table.
*  And he and he calls Hillary crazy,
*  her lying Hillary and sleepy Joe Biden.
*  He makes jokes about them.
*  I'm not saying I'm not justifying what he does, but the reason why he can even do
*  what he does is because everybody besides him when it comes to communicating
*  is so goddamn boring.
*  The way they get their message is so fucking boring.
*  Yeah, Jesus.
*  I get it. You want to help.
*  You're fucking killing me.
*  You're so annoying with the thumb thing.
*  You're full of shit.
*  If you were talking like that in my house, I'd be like, who the fuck are you, man?
*  Who are you? Why are you lying about your past?
*  Why are you pretending about this?
*  You're you're lying.
*  Well, it's a weird sleight of hand.
*  You know, yeah, the thumb thing.
*  They're wearing a mask. Killer Mike.
*  There's no mask. No.
*  He's guns blazing. Oh, yeah.
*  That kind of person is the future of power.
*  Oh, man. That's what's going to happen.
*  But back to the Trump.
*  Trump did, though.
*  It's a sleight of hand.
*  It's like it's like a magic trick.
*  But so is everyone else. That's the problem.
*  The problem with saying that is so is Ted Cruz.
*  Everyone saw the videos of Ted Cruz with his family, like,
*  you know, pretending to have like a real moment with his family.
*  On the beach. Is that the one?
*  This is fucked up. It's in the living room.
*  Like, Mom, you got to be more sincere.
*  Like, it's like weird, weird, like sculpted, fake, scripted reality.
*  Trump is the antidote to that.
*  That's the problem. They're all crazy, too.
*  That might be a worse kind of crazy.
*  It's a broken system.
*  It's it's who wants to do it?
*  That's the problem, Joe.
*  No, no, no, no, no. I think it's time.
*  No, no, no, no. For you to run.
*  I'm not interested in anything.
*  I'm not. I'm interested in doing less than I'm doing.
*  All right. You are leading us all, sir.
*  Leaning shit.
*  No chance. All I've seen is like this is nonsense.
*  These people that do this, they're nonsense people.
*  They're doing it. They're tricking.
*  It's like someone someone made a good description of it.
*  I think it was Kyle Kalinsky. That's exactly it was.
*  He was saying it's exactly like there was a bunch of crappy comedians
*  that were imitating the cadence of David Tell David Tell.
*  We'll talk like that. Yeah. Right.
*  It was always funny.
*  He always had these brilliant punchlines, and he inspired a whole gigantic
*  slew of people that have imitated this David Tell cadence.
*  Most of it is harmless.
*  And they're just fans.
*  And they wanted to be like him.
*  They might not even realize they're doing it.
*  And they eventually will find their own voice.
*  And that happens, I'm sure, with musicians.
*  It happens probably with everybody and art in everything. Right.
*  But the problem is it's like.
*  Just just doing something like that is I can't listen.
*  You can't run the world if you're doing a character, if you're doing this,
*  because you're trying to make it as a comic and you pretend you're David Tell.
*  Fine. But if you want to run the fucking free world and you're doing the Obama
*  thing and you're talking like this and you talk in the exact cadence
*  exactly the way Barack Obama used to talk like, fuck
*  you, man, that's not you. Who are you, bitch?
*  Who are you? At least we know who Trump is.
*  He might be crazy. It might be madness.
*  It might be. It might be. You're right.
*  Guess what? They all are. The whole thing's crazy.
*  Yeah. Everybody wants to be president.
*  Almost everyone. Yeah. Except a couple of them.
*  You know what I like?
*  What? Madness.
*  Well, the fuck wants to run this thing? Crazy people.
*  I think it'd be cool if.
*  Dude, man, let me die.
*  Bro, I think it'd be cool.
*  No, honestly, though, if the Democrats like teamed up with who each other aliens.
*  Oh, I think they are doing that right now.
*  But in the light, Sanders, you're, you know, head of national security,
*  your president, your vice president, you know, like in this way that I think
*  they all have strengths.
*  It's tough to feel like one of them has it all.
*  And essentially, that's the case with most people.
*  But if they I don't know.
*  I know the Democrats.
*  I hate talking about politics because people give me so much shit about it.
*  And it will fuck them. I don't care.
*  I think that like it's a really scary time.
*  And Trump is terrifying.
*  Everybody's terrifying.
*  Yeah. But his his blatant.
*  I'm going to pee. I have to.
*  I'm holding it together. That's why I'm so anxious right now.
*  Gary Clark wins this one.
*  You know, you should go pee.
*  You didn't leave him pee yet, right?
*  No, I didn't. OK, why don't we?
*  Let's play a song.
*  And then we don't have to play any more songs.
*  Yeah, but let me come back. You guys talk amongst each other.
*  I'm good. I'm quick.
*  I'm going to 20 seconds to pee, too.
*  No. Wow. Impressive.
*  I feel like I have to pee again.
*  And I've already seen once he's running in a sports shirt.
*  You see the calves on that man like, wow.
*  Yeah, they make me feel bad about myself.
*  I should have been sitting around eating.
*  Come on now.
*  Have I told you how much my mom talks about how good looking you are?
*  Oh, really? Yeah.
*  She said it literally today.
*  I love her.
*  And I said, Mom, Gary's married to a beautiful supermodel.
*  And he's about they want now you've had your third baby.
*  Yes. Yeah.
*  Well, your mom's sweet.
*  She is. She's great.
*  I wish more people thought like her.
*  Get out of here.
*  Make me feel better in the morning.
*  Wake up and just look at this face.
*  Get out of here, Gary.
*  I'm just kidding. I love my life.
*  It's all good. Thank God.
*  Yeah, it's a good life.
*  Hey, cheers. That's very sweet.
*  Thanks for being here. My pleasure.
*  Wow. How about it?
*  We're running the Joe Rogan podcast without Joe Rogan.
*  I don't know.
*  Jamie, not many people have gotten to do that.
*  Oh, my God.
*  OK, what should we talk about? Joe. Yeah.
*  What a legend. Absolutely.
*  Absolutely.
*  With his space suit and his, you know, his antlers.
*  And is there taxidermy in this room?
*  I mean, yeah, antlers. Yeah, not.
*  Yeah. Copy that.
*  Um, no, it's a special place.
*  I feel like we're in a bomb shelter of party town.
*  You know, like we're safe here and we're going to have a good time
*  and we could stay here for a while.
*  Yeah, I wouldn't be mad if this is where I had to.
*  Me, too. You know what I mean? Yeah.
*  So how can we model our lives like it's like WWD?
*  What would Joe do?
*  OK, let's take notes.
*  OK, start writing this shit down.
*  OK, one sauna.
*  Sensor deprivation tank to what? Really?
*  Yeah, son of a bitch.
*  No, but, you know, Joe, ironically, sent Ben Jaffe
*  and I from Honey Honey to a sensory deprivation tank in Venice Beach.
*  And it was going well until I got to that point where I like
*  panicked a little bit. Oh, Joe, we're doing so good without you.
*  I was I literally wrote down sauna.
*  So thankfully, I was just telling the story of when you sent Ben
*  and I to the sensory deprivation tank, the float tank in Venice and.
*  With crash crash, my man.
*  Yeah. And I kind of went in and crash was basically like, look,
*  I'm going to lock the doors and you guys are like in here,
*  you know, do your thing.
*  And so I was in the tank and I got to this point
*  where I like started to panic.
*  And I thought I was just trying to sort of go somewhere.
*  And then I was like, what if what if crash didn't leave open the air vent?
*  And I'm going to suffocate.
*  And I started to like go for the door and then I got it in my eye.
*  And I was like, ah, because it's salt water.
*  Were you high? No, really?
*  I wasn't high. Maybe. I'm not sure.
*  But I had I like I really I really hit a wall.
*  And I was, you know, and you're like naked and suspicious.
*  And I ended up like going I had to like jump out and go to the shower.
*  And I was like, ah, getting my eyes rinsed out.
*  And I kind of sat there in a towel like.
*  You know, that's so ridiculous.
*  I failed my first float.
*  You never get these vents there.
*  There's air, plenty of air to have it set up.
*  But I will say, I went to a cryotherapy in Austin
*  one of the last times I was there and I loved it.
*  It's great, right? You feel awesome.
*  I got I didn't last the three minutes.
*  I did like 230 before I started to panic.
*  I think they're supposed to make you do to the first time.
*  I did 230. That's your rebel.
*  Suck my dick.
*  That might be the funniest thing I've ever heard.
*  That's going to come back to haunt me.
*  Um, well, I.
*  I had a.
*  Sorry, I'm sorry.
*  Who was the first woman to say suck my dick? Was it?
*  Was it? I would know Fonda.
*  Oh, really? Fonda.
*  I was going to say, I hope I would hope it's like Sarah Silverman.
*  Oh, G.I.
*  More to me more and G.I. Jane, right?
*  Remember, she was the Navy SEAL.
*  She's like, suck my dick.
*  And then wow.
*  I love it.
*  I think it's incredible.
*  It's like, whoa.
*  That was the best a woman has ever said, suck my dick.
*  Now you're the queen.
*  Wow. Joe, I cannot.
*  That's bad. That is a great honor, sir.
*  You know, that's because I believe I believe in you.
*  She's well, I just reading lines in the movie.
*  I hate to say this back back in the honey, honey days.
*  And I, you know, I did have a nickname and it was Suck My Dick Seuss.
*  I would say it a little too often.
*  It's like a reflex.
*  But it's a cool thing that a girl can say, she doesn't have a dick.
*  And everybody thinks it's hilarious.
*  Like no one gets offended.
*  If a girl's like, I don't want to offend anybody.
*  If you're offended, if you're a guy like that, it's outrageous.
*  Like you're off the team to hear you.
*  Yeah. What guy would be offended by a woman like you saying suck my dick?
*  We would think.
*  And this is where I get the me too from you guys.
*  From us? Impossible.
*  But that would be like a good indicator of like, like douchebaggishness.
*  Sure. Someone was upset of you saying suck my dick.
*  Like, who are you? Like, what's going on?
*  Yeah. Well, that's the climate we're in, which is kind of scary.
*  I don't think that way, though.
*  It's not that way because that would require men to be upset at a woman
*  for saying something like suck my dick.
*  That hasn't gotten that crazy yet.
*  I hope not. The only way it could ever is retaliatory.
*  I don't think so either.
*  But there's a lot of bitches amongst us.
*  There's a lot of bitches amongst us.
*  It could go bad. We could hit the rocks and then bounce back.
*  You know what we need?
*  But we need to conquer those inner bitches.
*  There's a lot of people that are just not capable of getting up.
*  They can't. Yeah.
*  There's going to be no movement. Agreed.
*  Boom. They're going to hit that wall.
*  There's some some guys.
*  Look, there's for sure a lot of men who would try to claim that way
*  in that direction.
*  Well, let's hope that's not the case with this podcast.
*  All of a sudden, all of a sudden, suck my dick.
*  You fucking bitch.
*  Mad at you. Appropriating a penis is a fucking horrendous injustice.
*  You appropriated a penis.
*  I'm pretty sure I said that at one of my last poker games.
*  I'm pretty sure I said that at one of the last poker games I played
*  and nobody laughed. So I was like, oh, well, you're fucking playing poker
*  with a bunch of serious normies.
*  No, a bunch of normies that can't handle it.
*  It's OK. How about how much money did you take from?
*  Oh, it wasn't, you know, it was a hustler.
*  She's a hustler.
*  I don't want to. Yeah, I mean, she's trying not to fuck up her game right now.
*  I see what's going on.
*  All right. Moving on. No, no. Yeah, yeah.
*  I did OK. I did OK.
*  I've always wanted to be good at chess.
*  That would be a thing that would be like cool to tell people like,
*  I'm really good at chess. Really? Yeah.
*  Yeah, I guess so.
*  Good thing. I guess so.
*  But also, Joe, like you're really good at a lot of other things.
*  So chess is one of them ones that's like universally respected.
*  Right. You meet a dude who can play some chess like, oh, OK.
*  Gary, how's your chess game?
*  Terrible. Not existing.
*  What is up?
*  Now checkers, on the other hand, they'll fuck you up.
*  Take your soul and checkers.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  You know, flip it up on the side, beat you all day and four squares.
*  But oh, my God, there's only so many games and there's only so many.
*  I love games. Hours in a day.
*  That's the problem.
*  I recently this is so silly.
*  My dear landlord slash friend
*  invited me downstairs to play this game that was created by the
*  Rich Dad Poor Dad author. Oh.
*  And I can't are created by the author of that book.
*  Yeah. And it's I can't remember.
*  I don't know what it's called, but it it was called Suck My Dude.
*  He's called Suck My Dude, bitch.
*  And it's it's about it's a financial game.
*  It's like an adult monopoly.
*  OK, adult monopoly was an adult.
*  You get out of the rat race.
*  I'm always scared when I play monopoly.
*  You get out of the rat race and then you go to the like big dogs.
*  And it's very enlightening because you're kind of like buying property
*  and then you're like making deals.
*  And there's something about it that I did.
*  You read Rich Dad Poor Dad? No.
*  It's interesting.
*  It's it's an interesting way to approach your relationship with money.
*  If you've ever struggled with it or weren't sort of given a crash course
*  on how to handle it or not handle it.
*  What did you get out of it?
*  I got that like
*  the power that money can have over you is something to reconcile with,
*  you know, in a way that you can live a healthier life and,
*  you know, not obviously in a consumerist society.
*  Like you kind of have this constant like I need I need
*  and you know all that stuff.
*  But Rich Dad Poor Dad, I first of all, I read half the book.
*  I didn't read the whole book.
*  So I can't really like speak on the entirety of it.
*  But it gave me a different level of confidence that
*  money was taking from me, you know, like the work as an artist.
*  Like I chose the life to be a musician.
*  I could have lived in Cleveland and sold spaghetti and had a comfortable life.
*  But I didn't do that.
*  And because my family has a great they have a great restaurant.
*  If that ship is sailed, because it's like out of my immediate family's hands.
*  But at the time, I've had many, many moments in my life where I was like,
*  should I move home and just like ditch this music thing?
*  Because that would be so much easier.
*  And money's been like this, you know, you kind of have I've I've had
*  a roller coaster and it can like rule my sleep and rule my happiness and my anxiety.
*  But when I read Rich Dad Poor Dad,
*  and then in conjunction with this board game I played with Russell,
*  it really it's so funny.
*  It seems you know what?
*  It seems like part of the whole illusion of reality.
*  And obviously you need money to survive.
*  But the the stock that we put into it is pretty incredible.
*  You know, and then and like the things that we think that we need in order to to like
*  satisfy us. Yes, yes.
*  And and I feel like there's this weird mind game.
*  I'm always playing with it.
*  You know, like in terms of.
*  Like getting.
*  To the next level in my music career, like it's going to take this much.
*  How are you going to get it? You know, all that stuff.
*  But at the end of the day, I think when you sort of like
*  release your white knuckles on on the thing, it all works itself out.
*  I know that sounds pretty, you know, broad, but.
*  I think a money is something that's entangled into life.
*  Yeah, there's there's great aspects to what you can do with your money.
*  But it's entangled into your life in a weird way.
*  There's like. There's what you currently can do, right?
*  Based on your circumstances, based on your life, your health, your responsibilities.
*  There's what you can do and there's what what's like
*  what's humanly possible for you to do.
*  And when you see people that are making a lot of money
*  and you see that money, the money starts to get you thinking that that's what you should do.
*  You should do that money thing, whatever that money is.
*  No, no, no. I used to make less money.
*  Now I make more money and that makes more money than even I make.
*  I got to do what that is to get more money.
*  But then you do that, you realize, oh, but this isn't fun.
*  Now most of my day is spent doing something that's not enjoyable.
*  That's not what I want to do.
*  So then it's what you want to do, what you can do, what's possible
*  and what you want to do.
*  And they don't always go together.
*  Sometimes what you can do is like you have too much responsibilities
*  and you're you're always going to feel short sighted by life because it's random
*  and it's crazy and it's chaos.
*  But the money thing can trick you.
*  Like if you have you have a certain amount of money in the bank.
*  Like Brian Cowen said it best to me, he's like, once you go to a restaurant
*  and you don't worry about what food costs, he goes, everything else is bullshit.
*  I was like, do you're right?
*  Yeah, because that's that's when you're free, right?
*  When you know your rent is paid, you know, your gas is paid,
*  your car payment's paid, you're not worried about it at all.
*  You can just go eat. Let's go eat.
*  You don't care. You leave a nice fat tip.
*  Thank you. Good night. Bye.
*  That's when that's when you're rich.
*  Everything other than that is like, what are you doing?
*  Like you just trying to score points because that's what we're doing.
*  Try to get the high score.
*  Everybody wants to get the high score.
*  Like that high score, like you're in there fucking playing centipede all day.
*  Like you can't even.
*  I never thought about it.
*  It's a little arcade game.
*  Maybe you come down like this.
*  You shoot out of it.
*  It's a pong era.
*  Like just just pass pong.
*  Super old school dork shit.
*  That's funny. But that's what it's like.
*  Yeah, it's like, you know.
*  Yeah, the minute you stop obsessing about it, it stops becoming a problem.
*  Yeah, in some ways, I mean, it depends on your situation, but yeah, for me,
*  it feels like this weird, like spiritual grapple.
*  I'm just like it like once I chill out, all the things start.
*  Yes, always, because you're more relaxed.
*  If you're more relaxed, you're better.
*  If you're better, you attract people that want to do stuff with you.
*  Desperate people. Yeah.
*  Anxious people are the worst is angry people.
*  People that are angry that they've been fucked over by the system somehow.
*  And I'm not angry. I will say that.
*  And I feel really grateful for that.
*  Like with how hard I work in like trying to get the things that I really want.
*  I don't feel jaded or or, you know, cynical about it.
*  I feel really excited.
*  It's going to be really tired at the same time.
*  Become gigantic. It's going to be really romantic.
*  That'd be nice times you're going to look back on me and Brad Pitt.
*  Just fucking banging it out with Brad Pitt, doing the best music
*  you can do is hoping for the future to be bright.
*  Yeah, there's something about these days, though, like, yeah,
*  I almost have to appreciate them because when they're gone, they are gone forever.
*  Yeah, they're gone. They're gone forever.
*  I yeah, I.
*  I think about that sometimes, you know, because I do believe like I know
*  that I won't feel like I do now with the like the struggle, you know, whatever.
*  But I also think like, you know, maybe this is
*  I did not read The Secret or Watch The Secret.
*  However, I've had two guys I broke up with give me The Secret as a book.
*  Oh, Jesus Christ.
*  Dating fruitcake.
*  I guess. Don't I fucking know it?
*  And I need a lumberjack from Montana.
*  Yeah, some dude is an arborist.
*  Please climb in trees.
*  But like you have to be funny and kind and.
*  Yeah, there's plenty of those.
*  Got to go to Bozeman.
*  I love Bozeman. That's what I'm talking about.
*  One of my favorite poker tables is in Bozeman.
*  Oh, my God. She is a hustler.
*  Gary, stay the fuck away from her.
*  Do not have a lot of pocket money.
*  When I go to visit this lady, there's this bar there that has like a six
*  seat table and I probably go in once a year and I love it.
*  And I don't know if the same deal of the dealer's name is Spencer.
*  And I'll walk in at the last few years.
*  I love it. Makes me feel so cool.
*  He goes, honey, honey.
*  And you can play off of 40 bucks for six hours and have a blast.
*  It's fun. It's just fun.
*  It's a hustler. I don't know.
*  Games. Oh, just yuck.
*  Have a good time. Oh, shucks.
*  I don't know. I just like to I like to play cards.
*  I like to have fun. Fun.
*  Games are fun for people. They are fun.
*  You know, have you ever done Neil's VR quest things where you put on a VR helmet
*  and go to a fucking warehouse and once.
*  Yeah. Fight gargoyles and shit.
*  No, I was dancing.
*  I was in a VR dance like with this robot with John Spiker.
*  John Spiker had a VR helmet.
*  And I was with him and his wife in Lake Arrowhead.
*  And we were drunk and having fun.
*  And then I was dancing with a robot.
*  And then I got dizzy.
*  I got pretty dizzy.
*  I mean, you're not really sure the ground is real.
*  It's weird. It's weird.
*  Well, the thought of it is disconcerting because you're like,
*  it's so the sound, the visual, the actual like depth of space.
*  You know, you're like in a real setting.
*  And then you come out and you're like, this isn't as fun as that.
*  And that's fucking weird.
*  Like, that's scary. That's where we're at.
*  Oh, yeah. That's where the future is.
*  Because right now it's still pretty crude.
*  You still definitely tell it's not real life.
*  But how long is that going to last?
*  They're they're they're so.
*  Duncan, speaking of Duncan, had the very first HTC Vive,
*  which is one of the very first consumer virtual reality headsets
*  you could buy. And he was like an early adopter.
*  So when Duncan when they were first going through it,
*  you'd put his helmet on.
*  It was attached to a PC via all these cables.
*  And you couldn't move very far.
*  You had a very small area you can move in.
*  But and everything was really, really, really pixelated.
*  Like in no way did it look real.
*  It looked more like like some sort of an old school video game.
*  Right. OK.
*  But then I came back and I just podcast again two years later.
*  And I tried the new one and the new one was way better.
*  I was like, whoa.
*  And the new one I was at the bottom of the ocean.
*  A whale swam by and I looked right in the whale's eyeballs.
*  I was like, holy fuck, dude.
*  And he's like, bro, you should see the poor.
*  That's what Duncan sounds like.
*  I was like, no, they don't.
*  He goes, yes, they do.
*  Yeah. And there was a few quite a few things you could do.
*  There's one archery game. It was amazing.
*  It was like almost like South Park style characters
*  were bouncing towards you and they would kill you.
*  And then you would shoot at them like Roman times, like barbarians
*  were attacking your castle.
*  And you'd be on this castle with a bow and arrow.
*  And you'd be shooting at these like South Park looking shapes.
*  But it was fucking crazy. Did you kill Kenny?
*  I killed all the Kenny's.
*  But the problem is, you're so tired because your arms
*  are just doing this for minutes and minutes.
*  You're exhausting. My shoulders are tired.
*  Yeah. Everything was tired.
*  Yeah. It's you don't they have VR workouts like you do?
*  Oh, yeah, for sure.
*  So you're like, you know, training with Olympians.
*  Some great boxing games that make you super nervous.
*  You feel like you're boxing someone.
*  You got head gear on and this big Russian dude with a fucking cross
*  on his chest is coming towards you and it's not their cartoon looking.
*  They look like like Mike Tyson, punch out type characters.
*  They're cartoon looking.
*  Can you feel? No, no, but you see white when they hit you.
*  Oh, that's weird. That's disorienting.
*  Yeah, it's well, it's like it would feel like if you, you know,
*  eventually you feel like the more that is now.
*  As I say, I was reading about one just yesterday.
*  It's opened up. I think it's called Dreamscape and they have like
*  yeah, animal thing.
*  And like you have sensors on your hand and like the kids are saying,
*  like, it felt like I was touching the animals.
*  Yeah, dude, that's I did that.
*  That's Dreamscape. They have it in Century City.
*  But that's but the but the difference between that is it's not like a fight
*  with a thing like the boxing one.
*  It's it's a real workout. Yeah.
*  The dreamscape one's just fun.
*  Like they have one that's an alien zoo and there's like a thing.
*  This this this alien comes towards you and you put your hand on its head.
*  They have like a little, you know, that we got work in there.
*  And he's got a little foam rubber thing and he puts right where the head should be.
*  And you touch it.
*  But you really feel like it might be touching this alien's fucking head.
*  I mean, I will say, I feel like like there was like a little piece
*  of my humanity that was lost when I was in a VR situation
*  where I came back and I'm like, like I lost time or something. Yeah.
*  Well, you said his best is that it's more fun sometimes than regular life.
*  And it's crude. Yeah. When it's complicated. Yeah.
*  This is the argument for simulation theory.
*  The argument for simulation theory is we know it's coming one day.
*  If things keep if you go back to like the you don't think it's already here.
*  It might be. I don't know.
*  I don't know. But if you go back to like the Model T
*  and then look at like a modern brand new BMW,
*  like the amount of technology involved in this shift is so radical and so so crazy
*  and not that long, like 100 years or so.
*  Imagine what it's going to be like 100 years from now,
*  because things are just speeding up.
*  We're still going to be alive, apparently.
*  Probably, according to this dude, Aubrey DeGray.
*  So the stuff that we're seeing now in terms of virtual reality,
*  this is just the tip of the iceberg.
*  Yeah. Yeah, it's weird.
*  Some freaky shit.
*  You're going to be able to stay home and do concerts, though.
*  That's the goal. We could already do that, though.
*  That shit's already available.
*  Yeah. But I mean, have it be fully immersive, like someone's on stage with you.
*  Oh, so much. That Jameson event.
*  You can imagine you can never replace a live show.
*  I don't know if you're right. I do.
*  I don't know if you're right. I think you're right.
*  I think you're right. But I don't know if you're right.
*  And I don't think I think we're limited to what we're where we understand
*  people are capable of right now. I don't.
*  I think until our actual like resources collapse and you can't go outside
*  and you have to live in a bubble, nothing can replace a live music show
*  or a live comedy show.
*  Like when you're right there.
*  I think you're right for now until the VR gives you the like breath,
*  the wind on your face and the fucking heat from the pyrotechnics or whatever.
*  By the way, I was at the Grammys when you played and the pyrotechnics were.
*  I was like, there was fire.
*  Suzanne, I don't think they're very I don't think they're very far away
*  from being able to transmit a more immersive experience than being there.
*  And call me a purist.
*  That fucking sucks.
*  It does. That sucks.
*  You're going to get a bunch of people that are just here's a question.
*  I can't. No, you first.
*  No, go ahead.
*  The question is, don't forget your thought.
*  That's not the question.
*  That was that was a request.
*  The question is, I can't is I can't believe that you could replace.
*  Check me out here.
*  Yeah, thanks, friend.
*  The energy that you get from a live performance with virtual reality.
*  I can't believe or subscribe to that thought
*  that it is going to be manufactured digitally.
*  OK. Right.
*  I see what you're saying.
*  Like you can get all the effects of the sensory stuff with the sound
*  and the visual and maybe even have machinery that gives you physical
*  like air or heat or cold or whatever would, you know, simulate that thing.
*  But I can't at the core of my being thinks
*  think that you could you could substitute
*  the energy that you feel when you connect with a group, a room full of people.
*  Cheers. Love you guys. This is so much fun.
*  Salute. Do you know what I'm saying?
*  I do. I completely agree with you, but I don't. OK.
*  I saw Tupac live at Coachella.
*  Me too. That was the year he was so jacked.
*  It's like Tupac's been doing crossfit, right?
*  Tupac was super jacked.
*  But was that the same thing?
*  No, but no, it's not the same thing, but
*  I'm kind of in the middle like, yeah, I feel like you got to.
*  This is what I think. I really think this like right now.
*  You're right. Right now you can't be at a show where you're on stage
*  live and get that same exact experience if you were at home
*  on a computer or with a VR goggle.
*  I feel like right now, yes.
*  But in the future, oh, they might be able to get to the point where
*  it's better to do it through VR because I'm standing right next to you
*  while you're singing on stage.
*  Last thought, the intimacy of the crowd experience
*  where you can look to your neighbors and be like, fuck yes.
*  You're so right. But you know what? You can't simulate that.
*  One way you can't simulate that.
*  In cells that finally find an online community.
*  And when they meet in virtual reality, they meet in virtual reality.
*  Not only is it more satisfying than real life has ever been for them,
*  it's the only way.
*  Nothing's better than real intimacy.
*  They don't have that. It's not happening.
*  But this might be the only way where they can recreate some sense of community
*  through digital entanglement, like through these VR goggles.
*  They're all together in a room together.
*  Real sexual entanglement.
*  You're so right. But for some people that's not possible.
*  Unless you feel like fucking Gary Coleman.
*  I'm angry.
*  Right? Like some people are not going to catch, they're not going to catch the right break.
*  They don't have a good hand of cards.
*  Gary, Gary, help me.
*  I can't. I can't.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  We'd love it. Everybody to get fucking four aces.
*  Is this where we're headed, folks? Is this it?
*  I don't think this is the worst thing that could ever happen to us.
*  I think this is just a problem and a puzzle.
*  I think the way we handle these problems and puzzles is what's going to define our future.
*  That's what I think.
*  And I think there's a lot of old school people with old school ideas
*  trying to keep things running the same way they were when there's no internet and no accountability.
*  I think there's a healthy level of evolving and integrating and also not going full throttle robot.
*  There's all these things, but there's so many things happening at the same time that can affect your life forever.
*  You can't pay attention to all of them.
*  And that includes industrial waste and chemicals and fucking life and sucking all the tuna out of the ocean.
*  So where's the bunker?
*  Where's the party bunker?
*  There's a lot of questions, right?
*  The kind of play out.
*  Do we fucking figure this thing out before the canoe gets to the waterfall?
*  Well, in all transparency, though, like when it comes down to it, like the end, I'm not afraid to die.
*  Whoa, this bitch is crazy.
*  I'm not. I'm really not.
*  Like, I mean, I don't want to suffer and like burn in like nuclear waste and be like in that aftermath.
*  I really don't want that.
*  But, you know, when it's like if it's lights out, I'm pretty spiritual.
*  So I'm sort of curious of like what's next.
*  Yeah. And then if there's nothing then like what the fuck do I care?
*  Yeah, it is really right.
*  Like this is what I've always said.
*  Everyone wants to go to sleep, but everyone's scared to die.
*  Mm hmm.
*  Right. Everyone's looking forward to sleep.
*  Like, oh, I can't wait to shut off and hope I come back.
*  I want to just be vulnerable for eight hours. Sounds good.
*  See you.
*  God. But first of all, as someone who's been deprived of sleep, I love it.
*  Well, you're giving it to the robot overlords to remap your brain.
*  I actually don't know who's speaking to you right now.
*  Somebody else.
*  Some pilot in the back of your brain.
*  Tell him you've never been happier, Suzanne.
*  Gary Clark Jr.
*  Suzanne, shut the pod bay door.
*  It's a matter of time before we integrate with whatever the fuck is the future.
*  It's a matter of time.
*  We're hanging out. We're heirloom people.
*  We're like the last group of people.
*  I mean, I'm the oldest of all of us.
*  I'm 52, which means when I was a kid, no one even thought of the best shape of all of us, though.
*  Like, you're like, I'm going right into my house and be like, baby, I get my shit together.
*  Oh, my God, I want to see that look on your face when you say those words.
*  Oh, yeah. Like you did the same time last year.
*  I'll be taking care of these children.
*  That's hilarious.
*  That's hilarious.
*  It's man.
*  What is that? What's that quote?
*  Is a quote.
*  Inspiration is like bathing.
*  It's effective, but it must be done daily.
*  I can hang with that.
*  Yeah.
*  I brutally and really unpoetically paraphrase that.
*  Do you know how I like back to like having the blues, having like depression and stuff?
*  Is that Bertrand Russell?
*  First thing that popped up is Zig Ziglar said it also changed a little bit.
*  I've seen 10 variations of inspiration, like a shower you need a daily.
*  I've seen a lot of inspiration.
*  I've seen a lot of inspiration.
*  He's the best.
*  He's the best.
*  He's the goat.
*  I know.
*  I love that guy.
*  But back to like, you know, per inspiring yourself, man, whenever I've been like really in it,
*  in my like head and down, if I just read a book.
*  Just something that takes your brain away from what you're concentrating on.
*  Like you develop a new story or inspiration or like even just like jargon, you're getting
*  new words.
*  There's something about it that's really empowering.
*  You know, I watched a movie again, real recently that I haven't seen in quite a long time.
*  It's called Jurassic Park.
*  I've seen that like eight times.
*  It's called Happy People.
*  Life of a Taiga.
*  It's a war.
*  We're in the middle of a war.
*  It's a war.
*  It's a war.
*  It's a war.
*  Life of a Taiga.
*  It's a war.
*  We're in a Herzog documentary.
*  It's a great documentary about these really, really, really fucking happy people.
*  And they live in Siberia.
*  And there's 300 of them in this town.
*  And some of them are trappers.
*  And some of them are hunters.
*  Some of them go out and pick pine nuts and they grind them in this old fashioned wood
*  machine.
*  They have dogs everywhere.
*  They live on the base of this river and they scratch and claw and get by every year.
*  They know what to do.
*  They work every fucking day.
*  They get up.
*  They run nets through the ice in order to catch pike.
*  They stay alive.
*  Are these the, where the kids have like hawks on their hands and like eagles?
*  No, no, no.
*  Okay, sorry.
*  I was thinking of the Mongols.
*  Fuck.
*  These are, these people live in this really, really, really inhospitable, cold as fuck
*  area where it's only, the river's only thawed for like two or three months out of the whole
*  year.
*  The river.
*  The fucking river!
*  It's a great documentary.
*  I want to watch it.
*  But I want to watch it again.
*  Okay.
*  And the thing about it is, Werner Herzog.
*  Simplicity?
*  Werner Herzog is one of my favorite documentarians because he's like, he's so passionate about
*  fascinating things, whether it's this or Grizzly Man or the one about the cave paintings in
*  France.
*  There's this amazing documentary about these 40,000, I believe it's 40,000 year old cave
*  paintings they found in this cave in France.
*  Where they're like, what in the fuck?
*  Like imagine what these people's lives were like.
*  These creative people that were like becoming what we are today, but only 40,000 years ago.
*  So they're probably really fucking similar to what we are.
*  And these people were just barely clawing by, living in fucking caves in France.
*  And there's cats and lions and oxen and all these crazy animals they're depicting on the
*  walls, these caves where they raise their families and hope they didn't get eaten.
*  I think that's what it is though.
*  No, I think that it's simplicity.
*  It is simplicity.
*  Like sustenance and intimacy.
*  Community.
*  Community.
*  Yeah, everything like bonds.
*  The worst thing you could do, I always said this about prison.
*  What's the worst thing they can do?
*  They put you in solitaire.
*  They take you away from rapists, murderers, and thieves.
*  And they put you by yourself and you're like, no.
*  Give me a general population, I'll take my chances.
*  You'd rather take your chances.
*  What I loved about your Bernie Sanders episode was he said that there's an epidemic in this
*  country and it's a lack of community.
*  Yes.
*  And I thought that was really profound.
*  He's right.
*  He is right.
*  You know, you don't, like half of us don't know our neighbors.
*  And so since I've been home for a while since my last tour, which has been like crazy, I've
*  really enjoyed immersing myself in my community and getting to know where I get my coffee.
*  And it feels so good to walk in and have them be like, hey, Suze, you want your latte?
*  You want your oat milk latte?
*  And I'm like, yes, thank you.
*  It's a little thing, but it's not.
*  You have recognition and people see each other.
*  And that goes a long way.
*  It does.
*  Man, it really does.
*  It does.
*  Having neighbors is a good feeling.
*  Having a community is a good feeling.
*  That's one of the things that we're talking about.
*  It's an indication of health.
*  Sure.
*  Or an indicator of poor health, too, is when you don't have those connections.
*  People feel real lost.
*  They don't have a sense of community.
*  And that's one of the things that any sort of thing can provide them.
*  That's why it's dangerous to get lumped up in groups because some groups are toxic.
*  You really want camaraderie.
*  That's what gangs are all about, right?
*  People grow up in real bad circumstances and together through a group, they find loyalty and unity
*  and they get compelled to act in the interest of that group even if it's really dangerous, illegal shit.
*  And so they do it out of love.
*  They do a negative thing for a positive reason because they want love.
*  I think we all do that.
*  We all do that with our ideologies.
*  We do it with our religions.
*  We do it with so many different things we do.
*  We do it because we want love.
*  But we're failing to understand the mechanisms that are at work that are causing us to be a fundamentalist
*  or a reactionary or really a radical person on one side or the other.
*  It's like we really just want to be loved.
*  But it's so simple.
*  Yeah, it is so simple.
*  There's so many things convoluting that.
*  It's hard for people to admit.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, well, I was telling you guys earlier about the LAFC, the Los Angeles football club.
*  I went to my second game yesterday.
*  It was their season opener.
*  And, you know, I'm a diehard Cleveland sports fan.
*  I love where I'm from.
*  I love the Tribe.
*  I love the Cavs.
*  I love the Browns, but I kind of have a beef with the NFL.
*  Let's not get into it.
*  Someone's very Cleveland-centric.
*  Well, you know, it's just like I love the Browns, but like my God.
*  Let me ask you a Cleveland question.
*  If you're so high and mighty on Cleveland.
*  Oh, shit.
*  Who is the UFC heavyweight champion in the world?
*  Fuck.
*  Stipe Miocic.
*  Where does Stipe live?
*  Motherfucking Cleveland.
*  But you said UFC.
*  South Euclid.
*  What's that?
*  Euclid, bro.
*  Euclid?
*  It's a neighborhood.
*  Thanks for the first of all.
*  John is going deep.
*  Money, the water, the fucking Ohio, and it took over.
*  But hold up.
*  He's the greatest heavyweight of all time.
*  Do you know that the UFC's greatest, most accomplished heavyweight of all time is lives and from Cleveland.
*  Shut your mouth.
*  He claims Cleveland.
*  He claims Cleveland.
*  Shut your mouth, Jamie.
*  He claims Cleveland.
*  OK.
*  But he's a great guy.
*  And he's a monster.
*  I am not as educated on the UFC front.
*  Well, educate yourself.
*  And I will.
*  And I also, you know, in all transparency, I know this is boxing, but I did watch the
*  Wilder Fury fight.
*  Oh, Wilder Fury.
*  Did not like it at all.
*  It made me very sad.
*  Did you watch it live?
*  Yeah, sure did.
*  Oh.
*  In between a poker game.
*  Have you seen a boxing match live before?
*  No.
*  Oh, no.
*  I watched it on the television.
*  Oh, that's not live.
*  Where are you from?
*  Cleveland, you asshole.
*  Suck my dick.
*  Suck my dick.
*  No, but let me get back to it.
*  The point is.
*  God damn it.
*  Look, I want to get into the UFC a little bit more, but I get a little tripped up by it.
*  But what I wanted to say about.
*  No, I first of all, I love you and I want to go to a match.
*  I just I just really.
*  Yes.
*  Cool.
*  Cool.
*  Next weekend.
*  I'm going to be on tour.
*  OK, but yeah, you want to go?
*  Gary, Gary should go Vegas.
*  Gary, you should go to Vegas.
*  Yeah, I do actually.
*  OK, you're in.
*  You're in.
*  But when I'm in town, let's go together.
*  Have a good time on tour.
*  I feel sad.
*  Watching people fuck each other up.
*  God damn it.
*  Gary, you've been a few of them.
*  Some FOMO.
*  Yeah.
*  Getting some FOMO.
*  Hey, back to the community thing.
*  Gary gets that first row of love.
*  Oh, son of a bitch.
*  First row of love.
*  In my face.
*  It just comes back full circle.
*  I'm sorry.
*  Cheers.
*  Well played.
*  Cheers to all you guys.
*  Well played, you assholes.
*  Oh my God.
*  What I wanted to say was.
*  I know it's taking me 10 minutes to get here.
*  I feel like we should dismount on that.
*  The LA.
*  The LA.
*  The LA.
*  The LA.
*  The LA.
*  The LA.
*  The LA.
*  The LA.
*  The LA.
*  The LA.
*  The LA.
*  The LA.
*  The LA.
*  The LA.
*  The LAFC team is, has been constructed by some pretty great folks in LA, like Will Ferrell's
*  a big impetus behind the team and Mia Hamm and all these great folks that kind of tailored
*  it to Los Angeles.
*  And my first game was, you could, I've never felt that kind of pride in Los Angeles.
*  Like I've always sort of felt like a transplant here and I've been here for almost 20 years.
*  And it was incredible.
*  Whoa.
*  The, the game itself is, is mind blowing.
*  Like it's nonstop in the, like the physical feet of, and I grew up playing soccer, so
*  I love to watch it.
*  I love to play.
*  Like it's great.
*  But the sense of community here and the enthusiasm and just the, the way that they have built
*  the stadium in downtown Los Angeles, it was, it was heavy.
*  Look at you.
*  You went hand to heart.
*  I did.
*  I felt it deeply.
*  I felt it so deeply.
*  You can make fun of me all you want.
*  Look at that gorgeous stadium.
*  That is beautiful.
*  And were you a soccer fan, excuse me, football fan?
*  Can we just come up with one fucking name?
*  We can't call it football.
*  Okay.
*  Why not?
*  Because we have American football.
*  We have all the missiles.
*  Yeah, that's fine.
*  Listen, this, we're not interested in changing the name of football.
*  All right.
*  Tell us more.
*  Go ahead.
*  This is us shit.
*  We're all in this together.
*  I'm just talking about names.
*  I'm not, I look, I don't even like football.
*  I think if they're real men, they take those fucking helmets off.
*  This is nonsense.
*  Oh, football, football.
*  Not foot ball.
*  Nonsense.
*  To fuck out of here.
*  By the way, by the way, all you savages, I'm joking.
*  These are just jokes.
*  All these fucking corn Fred assholes.
*  Get your disclaimer in.
*  Come down from Idaho.
*  What the fuck, bro?
*  We're going to get so much shit for this podcast.
*  We got football.
*  I'm just kidding.
*  Keep your pads on.
*  We're more pads.
*  I think you should play football from fucking hamster wheels.
*  Just giant hamster wheels slamming each other.
*  If you're going to have shoulder pads, this is a pad up the entire area around you.
*  Why are we playing games?
*  We got to protect you a little bit.
*  Let's protect you all the way.
*  Hamster wheels.
*  Everyone inside Ferris wheel slamming into each other from a distance of hundreds of
*  yards.
*  You're in the center powering it and you slamming each other.
*  Let's eliminate CTE and make this fun for everybody.
*  We just need bigger, we need golf court sized areas to play on.
*  Yeah, man.
*  Yeah.
*  Get some views.
*  That's how the fucking men play it.
*  That's how it was.
*  That's actually not even men.
*  That was the guys in the transitionary period.
*  They were transitioning.
*  That was right when they...
*  Yeah, see, the original men were leather helmets.
*  Yeah.
*  No, that's not leather.
*  Well, here's the thing.
*  Here's a little shout out to our Native American friends.
*  One of the problems when they first started inventing football is the Native American
*  teams would fuck up the white teams.
*  Sure.
*  These dudes were college educated and trying to learn how to play this new game.
*  These Native American dudes would put the smash down on them.
*  The fucking old school, angry that the grandpa got scalped, land got stolen.
*  Yes, they should be.
*  Yeah.
*  They've been hunting bison for a thousand generation.
*  Put that real smash down.
*  But it wasn't like they were making millions of dollars each player.
*  They would...
*  This is a new thing though.
*  They had real jobs and then football.
*  So this is the story.
*  It's like if you Google how American Indians saved the sport of football, it's an amazing
*  story and it's really the origins of the beginning of football.
*  They barely had pads.
*  They had these little shoulder fucking things that dudes have now in sport coats to make
*  themselves look like they're more boxy.
*  Crazy.
*  It's the male equivalent of a push up bra.
*  There's a dude with padded shoulders and a sport coat.
*  I never thought of it before.
*  It is.
*  That's exactly what it is.
*  They're that weird little thing.
*  Like, ho ho, I'm a general.
*  Whenever I buy a vintage jacket, I take the shoulder pads out because I feel like a douchebag.
*  You're a rebel.
*  Suck my dick.
*  I can't.
*  I think there was an NPR, like a radio lab podcast on...
*  That's what this is about.
*  I love radio labs.
*  Fuck yeah.
*  19 people died playing football.
*  How many?
*  Wait, was that in a year?
*  Yeah, 19 people died playing it.
*  What's the timeline?
*  One year.
*  Oh my god.
*  Those people are different.
*  I'm going to duck out for a second.
*  Gary's got to pee.
*  Gary's got to pee.
*  Get it.
*  I have to pee too.
*  Suzanne, keep it together until Gary gets back.
*  This is an epic one.
*  Take one for the team.
*  We're like three and a half hours in.
*  I saw that and I just looked at my phone.
*  We should probably play a song when Gary comes back.
*  100%.
*  And then, you know, we'll be like, we're going to play a song.
*  We're going to play a song.
*  We're going to play a song.
*  We're going to play a song.
*  We're going to play a song.
*  We can do whatever the fuck we want.
*  We can exhaust your fan base.
*  No, this is amazing.
*  Here's the thing.
*  They don't have to listen to it.
*  This is the whole reason this podcast became successful.
*  Ari Shafiro, who I love, know and love.
*  I think I met him once.
*  I love Ari to death.
*  I love him.
*  He's amazing.
*  But Ari gave me the worst advice ever and I talk about it often.
*  He's like, you got to edit.
*  You can't have your podcast four hours long.
*  I go, why not?
*  He goes, they're not going to listen to all of it.
*  I go, well then they don't have to.
*  I'm pretty sure the last Honey Honey podcast were about three hours.
*  And he fully admits it, by the way.
*  But it's not a knock on Ari.
*  No one knew what was going on back then.
*  I was just stubborn.
*  I think you've done a great job doing it your way.
*  I salute that.
*  And I also like, Joe, you've had a big hand in my career and what's gone on with Honey
*  Honey and how you've supported us.
*  There's something very special about not just doing it your way, not tailoring it to anyone
*  else's agenda.
*  It's like, it's pretty fucking cool what you're doing, my friend.
*  The crazy thing is that it happened 100% organically.
*  There was no preconception.
*  There was no idea that this was going to happen.
*  Just keep doing it and do what you like and then eventually it happens.
*  But when you and I went to see Sturgill, how fun was that?
*  So good.
*  How fun was that?
*  So good.
*  I enjoyed that so much.
*  Me too.
*  Because we went to see another one of our friends in this real cool, intimate setting.
*  I don't know Sturgill.
*  You worked with him?
*  No.
*  Never met him.
*  But I love him.
*  But didn't there was some communication back and forth?
*  So we both worked with Dave Cobb on Honey Honey's Last Record was produced by Dave Cobb
*  and he does all of Sturgill's records for the most part, I think.
*  That is crazy.
*  I would have swore that you guys had met.
*  No, I've never met him.
*  I'm a huge fan.
*  Love him.
*  But I told you I got mad at him at that one point where he did like an 11 minute guitar
*  solo and it was shredding and it was fucking sick.
*  And then he said, alright, it's a little too much testosterone.
*  Let's tone it down for the ladies.
*  And he played like a love song.
*  And I was like, ladies love rock and roll!
*  Sturgill!
*  He was just looking for a good segue, ma'am.
*  First of all, I fucking love him and I give him a free pass.
*  Let me tell you, I like rock and roll.
*  You know who else I love?
*  Who?
*  That dude who's on the road with him right now.
*  Tyler.
*  Tyler Childers.
*  Yeah, he's cool.
*  God damn, he's good.
*  He's super cool.
*  Both of his albums that I've listened to, I don't know if he has more than two.
*  Does he have more than two?
*  I don't know.
*  He's really good.
*  He's really authentic.
*  Yeah.
*  They're doing like stadiums, aren't they?
*  They're like doing huge venues.
*  Arenas!
*  Oh Jesus.
*  Arenas, bitch!
*  My bad.
*  Sorry.
*  I'll see myself out.
*  Sturgill told me he quit sugar, he lost 20 pounds.
*  He sent me a text, he's like, motherfucker, I lost 20 pounds.
*  I'm ready to do some fucking arenas.
*  Woo!
*  Oh my God.
*  Can I pee now?
*  I'm going to pee now.
*  Who has three?
*  And then we should probably play because we're going on a three hour podcast.
*  Why?
*  Well, no, it's fine.
*  There's no one.
*  We have no boss.
*  You're right.
*  You're right.
*  Whoa.
*  Suzanne, good luck.
*  Thanks.
*  Return.
*  We're going to say nice things about you.
*  Take a left.
*  You're going the wrong way.
*  She said, I don't know what's going to happen.
*  Oh, Gary Clark.
*  Yeah, man.
*  Are you talking about Sturgill?
*  I love that dude to death.
*  He's one of my favorite people.
*  He's cool.
*  I saw you guys hanging.
*  That was a new introduction.
*  Dude, I love him.
*  Yeah, he's dope.
*  He's amazing.
*  I've had a bunch of fun experiences with him.
*  But one of them was like, I have a couple of buddies in mind that at the time they were
*  living in the same apartment, they were like, I'm going to go to the gym.
*  I'm going to go to the gym.
*  I'm going to go to the gym.
*  I'm going to go to the gym.
*  I'm going to go to the gym.
*  And I said, hey, I go come on down.
*  And these are just like they live in bum fuck Idaho.
*  Right.
*  At the time.
*  Shout out to my friend Kenton, Kenton, Ruth.
*  First Light is a hunting apparel company and my friend Ryan Callahan.
*  And they came with me to the lab factory.
*  We're just hanging out.
*  And I said, hey, my friend Sturgill Simpson is going to come by.
*  And they're like, what?
*  And Sturgill shows up with one of his buddies like, what's up, man?
*  And they're like, and then we're all smoking weed.
*  And they're like, holy shit, we just smoked weed with Sturgill Simpson.
*  Sorry if I get you in trouble, Sturgill.
*  But and then, you know, he goes, he goes, what in the fuck just happened?
*  We just smoked weed with Sturgill Simpson.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I guess.
*  That's what happened.
*  Not his last album, but the one before.
*  I didn't know I was supposed to not tweet it, but I was the one who broke his album.
*  I broke the cover.
*  I put I put it on my Instagram.
*  I said, this album is the shit.
*  What?
*  He sent it to you or something?
*  He said to me, I thought it was already everybody already knew how far before the release.
*  It was pretty close.
*  It's pretty close.
*  It only helps.
*  Come on, man.
*  Of course.
*  All I'm saying is that it's a shit.
*  No, of course, man.
*  That's an amazing thing.
*  He's a unique dude, you know, because like it's hard to define him.
*  Like he's all over the place.
*  That's kind of what time it is, though, I feel like.
*  I agree with you.
*  I agree with you.
*  People are complex.
*  Yes.
*  And they should be.
*  We should be complex.
*  You know, and then sometimes not.
*  Like I love ACDC.
*  Yeah, there's that.
*  Yeah, that's OK, though.
*  It's like I don't I don't think there's a right way or wrong way.
*  I think it's great to have all sorts of different things.
*  You know, a whole lot of Rosie's.
*  That's a fucking song for for the ages.
*  And it's a real simple song about a giant lady.
*  Well put, you know, it's a real simple song about a real large lady.
*  And it's amazing.
*  A whole lot of Rosie's amazing.
*  I mean, a whole lot of Rosie ACDC.
*  I mean, come on.
*  Oh, yeah. Come on, sister.
*  I'm here. We need an equal word to come on, son.
*  Oh, to to girls.
*  You know, I mean, sister works.
*  We need an equal word.
*  I'm a big fan of the friendly like, come on, hope, you know, just in the friendly way.
*  Not in the negative way.
*  I like calling girls hookers, but in a fun way.
*  Like when girls yell shit out in the audience, I settle down, hooker.
*  Yeah, but it's all love.
*  It's not like in a mean way.
*  I feel like you're the only person, the only person.
*  I mean that and I don't say that lately that I'm I can laugh when you're like, yeah, bitch.
*  But listen, you and I have been friends for almost a decade.
*  I know.
*  And it's all love.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Yeah, we met in 2011.
*  Right. We did that end the world show 2012.
*  That was fun.
*  We did. And apparently we did it.
*  Supposedly we're still here.
*  Cheers.
*  Honey, honey.
*  Joey Diaz, Doug Sandhoff and I did a show at the Wiltern in Los Angeles on December 21st, 2012.
*  That was the Terrence McKenna thing.
*  The end of the Mayan calendar.
*  Right. Terrence McKenna.
*  He had a computer.
*  This is how deep that motherfucker ran.
*  He got so high.
*  He came up with an algorithm based on the I Ching that was mapping out time.
*  It wasn't the Mayan calendar.
*  It was. It was both.
*  OK. It was the Mayan calendar.
*  It was novelty.
*  It was based on novelty.
*  It coincided with this is what happened.
*  He came up with a thing called novelty theory and novelty theory.
*  He based off the I Ching, the I Ching, which is it's a divination system, a Chinese divination system.
*  And they would throw these hexagrams.
*  I believe it's hexagrams.
*  And they would indicate a certain pattern and they would try to recognize this pattern.
*  Was it hexagrams?
*  What the fuck is the I Ching?
*  Anyway, they would throw these stones.
*  It is hexagrams.
*  Thank you.
*  So it's a Chinese method of divination that's more than a thousand years old.
*  And they were trying to conduct what McKenna believed.
*  This is what he believed the I Ching really was.
*  He believed it was a map of time and that they had through some way figured out through hexagrams to recognize that time was it was mimicable.
*  You could capture it in hexagrams, in mathematics, in geometry.
*  Is this like a string theory kind of thing?
*  Almost.
*  All right.
*  And that you could come up with some sort of a system to this thing.
*  And he called that system time wave zero.
*  And what he thought that system was, he thought that was a system of recognizing novelty, like new ideas, creative things, whether it's the Internet or internal combustion engine or the Tesla electric car, anything where it was where you could map that out.
*  And you could say, OK, if you looked at this as a mathematical algorithm and you saw how this is going to play out, you could almost predict patterns in this wave.
*  And where do you where do you predict this happening and that happening?
*  And where does it end?
*  Where does it get to a point where it's so crazy?
*  No one knows what the fuck to do.
*  And in Terrence's life, he believed that time was December 21st, 2012.
*  And he as a matter of fact, my Barracuda 1970 Barracuda, my license plate was December 2012 because I'm like, if this bitch ends, I'm going to be driving around this 1970 Barracuda.
*  Did you think it was going to end?
*  I did.
*  You really did.
*  Yeah, that's why we did that show together.
*  That's it.
*  Look at that.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Oh, my God.
*  I love that so much.
*  That was that makes me so happy.
*  December 21st.
*  I was like, if I'm going to die, I'm going to be with my favorite people on the planet, like legitimately.
*  Wow.
*  You know, you roll through the countdown.
*  That's what I love.
*  There was no like 10, 9.
*  You're like, happy new year, motherfuckers.
*  Then you just kept on with your set.
*  It was great.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, it was fun.
*  It was fun.
*  It was like my favorite people are my family and my friends.
*  There's Ben.
*  Yeah.
*  And to be able to do a show and I wear a fucking suit.
*  I'm like, if Odin's going to come capture me, he's going to capture me wearing some fucking very fine David August apparel.
*  Didn't Joey Diaz do a set?
*  Yes.
*  Joey Diaz, Doug Stanhope.
*  And honey, honey.
*  That was so special.
*  It was one of our favorite times.
*  Thank you for bringing us on to such a cool thing.
*  Come on. It was fun.
*  Just me and Stanhope.
*  Look, I love Stanhope as much as I'll cut my fucking pinky off for Stanhope.
*  But he's, I don't see him enough.
*  You know, so whenever we're going to make an excuse to do this, we're going to do another, I should tell this right now, we're going to do another end of the world podcast at the new presidential elections.
*  So when was it November 21st 2000?
*  What is it?
*  Like the first week, the first, the first, whatever it is, 2020, we're going to be at the comedy store.
*  We're going to make that shit happen.
*  We're going to do another live podcast.
*  This time it's just going to be me, Stanhope and a couple of other people.
*  We last time we got too many people.
*  November 3rd, end of the world or not.
*  It seems like we're wrong a lot.
*  Who knows?
*  But this is my thought on all this is like everyone, even the people at the top of government are just people.
*  They need to listen to, we all need to listen.
*  We can work together.
*  The system that we're on, this fucking clock that we're on, it's not good for anybody.
*  Yeah.
*  We're all worried.
*  No one's good at being wrong.
*  No one's good at being like, oh, I made a mistake.
*  I'm so sorry because you're a human and that's what we do.
*  And that's where I think there's this like real disconnect with the people that are
*  quote unquote running this country.
*  You know, there's no room for error.
*  They shouldn't be running it.
*  That's and they know it.
*  That's why they're holding onto that spot.
*  No one should be.
*  I think they would do a better job running it if they could exhibit human qualities and also be leaders at the same time.
*  I agree.
*  You know, but I think they're scared.
*  I think everybody's scared.
*  And I think when you're in a position where you're in control.
*  Mind killer.
*  What?
*  Mind mind control over giant groups of people.
*  You barely can keep your shit together.
*  Like, who are you?
*  Are you an alien?
*  Are you from another fucking planet?
*  You're not.
*  Are you?
*  Yes, Gary.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  I wonder.
*  No, no, no.
*  You mean them?
*  Take me to your leader.
*  Remember close encounters.
*  I said they talk to people.
*  We should play a song.
*  Or not.
*  I don't know.
*  Suzanne, we hit the perfect podcast.
*  We're at critical mass.
*  We can do whatever we want.
*  If you guys want to play a song, we could play a song.
*  But this podcast has been perfect.
*  It's great.
*  It's been flawless.
*  The universe has called us forth.
*  We could play the single on the way out.
*  You know, we don't have to play a live song.
*  We could play another variation.
*  We could do everything.
*  I don't want to hot box you.
*  But it's too late.
*  I think you can't hot box the willing over here.
*  I can't smoke and then play.
*  I'll smoke after.
*  I'm already pretty intoxicated.
*  You're such a pro.
*  You're weed pros.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  I'm not a pro.
*  There's real pros.
*  There's real pros.
*  I'm not.
*  Axe Bronson.
*  I had that motherfucker on this podcast.
*  I took a picture with Khalifa.
*  I took a picture of his ass straight too.
*  I'm like, what?
*  I'm an amateur.
*  I'm a baby.
*  I'm a little baby.
*  Look what Tommy Chong gave me.
*  I'm a baby.
*  I'm a baby.
*  Shake goes deep.
*  How long has that been there?
*  It's been there forever.
*  It's a shrine.
*  I'm not going to light this thing on fire.
*  I love Tommy Chong.
*  He's a legend that will stay there.
*  I will love it as much or more.
*  I would light it if he asked me to.
*  If Tommy Chong sent me a direct message,
*  bro, I would really appreciate if you lit that on air.
*  I'd light on air out of respect.
*  I used to listen to Big Bamboo when I was a little kid.
*  Me and my friends would have headphones on over a record player.
*  Listen to Tommy Chong and Cheech.
*  Damn.
*  The fact I don't even know those guys, it still weirds me out.
*  I want to get away from them.
*  It's just too real.
*  Like, how are you guys real?
*  I know you.
*  Back in my acting days, I worked with Cheech.
*  He was on a show I worked on.
*  Cheech used to be on that show with Don Johnson.
*  Remember that shit?
*  Remember that shit?
*  I never looked it up.
*  You know how I know?
*  Because of barracudas.
*  Plymouth barracudas discontinued 1974.
*  Something like that.
*  Cheech and Chong was, or Cheech rather, Cheech Martin,
*  not Cheech and Chong, Chong was on.
*  Goddamn, we're fucked up.
*  Listen, you can suck my Monday.
*  It's not real.
*  That's not real.
*  Monday's not real.
*  This is life.
*  This is life.
*  Monday's not real.
*  I'm not an accountant.
*  Listen, I have to check back in from time to time.
*  Just to make sure that I'm here.
*  Because I could disappear, man.
*  I don't care what time it is.
*  I don't care what day it is.
*  But sometimes it's nice to know so you can relate to something.
*  Gary, you're here, and I'm so glad you're here.
*  My god.
*  I'm glad you're here, too.
*  There it is.
*  There's Axe Bronson.
*  That dude smoked one, two, three, four, five, six, seven
*  blunts in the course of one podcast.
*  He had one in his hand, I think.
*  That's right.
*  He didn't get in.
*  That's crazy.
*  He went hard.
*  He just keeps going.
*  I don't have the weed tolerance like I have the booze tolerance.
*  How do you feel about spliffs in here?
*  You love them.
*  You do, you, Gary.
*  We have a machine.
*  There's no rooms here.
*  We have a fan.
*  This room is set up for smokers.
*  How do you feel bad?
*  Dude's smoking a blunt over here.
*  Jamie's going to turn the fan on.
*  It'll suck all the air out of the room and connect us with Jesus.
*  Look at that.
*  It's a phone.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, we set it up.
*  When we built this room, we had it set up for Dice Clay.
*  Dice Lice to smoke.
*  So he would come in and smoke and I would never want to tell him not to smoke.
*  So I bought, because I'm just happy he's here.
*  So I bought him an air machine that would process the air while he was there.
*  Just for Andrew Dice Clay.
*  That's amazing.
*  Stan Hope used it and I was like, perfect.
*  All right, now we got one for smokers.
*  So fire up that spliff kind, sir.
*  Do not be scared.
*  Young Jamie's impervious to all forms of intoxication.
*  He's probably from another planet.
*  If anyone visits us from afar and is just down here to contribute, it's Jamie.
*  That fucking dude eats a thousand milligrams of THC.
*  No lie.
*  And I'm like, how are you?
*  He's like, I'm fine.
*  1250.
*  Excuse me.
*  Pardon me.
*  I have insulted our host from afar.
*  Yeah, 1250.
*  I'm impressed.
*  I'm very impressed.
*  He's an alien.
*  And also inspired.
*  Well, you know, like sheep can't eat like certain grass and they'll die.
*  They eat Filaris grass.
*  They're fucking DMT kills sheep.
*  I did not know that.
*  You can take it as a part of your brain, but if a sheep gets a hold of it like,
*  they just die.
*  Legs sticking up near, twitching.
*  It turns out they ate a DMT rich concentrated patch of grass.
*  Oh my God.
*  Jesus.
*  It fucking kills them dead in their tracks.
*  Like farmers in certain areas would find these sheep like legs up.
*  No way.
*  Yeah.
*  The last time I smoked DMT, I was in the bathtub and I was, you know, prepared to have a moment.
*  And I got myself all situated and I like lit up and then I hear like, and I'm like, I get up
*  and I put a robe on and I go to the front door and my old landlord, Carlos, was like,
*  Ms. Susie, Ms. Susie, the ceiling is leaking.
*  And my bathtub was leaking.
*  Oh no.
*  I was.
*  You didn't know?
*  No.
*  And I was very high.
*  Oh no.
*  And it was a terrifying experience.
*  Oh my God.
*  You're DMT high, so you're pixelated and shit?
*  And PS though, it was kind of old, so I didn't get as like.
*  You didn't get a solid hit?
*  No, but I got enough of a hit to be fucked up with my landlord knocking on my door when I was
*  a little high on DMT.
*  So anyway, I haven't smoked it since.
*  I'd like to at some point.
*  But Duncan Trussell 24 seven and the hour of the day for incantations and wizardry.
*  Wouldn't I call Joe Rogan?
*  Do not say that over the air.
*  This is going to be edited.
*  Hold this for later.
*  They should get it on it too.
*  I'm with you guys.
*  They should be.
*  They're missing the point.
*  Well, this like the drug users versus fucking law enforcement.
*  You guys should be on drugs.
*  You want to do good law enforcement?
*  All be on mushrooms.
*  That's what we should have every cop on mushrooms.
*  Like like he'll know which cop which kid can hug.
*  Don't shoot him.
*  Just hug him.
*  Just run up and hug him.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  He'll know.
*  He'll know you feel it.
*  You'll feel it in your soul.
*  Like that kid just needs a hug.
*  He fucking doesn't know his dad.
*  Just run up on him.
*  That guy's dad's in prison right now.
*  That guy's dad's a bank robber.
*  That guy's a kid.
*  He's a baby.
*  I'm not mad at that a little bit.
*  I'm with you.
*  That's what I think.
*  All cops.
*  Andrew Yang had a great idea.
*  All cops should be purple belts and jujitsu.
*  Which I agree with.
*  I think it's a great idea.
*  So you should have some understanding of how to defend yourself if someone tries to grab you
*  and get your gun.
*  I 100% agree with that.
*  But also why not be on mushrooms too?
*  Why are you playing games?
*  Come on man.
*  You're out there life and death in the streets.
*  Yeah this bill is going to go a long way.
*  You should be like fucking Dr. Manhattan.
*  You're just levitating through the city trying to teach people the right way.
*  Come on.
*  We can all work together.
*  Agreed.
*  We'll all be a part of love.
*  I think it's possible.
*  I think we just need to adjust the chemicals that we have.
*  Just like you've done with exercise and some people have done with medication
*  or meditation and medication.
*  Some people do with music.
*  It adjusts the chemicals.
*  And I think every way that we know of that's beneficial to adjust the chemicals.
*  Whether it's through yoga or meditation or love or music or comedy or anything you can find
*  that puts you in a better place.
*  We should embrace that.
*  Agreed.
*  Mushrooms are one of those things.
*  Agreed.
*  You shouldn't listen to ACD Highway to Hell all day long.
*  ACDC Highway to Hell 24-7 is going to be a bummer man.
*  I mean you might like the first two or three plays.
*  I wouldn't like that shit at all.
*  But every now and then.
*  Right.
*  You know it's like Billy Squire.
*  Lonely is the night.
*  You don't want to hear it every day.
*  But every now and then when you're in a car.
*  You know how you have that Bluetooth thing that happens when your car synced up to Bluetooth.
*  Does your car do that?
*  Does it do the Bluetooth?
*  Where like randomly it'll play a song.
*  Yeah.
*  So you hear like some cool.
*  It's always alt.
*  No not alt J.
*  It goes to the A anyway.
*  Yeah a lot of times.
*  iTunes.
*  I told Tommy Segura that there was one of his bits would come up.
*  Like one of the first things.
*  Vampire Weekend.
*  That was it.
*  That's the one to play.
*  Sorry.
*  Well it's any but sometimes it's a random thing too.
*  Sometimes it doesn't do it alphabetically.
*  It just doesn't randomly.
*  Like you'll get like a cool song out of nowhere just plays when you start your car.
*  Like oh that's a drug.
*  It's a little weird drug.
*  Yeah.
*  What you guys do is a little weird drug.
*  Likewise.
*  All of us.
*  So are we drug dealers?
*  Is that what you're saying?
*  Yes in a good way.
*  We're like the proverbial drug dealer.
*  I love whenever you can use proverbial.
*  I'm on your team.
*  We should be wearing robes.
*  Do you know what I watched the other day?
*  Willie B from the Ghetto Boys had a...
*  Willie D from the Ghetto Boys had this...
*  Are you leaving?
*  No.
*  Gary where are you going?
*  I'm going to get ready.
*  Is that a really...
*  Yes sir.
*  Sir.
*  No you got to do what you got to do.
*  Willie D from the Ghetto Boys had this video that he put up of James Brown.
*  Like right after James Brown had gotten arrested for some craziness.
*  But he was like on the air apparently high as a kite.
*  Yeah sounds about right.
*  And they were asking about being arrested.
*  He was like living in America.
*  That's freedom.
*  You have to see it.
*  He's got these crazy glasses on.
*  I mean it's just...
*  Gloves and everything.
*  Well he didn't have gloves.
*  There he is.
*  Oh shit.
*  Oh look at him.
*  Can we play any of this or we get in trouble?
*  Come on look.
*  We'll get in trouble if we play it.
*  Pretty famous little clip.
*  Yeah it's a famous clip.
*  Look at him and his glasses.
*  James Brown's strangest interview ever.
*  Look at that white lady with her 59 year old lady haircut.
*  Wow that's a real...
*  Can I speak to the manager haircut?
*  It's amazing.
*  God look at him.
*  Look at his glasses.
*  He's like yep got it.
*  He put those glasses on like perfect.
*  That's what I'm trying to say.
*  Bitch I'm not even in your dimension.
*  My favorite James Brown video of all time is live in Zaire.
*  Live in Zaire before Muhammad Ali and George Foreman fought.
*  Wow.
*  Yes yes yes.
*  And James Brown comes out and performs live.
*  Right before Muhammad Ali fucks up George Foreman.
*  I like that guy's jacket.
*  James Brown BB King is on that one too.
*  Dude.
*  Crazy.
*  Yeah man.
*  I love the stash that's going.
*  And you got a real...
*  What is this 74 or something?
*  Is that what it said?
*  74.
*  This is...
*  The world's a different place.
*  James Brown live in Zaire just crushing it.
*  Just crushing it.
*  And again what the fuck was that?
*  What was out there like James Brown before James Brown?
*  Answer.
*  Nothing.
*  Nothing.
*  Oh my god.
*  Not a fucking thing.
*  Not a thing.
*  A human original.
*  Just super eccentric powerhouse.
*  Wait what does GFOS mean?
*  JB James Brown.
*  No no no.
*  What the fuck?
*  Thank you Gary.
*  Jesus woman.
*  I'm sorry.
*  Jesus Christ you're white.
*  Cleveland in the house.
*  GFOS.
*  That's the meanest thing you've ever said to me Joe.
*  Come on look at his outfit.
*  Soothe yourself by looking at his outfit.
*  I knew once I said it I was like you shouldn't ask.
*  Look at that fucking outfit.
*  And here's the thing.
*  A dude like him.
*  I mean he's so goddamn talented he could wear whatever he wanted.
*  He could wear some bullfighting cape.
*  James Brown can wear anything.
*  Look at those pants.
*  Look at those pants.
*  He could wear anything.
*  Did you notice that the zipper was on the back?
*  Oh my god.
*  I thought about it.
*  Look at you.
*  You can pull it off.
*  Come on now.
*  A woman can pull it off far easier than a male.
*  A male pulling that off is peacocking.
*  You know what though?
*  Everything now has already been done.
*  For the most part.
*  Oh I don't know about that.
*  I do.
*  I think like sexuality and individuality in a lot of ways
*  have been exacerbated.
*  And now the weird.
*  I sound cynical.
*  I think the thing now is being authentic.
*  That's what's a rarity.
*  I agree with you if that's what you are.
*  But if you're some hypersexual James Brown motherfucker from another dimension.
*  This is 40 years old.
*  Four zero before TRT.
*  No growth hormone.
*  No vitamins to speak of.
*  Stem cells.
*  Yes.
*  41 maybe.
*  Dude.
*  A lot of home cooking.
*  And a lot of love.
*  That dude is fueled by love.
*  It's like maybe four people on earth as famous as he was in 1974.
*  There he is.
*  Man.
*  That's a weird moment in time.
*  You know?
*  It's special.
*  I was watching a video of Elvis Presley singing Suspicious Minds.
*  And I was like that poor bastard never had a chance.
*  Never had a chance.
*  What do you mean?
*  What do you mean?
*  Yeah.
*  This is what I mean.
*  There was no one that famous before Elvis.
*  It never happened.
*  It wasn't real.
*  And then all of a sudden this young guy out of nowhere.
*  And all the signs are there.
*  Like he marries his wife when she's 14.
*  Why is he doing that?
*  Because he wants to reclaim his innocence.
*  Like people call him a pedophile.
*  Like maybe.
*  But there would be probably a bunch of instances of that.
*  I think it was more likely this is a guy slinky.
*  Like sliding away from reality with pills and fame and stardom.
*  That's a good question.
*  How old was he?
*  What?
*  You know what's funny about that?
*  In this.
*  What's funny about that was we would expect there would be a year where he should be able
*  to keep it together.
*  Because like I don't think he died that old.
*  He looks pretty young there.
*  How old was Elvis when he died?
*  He's like 45 or something.
*  Not that old.
*  How old was he?
*  Young Jamie.
*  Drum roll please.
*  Young Jamie.
*  Yes sir.
*  Born in 35.
*  Died in 77.
*  So he's 42.
*  Yeah.
*  42.
*  That ain't shit.
*  Damn.
*  That ain't shit.
*  No it's not.
*  And it was he was a new thing.
*  There was a new thing.
*  The new thing was this fucking insane supernatural sex appeal star with tassels on his pants doing
*  fake karate throwing kicks.
*  Girls are going crazy.
*  He's taking pills.
*  He was kind of.
*  No one before him.
*  He was kind of a sacrificial lamb though in a lot of ways.
*  Could you imagine like what the fuck?
*  And then there was Michael Jackson who said hold my beer.
*  But Michael Jackson said hold my beer.
*  You want to see crazy?
*  How about I do what you do when I'm six?
*  How about that?
*  And then you have to hold the weight of the world on your back of like the icon that you are
*  and the barriers that you've broken and then the you know the effect you've had on people
*  and how much they rely upon you.
*  I can't fucking imagine.
*  I can't imagine either.
*  Jamie come back to Elvis doing those stretches.
*  By the way I should say when I say fake karate some of his karate was fake but he was actually
*  trained by Ed Parker who was a noted Kempo karate master and back in the day like in Elvis's
*  day in 1970.
*  This reminds me of the Lenny Kravitz pants rip.
*  First of all how dare you?
*  What do you mean?
*  It's a great moment in history.
*  Yeah but he's a different thing.
*  Yeah but I know he was really kind of squatting there.
*  And Lenny Kravitz has got his shit together fully.
*  Except for that time his pants ripped and his dick flopped out.
*  That's just pants.
*  Do you think it was probably planned out?
*  It's probably Janet Jackson's nipple.
*  Remember?
*  Remember at the Super Bowl?
*  Everybody remembers nipple gate.
*  Yeah nipple gate.
*  Nipple gate.
*  Lenny Kravitz has some crazy farm in Brazil.
*  He lives on a giant farm.
*  Yeah he's got a quill.
*  I don't know I haven't talked to him lately.
*  He rides horses.
*  That's nice.
*  Lenny Kravitz is on the show.
*  There's a whole video online when you see him in his estate in Brazil
*  riding horses over the mountain.
*  Look at that.
*  That's Lenny Kravitz bitch!
*  Boom.
*  Yeah.
*  Damn he looks good.
*  He looks so good.
*  They sent him to South America.
*  They said you're gonna have to go to division one.
*  You're fucking things up over here in division two.
*  They said you're going to South America.
*  You need to go to Brazil.
*  Listen, we're not going to let you go fam.
*  You need to raise cattle and stare at the sunset.
*  Jesus Christ man.
*  Slow down.
*  You handsome bastard.
*  You handsome smooth singing bastard.
*  He's beautiful.
*  He's amazing.
*  He's so fucking talented.
*  Wow are you gonna go my way?
*  Maybe.
*  Dude he's so talented.
*  He's so talented.
*  Have you seen a there's a film where he produces Mick Jagger's record.
*  A record for Mick Jagger.
*  No way.
*  There's a documentary on it.
*  Oh wow.
*  It's incredible how talented he is.
*  You can tell just where he's at.
*  Early 2000s I think.
*  What is that video you were showing Jamie?
*  Because that's an amazing video because you can tell what kind of a person he is
*  by following him around this house where he talks about what these things in his house mean to him.
*  Little pieces of art, things that someone left him, things that have real significant meaning to him.
*  He's talking about why and what they are.
*  Architectural Digest.
*  Oh okay.
*  Yeah people try to be weird.
*  Oh I'm gonna get a fucking ranch in Arizona.
*  I see your ranch in Arizona.
*  I raise you a ranch in Brazil.
*  Suck my dick.
*  Hold my beer.
*  Hold my beer.
*  I'm going to another continent bitch.
*  I'm gonna have my whole band stay over at my place.
*  Whatever, whatever, living the dream.
*  Level up.
*  Yeah there's levels to this shit.
*  There's levels to this shit.
*  That's funny.
*  What is this one Jamie?
*  This is the song you made with me.
*  Make Jagger.
*  Oh this is the song you did?
*  This is just the video.
*  This is not the documentary.
*  When you talk about levels to this, how is this dude still slinging dick at how old is he?
*  How old is Mick Jagger?
*  What is, let's guess.
*  Let's be conservative and say 73.
*  Yes.
*  Might be 76 right?
*  What do we got Jamie?
*  Here we go.
*  Drum roll please.
*  76!
*  Here's the thing.
*  76!
*  Per your Black Swimmers.
*  Aubrey DeGray podcast, do you have a, like I feel like these people are joyful.
*  You know I think that that's the anti-aging contingency is propagating joy.
*  I think you're right and I think with Mick Jagger, one of the big things is that Mick Jagger is like
*  really really into fitness.
*  Oh I didn't know that.
*  Oh yeah he works out twice a day.
*  What?
*  What an asshole!
*  What the fuck?
*  Yeah he's like oh I see what's up.
*  Like you gotta keep this fucking boat on the river.
*  You gotta keep this boat on the river and he gets after it.
*  He does, he's legendary.
*  He does dancing and all kinds of other shit.
*  He's got choreography.
*  Dancing is everything.
*  Dancing is everything.
*  Dancing is a lot.
*  Look at him.
*  Oh bless his heart.
*  So if you went to see Mick Jagger you're like oh this is one of the fucking guys.
*  That's some dancing in the streets move right there.
*  You're like he's got bad hips, he's gonna stand still.
*  No this guy's fucking hustling.
*  He realizes what he's doing is rare.
*  Do you guys dance?
*  Do you dance?
*  Who doesn't?
*  I do.
*  This is my thing is when I'm in my studio I work off by myself and I just dance crazy.
*  Fuck yeah Gary.
*  Absolutely.
*  I'm gonna bust it out someday.
*  Gary that is awesome.
*  Yeah why not man?
*  You're dancing to your own sounds.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  That and other people's too.
*  It's also.
*  I love to dance.
*  I love to dance too.
*  Making my own steps.
*  I don't dance enough.
*  I dance at home alone often but I should get out and like.
*  It's a form of exercise too.
*  Sure.
*  And it's not just a physical exercise.
*  It's like a spiritual exercise in that you're enjoying yourself.
*  That word spiritual so poisoned by crystals and fucking horseshit.
*  No fuck that.
*  This is a safe place.
*  Yeah.
*  Like thank you.
*  I feel that.
*  But like.
*  Freedom.
*  Absolutely.
*  It's true.
*  It's true.
*  Why should joy have boundaries?
*  It shouldn't.
*  It shouldn't.
*  We're all scared.
*  No I'm not.
*  I had this conversation with this friend of mine about Bernie Sanders.
*  We were talking about socialism and he's like I never thought you'd be into socialism.
*  I'm not into socialism.
*  But what about fixing the things that are broken doesn't seem appealing to you.
*  And we have socialism for a lot of different things like the fire department, the police department.
*  But I'm like that's not what I'm into.
*  This is what I'm really into.
*  I'm really into like people having a big stake in community.
*  And I think when you look out for other people that's when you have the biggest stake in community.
*  And I think that's one of the things we're missing today.
*  We're missing we can do it in our neighborhoods like we were talking about.
*  You know your neighbors.
*  It's really nice.
*  But I think we can do it in an expansive way as long as we didn't give in to the temptation
*  to be shitty to people that we don't know and to treat everybody as if we're all a part of a community.
*  I think that can be done.
*  And I think the best way to sort of enhance that kind of thinking is to make decisions
*  that are for the downtrodden.
*  Make decisions that are for the working class and the people that are struggling and the people
*  that are just trying to put food on the table and keep a home heated.
*  That's concentrate on that first before anything because those are the hardest hardships.
*  There's too many people that have this idea that everyone that's in that experience is there
*  because they're lazy or because they don't work hard or because they don't really think that.
*  They do.
*  That's so ignorant.
*  There's a lot of people that do think like that.
*  But it is because it is it is that they're ignorant.
*  But it's also that they don't know.
*  They have an experience with those people experience.
*  And if they this is the thing about every person alive.
*  Look at a person.
*  Look at a person is doing great.
*  Look at a person is falling apart.
*  You would be that person if you did what they did.
*  There's not much difference between unless you're talking about physical things
*  like the difference between you seeing bolts running speed and the difference in mind.
*  Like this is certain physical things.
*  This is are unsurmountable.
*  I'm fucking positive thinking, bro.
*  Like it's not happening.
*  It's not happening.
*  Right.
*  There's certain things you can't get past.
*  But there's a lot of things you can.
*  And one of the problems that we all have is our perception.
*  The way we look at things.
*  If we could look at things as more like we're all cool.
*  We're all together.
*  Like nobody wants you to do bad.
*  Like let's all do good.
*  We can all do good together.
*  We could we could all go forward with that mindset.
*  There are some people that want you to do bad and those people also deserve attention.
*  Exactly.
*  They need a fucking hug.
*  They need a hug.
*  Which we for just they're just so scared.
*  We treat them the wrong way.
*  We treat them like we need to kill them and drown them in the river.
*  They're not the bad guys.
*  It's like the hurt people hurt people thing.
*  You got to see those people and say hey I see you and I'm going to hug you.
*  And let's all fucking move together.
*  Yes.
*  And then the problem is some of them are really legitimately broken.
*  Some people have done a terrible job of raising their kids to the point where they've broken
*  their kids.
*  And those kids need to find some way back to the garden.
*  It's hard.
*  And that's the reality of scale.
*  The fact there's 350 million people just in America.
*  I mean is that the real number is that North America.
*  That's fucking crazy for us to try to put that into perspective is almost impossible.
*  I don't think we even understand what that number means and that we're all supposed to be a team.
*  But I think it's possible.
*  I think we just have to look at it the right way.
*  You have to have no room for douchebaggery.
*  No room for that's impossible.
*  But it's not impossible.
*  I don't think it is.
*  I think people just need a higher level of guidance and of understanding of the consequences of not
*  behaving that way and the benefits of behaving that way.
*  The problem is we look at it like it's a negative like somehow or another it's a weakness.
*  If you show any sort of sympathy or compassion or or understand try to have some understanding for
*  people who are downtrodden or poor.
*  People look at you like you're weak.
*  Like no you're you're looking at the wrong way.
*  You're looking at you feel uncomfortable about it because it makes you feel weird.
*  Because there's too many variables and it'd be better if you just nailed it down to a one or a zero.
*  Either they're lazy or they're good hard working people.
*  If they're good hard working people to figure it out and if they're lazy they don't.
*  It's not binary.
*  It's not like that's the thing.
*  That's exactly right.
*  Yeah it's there's so much more.
*  Just too many of us.
*  There's too many variables.
*  The idea that like no one should get help.
*  That's so crazy.
*  I was on welfare when I was a kid.
*  It's it's important.
*  It's important for people.
*  It keeps them fed.
*  It gives people a chance.
*  That doesn't mean that people are going to come steal your money.
*  That means we should all chip in a little bit.
*  We have to figure out how to make sure the government has our confidence.
*  We feel like we can throw them our money and they're going to do the right thing with it.
*  And we're going to help communities.
*  We're going to help people.
*  And that's what everybody's wary about for a good reason.
*  It's because who the fuck knows who's taking your money.
*  They don't give you an accountant sheet.
*  They don't show you what they're spending it on.
*  You just give it up.
*  That's what I meant earlier when I was like I don't know what's true.
*  I don't know.
*  It's hard.
*  But at the same time I think what you're saying is so powerful because like you can
*  have your sort of government affiliations and like oh these are the people that are
*  quote unquote taking care of us.
*  And then you can also take care of yourself and each other and recognize your neighbors
*  and recognize your community and kind of build from the ground up know who your
*  local representatives are.
*  You know for fuck's sake like your kids in their schools and like all that stuff like
*  that is a very powerful tool.
*  Well and even I mean those are official titles and official designations and all that stuff
*  is awesome too.
*  But it's also just know who the fuck is around you.
*  Right.
*  Like and be nice to each other and figure it out together.
*  Yeah.
*  We're all acting like everybody is not going to help you and everybody's not going to
*  understand you.
*  And then when that gets fed to a scale of this impossible number of 350 million people.
*  350 million people doesn't even make sense to us.
*  It's so hard for us to ever understand what it's like to try to like do what's best for
*  350 million people.
*  It doesn't make sense.
*  So you just do what's best for yourself and you go it's going to work itself out.
*  It's going to sort itself out.
*  If there's ever a conspiracy.
*  There's no action involved in that.
*  Exactly.
*  And if there's ever a conspiracy to keep people stupid that's the conspiracy.
*  Yeah.
*  Make that seem like it's normal.
*  Yeah.
*  Make that seem like everybody shouldn't go hey hey hey you really can affect things and
*  you really should pay attention to this and we should all figure out a way to do it together
*  where the whole motivation is to make life better for everybody.
*  When you're really really really really rich.
*  Let's say you're really really really really really rich.
*  What if you just really really really really you get a notice.
*  Bitch you ain't noticing shit.
*  You're not going to notice.
*  But you are contributing in a dynamic way to a system that helped you get really really
*  really rich.
*  See the balancing act is not wanting to get to a place where you stifle people's need
*  to do well because they have they need to have some sort of motivation.
*  Some people do you want them to have motivation but you want them to feel good about contributing
*  to that's that's what's up.
*  It's not this idea that they're going to come steal your money.
*  It's like no you're going to help you're going to help.
*  We're not stealing any money.
*  You're going to help people that can't help themselves.
*  There's people you might have got lucky might have got a good parents and a good situation
*  good neighborhood good school.
*  You did well.
*  Some people don't some people get fucked when they're really young.
*  They get robbed.
*  They get beaten up.
*  They get tortured.
*  They get scared.
*  That's normal in life too.
*  And you can help them.
*  And this is what I think when you get lost in words like socialism and libertarianism
*  and all these different fucking labels that carry all this weight behind them.
*  If we just say like what's your intentions is your intentions to make the community a
*  better place for everybody and make people happy and make sure people have food and make
*  sure people are loved and make sure people are in a war.
*  That's what we should do as a community.
*  You know that's what we should do.
*  All that other stuff is bullshit because if you don't have that you don't have anything
*  and you're going to feel you're going to feel really uncomfortable.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the thing.
*  That's the thing.
*  And these fucking labels whether it's liberal Republican you fucking cuck you know you
*  goddamn hippie all these different labels of people it's so easy to dismiss people with
*  these labels and they have such an agenda right and it plays on that part of the human
*  psyche that wants to be a part of a team and attack opposing ideas and it becomes a
*  fucking tribal thing.
*  It's so hard to sort out what's right and what's wrong you know but I think we're in
*  a weird space where there's no one at the wheel.
*  I think this is the first time there's no the government doesn't have a hold of wheels
*  and there's no mystery.
*  Yeah.
*  No no that's what's so scary.
*  It's all eroding before our eyes but no one's at the helm.
*  No one's got a hold of that goddamn battleship.
*  You know the parachips they have those handles on the wheel and you know strap yourself in
*  and shit.
*  No one's at that wheel.
*  That thing is just you know I'm going to I'm going to go out on a limb here and you said
*  this earlier and we laughed about it but like the thing is you know you said the word love
*  and like music and art and you know things that are cohesive in communal environments
*  and helping people come together like in terms of like feeling like like what what can I
*  contribute like fuck how can I help because this feels like an epidemic this this disbandment
*  you know amongst us and all this fear everybody's so scared I'm scared you know I am not scared.
*  I go in and out of it.
*  I go in and out of bring us back in right.
*  I don't know my my fear is fleeting you know it's things that are that feel a little
*  superficial at times but at the end of the day like this the love thing that the energy that
*  you know you you could make fun of me I don't give a fuck you know like the fact is like
*  we all need it you know we all want it and we all deserve it so what what are you going to do with
*  that you know like we can sit here and dissect politics and agendas and this guy and this guy
*  and socialism all this stuff but we all need to feel that thing and it is love and it's very very
*  very powerful and it comes in many forms and and has you know different hats and I think that
*  right now like like I'm sure that you feel it at a show right when you play music for people
*  you know I'm sure you feel it all the time you know with your podcast and with your shows
*  and with the outreach that you have and you know and forgive me I don't want to assume you know
*  and and I feel it in all the varying degrees of the shows that I play and things and like at the
*  end of the day this stuff it like where we're at is a scary place but there's like this thing
*  there's this like kind of one thing and it's it is the love thing and that has like a bunch of
*  different adjectives around it and verbs that are like recognizing each other and seeing each other
*  and saying hey we're different but we're the same and we're we're okay like let's keep moving you
*  know the thing that saves me from all this like deep depths of fear is that
*  that's it.
*  It is a weird world and people can tip left or right or that's a bad analogy people can tip good or bad one way or another depending upon how you approach them.
*  Sure.
*  And this is the thing that a lot of us get wrong you run into someone they're a dick you're a dick back it turns into a fight you're like oh that guy was a fucking dick.
*  But sometimes when someone's a dick and you're not a dick they stop being a dick.
*  We literally talked about this at the beginning of the podcast.
*  That's right that's right we did.
*  Where like will you diffuse a situation where energy gets heated and somebody's angry or you know
*  I don't know if I should retell the story but like you know you uh it's accountability too like you know when you mess up.
*  It's also presumptions right?
*  Sure.
*  You go into conversations with presumptions of how this guy feels about you like this fucking guy thinks I'm an idiot.
*  I know.
*  Well it's like a winner society it's like you have to be right but you know what it's a it's fucking okay to be wrong.
*  I fucking made a mistake I'm so sorry.
*  It's not just okay to be wrong it's a gift.
*  When you're wrong it's a gift because that humility that comes with being wrong is what really helps your education as a person.
*  Yes agree.
*  As a as a fucking girlfriend a boyfriend a lover a father a son you learn when you fuck up you learn you learn like god damn I was wrong.
*  Like yeah that's a valuable lesson because it's a humiliating lesson.
*  Well and you set yourself free too because there's a um there's some when you're hanging on to righteousness like this like
*  you know an ability to say that you were wrong.
*  Yep.
*  That is a fucking burden.
*  It's not just a burden it's it's a foolish pursuit like you should relish every opportunity to apologize and say you're wrong as a showing of strength.
*  Yeah.
*  Because if you think you're strong you think you're strong and you know you're wrong and you don't tell the truth well then you're a fool.
*  You're you're missing out on an opportunity for you to be strong for you to show that you're strong.
*  To show that you made a mistake.
*  I've made a lot of mistakes I make them all the time.
*  I'm a fucking dummy all right.
*  I do my best but ultimately at the end of the day there's a lot of dummy in there and I do my best.
*  But if I make a mistake I will fucking own the shit out of that mistake.
*  If you talk to me about it and you want to have a discussion about it I'm not one of those people that I don't think there's any value in pretending you didn't make a mistake.
*  I think there's a real societal misconception.
*  Like they don't know the people that did it didn't understand the rules that were written were written by people who really hadn't had a good grasp of the territory yet.
*  They didn't really understand what they were saying.
*  They should have taught people that in school.
*  They should have taught people like that in junior high school high school for sure.
*  They should have said your your failures those feelings that you feel like they teach you about history and math and those things are great.
*  There's nothing wrong with that but they should have taught us about how your failures are a very valuable fuel.
*  That feeling that you get when a girl dumps you or that feeling that you get when you crash your car or that feeling that you get when you fucking ruin something you say something wrong when something comes out of your mouth.
*  When you do anything you do wrong you flunk out of a class whatever the fuck it is that negative feeling is a boost.
*  It's supposed to take you into the next orbit.
*  It's supposed to blast you into the next level of understanding what you were doing wrong and how to improve in your life and how to go forward with better habits.
*  And if you don't experience that pain that feeling that embarrassment then you don't really know how valuable it is to stay on your grind.
*  And people say it all the time and it resonates with people just on your grind like yes yes.
*  But why do you think that it's not OK to be human.
*  Why do you think societally speaking we can't just be accountable and strong at the same time.
*  We're just nervous. It's not that we don't think.
*  But I mean like systemically like that is since the beginning.
*  Is that like the monkey brain in us that's like you have to be the alpha all that shit.
*  I've thought about this forever.
*  Fucking boggles my mind.
*  It's just because we're worried about people that are not pulling their weight when people are starving to death.
*  It's an ancient ancient instinct.
*  When they look if we barely had enough food to keep our babies alive and our friends alive and our parents alive barely had enough food and we saw someone slacking.
*  Holy shit.
*  Did you want to fucking kill them.
*  If you saw them someone that was sneaking food that was taking too much food or you saw someone that wasn't putting in their work and you were just slightly shy of being comfortable and you knew this fucking lazy motherfucker.
*  They just did their work.
*  We would all be fine but they don't do what we do.
*  They claim their foot hurt or they claim their back hurts.
*  They go back to the cave and everybody wants to kill them.
*  That's what the fuck that's for.
*  It's a resource balance relationship.
*  That's like the sort of aggression against like welfare people that need it and people that don't people that exploit it.
*  I get it exactly exactly.
*  Well let's call it's attaching ultimatums or ultimates rather like this is the ultimate truth to any sort of circumstance in a general sense to pretend that you have a million fucking.
*  Let's pretend you have a city of X amount of people you have a million people that are on some sort of assistance whether it's food stamps or welfare or whatever to pretend they're all one thing.
*  It's crazy to pretend it's all one story is crazy.
*  One set of circumstances once that's nuts.
*  That's nuts.
*  The question should be like look there's no billionaires are signing up for food stamps right.
*  There's no millionaires that are trying to get welfare money right.
*  So it's only when you're desperate.
*  So the question is like how do we engineer society so that even the most desperate people never hit that spot never hit a spot with a need assistance.
*  The most desperate people are always taken care of.
*  Well they don't have to worry about it.
*  And then what motivation is is just following your dreams doing what you enjoy doing whether it's a thing like playing music or writing books or whatever it is whatever it is finding that thing.
*  But that that motivation for doing that thing should be above all above the idea that you have to survive by doing some shitty job to make a living to pay for your bills and just rob you of your your your time and your resources.
*  It should be like hey fuckface recognize this you don't have a lot of resources.
*  OK.
*  All right.
*  Let's just pretend you don't you don't need a job.
*  We're going to give you the money.
*  You don't need a job.
*  But understand this motherfucker you give it a gift.
*  You give it a gift that Beethoven never had.
*  Hendricks never had.
*  Nobody had it.
*  You got you got money enough to live.
*  Now go but understand you got if you're lucky you live 80 years everything over there is like tomorrow.
*  Every time you sneeze you're worried you're going to die.
*  Yeah we just have to look at the way we distribute money as being like we think about it right now as being this is the way we've always done it this way we're going to do it.
*  But money didn't even exist.
*  Right.
*  Shit is only this shit is really recent.
*  It doesn't mean we're doing it right.
*  We shouldn't have tents filled with homeless people.
*  That's fucking gross.
*  We should have people shitting in the street in San Francisco.
*  That's fucking gross.
*  If you guys have to pay more money to make sure there's health care for a bunch of homeless people with mental illness that are shitting all over your streets you should definitely spend that money because you're not going to fix it.
*  But a bunch of dudes squeegees and fucking power hoses out there.
*  Where's that shit going.
*  We know you know what they do is I was just up there.
*  You know what they do is they they give those people a little bit of money and a bus ticket to like Salt Lake City or something or Austin Texas or Austin.
*  They do that.
*  Yeah and then they drop them off and they say you got a motel for 30 days and then get them the fuck out and then make them somebody else.
*  Oh fuck yeah.
*  And they make it somebody else's problem.
*  We tried to trace that right.
*  It's gross.
*  We found that there's been all over the country they ship them to different places.
*  Yeah they had a huge thing in Orange County.
*  There was like like almost like a mile long tent city and they got them out.
*  I don't know where they sent them.
*  You know what that's like.
*  It's like the human equivalent of throwing a cigarette out the window on the highway.
*  Someone's going to figure it out.
*  It's terrible.
*  It's terrible.
*  What are we going to do guys.
*  What the fuck are we going to do.
*  Suzanne I think you figured out a lot of things.
*  You're selling yourself short.
*  Yes.
*  Amazing revelations during this show and they've all been documented.
*  Shit.
*  Yeah but I think the more I mean it's going to sound ridiculous but I think the more
*  conversations people have like this we try to figure out what's going on.
*  Yeah try to concentrate on what do we need to do to make that I agree 100 percent.
*  I think that's real.
*  Wake up and walk out of the house.
*  Understanding your what's your intention.
*  I think it goes back to that.
*  But I think what you were talking about with you know coming up levels and different upbringings
*  and this and that it's a factor and so it's not that easy.
*  It's not that easy.
*  Yeah well learn about people that are different from you.
*  You know I think that a lot of folks ignorance is something to recover from.
*  You know you if you don't know if you haven't if you're you know a religious type and you
*  have an opinion about gay people but you've never met a gay person in your life and what
*  it's like to be gay and why you know it's like you think it's a choice or whatever you
*  think you know until you have it you can't really have an opinion until you actually
*  sit across from somebody and look them in the eye and talk to them.
*  You know I think that's that's where a lot of this you know discord comes in in terms
*  of we're all different and we are but we're not you know I don't know how I don't want
*  to go there but we're there.
*  Well what we're different about is the things that are superficial.
*  Yes thank you.
*  Yeah well we're not different about is what we are we're human beings whether we have weird
*  accents or styles or hobbies or musical colors all that stuff.
*  Whatever we're interested in whatever whether it's the way we like to dress or the style that
*  we like to eat or the places we like to live or all those things are interesting but what we really
*  are that that core whatever the fuck you are at the center that's a human being.
*  Yes that's what's real that's what's real and when you love people and they love you and you love
*  each other back you all recognize that that thing that human being thing is the same it's the same
*  it's the same in your children it's the same in your mother it's the same in your neighbor it's
*  the same in everybody yeah it's the same it's it's love it's like us and we don't you know the only
*  time that people lash out is when someone lashed out against them and it all gets terrible and
*  cock-eyed and twisted but what we are is the same we're all the same going through this weird
*  strange existence it's almost like some crazy game that's being played out simulation no one
*  knows but why well even if it's not a simulation it is this is what people need to understand
*  even if it's not it still is even if it's not even if this is real it's still a simulation you
*  were a fucking nothing 14 billion years ago you were a part of a head of a pin and you exploded
*  and the only reason why you're going big bane yes the only reason why your body your fucking
*  human body even exists because of frost is unexploded nuclear rubble yeah we are i know
