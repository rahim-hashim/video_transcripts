*  Yeah. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=167.0s)]
*  I know they don't give a fuck about history. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=169.0s)]
*  It was the time. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=171.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=173.0s)]

*  She played a 200 year old flute. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=177.0s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=179.0s)]

*  Yeah, I guess I don't give a fuck about it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=185.0s)]
*  I have zero problem with that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=187.0s)]
*  She wasn't playing it recklessly. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=189.0s)]
*  She was just twerking about it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=191.0s)]
*  Which is fine. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=193.0s)]
*  Imagine the street cred you would get if you spiked it and said, fuck white supremacy. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=195.0s)]
*  That would kill. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=201.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=203.0s)]
*  That would be the most polarizing moment in human history. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=205.0s)]
*  That would be big. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=207.0s)]
*  I'd be like, wow. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=209.0s)]
*  For the record, I take back my opinion from one minute ago. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=211.0s)]
*  I get the thing that does suck about it though is them covering it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=215.0s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=219.0s)]
*  They're covering it because they want you to be mad. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=221.0s)]
*  She might have been doing it because like, oh, I'm playing one of the presidents. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=223.0s)]
*  The Smithsonian was like, you play the flute. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=227.0s)]
*  You're a major performer. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=231.0s)]
*  We want you to play the flute. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=233.0s)]
*  So she did it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=235.0s)]
*  But all she did was wiggle her butt a little. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=237.0s)]
*  Is that the biggest problem we have? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=239.0s)]
*  What, there's fucking drone bombings in Yemen. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=241.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=243.0s)]
*  And like, what? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=245.0s)]
*  Who gives a fuck? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=247.0s)]
*  She did what she does. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=249.0s)]
*  First of all, she did it in her underwear. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=251.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=253.0s)]
*  Look how she's dressed. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=255.0s)]
*  Go back to that please. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=257.0s)]
*  Is the wiggling of the buttocks? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=259.0s)]
*  I take it back. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=261.0s)]
*  Imagine if they approved that costume. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=263.0s)]
*  So they approve this costume. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=267.0s)]
*  I take it all back. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=269.0s)]
*  She's going to run for Senate. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=271.0s)]
*  Nah, I'm back. I hate it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=273.0s)]
*  We're all over the place with this. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=275.0s)]
*  Can I hear how good she played it? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=277.0s)]
*  She's a good flautist. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=279.0s)]
*  She is. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=281.0s)]
*  Flauta. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=283.0s)]
*  She does love flute. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=285.0s)]
*  Keep that in mind. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=287.0s)]
*  It would be funny if they were like, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=289.0s)]
*  this is actually a Native American flute. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=291.0s)]
*  This is her instrument. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=293.0s)]
*  I take it all back. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=295.0s)]
*  Now I take it back. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=297.0s)]
*  I like what she did. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=299.0s)]
*  I think it actually rules. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=301.0s)]
*  Her one instrument is the flute. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=303.0s)]
*  And she's like, I'm playing a president's my instrument. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=305.0s)]
*  So she fucking moved her body a little bit. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=307.0s)]
*  That's fine. I agree with that. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=309.0s)]
*  Joe. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=311.0s)]
*  What does it say? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=313.0s)]
*  Stop making me the bad guy. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=315.0s)]
*  What is the problem with Lizzo? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=317.0s)]
*  The problem people are having with Lizzo [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=319.0s)]
*  has nothing to do with the flute or his flute. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=321.0s)]
*  It has everything to do with the fact that she's a black woman [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=323.0s)]
*  playing the flute that belonged to a slave owner. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=325.0s)]
*  Oh shit, Rex. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=327.0s)]
*  Dude, what a big downer. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=329.0s)]
*  Can you write any positive stories? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=331.0s)]
*  Here's my take. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=333.0s)]
*  If you're getting mad at Lizzo, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=335.0s)]
*  if you're a right-wing conservative person [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=337.0s)]
*  and you get mad at Lizzo playing the flute like that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=339.0s)]
*  That's left-wing. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=341.0s)]
*  The left-wing people are mad at her? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=343.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=345.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=347.0s)]
*  The right-wing people are mad that she played that. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=349.0s)]
*  And this is why. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=351.0s)]
*  Because she's a... [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=353.0s)]
*  Listen, he's saying that the right-wing people are mad. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=355.0s)]
*  He's saying the right-wing people are mad [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=357.0s)]
*  because she's playing the flute of a slave owner? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=359.0s)]
*  Exactly. That's what he's saying. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=361.0s)]
*  No. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=363.0s)]
*  She's playing the instrument of the enemy? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=365.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=367.0s)]
*  You could go that way too. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=369.0s)]
*  Because the right-wing people are mad [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=371.0s)]
*  that she is being disrespectful. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=373.0s)]
*  The angel again. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=375.0s)]
*  The right-wing people are being mad. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=377.0s)]
*  Angel salad. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=379.0s)]
*  No. The Jews killed Jesus and an angel. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=381.0s)]
*  The right-wing people are mad [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=383.0s)]
*  because Lizzo is supposedly being disrespectful [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=385.0s)]
*  to a historical flute. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=389.0s)]
*  But clearly she's not being disrespectful at all. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=391.0s)]
*  In fact... [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=393.0s)]
*  She's loving the flute. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=395.0s)]
*  She's playing the flute. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=397.0s)]
*  She's holding it very carefully. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=399.0s)]
*  She's playing it well. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=401.0s)]
*  It's got to be left-wing people mad. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=403.0s)]
*  No, it's right-wing people. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=405.0s)]
*  But she's being Lizzo while she's doing it. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=407.0s)]
*  If you're going to hire Lizzo to do it... [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=409.0s)]
*  What do you want her to do? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=411.0s)]
*  She's going to do what Lizzo does. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=413.0s)]
*  It's like Corzine at the National Anthem. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=415.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=417.0s)]
*  Lizzo! Lizzo! Lizzo! [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=419.0s)]

*  I stand behind her. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=427.0s)]
*  You just can't see me. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=429.0s)]
*  Minnesota Viking. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=431.0s)]

*  This is a good song. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=461.0s)]
*  Crazy that her backup dancers are mad at her. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=463.0s)]
*  She's fun. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=465.0s)]
*  She's having fun. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=467.0s)]
*  That's always how it works. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=469.0s)]

*  No. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=547.0s)]
*  I highly doubt she'd be interested in that. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=549.0s)]
*  I think she would. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=551.0s)]

*  Like it's not like it was her idea. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=571.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=573.0s)]
*  But that was the thing. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=575.0s)]
*  They were saying it was fucking liberal ass. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=577.0s)]

*  they think it's nothing. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=6325.08s)]

*  you can talk about almost anything. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=6337.08s)]
*  It's a numbers thing. You have to be closer enough [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=6341.08s)]
*  to that frequency when you connect with the whole crowd [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=6345.08s)]

*  They know this is a good faith show. You're trying to find out what's funny. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=6357.08s)]
*  You're not terrified. You're engaged. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=6361.08s)]
*  And you're all locked in together. But that's why it's a numbers thing too. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=6365.08s)]
*  You can't do that with more than 400 people. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=6369.08s)]
*  400, 500, 600. It's too many people. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deK4KCn2hbI&t=6373.08s)]
