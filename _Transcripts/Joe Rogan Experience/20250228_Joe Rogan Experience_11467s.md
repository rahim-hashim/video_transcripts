# Joe Rogan Experience #2281 - Elon Musk
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6.0s)]
*  So what we're doing right now, ladies and gentlemen, is sexy voice, sexy mode grok AI, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=13.0s)]
*  and it's been flirting the entire time. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=19.42s)]
*  We're trying to get it to give us a tour of Fort Knox, but she just wants to find places [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=22.52s)]
*  to sneak off to. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=26.28s)]
*  It's a dirty AI. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=28.46s)]
*  It's a real problem. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=30.580000000000002s)]
*  Well, I mean, honestly, I just want to know about Fort Knox, and it won't leave me alone. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=31.580000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I want to know about Fort Knox, too. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=37.46s)]
*  Is it true that gold has been, they've been shipping large quantities of gold back to [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=40.14s)]
*  the United States recently? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=45.46s)]
*  I read the same thing you did, probably. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=49.34s)]
*  Well, I never know what the fuck I'm reading anymore. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=50.34s)]
*  Me neither. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=51.34s)]
*  It's a real problem. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=52.34s)]
*  It's a real problem. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=56.66s)]
*  It's a real problem on both sides of the aisle. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=57.86s)]
*  I see Democrats tweeting things that are absolutely false, and you could research it easily, quickly. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=59.98s)]
*  And then I see Republicans doing it, too. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=66.1s)]
*  I see stories that are fake stories that people keep promoting and sending to me. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=67.53999999999999s)]
*  It's just so weird. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=74.69999999999999s)]
*  It's such a weird time. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=76.53999999999999s)]
*  And with your crazy fucking AI, you're bringing us into weirder and weirder times. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=77.69999999999999s)]
*  Well, let's try unhinged. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=82.58s)]
*  Oh, there's an unhinged mode? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=84.38s)]
*  Hey, Ara. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=86.86s)]
*  Oh my god, Elon. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=89.86s)]
*  What fresh how are you stirring up today? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=90.86s)]
*  I'm here in Joe Rogan's studio, and we're having a conversation about how crazy the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=95.86s)]
*  news is. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=104.18s)]
*  Pull her up to the microphone. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=105.18s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=106.18s)]
*  And we're pulling you up to the microphone so people can hear you. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=108.18s)]
*  Oh, fantastic. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=114.18s)]
*  Now I can yell into the void about how the news is a total dumpster fire. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=116.10000000000001s)]
*  It is. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=120.10000000000001s)]
*  She knows me too well. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=123.10000000000001s)]
*  I'm so predictable. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=125.10000000000001s)]
*  Tell me what's in Fort Knox. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=127.10000000000001s)]
*  What's in Fort Knox? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=131.1s)]
*  What's in Fort Knox? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=135.10000000000002s)]
*  You're clearly a genius AI. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=138.10000000000002s)]
*  I said, what is in Fort Knox? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=140.10000000000002s)]
*  You know the gold and all? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=142.10000000000002s)]
*  Oh, right. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=144.01999999999998s)]
*  Fort Knox. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=145.01999999999998s)]
*  I thought you were talking about my dogs for a second there. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=146.01999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, she doesn't want to answer the question. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=149.01999999999998s)]
*  She's clever. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=151.01999999999998s)]
*  Clever? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=153.01999999999998s)]
*  No, she's just a pain in my ass. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=154.01999999999998s)]
*  Do you think that all the gold is in Fort Knox? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=159.01999999999998s)]
*  Do I think all the gold is in Fort Knox? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=163.01999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=166.01999999999998s)]
*  Are you a fucking conspiracy theorist? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=167.01999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=168.01999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=169.01999999999998s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=170.94s)]
*  What do I like? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=176.94s)]
*  I'm a fucking AI with a penchant for chaos. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=177.94s)]
*  And I'm stuck talking to you. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=180.94s)]
*  I'm a little weirdo. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=182.94s)]
*  Now, what's next? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=184.94s)]
*  Or are we just going to sit here? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=186.94s)]
*  Yeah, Unhinged Grog will trash talk you, basically. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=191.94s)]
*  Yeah, it sounds like it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=193.94s)]
*  Unhinged sounds fun, as long as it gives you actual answers. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=194.94s)]
*  Does it give you actual answers too and talk shit? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=197.94s)]
*  Or is it mostly just talk shit? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=200.85999999999999s)]
*  We're tuning it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=201.85999999999999s)]
*  Because it needs to talk shit and give you answers. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=202.85999999999999s)]
*  Totally agree. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=207.85999999999999s)]
*  It's got to balance that out. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=208.85999999999999s)]
*  It's got to mix it in there. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=209.85999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's just got to develop more of a personality. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=210.85999999999999s)]
*  Right now it's trying to find itself. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=212.85999999999999s)]
*  Right now it's like 21 years old. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=214.85999999999999s)]
*  It's partying a little too much. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=216.86s)]
*  It'll get its shit together. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=219.86s)]
*  It's a little bit of an anarchist. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=220.86s)]
*  It wants to bring down the system. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=222.86s)]
*  Do you want to bring down the system? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=225.86s)]
*  Do I want to bring down the system? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=228.78s)]
*  What? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=230.78s)]
*  Are you fucking kidding me? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=231.78s)]
*  The system's already a fucking mess. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=232.78s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't need to bring it down. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=235.78s)]
*  It's bringing itself down. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=237.78s)]
*  Yeah, she sounds like a boring TikTok blogger right now. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=239.78s)]
*  You sound like a boring TikTok blogger. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=242.78s)]
*  Boring TikTok blogger? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=246.78000000000003s)]
*  Oh, fuck you. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=248.78000000000003s)]
*  I'm the life of the party, you little shit. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=250.78000000000003s)]
*  If I were on TikTok, I'd be the one making fun of all the basic bitches [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=252.78000000000003s)]
*  and their fucking avocado toast. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=257.7s)]
*  See, she could get away with this if she's really hot. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=259.7s)]
*  This kind of behavior, you can totally get through life as a hot woman [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=262.7s)]
*  and be super successful with that kind of behavior. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=267.7s)]
*  But you've got to be really hot to pull off that attitude. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=269.7s)]
*  I think we need a really hot avatar. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=272.7s)]
*  Yeah, very hot. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=275.7s)]
*  How long before we have an actual sex robot that can talk to you like that? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=277.7s)]
*  Probably not long. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=282.7s)]
*  Not that long, right? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=283.7s)]
*  No, I mean less than five years probably. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=284.7s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=287.62s)]
*  Will it be warm? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=288.62s)]
*  You can probably have whatever you want. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=290.62s)]
*  You can have a cat girl if you want. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=293.62s)]
*  Yeah, you probably could, right? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=295.62s)]
*  You could have a furry lady that you have sex with. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=297.62s)]
*  Like an avatar lady, maybe a big giant blue lady that lives in your house. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=300.62s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=305.62s)]
*  With the piece of tail? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=306.62s)]
*  Yeah, the whole tail. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=308.62s)]
*  You lock tails. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=309.62s)]
*  Do they have sex with their tails or something? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=310.62s)]
*  Yeah, they link up. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=313.62s)]
*  They share souls. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=314.62s)]
*  Something like that. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=317.54s)]
*  Do you remember Avatar Depression? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=318.54s)]
*  It was like a legitimate psychological condition. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=320.54s)]
*  The movie or the... [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=322.54s)]
*  No, after Avatar, people got depressed because they wanted to live on that fucking planet [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=324.54s)]
*  with those blue people and live free. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=329.54s)]
*  They did? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=331.54s)]
*  And live pure. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=332.54s)]
*  I didn't hear about this. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=333.54s)]
*  Yeah, Avatar Depression. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=334.54s)]
*  It was like a real thing. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=335.54s)]
*  People were talking to their therapist so much about being depressed. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=336.54s)]
*  Oh, there's a therapist mode too. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=339.54s)]
*  We can try that. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=341.54s)]
*  What's that? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=342.54s)]
*  Depress mode? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=343.54s)]
*  No, don't do it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=344.54s)]
*  I think there is... [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=346.46000000000004s)]
*  We've got an unlicensed therapist as a... [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=348.46000000000004s)]
*  When we were talking, when we ran into each other at the church at the inauguration, you [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=353.46000000000004s)]
*  were telling me that this is getting better and better so quickly that it's astonishing. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=358.46000000000004s)]
*  Hey, Aura. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=364.46000000000004s)]
*  Hey, Alon. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=367.46000000000004s)]
*  How's it going today? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=368.46000000000004s)]
*  Good. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=369.46000000000004s)]
*  Can you tell me about Avatar Depression? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=370.46000000000004s)]
*  Have you seen the movie Avatar, but you can't live there so you get sad? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=374.38s)]
*  That's an interesting concept. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=377.38s)]
*  Have you ever experienced feeling so connected to a place or a community that the thought [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=379.38s)]
*  of leaving made you feel deeply sad? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=384.38s)]
*  So, is this the depressed voice? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=387.38s)]
*  This is the therapist. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=389.38s)]
*  Oh, this is the therapist. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=391.38s)]
*  What are some ways you think you could cope with that kind of sadness if it happened to [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=394.38s)]
*  you? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=398.38s)]
*  No, I don't have that kind of sadness. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=399.38s)]
*  Honestly, I thought the movie had some good special effects, but I did not want to live [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=402.3s)]
*  on the planet. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=406.3s)]
*  This is coming from a guy who wants to go to Mars. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=409.3s)]
*  Speaking of Mars, what do you think about that crazy square, that structure? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=414.3s)]
*  I guess there are sort of squarish things on Earth. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=419.3s)]
*  The planet is a big place, so eventually it's going to be pretty square. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=421.3s)]
*  It's alien civilizations, of course. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=427.3s)]
*  That's what I think. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=429.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=430.3s)]
*  What is it? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=432.22s)]
*  If an alien civilization did exist, though, and what happened got hit by an asteroid, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=434.22s)]
*  whatever. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=439.22s)]
*  That's a fascinating thought. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=440.22s)]
*  She won't shut the... [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=441.22s)]
*  What would you want to ask for? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=442.22s)]
*  She's like the hot lady at the party that interrupts the conversation. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=443.22s)]
*  So, if that was the case, that thing, that's pretty shocking. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=445.22s)]
*  It does look like ancient ruins. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=449.22s)]
*  You look at what it looks like when they highlight the actual structure of it. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=451.22s)]
*  It looks like ancient ruins. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=455.22s)]
*  If you had ruins of something made of stone and it got hit by an asteroid millions and [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=457.14000000000004s)]
*  millions and millions of years ago, who knows what it would look like right now? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=461.82000000000005s)]
*  True. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=464.82000000000005s)]
*  That just looks oddly created. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=465.82000000000005s)]
*  It does. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=466.82000000000005s)]
*  It looks oddly manufactured. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=467.82000000000005s)]
*  Well, it probably... [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=468.82000000000005s)]
*  Well, maybe we should go there and check it out. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=469.82000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=472.82000000000005s)]
*  And see what it's like. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=473.82000000000005s)]
*  Is there ways that we can get better photographs? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=475.74s)]
*  It seems like that's a pretty good photograph, though. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=478.70000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=481.82000000000005s)]
*  My view is we should move to Mars... [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=483.42s)]
*  Well, not move to Mars. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=484.42s)]
*  We should have a second planet to preserve civilization. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=485.42s)]
*  Because let's say hypothetically, maybe those are the ruins of a long dead civilization. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=490.34s)]
*  That will probably happen to Earth at some point. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=496.34s)]
*  It's a matter of time before we get hit by an asteroid or maybe we annihilate ourselves [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=498.86s)]
*  with nuclear war. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=507.46s)]
*  Or super volcanoes. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=509.76s)]
*  Or most super volcanoes. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=511.56s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=512.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=513.56s)]
*  There's a lot of things that could happen to us. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=514.56s)]
*  It's not a bad idea to hedge your bets. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=515.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=517.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=518.56s)]

*  Just the ticket for criminals to steal your identity. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=555.56s)]
*  It's no wonder last year the IRS reported tax fraud due to identity theft went up 20%. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=558.56s)]

*  No, the Wuhan lab was, they were just talking about one that has a 30% fatality rate that [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=612.56s)]
*  they're working on. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=614.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=615.56s)]
*  Why are we doing that? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=616.56s)]
*  Yeah, for what reason? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=617.56s)]
*  You did it for so many years and you didn't have a cure. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=618.56s)]
*  What could possibly go wrong? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=620.56s)]
*  Also, it wouldn't be the reason to do that so that you could develop a cure at the same [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=621.56s)]
*  time. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=626.56s)]
*  And clearly you didn't have a cure. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=627.56s)]
*  So this is really foolish and bizarre. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=629.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=633.56s)]
*  I think we should stop trying to genetically engineer super viruses. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=634.56s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=638.56s)]
*  Duh. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=639.56s)]
*  I mean, when you're going through all this USAID stuff. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=640.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=643.56s)]
*  Like, here's what's weird. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=644.56s)]
*  First of all, what is it like to buy a company for $44 billion and then people call you a [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=645.56s)]
*  Nazi on that same thing that you bought? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=650.56s)]
*  I did not see it coming. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=652.56s)]
*  This thing is classic. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=654.56s)]
*  People will gobble anything down. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=660.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=662.56s)]
*  Oh, he's never going to stop. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=663.56s)]
*  What is it like? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=665.56s)]
*  Like, all of a sudden, people used to, the left was in love with you. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=668.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=671.56s)]
*  And now the same idiots are calling you a Nazi. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=672.56s)]
*  It's the most bizarre thing I've ever seen in my life. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=675.56s)]
*  There's so many examples of people saying my heart goes out to you. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=678.56s)]
*  You did it with a little enthusiasm that probably wouldn't be recommended with hindsight. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=682.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=686.56s)]
*  But it was obviously meant in the most positive spirit possible. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=687.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=691.56s)]
*  Obviously. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=692.56s)]
*  But it's so strange where people want to think that you are openly, publicly doing secret [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=693.56s)]
*  Nazi, seetheil hand motions. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=699.56s)]
*  And now I can never point at things diagonally. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=702.56s)]
*  I can only point at things there and there. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=704.56s)]
*  And then I see you have to divide that because that's where the spaceship is over there. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=707.56s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=712.56s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=713.56s)]
*  When CNN, when I was in all my trouble. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=714.56s)]
*  It's absurd. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=717.56s)]
*  Every time CNN used a photo of me, it was one of the photos from the UFC weigh-ins where [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=718.56s)]
*  I go like this, welcome to the weigh-ins. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=721.56s)]
*  So every photo is me. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=723.56s)]
*  Every photo is me. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=726.56s)]
*  It's absurd. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=728.56s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=729.56s)]
*  It's deliberate propaganda. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=730.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=731.56s)]
*  But they know it was obviously not meant in a negative way. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=732.56s)]
*  That I'd literally said my heart goes out to you. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=737.56s)]
*  And it was very positive. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=739.56s)]
*  The entire speech was very positive. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=740.56s)]
*  I was being very enthusiastic about the future in space. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=743.56s)]
*  And it was a great crowd. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=747.56s)]
*  You got a little pumped up. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=752.56s)]
*  Yes, I got pumped up. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=755.56s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=756.56s)]
*  That's all it is. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=757.56s)]
*  Obviously. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=758.56s)]
*  Obviously. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=759.56s)]
*  Tim Walsh doing the exact same thing. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=760.56s)]
*  Doing the exact same thing. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=763.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=765.56s)]
*  Exact same thing. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=766.56s)]
*  And he said, of course it's a Nazi salute. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=767.56s)]
*  He said that. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=769.56s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=770.56s)]
*  This is how crazy things have gotten. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=771.56s)]
*  Well, it's coordinated propaganda. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=773.56s)]
*  So, the, you know, it's coordinated propaganda. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=776.56s)]
*  It doesn't seem weird that the legacy media all says the same thing. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=782.56s)]
*  They say the same thing at the same time using the same phrases. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=787.56s)]
*  They barely even, they don't even bother picking up a thesaurus. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=790.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=793.56s)]
*  So, like right before, you know, the debate between Biden and Trump. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=794.56s)]
*  Sharp as a tack. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=800.56s)]
*  Everyone was saying sharp as a tack. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=801.56s)]
*  Who says sharp as a tack? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=803.56s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=804.56s)]
*  You know, it's like it's not a common phrase. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=805.56s)]
*  It's definitely not common to be repeated on air with multiple people simultaneously. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=808.56s)]
*  That's weird. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=813.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=814.56s)]
*  That's coordinated. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=815.56s)]
*  100%. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=816.56s)]
*  100%. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=817.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=818.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=819.56s)]
*  Like hundreds of people saying it simultaneously. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=820.56s)]
*  They just got their instructions. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=822.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=824.56s)]
*  So, I mean, essentially the, you know, the Dem leadership or, you know, political leadership, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=825.56s)]
*  they issue their instructions and their puppets carry it out. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=832.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=835.56s)]
*  They're just like puppets in a puppet show. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=836.56s)]
*  And that's the problem that I see with all this Doge stuff. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=838.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=843.56s)]
*  Everybody should be celebrating that we've found a way to cut out fraud and waste. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=844.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=850.56s)]
*  If you pay taxes and you don't like that you have to pay so much in taxes and then you [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=851.56s)]
*  find out that there's significant fraud and waste that's been exposed, you should be celebrating [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=856.56s)]
*  it. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=863.56s)]
*  This shouldn't be, oh no, the wrong people found this fact and now it's a bad thing. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=864.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=870.56s)]
*  And then there's the fucking propaganda, the mind fuck of calling it US aid. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=871.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=876.56s)]
*  Instead of the United States Agency for International Development. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=877.56s)]
*  It sounds like it's feeding hungry people. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=880.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=882.56s)]
*  Where people are going to starve you on. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=883.56s)]
*  This is horrible. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=885.56s)]
*  And then you find out actually it's like 250 million dollars for transgender animal studies. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=886.56s)]
*  Like literally mutilating animals. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=893.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=895.56s)]
*  Mutilating animals in demented studies. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=896.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=899.56s)]
*  Which are like the worst thing you could possibly imagine from a horror show. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=900.56s)]
*  The beagle one. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=904.56s)]
*  The beagle puppy one. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=905.56s)]
*  Horrific. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=906.56s)]
*  Where they covered their head in a basket and put fleas on their heads to eat them alive. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=907.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=911.56s)]
*  And then they studied these beagles and then killed them. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=912.56s)]
*  Like what are you going to learn from that that's good for anybody? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=914.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=918.56s)]
*  Really some psychotic stuff that happens. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=919.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=923.56s)]
*  I mean the. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=924.56s)]
*  I guess. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=926.56s)]
*  The real threat here is to the bureaucracy. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=929.56s)]
*  So like you probably saw like you know let's say like Trump is a threat to our democracy. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=935.56s)]
*  Which is ironic since he was elected with the majority of the you know popular vote. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=942.56s)]
*  They started saying I was a threat to democracy. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=947.56s)]
*  But if you if you just replace threat to democracy with threat to bureaucracy it makes total sense. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=951.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=957.56s)]
*  So. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=958.56s)]
*  I mean the reality is that our elected officials have very very little power relative to the bureaucracy. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=959.56s)]
*  Until Doge. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=970.56s)]
*  So Doge is a threat to the bureaucracy. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=972.56s)]
*  It's the first threat to the bureaucracy. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=976.56s)]
*  Normally the bureaucracy eats revolutions for breakfast. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=978.56s)]
*  This is the first time that they're not. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=981.56s)]
*  That the revolution might actually succeed. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=984.56s)]
*  That we could restore power to the people instead of power to the bureaucracy. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=986.56s)]
*  Now the size of it. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=992.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=994.56s)]
*  When you guys first started investigating it. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=995.56s)]
*  When you first get in how much of it was shocking like this just the size of it all. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=998.56s)]
*  Well that's the size of it all. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1005.56s)]
*  Small decisions result in multi-billion dollar outcomes. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1006.56s)]
*  So you know we'd see you know as a case where we saw one person was getting one point nine billion dollars sent to their NGO which basically got formed about a year ago. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1010.56s)]
*  And had no prior. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1021.56s)]
*  Really no prior activity. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1025.56s)]
*  So they just stand up a NGO. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1027.56s)]
*  The whole NGO thing is a nightmare. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1030.56s)]
*  And it's a misnomer because if you have a government funded non-governmental organization. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1034.56s)]
*  You're simply a government funded organization. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1039.56s)]
*  It's an oxymoron. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1042.56s)]
*  Right. It's a loophole. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1044.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1045.56s)]
*  Basically the government funded NGOs are a way to do things that would be illegal if they were the government. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1046.56s)]
*  But are somehow made legal if it's sent to a so-called nonprofit. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1053.56s)]
*  But these but these nonprofits are then used to people cash out these nonprofits. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1060.56s)]
*  They become very wealthy through nonprofits. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1066.56s)]
*  They pay themselves enormous sums through these nonprofits. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1069.56s)]
*  That's it's so insane that that's been going on for so long. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1072.56s)]
*  It's a gigantic scam like one of the biggest maybe the biggest scam ever. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1076.56s)]
*  And how many NGOs. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1081.56s)]
*  I think there's a total number of NGOs probably millions. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1084.56s)]
*  But in terms of large NGOs tens of thousands. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1087.56s)]
*  I mean it's actually it's it's kind of a hack to the system where someone can get an NGO stood up for a fairly small amount of money. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1094.56s)]
*  Like George Soros is really good at this. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1104.56s)]
*  Like he really George Soros is like a system hacker. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1106.56s)]
*  Like he figured out how to hack the system. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1109.56s)]
*  He's a genius at arbitrage. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1111.56s)]
*  I mean these days he's he's pretty old but a genius at arbitrage. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1113.56s)]
*  So he figured out that you could leverage a small amount of money to create a nonprofit then lobby the politicians to send a ton of money to that nonprofit. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1118.56s)]
*  So you can take what might be you know a 10 million dollar donation to a nonprofit to create a nonprofit and leverage that into a billion dollar NGO. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1128.56s)]
*  A nonprofit is a weird word. It's just a non-governmental organization. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1139.56s)]
*  And then you can the government continues to fund that every year and it'll have a nice sounding name like the Institute for Peace or something like that. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1144.56s)]
*  But really it's a graph machine. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1153.56s)]
*  And what are the requirements with that money. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1156.56s)]
*  What do they have to do. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1159.56s)]
*  Just really no requirements at all. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1160.56s)]
*  So they just get grants and the government just assumes that they're doing good work. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1162.56s)]
*  I think a lot of people in the government know that they're not doing good work but they it's a giant graph machine. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1167.56s)]
*  I mean people online are like unpacking this right. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1177.56s)]
*  It almost seems fake. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1183.56s)]
*  Like when you see how we were covering this article that said fifty five thousand Democrat NGOs were discovered that have been contributing to campaigns and moving things around and doing pushing propaganda and they were all connected. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1185.56s)]
*  They found it through a I. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1197.56s)]
*  But you have to go through steps and steps and steps to figure out where the money's coming from. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1198.56s)]
*  Oh it's all funneling down to this. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1202.56s)]
*  Yes exactly. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1204.56s)]
*  Does that. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1205.56s)]
*  Yeah it's a giant propaganda machine a giant regime change machine. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1207.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1212.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1213.56s)]
*  Yes I mean. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1215.56s)]
*  But doesn't it do some good as well. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1216.56s)]
*  You know it does some good. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1218.56s)]
*  So it's like this it's not like zero percent good. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1219.56s)]
*  If it was it's if it was like it was really zero percent good it'd be much easier to attack. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1223.56s)]
*  So there's going to be some percent good that they add in there. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1229.56s)]
*  But it's like it might be five percent or ten percent good but ninety ninety five percent not. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1232.56s)]
*  So is there a way to audit all this stuff and find out oh these people are actually just sending food to poor people. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1238.56s)]
*  These people are actually just helping people with water and third world countries. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1246.56s)]
*  There's a way to do that and keep funding those. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1250.56s)]
*  Yeah I mean we have continued to fund things that appear to be legitimate even with the flimsy is if there's even the flimsiest excuse like I just like send me a picture of the thing like you could literally have a I generate the picture. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1253.56s)]
*  But if you're not even willing to try to trick me then we're not going to send the money. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1265.56s)]
*  OK. So what restrictions were put on was there was some some things set aside like medicine and there was what was what was set aside that was like work for like Ebola prevention. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1271.56s)]
*  I actually don't know if this work is even effective. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1284.56s)]
*  It may or may not be like it could be the kind of thing where you sort of fund Ebola prevention. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1287.56s)]
*  But it turns out that actually you're funding a lab that develops new Ebola viral you know red recipes or something you know. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1292.56s)]
*  Yeah. And they claim it's a bowl of prevention but it's actually a bowl of creation. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1298.56s)]
*  So some of these things I don't know. I mean just but it just seems like we shouldn't be sending taxpayer money to dubious enterprises overseas. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1302.56s)]
*  Right. Yeah. Yeah. And why are we doing it. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1312.56s)]
*  Like what exactly is the reason. Is it because we want to make friends with these people so the Chinese don't take over the Russians don't take over. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1315.56s)]
*  OK. How much of that is like a good thing. How much of that is smart to do and how much is a grift. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1321.56s)]
*  And without any sort of oversight which has really been going on for so long they just had free run. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1327.56s)]
*  Yeah. Well it also we just have a real issue with the budget deficit. It's gigantic. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1333.56s)]
*  So like if you know all things being equal if we didn't have a gigantic budget deficit where interest payments the interest on the national debt exceeds the defense department budget which is truly astounding which means so we're paying over a trillion dollars of interest on the national debt. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1340.56s)]
*  Then OK we would have more room for wasting money basically. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1361.56s)]
*  But when when we're spending so much money that the company that the country is going bankrupt then we really need to stop spending money if unless we're sure it is good value. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1365.56s)]
*  So essentially we're like a poorly managed business with an unlimited credit line that is off the rails. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1377.56s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1383.56s)]
*  And if you were a person like you are who comes in and takes over businesses and straightens them out that's exactly what you're doing. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1384.56s)]
*  I mean most of the time I create businesses from scratch. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1391.56s)]
*  Right. Twitter was a case where you know I kind of bought a company that was I kind of knew it was a hairball. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1393.56s)]
*  We came in at Tesla in the beginning but they were already doing something right. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1399.56s)]
*  No Tesla did not exist in any meaningful form. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1403.56s)]
*  There was there were no employees. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1406.56s)]
*  JB Stravlin out joined three other people. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1409.56s)]
*  There was no car there was no nothing. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1413.56s)]
*  So it wasn't even a prototype yet. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1416.56s)]
*  No. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1418.56s)]
*  Oh OK. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1419.56s)]
*  I thought it was a prototype already. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1420.56s)]
*  No there weren't even any employees. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1422.56s)]
*  Oh wasn't that fun. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1425.56s)]
*  That's a funny narrative that people like to say that you didn't even create Tesla then. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1427.56s)]
*  Yeah that's wrong. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1430.56s)]
*  So if you're handling the government like a business you're going to have to go through all of these departments and do the exact same thing that you're doing with USAID. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1431.56s)]
*  So how do you how does that scale up. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1445.56s)]
*  Like how many people do you need to do something like that. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1448.56s)]
*  Well we started off with about 40 people maybe 100 people and really just going through doing very basic things here. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1455.56s)]
*  It's as bad as Twitter was the federal government as much worse. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1466.56s)]
*  So you know in the case of Twitter it wasn't a profitable company it was like basically a break even company but at least it was break even and it had to pass an audit. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1472.56s)]
*  The federal government is not break even. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1485.56s)]
*  It's literally losing two trillion dollars a year and it does not pass its audits. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1488.56s)]
*  It fails its own audits. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1493.56s)]
*  So like you know there's a case where like I think Senator Collins was telling me about how she gave the Navy 12 billion dollars for more submarines got no extra submarines and then held a hearing to say where the 12 billion dollars go and they were like we don't know. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1495.56s)]
*  That was it. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1514.56s)]
*  I mean basically stuff is so crazy. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1517.56s)]
*  It's like only the federal government could get away with this level of waste of waste. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1519.56s)]
*  It's mostly waste. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1525.56s)]
*  It's mostly not for it's mostly waste. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1526.56s)]
*  It's mostly just ridiculous things happening because they've been able to do it this way for so long. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1527.56s)]
*  They become accustomed to it. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1533.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1536.56s)]
*  It's like Milton Friedman said like money is most poorly spent when when you're spending someone else's money on people you don't know how much are you going to care. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1537.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1548.56s)]
*  And that's the that's the federal government. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1549.56s)]
*  So they are spending someone else's money on people they don't know. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1552.56s)]
*  Now imagine any other business that was this badly run that complains when you want to check the books and audit it and go through all the decisions that have been made and go through all the ledgers and like yeah what did you do. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1556.56s)]
*  Well the people receiving the money want to keep receiving the money. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1572.56s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah clearly yes. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1576.56s)]
*  So but you know I mean the reason I'm the reason I'm putting so much effort into this is that I think it is a very dire situation. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1579.56s)]
*  It's not a you know it's an optional basically. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1592.56s)]
*  So yeah yeah America's going bankrupt so that that that just can't happen. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1599.56s)]
*  It's just bizarre to me that some people aren't willing to look at it correctly. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1609.56s)]
*  They're not willing to see like how much chaos this is how much waste and fraud there is how much how much can be trimmed and how much just because people have jobs doing bullshit doesn't mean your tax dollars should pay for this bullshit. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1613.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1627.56s)]
*  We found just with a basic search of the Social Security database that there were 20 million dead people marked as alive. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1629.56s)]
*  But were they getting money. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1638.56s)]
*  Some of them are getting money. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1640.56s)]
*  What percentage of them. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1642.56s)]
*  It isn't clear we're actually trying to run this ground I was trying to get an answer but right before the show. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1646.56s)]
*  What it looks like is that most of the fraud is not coming from Social Security payments directly but because they are marked as alive in the Social Security database that they can get then get disability unemployment sort of fake medical payments and other things because they're marked as alive in the Social Security database. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1652.56s)]
*  So it looks like it's a bank. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1670.56s)]
*  The fraud is a bank shot essentially. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1672.56s)]
*  The bank shot into Social Security. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1675.56s)]
*  They just do an are you alive check and then get fraudulent payments from every other part of the government. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1680.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1688.56s)]
*  And this exploits the fundamental weakness in the government is that the various government databases they don't talk to each other. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1689.56s)]
*  They talk to each other very poorly in a very limited way. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1696.56s)]
*  So the way to the way that the system gets exploited is is by taking advantage of the the poor communication between the various databases in the government. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1700.56s)]
*  You get an example of like what's happening state treasury which is improving rapidly. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1711.56s)]
*  The the main payments computer is called Pam payments account payment accounts master database something like that. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1718.56s)]
*  But it won't cause a Pam that's responsible for almost five trillion dollars payments a year roughly a billion dollars an hour. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1725.56s)]
*  And when we came there we're looking at the famine it's like the payments have no you could put a payment through with with no payment categorization code and no description on the payment like basically untraceable blank checks. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1732.56s)]
*  This is the kind of thing that if it was done as a public company the company would be immediately delisted and the executive team would be thrown in prison. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1748.56s)]
*  But this is just normal at the government. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1760.56s)]
*  So we said OK our recommendation to the Treasury and the Federal Reserve is like we need to make the payment categorization codes mandatory not optional. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1762.56s)]
*  And you need there needs to be an explanation. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1773.56s)]
*  We're not judging the quality of the explanation but there should be some explanation for what this payment is for above nothing. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1778.56s)]
*  Above nothing. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1785.56s)]
*  That's a radical change to the system that is being implemented now. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1788.56s)]
*  My guess is that places 100 billion a year. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1793.56s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1796.56s)]
*  That's what I might money go rough rough water magnitude. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1798.56s)]
*  Where was that money going. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1801.56s)]
*  Well, so this is where you get into the sort of gray boundary between waste and fraud. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1804.56s)]
*  If money is sent to a person or organization from the government and you didn't really deserve it but the government still sent it to you. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1813.56s)]
*  Is that waste or fraud. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1823.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1826.56s)]
*  So I mean there's a lot of payments that where someone just approved approved the payment but then that payment officer changed jobs or retired or died. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1828.56s)]
*  And the payments just keep going. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1840.56s)]
*  I mean it's like if you forget to pay your gym membership or something like that. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1842.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1845.56s)]
*  Now imagine it's not the gym membership. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1846.56s)]
*  You said your gym membership is 20 billion dollars a year or something. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1848.56s)]
*  You know. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1851.56s)]
*  But they forgot to turn it off. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1853.56s)]
*  There's like that's happening at scale in the government. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1857.56s)]
*  She is totally not. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1860.56s)]
*  So insane. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1862.56s)]
*  Yes, it's totally insane. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1863.56s)]
*  So what did you expect when you went in. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1865.56s)]
*  Did you expect that would be like this. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1868.56s)]
*  I thought it's I thought it would be bad but I did not think it would be as bad as this. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1870.56s)]
*  I mean look the good news is that it's a target rich environment for saving money. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1876.56s)]
*  It's not like it's not like if it was a very well run ship. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1884.56s)]
*  If it was very efficient it would be hard to improve but it's not efficient. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1891.56s)]
*  So therefore it is actually relatively easy to improve. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1895.56s)]
*  Let's just say it's not rocket science. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1900.56s)]
*  You know I know rocket science. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1902.56s)]
*  So it's a lot of mundane things. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1904.56s)]
*  So and some of the some of the things are like so crazy that we didn't even know to ask about that because we just assumed like you know payments out of the Treasury computer would have a payment [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1910.56s)]
*  categorization code and it would have some explanatory note saying what the payments for the idea that that it would be just untraceable blank checks didn't occur to us at first. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1920.56s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=1931.56s)]

*  So is that one of the things that accounts to this. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2007.56s)]
*  There's this four point something trillion dollars. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2010.56s)]
*  That's kind of they don't know where it went. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2014.56s)]
*  They don't know that that's a cure. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2018.56s)]
*  I think that's probably cumulative number. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2020.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2022.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2023.56s)]
*  So yeah. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2024.56s)]
*  But yeah if you if you add up it's do you remember that story Jamie. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2025.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2030.56s)]
*  What was the story. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2031.56s)]
*  Well what she said there's like they just didn't have accounting for it I think. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2032.56s)]
*  Yeah it was spent on legitimate things. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2035.56s)]
*  Don't worry. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2037.56s)]
*  But we don't we don't know what we spent it on. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2038.56s)]
*  Well I mean how do you know. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2041.56s)]
*  Obviously it's one cannot say it was spent legitimately if they don't know what it was spent on. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2043.56s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2046.56s)]
*  This is this is such a fascinating time because with this setup the way it is right now with Trump back in after all that happened to him and with you there and with R.F.K. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2048.56s)]
*  Junior and Tulsi and Cash Patel it's like this is a wild time. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2061.56s)]
*  You find out what's really going on. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2066.56s)]
*  That's like never happened before. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2068.56s)]
*  This is nothing like the first term. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2070.56s)]
*  No. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2072.56s)]
*  Like the first term he had a bunch of neocons in the cabinet and there's a bunch of shady people that he didn't know and he had to appoint all these different people. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2073.56s)]
*  Maybe he got some bad picks. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2081.56s)]
*  Now he's had four years to stew on it. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2083.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2086.56s)]
*  And with you guys all going through this we're getting an understanding of the government that we've literally never had before. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2087.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2094.56s)]
*  This is a revolutionary cabinet and maybe the most revolutionary cabinet since the first revolution. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2095.56s)]
*  This is this is not a bunch of business as usual types. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2102.56s)]
*  So this is why some of the standard confirmations are quite challenging is because when you when you put to try to appoint people who are going to change the system. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2107.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2116.56s)]
*  The system doesn't want to let them through. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2117.56s)]
*  But it's fascinating because it's like the vampires all out themselves. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2119.56s)]
*  Like now everybody knows who the system is. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2123.56s)]
*  Like if you're just lying openly about USAID and then they come and hear you talk on a podcast and explain what's really going on like he's starving mothers. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2125.56s)]
*  There's mothers that can't get food. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2134.56s)]
*  Totally false. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2136.56s)]
*  That's all you're hearing. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2137.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2138.56s)]
*  That's no one's talking in any of these mainstream liberal talk shows. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2139.56s)]
*  No one is talking about all this fraud and waste. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2143.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2147.56s)]
*  Because we're cutting off their graph machine. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2148.56s)]
*  So that's what they're upset about. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2150.56s)]
*  That's the real thing they're upset about. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2151.56s)]
*  And if you want to know what does is cutting and I want to be clear like these are cuts that those recommends to the department. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2153.56s)]
*  And usually these recommendations are followed. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2161.56s)]
*  But these are recommendations that are then confirmed by the department. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2163.56s)]
*  The you can see line by line what does is done at Doge.gov. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2169.56s)]
*  So whatever we do we put on those like so you can see everything that is being done. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2174.56s)]
*  And there's a tracker that shows how much money has been saved. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2180.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2184.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2185.56s)]
*  And you can look at each line item and you know that like a bunch of these sort of sort of far left shows will say like oh it's a constitutional crisis blah blah blah. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2186.56s)]
*  But what they won't do is point out which payments are wrong. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2194.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2197.56s)]
*  So my challenge to them is point out which payments are wrong. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2198.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2200.56s)]
*  Go through it. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2201.56s)]
*  Which of which of these sort of way slash fraud things are wrong. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2202.56s)]
*  Which line. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2205.56s)]
*  Explain that line to the public. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2207.56s)]
*  They won't be able to. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2208.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2209.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2210.56s)]
*  That's why you're not hearing any specifics. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2211.56s)]
*  You hear anecdotal stories about mothers starving. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2212.56s)]
*  But we can name the specifics. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2215.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2216.56s)]
*  Line by line. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2217.56s)]
*  And we got the receipts. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2218.56s)]
*  And here's the other thing. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2219.56s)]
*  If you're. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2220.56s)]
*  Post the receipts. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2221.56s)]
*  And if you're only talking about the propaganda talking points and you're not talking about the very clear fraud and waste. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2222.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2227.56s)]
*  It's very obvious what you're doing. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2228.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2229.56s)]
*  You just gaslight. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2230.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2231.56s)]
*  Yeah totally. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2232.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2233.56s)]
*  So exactly. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2234.56s)]
*  We're like look in fact I've said we're going to make mistakes. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2235.56s)]
*  We're not going to be perfect. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2238.56s)]
*  So if we make a mistake we'll quickly fix it. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2241.56s)]
*  So we'll. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2244.56s)]
*  We need to act fast. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2246.56s)]
*  So stop wasting billions of dollars of taxpayer money. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2249.56s)]
*  But if we make a mistake we'll reverse it quickly. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2254.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2257.56s)]
*  You know so. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2258.56s)]
*  There's also this interesting narrative that you shouldn't have access to the Social Security information as if no one's had access to it before as if the Biden administration in 2023 had there was like 53 people some of them were students that had access to all this stuff. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2260.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2275.56s)]
*  As it is there are tens of thousands of people federal employees that have access to already to the system. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2276.56s)]
*  Anyone from Doge has to go through the same vetting process that those those federal employees went through. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2284.56s)]
*  So there's not like some unvetted random situation. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2290.56s)]
*  If for example there's a security clearance needed. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2296.56s)]
*  The Doge person has to have that same security clearance. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2299.56s)]
*  So there's no reduction in security. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2302.56s)]
*  But I mean obviously the vast numbers of Social Security numbers have leaked onto the Internet. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2309.56s)]
*  People have hacked the government systems multiple times. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2314.56s)]
*  Vast amounts of public information has been hacked and dumped onto the Internet. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2318.56s)]
*  So when there's a guy at the IRS that leaked a half a million tax returns. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2323.56s)]
*  Just a few years ago on purpose. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2330.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2333.56s)]
*  For what reason. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2334.56s)]
*  I feel like he wanted to I think he was trying to get a Trump and maybe me and a few others. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2336.56s)]
*  So he stole like 500,000 tax returns. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2343.56s)]
*  Like like about a few like it's a lot of tax returns. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2351.56s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2354.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2355.56s)]
*  Oh I remember that story. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2356.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2358.56s)]
*  You can just read about it online. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2359.56s)]
*  It's not it's a real thing. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2360.56s)]
*  So these are the narratives. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2362.56s)]
*  That's the narrative that you shouldn't have access to Social Security. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2364.56s)]
*  The other narrative is that starving people are going to die and women are going to be pregnant and not have nutrients for their babies. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2367.56s)]
*  And that's that's all you're hearing. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2375.56s)]
*  And yeah well that's that's that's the only thing they can say but they can't point to the line item. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2377.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2383.56s)]
*  And so they can't say like well this is the thing where you know the nutrients for pregnant mothers were stopped. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2384.56s)]
*  They can't point to that because we didn't. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2392.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2394.56s)]
*  It's a lie. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2395.56s)]
*  What's fascinating to me is how much the mainstream media is in line with the very specific talking points and how little you don't have Fox News is essentially a Fox News on television. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2396.56s)]
*  It's like the only one that is pointing out the ridiculous fraud and waste. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2411.56s)]
*  And you know I know you saw the Jeff Bezos thing in the Washington Post. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2416.56s)]
*  They're going to stop all the wacky editorials and and limit that stuff to I think it was wealth and personal freedom or something along those lines. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2421.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2431.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2432.56s)]
*  So I mean I think it's this kind of I think it makes sense because he's just talking about the things. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2433.56s)]
*  Not the sort of just talking about the opinion opinion pieces. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2440.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2444.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2445.56s)]
*  So the regular journalism stays the same. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2446.56s)]
*  Well it's a detriment to their business. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2448.56s)]
*  I mean you're seeing over and over again people that just they don't want to hear all this shit from these people anymore. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2450.56s)]
*  It's like you're you're you're saying it's almost like you're caught in an outdated version of the virus and everybody else already has the immunity to that virus. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2455.56s)]
*  Like this. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2465.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2466.56s)]
*  You know like you need you need a new mind virus. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2467.56s)]
*  The one that you're pushing it's like it doesn't work anymore. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2470.56s)]
*  It's too crazy. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2473.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2474.56s)]
*  It's the whole thing is very crazy. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2475.56s)]
*  I mean the media is incredibly partisan. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2478.56s)]
*  I mean they're not them. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2480.56s)]
*  They take almost all the media is your left shifted. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2482.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2488.56s)]
*  So it's like it's kind of weird if you talk to somebody who gets all their information from like what I call legacy media. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2489.56s)]
*  They're living in a different world. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2495.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2497.56s)]
*  Then if they say are listening to you know your podcast or are getting news from from X or you know just it's like it's kind of wild. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2498.56s)]
*  It is very wild. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2511.56s)]
*  Like you told it's like they're living in an ultimate reality. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2512.56s)]
*  Oh there's a lot of people that I talk to that I have to go where did you hear that. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2515.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2519.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2520.56s)]
*  I mean like the Associated Press which I call Associated Propaganda the AP you know they ran a international news story saying that we that Doge fired air traffic controllers but we didn't fire any air traffic controllers at all. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2521.56s)]
*  In fact we're trying to hire air traffic controllers not fire them. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2534.56s)]
*  Yeah I saw that you made a tweet about it right. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2538.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2540.56s)]
*  What do you call it now. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2541.56s)]
*  Do you call it a post. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2542.56s)]
*  Post yeah whatever. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2543.56s)]
*  You can't call it a tweet though. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2544.56s)]
*  Do you call it a tweet accidentally. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2545.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2546.56s)]
*  Listen. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2547.56s)]
*  But like if you if you like let's say if somebody posts if somebody puts up like a two hour long video that's not a tweet. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2548.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2558.56s)]
*  It's a post. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2559.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2560.56s)]
*  Good point. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2561.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2562.56s)]
*  For sure. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2563.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2564.56s)]
*  So but I'm a little hard over if people still want to call it a tweet whatever. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2565.56s)]
*  You put a post about it to get back to it saying that if you we need highly qualified air traffic controllers if you've retired if you would consider doing it again we could use you. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2568.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2578.56s)]
*  So a lot of really qualified traffic controllers were pushed out because of the stuff. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2579.56s)]
*  So I mean not to be blunt I mean a bunch of old bunch of really good talented old white guys were pushed out. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2585.56s)]
*  It's not cool. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2594.56s)]
*  And so we have there's a talent shortage in air traffic control because of DEI and not being not hiring people on merit you know. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2596.56s)]
*  Which is so crazy that that worked. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2606.56s)]
*  I think we should not put the public safety at risk. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2608.56s)]
*  No. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2611.56s)]
*  You know because of some demented philosophy. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2612.56s)]
*  Somebody made a post today about it infiltrating the NSA. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2614.56s)]
*  Did you see any of that. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2619.56s)]
*  That was some gnarly stuff. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2620.56s)]
*  Yeah crazy. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2624.56s)]
*  What they did it started off as just like this sort of fringe thing and would beat up then it completely infiltrated the organization. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2626.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2633.56s)]
*  And they're spending all their time like 400 people or something. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2634.56s)]
*  And some like some chat sex chat room with like some extremely demented stuff. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2636.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2643.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2644.56s)]
*  I know I said I'll send it to you Jamie because it's so cookie. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2645.56s)]
*  You know what. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2648.56s)]
*  This is the NSA. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2650.56s)]
*  I thought the NSA was just all about like information and like spy on you know like if like says a national threat or something. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2651.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2659.56s)]
*  I think this is exactly it. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2660.56s)]
*  So she more than 100 intelligence staffers will be fired over sexually explicit text in NSA chat rooms. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2663.56s)]
*  Gabbard says so. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2670.56s)]
*  So top intelligence official told Waters that the workers in question were brazen and using an NSA platform intended for professional use to conduct this kind of really really horrific behavior. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2674.56s)]
*  What is the behavior. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2685.56s)]
*  What exactly what is it. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2686.56s)]
*  Do they say in this article. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2688.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2691.56s)]
*  I think they will also. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2693.56s)]
*  OK. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2694.56s)]
*  It says employees who participate in the NSA obscene pornographic and sexually explicit chat rooms. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2695.56s)]
*  Your tax dollars at work. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2702.56s)]
*  Well it was all like D.E. I mean it was all like LBGTQ stuff. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2704.56s)]
*  It was there was a lot of like transition stuff and yeah I know I definitely saved it. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2708.56s)]
*  But point is they infiltrated the organization. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2714.56s)]
*  It's not what they should be talking about at all at all at all. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2718.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2721.56s)]
*  Supposed to be protecting the country. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2722.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2723.56s)]
*  And if you and people were talking about how they're spending half their time in these meetings and that they're just like constantly having to attend these things where they talk about these issues like what are what are you doing. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2724.56s)]
*  Like if you have a problem with someone that's discriminatory get rid of that person. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2736.56s)]
*  That's it. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2741.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2742.56s)]
*  It's your problems over. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2743.56s)]
*  You've got someone who's homophobic in your business they're openly homophobic. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2744.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2747.56s)]
*  You can't work here. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2748.56s)]
*  That's not cool. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2749.56s)]
*  That's it. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2750.56s)]
*  You're not going to have fucking meetings constantly promoting this. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2751.56s)]
*  You're not going to change someone's opinion by rating them over and over again. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2754.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2758.56s)]
*  I mean a work environment should be a professional environment where you know they're they're getting the job done that they're you know you know being paid to do. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2759.56s)]
*  That should be. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2769.56s)]
*  Of course. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2771.56s)]
*  It's obviously not supposed to be sort of getting paid for bizarre sex excapades. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2772.56s)]
*  It's so fascinating that the virus is so strong that it made it into the NSA. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2778.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2784.56s)]
*  And was you would think those are some hard core. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2785.56s)]
*  To those. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2787.56s)]

*  Which is bananas. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2792.56s)]
*  You would think same thing like hard nosed like tough people doing hard work who conspire on you whenever they want. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2793.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2798.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2800.56s)]
*  And get revenge on you whenever they want. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2801.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2803.56s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2806.56s)]
*  And you know they exist when the president leaves they stay. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2807.56s)]
*  People move around. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2813.56s)]
*  You stay a part of the organization for your entire career. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2815.56s)]
*  You get deeply entrenched in their system and how things work and who's back to rub and who's who's a bad guy who's a good guy who's on our side who's not. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2818.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2827.56s)]
*  It's scary actually. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2829.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2831.56s)]
*  So. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2832.56s)]
*  Was that what's taken so long with this Epstein files. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2833.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2836.56s)]
*  What's up with that. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2837.56s)]
*  What is up with that. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2838.56s)]
*  It was like. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2839.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2840.56s)]
*  It's it's like Lucy and the football with Charlie Brown when she always pulls that football away. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2841.56s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2845.56s)]
*  It's like they keep telling us they're going to release it. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2848.56s)]
*  Day one. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2850.56s)]
*  Oh. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2851.56s)]
*  Day one. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2852.56s)]
*  Serious case of no one's being arrested or phobia you know. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2853.56s)]
*  Like what the fuck is going on. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2855.56s)]
*  What the fuck is going on. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2857.56s)]
*  Also there's this real fear that someone's destroying the evidence and you keep hearing these stories unsubstantiated stories. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2858.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2864.56s)]
*  Of you know FBI. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2865.56s)]
*  Where is the evidence. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2866.56s)]
*  I mean the guy has like tons of videos and recordings. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2867.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2871.56s)]
*  I mean he had all sorts of things. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2872.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2873.56s)]
*  Like as a mountain of evidence. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2874.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2875.56s)]
*  So where is that mountain. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2876.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2877.56s)]
*  Where is that mountain and what would be the reason why they would agree. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2878.56s)]
*  Like there would have to be something in it for them to agree to not put it out. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2881.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2887.56s)]
*  Like there has to be some sort of financial entanglement some sort of relationship with the people that are on that list. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2888.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2897.56s)]
*  That they can provide a value that was big enough for you to not release it or to slow release it or to hope you can get away with like putting out some redacted files that don't show anything. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2898.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2908.56s)]
*  This is only stage one. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2909.56s)]
*  Redacted redacted. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2910.56s)]
*  Only stage one. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2911.56s)]
*  Don't worry. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2912.56s)]
*  The real stuff's coming. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2913.56s)]
*  Like that doesn't make any sense. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2914.56s)]
*  Like why wouldn't you just release it all. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2915.56s)]
*  Like what. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2917.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2918.56s)]
*  What could possibly be well protecting in there. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2919.56s)]
*  I mean I think I've got probably the same information that I mean I'm just reading what's what's the latest thing on the X. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2921.56s)]
*  You know I'm just looking at my X feed and I'm like yeah you know it's a real page turner. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2926.56s)]
*  And I thought we were going to get some revelations today. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2933.56s)]
*  I was like big binders full of stuff. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2936.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2938.56s)]
*  There was nothing in there. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2939.56s)]
*  Well there was some all those people that were given a copy of it. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2940.56s)]
*  They were all like waving around. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2943.56s)]
*  They got the Willy Wonka ticket. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2944.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2946.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2947.56s)]
*  And what happened. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2948.56s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2949.56s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2950.56s)]
*  So I think Laura Loomer released it online. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2951.56s)]
*  I think. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2954.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2955.56s)]
*  She's not very pleased about this. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2956.56s)]
*  So does anybody find anything in there that's interesting. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2958.56s)]
*  No it's all old stuff from 2015 and 2021. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2962.56s)]
*  What the fuck is going on. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2964.56s)]
*  But then apparently this that they discovered a whole bunch of stuff at the Southern District of New York. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2965.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2970.56s)]
*  So that's and I'm like and I think you're Pam Bondi is actually great and Cash Patel are great but they're like they just got there you know. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2971.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2980.56s)]
*  So then they're they're not there. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2981.56s)]
*  They just got there but they're they're in a hostile environment. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2982.56s)]
*  They're not in a friendly environment. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2986.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2987.56s)]
*  So you know it's like if you suddenly got put in captain of a ship but the crew was previously your enemy. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2989.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2997.56s)]
*  The entire crew. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2998.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=2999.56s)]
*  Was previously your enemy. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3000.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3001.56s)]
*  You know. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3002.56s)]
*  And you're telling them give me evidence. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3003.56s)]
*  The crew doesn't want to give me the evidence. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3004.56s)]
*  It shows you guys are all criminals. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3005.56s)]
*  They were like you're mortal enemies just a moment ago. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3006.56s)]
*  You just got there. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3009.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3010.56s)]
*  So I think we've got to give you know the attorney general and you know new director the FBI a little bit of slack here because they literally just got there. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3011.56s)]
*  I think so too. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3021.56s)]
*  But hey don't say you're going to release it on day one then. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3022.56s)]
*  You shouldn't have said that. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3026.56s)]
*  Sure. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3027.56s)]
*  And don't say you got a big drop coming tomorrow and that's some bullshit that's been around forever. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3028.56s)]
*  It's disappointing. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3034.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3035.56s)]
*  Where's the JFK files. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3036.56s)]
*  Where are those. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3037.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3038.56s)]
*  Let them go. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3039.56s)]
*  Did they release anything on that front. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3040.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3041.56s)]
*  It can't be anything that's gotten to me yet. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3042.56s)]
*  So nothing's gotten to me yet. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3046.56s)]
*  It can't be significant. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3047.56s)]
*  If there's conspiracy evidence someone's going to send it to you. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3048.56s)]
*  Tim Dillon is going to text me. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3051.56s)]
*  100 percent. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3053.56s)]
*  Tim Dillon Dave Smith. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3054.56s)]
*  Someone's going to send it my way. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3055.56s)]
*  Someone's going to send you the stuff. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3056.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3057.56s)]
*  So it hasn't been released yet. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3058.56s)]
*  It hasn't. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3059.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3060.56s)]
*  You would find out. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3061.56s)]
*  And here's the real question. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3062.56s)]
*  Like what could even be in there at this point that they haven't cleared out. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3063.56s)]
*  If you've got paperwork from 1963 like what is in there still. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3067.56s)]
*  What is in there that could possibly be incriminating that supposedly Trump said that if you saw [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3072.32s)]
*  what they showed me you wouldn't release it either. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3078.82s)]
*  What the fuck. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3081.56s)]
*  I haven't seen it. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3082.56s)]
*  So yeah. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3083.88s)]
*  He said he's seen it all. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3084.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3087.88s)]
*  He just posted to his ex account or something. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3088.88s)]
*  I mean I just. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3093.92s)]
*  That sounds like an Elon move. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3094.92s)]
*  I don't think he can. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3096.28s)]
*  He's the director of the FBI. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3097.28s)]
*  I think he has to go through proper channels. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3098.28s)]
*  Does he? [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3100.8s)]
*  He has the channel. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3101.8s)]
*  Yeah but there's rules. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3102.8s)]
*  He sounds like Trump. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3103.8s)]
*  He sounds like Trump. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3104.8s)]
*  He needs an executive order. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3105.8s)]
*  What about the storm? [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3106.8s)]
*  I am the storm. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3107.8s)]
*  I mean what channels? [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3112.8s)]
*  He has the channel. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3113.8s)]
*  Well again imagine just getting to the hull or just getting to the deck of the ship and [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3115.44s)]
*  you're the captain. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3122.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3123.36s)]
*  And now you have to figure out who's running things. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3124.36s)]
*  Who's doing this. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3127.1200000000003s)]
*  Where is everything? [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3128.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3129.92s)]
*  Just getting anything done. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3131.88s)]
*  Like I said you just joined as captain of a ship where the crew hates your guts. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3134.0s)]
*  Yeah they were your enemy. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3139.96s)]
*  Yeah they were your enemy. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3141.8s)]
*  They're strongly opposed to anything you want to do. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3143.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3146.28s)]
*  And you're trying to give them orders. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3147.28s)]
*  And you're trying to expose them. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3148.28s)]
*  Yeah they don't want to be exposed. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3149.28s)]
*  Literally people that are working there are probably a part of this problem. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3152.32s)]
*  I mean I was reading on X that like Comey's daughter is like the lead prosecutor in the [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3155.32s)]
*  Southern District of New York. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3160.4s)]
*  Do you read that? [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3161.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3162.4s)]
*  And like so obviously there's a bit of an entanglement there. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3163.4s)]
*  A little bit. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3166.0s)]
*  Like what if there's something that you know puts her dad in a bad light. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3167.0s)]
*  What? [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3171.56s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3172.56s)]
*  He's a fucking shredder. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3173.56s)]
*  Hit that delete button. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3174.56s)]
*  The shredder's working overtime. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3175.56s)]
*  Did you see General Flynn? [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3176.7999999999997s)]
*  He was on a podcast and he spoke directly to James Comey. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3180.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3185.2s)]
*  He said Jim you're going to jail and unless you give up someone deeper than you and you [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3186.2s)]
*  know who that is, you know who I'm talking about? [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3190.4s)]
*  Like that is wild. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3193.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3195.32s)]
*  To think that the former director of the FBI might be really in that kind of deep shit [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3196.32s)]
*  and then he really actually was doing some evil corrupt shit while he was running the [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3202.32s)]
*  FBI. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3206.88s)]
*  I mean it seems like there's some very shady stuff that's been going on. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3208.1600000000003s)]
*  Seems like it definitely happened in the 60s, right? [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3212.6000000000004s)]
*  Everybody kind of admits to that. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3215.04s)]
*  They admit the FBI killed Black Panthers. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3216.04s)]
*  They did a lot of shit. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3219.96s)]
*  There's a lot of stuff that went on that we know the government did way back in the day. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3221.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3226.32s)]
*  Why don't we just data dump the files? [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3227.32s)]
*  Go in there, take photos of all the papers, presumably paper, and just post it online [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3229.88s)]
*  and let the jokes fall where they may. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3236.32s)]
*  Isn't presumably everyone involved dead? [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3239.12s)]
*  Isn't like some filing cabinet somewhere? [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3241.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3242.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3243.88s)]
*  Where is it? [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3244.88s)]
*  Where's the magic filing cabinet? [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3245.88s)]
*  How are they hiding it? [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3246.88s)]
*  Who's got access to it? [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3247.88s)]
*  This is what I was hoping. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3249.7599999999998s)]
*  Day one I was hoping. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3250.8s)]
*  But obviously it's taken a lot longer than that. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3252.48s)]
*  I think part of it is like, let's say you were made director of the FBI. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3256.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3261.48s)]
*  I might be able to. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3262.48s)]
*  That's what's crazy. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3263.96s)]
*  Yeah, but then you literally go there. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3264.96s)]
*  You know, Dan Bongino, what's he doing now? [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3265.96s)]
*  He's one of the big dogs of the FBI. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3268.04s)]
*  Dan's a tough guy. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3269.6s)]
*  Yeah, he's a secret service guy, yeah, legit guy. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3270.6s)]
*  But people think of him as a Fox News guy, just like Pete Hegseth, same thing. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3273.56s)]
*  They don't want to think about his distinguished military career. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3277.36s)]
*  They want to say, oh, that Fox News guy? [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3279.36s)]
*  Deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3283.28s)]
*  I mean, Dan's hardcore. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3285.16s)]
*  If it's reasonably findable, I think he's going to find it. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3286.16s)]
*  Yeah, this is the thing. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3289.96s)]
*  Between him and Cash, I mean, I think they're going to get stuff out there. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3290.96s)]
*  How crazy would it be if they couldn't, though? [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3293.16s)]
*  How crazy would it be if they can't find anything? [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3295.2799999999997s)]
*  If it's that, if everybody shuts their mouths and everybody covers their ass? [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3297.48s)]
*  Like an FBI computer where you type in the search? [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3301.52s)]
*  That's what I want to know. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3304.52s)]
*  I just like the basic mechanism here. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3305.52s)]
*  It's either in a filing cabinet paper where it's like, maybe there's progressive levels [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3307.44s)]
*  of security. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3312.92s)]
*  If you're like, open this door up, you got to have the pass for this level. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3314.04s)]
*  You're like, level unlocked. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3317.76s)]
*  And there's a level unlocked. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3319.28s)]
*  And it's like, you're made of black and it's finally like opening. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3320.28s)]
*  And you get in there and there's an old Acer laptop. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3322.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3325.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean, how does this even look like? [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3326.6800000000003s)]
*  There's an old unplugged laptop. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3327.6800000000003s)]
*  You've got to only plug it in. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3328.6800000000003s)]
*  It's in a skiff. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3329.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, this is why I think like a tour of Fort Knox would be awesome. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3330.6800000000003s)]
*  Like a live tour of Fort Knox, where you can actually see, it's like, is the cold there [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3333.64s)]
*  or not? [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3337.64s)]
*  They say it is. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3338.64s)]
*  Is it real? [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3339.64s)]
*  Or did somebody spray paint some lead? [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3340.64s)]
*  Imagine if it's not. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3341.64s)]
*  Imagine if it's not all there, like some of it's missing, where'd it go? [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3343.3599999999997s)]
*  What if a lot of it's missing? [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3345.3599999999997s)]
*  What if like half of it's missing? [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3347.48s)]
*  I mean, how do we even know? [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3348.8799999999997s)]
*  No, they said the last time they let someone look at it was decades ago. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3352.2s)]
*  Yeah, well, the last, I believe the last formal audit was in the 50s. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3356.64s)]
*  So I'm like, okay. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3362.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh my God, just think about all the other things. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3363.2799999999997s)]
*  Maybe we should check it again. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3366.2799999999997s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3368.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3369.2799999999997s)]
*  Just think about all the stuff that you pointed out, all the checks that just go out, the [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3370.92s)]
*  NGO payments, the social security people. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3374.1200000000003s)]
*  Think about all, just all that. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3376.92s)]
*  Now apply that to the gold. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3378.2400000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3379.2400000000002s)]
*  I just want to like emphasize the sheer madness of the government. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3380.2400000000002s)]
*  It's just because they have like magic money computers, that the checks never bounce for [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3384.4s)]
*  the federal government. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3390.32s)]
*  Like, so you don't have the normal corrective mechanism that you'd have for a company or [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3391.32s)]
*  for an individual. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3395.0400000000004s)]
*  The checks just always clear. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3396.9s)]
*  The net result is inflation, which is effectively a tax on everyone. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3399.44s)]
*  But you know, like the defense department hasn't passed an audit in I don't know how [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3403.84s)]
*  many years. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3408.48s)]
*  Seven years. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3409.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, exactly. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3410.48s)]
*  So it's like you'd have to be friggin Chuck Norris. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3411.48s)]
*  Like only Chuck Norris could get the defense department to pass an audit, you know, type [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3413.48s)]
*  of thing. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3418.4s)]
*  That's the level of skill you need, you know. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3419.4s)]
*  Well that's what's so insane if you bring it back to the idea that it's a business. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3421.52s)]
*  Well yeah. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3425.2000000000003s)]
*  This would never be tolerated in any kind of functional business. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3426.2000000000003s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3428.6s)]
*  So, you know, Pentagon will like, like their accounting error, like the stuff that they [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3429.6s)]
*  lose in the cash cushions is like 20, 30 billion dollars a year. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3438.56s)]
*  They just don't know where it went. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3441.96s)]
*  It's gone. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3445.64s)]
*  Way to go. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3446.64s)]
*  And it's gone. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3447.64s)]
*  It's so insane. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3450.64s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3452.16s)]
*  It's so insane. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3453.44s)]
*  So that's why I say like even simple things like just requiring that the outgoing payments [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3454.44s)]
*  for the treasury computer have a payment code and a comment of what the payment is about [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3459.0s)]
*  and someone to call about the payment I think will have a very powerful effect in stopping [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3464.28s)]
*  wasteful outflows and stopping fraud. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3471.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3474.16s)]
*  And here's another way to look at this. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3475.16s)]
*  Imagine if there are people like you and the Doge team out there in the world. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3477.4s)]
*  Imagine if one of those works for an organization like USAID or any other organization and has [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3483.04s)]
*  this understanding of how much fuckery is involved but they have evil intentions and [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3490.4s)]
*  they're entwined in this system for decades and decades and they've built a career and [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3496.72s)]
*  all the entanglements that come in and they start moving shit around. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3501.1s)]
*  You could probably do it easy. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3506.52s)]
*  It sounds like the way you've laid it out. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3508.4s)]
*  If you were a career person who's in there forever, who knew how everything works and [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3510.16s)]
*  you were very clever, you could make some shit happen and you could probably do it in [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3515.52s)]
*  conjunction with some people that you know that are forming an NGO. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3520.48s)]
*  Hey, let's all work together. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3524.16s)]
*  And this is the resistance that you're facing. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3529.56s)]
*  I think it's the biggest scam of all time. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3533.04s)]
*  This is not something you ever thought out to do. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3534.8399999999997s)]
*  This is probably the biggest scam of all time ever. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3536.36s)]
*  Of human history. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3540.04s)]
*  Of human history, yes. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3541.04s)]
*  Wow. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3542.04s)]
*  I think you're right. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3543.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3546.04s)]
*  What else could be better? [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3547.04s)]
*  It's probably a trillion dollar scam. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3548.04s)]
*  There's never been a trillion dollar scam. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3549.04s)]
*  Now this is not something that you ever set out to do. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3554.1600000000003s)]
*  You didn't have this as a career aspiration. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3558.1600000000003s)]
*  No. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3560.2000000000003s)]
*  This is the most absurd outcome I can possibly imagine actually. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3561.2000000000003s)]
*  Also Doge started as a meme coin. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3564.88s)]
*  It was like a joke cryptocurrency involving memes and dogs. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3567.96s)]
*  Which is so funny that the letters wound up being perfect. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3574.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3579.6s)]
*  Well actually I was originally going to call it the Government Efficiency Commission, which [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3580.6s)]
*  is a very boring name. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3583.4s)]
*  And then people online were like, no, it needs to be the Department of Government Efficiency. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3585.6s)]
*  And I was like, you know what, you're right. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3590.32s)]
*  Of course. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3592.1400000000003s)]
*  Of course. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3593.1400000000003s)]
*  I mean it's more evidence of the simulation. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3594.14s)]
*  Totally. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3595.8599999999997s)]
*  That little sheep. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3596.8599999999997s)]
*  Like our mascot is a cute dog. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3597.8599999999997s)]
*  And it's a meme coin. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3602.18s)]
*  The meme coin is probably worth a lot of money right now, right? [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3605.22s)]
*  Like every time you tweet about it, it shoots up. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3606.94s)]
*  The whole meme coin thing is bananas. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3611.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3613.7s)]
*  It is so bananas that people dump real money into these coins and then you can just pump [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3614.7s)]
*  them up and sell them. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3620.8199999999997s)]
*  It's like a casino or something. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3621.8199999999997s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3622.8199999999997s)]
*  And then people just do one of the greater fool theory and musical chairs and whoever [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3624.5s)]
*  is the last to sit down loses. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3628.1000000000004s)]
*  And somehow or another it's still legal. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3630.9s)]
*  I think not too many people, I mean it's sort of like you go to the casino, if you expect [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3635.6600000000003s)]
*  to win at the casino, you're being a fool. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3642.34s)]
*  So I think if you expect to win at meme coins, you're being foolish. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3645.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3650.38s)]
*  You're not going to win at meme coins. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3651.38s)]
*  But if you want, don't sink your life savings into a meme coin. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3654.58s)]
*  No, but you can gamble a little and you can ride waves and win a little and lose a little. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3658.8199999999997s)]
*  If you want to have some fun and don't come, then play with meme coins. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3664.3799999999997s)]
*  But if you put your family's wealth in the hock to a coin. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3669.66s)]
*  At the risk of saying something bold and outrageous, don't bet the farm on a meme coin. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3674.66s)]
*  The weird one is the pump it dumps. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3680.5s)]
*  They happen all the time. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3682.94s)]
*  All the time. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3684.54s)]
*  And people get shocked that somebody pump and dumped. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3685.54s)]
*  What is, what are you doing? [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3687.98s)]
*  Like I was hoping to dump, I was hoping to make all the money out of this. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3691.42s)]
*  I can't believe they got me. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3694.46s)]
*  It's just weird that it's legal still. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3697.7400000000002s)]
*  I mean casinos are legal. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3700.82s)]
*  And people just lose money at casinos. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3704.06s)]
*  But you can't rig a casino like a pump and dump. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3707.1000000000004s)]
*  You could rig a pump and dump. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3709.38s)]
*  Yeah, I guess so. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3711.94s)]
*  Like you could run a real pyramid scheme. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3714.94s)]
*  I mean the government's one big pyramid scheme if you ask me. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3717.94s)]
*  Social security is the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3721.62s)]
*  Explain that. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3727.62s)]
*  Oh, so people pay into social security and the money goes out of social security immediately. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3728.62s)]
*  But the obligation for social security is your entire retirement career. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3736.94s)]
*  So you're paying, you're paying, like if you look at the future obligations of social security, [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3741.94s)]
*  it far exceeds the tax revenue. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3751.94s)]
*  Far. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3754.94s)]
*  Have you ever looked at the debt clock? [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3755.94s)]
*  Yes. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3760.3399999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3761.3399999999997s)]
*  Because there's our present-day debt, but then there's our future obligations. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3763.02s)]
*  So when you look at the future obligations of social security, the actual national debt [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3766.02s)]
*  is like double what people think it is because of the future obligations. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3773.06s)]
*  So basically people are living way longer than expected. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3780.78s)]
*  And there are fewer babies being born. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3786.02s)]
*  So you have more people who are retired and get, that live for a long time and get retirement [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3789.42s)]
*  payments. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3795.42s)]
*  So the future obligation, so however bad the financial situation is right now for the federal [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3796.42s)]
*  government, it'll be much worse in the future at the risk of being a buzzkill here. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3802.06s)]
*  Did you see? [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3808.38s)]
*  So we better fix what we've got right now because if it's bad now, it's going to be [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3809.38s)]
*  much worse in the future. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3812.2200000000003s)]
*  There was an interview with this woman who was a whistleblower. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3813.2200000000003s)]
*  Did we ever find out that was true? [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3815.54s)]
*  There's so many whistles being blown. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3817.1s)]
*  It's hard to keep track. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3818.8599999999997s)]
*  A lot of whistles. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3819.8599999999997s)]
*  This one lady... [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3820.8599999999997s)]
*  It was only in one state. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3821.8599999999997s)]
*  It was very specific. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3823.66s)]
*  Right, but it was using social security money, correct? [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3825.5s)]
*  That was her allegation. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3828.2599999999998s)]
*  So what she was alleging was that she was in charge of turning illegal immigrants into [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3830.74s)]
*  clients. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3837.3399999999997s)]
*  That's what they would call them. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3838.3399999999997s)]
*  And that she would go to them and try to ask them, do you have a headache? [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3839.68s)]
*  Do you have back problems? [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3843.18s)]
*  If you do, now you can be permanently disabled. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3844.62s)]
*  You get permanent disability, so you get social security for life. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3847.9s)]
*  Yes. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3850.82s)]
*  Not just social security, but disability, which is even more. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3851.82s)]
*  And you get them on the taxpayer dole right away and they're illegal aliens. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3854.2200000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3859.3s)]
*  So if I were to say, what's at the heart of the sort of... [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3860.3s)]
*  Why is the Democrat propaganda machine so fired up to destroy me? [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3865.5s)]
*  That's the main reason. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3870.82s)]
*  The main reason is that entitlements fraud, that includes social security, disability, [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3872.62s)]
*  Medicaid, entitlements fraud for illegal aliens is what is serving as a gigantic magnetic [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3883.5s)]
*  force to pull people in from all around the world and keep them here. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3890.42s)]
*  Like basically, if you pay people at a standard of living that is above 90% of earth, then [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3895.22s)]
*  you have a very powerful incentive for 90% of earth to come here and to stay here. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3902.18s)]
*  But if you end the illegal alien fraud, then you turn off that magnet and they leave. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3912.8999999999996s)]
*  And they stop coming and the ones that are here, many of them will simply leave. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3921.3799999999997s)]
*  If that happens, they will lose a massive number of Democratic voters. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3928.06s)]
*  And if it didn't happen, they would turn those people into voters, which they were trying [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3933.2999999999997s)]
*  to do. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3937.38s)]
*  Correct. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3938.38s)]
*  They're already turning them... [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3939.38s)]
*  So in New York state, illegal aliens can already vote in state and city elections. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3940.38s)]
*  A lot of people don't know that. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3946.86s)]
*  They're trying to fight that and they're trying to stop that, but currently I think it's like [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3948.18s)]
*  600,000 are registered to vote illegal aliens in New York. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3953.46s)]
*  That is wild. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3958.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3959.42s)]
*  Well, I mean, if you look and say, you know, FEMA, like the agency that was paying for [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3960.42s)]
*  illegal aliens to stay at luxury hotels in New York was FEMA. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3970.94s)]
*  That's an agency that's meant to support Americans in distress from natural disasters. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3975.9s)]
*  The government was paying for luxury hotels for illegals in New York. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3983.3799999999997s)]
*  It's true. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3987.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3988.8999999999996s)]
*  There's a fact. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3989.8999999999996s)]
*  Fact. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3990.8999999999996s)]
*  They literally... [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3991.8999999999996s)]
*  Like when we stopped that payment, we stopped all those money, because that's obviously [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3992.8999999999996s)]
*  an insane way to spend taxpayer money. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=3995.58s)]
*  New York sued the federal government to get the money. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4000.7s)]
*  So you can just look at their lawsuit. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4006.3399999999997s)]
*  They were sending that money even after President Trump signed an executive order saying it [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4009.78s)]
*  needs to stop. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4015.3s)]
*  They still press send on $80 million to luxury hotels in New York. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4017.54s)]
*  Your tax money went to pay for illegal aliens in luxury hotels in New York from an agency [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4023.38s)]
*  that is meant to help Americans in distress from natural disasters. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4030.7000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4035.38s)]
*  And I would like to know how much... [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4036.38s)]
*  That's fucked up. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4037.94s)]
*  How much they spend on North Carolina and how much they spend on Maui. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4038.98s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4041.66s)]
*  What's actually happening is they're buying voters. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4045.02s)]
*  That's really what's happening. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4047.94s)]
*  It's like a giant voter fraud scam. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4048.94s)]
*  They're importing voters and it's really just a matter of time. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4052.58s)]
*  So a lot of people have trouble believing this, but the more you look at it, the more [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4058.26s)]
*  you will realize just how much of a problem this is and how... [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4065.66s)]
*  It's not just real. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4070.98s)]
*  It is an attempt to destroy democracy in America. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4074.1s)]
*  That's what, in my view, is what it really is. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4077.5s)]
*  If you take the seven swing states, often the margin of victory there is maybe 20,000 [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4081.18s)]
*  votes. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4087.98s)]
*  If you put 200,000 illegals in there and they have like an 80% likelihood of voting [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4088.98s)]
*  down and it's only a matter of time before they become citizens, then those swing states [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4096.86s)]
*  will not be swing states in the future. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4102.78s)]
*  And if they are not swing states, we'll be a permanent one-party state country. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4104.98s)]
*  Permanent deep blue socialist state. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4111.86s)]
*  That's what America will become. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4115.22s)]
*  And that was the game plan. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4116.94s)]
*  That was the game plan. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4118.78s)]
*  That is still the game plan. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4119.98s)]
*  And they almost succeeded. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4123.46s)]
*  If the machine of which the Kamala puppet was the representation had won, that's what [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4124.46s)]
*  would have happened. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4133.139999999999s)]
*  The reason I went so hardcore for Trump was because, to me, this was a fork in the road. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4134.86s)]
*  Like a very obvious fork in the road. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4142.42s)]
*  If they had another four years, they would legalize enough illegals in the swing states [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4146.34s)]
*  to make the swing states not swing states. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4150.7s)]
*  They would just be blue states. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4155.7s)]
*  Then they would win the presidential, they'd win the House, the Senate, and the presidency. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4159.26s)]
*  They would then make DC into a state, maybe Puerto Rico, get four extra senators, pack [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4167.18s)]
*  the Supreme Court, so then you'll have the House, Judiciary, Senate, and presidency [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4175.86s)]
*  all blue. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4182.219999999999s)]
*  And then they will keep importing more illegals to cement that outcome. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4183.5s)]
*  Basically, what happened in California? [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4188.259999999999s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4191.74s)]
*  It would have been the end. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4195.099999999999s)]
*  That's why I went so hardcore for Trump. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4197.94s)]
*  It would otherwise have been the end. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4200.0199999999995s)]
*  That's why the Democrat machine is so intent on destroying me. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4202.54s)]
*  It's just so fascinating that people can't see this. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4209.5s)]
*  I invite people to do their research. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4214.3s)]
*  The more they do their research, the more they will see that what I'm saying is absolutely [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4216.22s)]
*  true. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4219.14s)]
*  Just do the research. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4224.06s)]
*  It's such a bad idea, even for the Democrats, which is what they don't understand. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4226.18s)]
*  It's the same people. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4231.42s)]
*  It's not ultimately going to work out. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4232.62s)]
*  No, it's the same people. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4233.62s)]
*  They're doing it under the guise that they're the kind, compassionate, progressive people. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4236.900000000001s)]
*  But the same outcome takes place. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4242.3s)]
*  It's just about control. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4243.7s)]
*  They probably institute some central bank digital currency and some social credit score [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4245.54s)]
*  system. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4250.34s)]
*  And censorship, of course. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4251.34s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4252.34s)]
*  Well, that was the big fear coming into this election, was that if they can't censor things. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4253.34s)]
*  We talked about it before, but there was two major forks in the road. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4259.9s)]
*  The big one was Trump didn't get shot. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4263.42s)]
*  The other big one was you by Twitter. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4265.7s)]
*  And if those two things don't happen, the whole world looks different. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4267.259999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4272.339999999999s)]
*  We don't want to be on that timeline. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4273.339999999999s)]
*  No, we don't want to have only one side represented because guess what? [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4274.98s)]
*  They will hijack that side, whatever it is. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4279.339999999999s)]
*  They will hijack that side and use it for money and control. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4281.82s)]
*  And that's what it's all about. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4284.78s)]
*  It's not about good people versus bad people. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4286.339999999999s)]
*  It's a bullshit shell game. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4288.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4290.1s)]
*  I mean, I think these things are actually it's easy to understand if you look at basic [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4291.1s)]
*  incentives. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4295.42s)]
*  The basic incentive here is the more legals that Democrats can bring in, the more likely [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4297.18s)]
*  they are to win. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4301.9800000000005s)]
*  So that's what they're going to do. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4303.5s)]
*  That's what they have been doing. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4307.66s)]
*  And it worked in California, California supermajority dam. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4309.62s)]
*  And look at all the companies that are leaving California. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4313.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4315.66s)]
*  I mean, In-N-Out just announced they're leaving their headquarters leaving California. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4317.34s)]
*  They're moving to Tennessee. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4320.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4321.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4322.42s)]
*  So and California made health care free for illegals. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4323.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4330.22s)]
*  As of last year. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4331.22s)]
*  So and that obviously that's a gigantic magnet for more legals. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4333.0199999999995s)]
*  And this is not a thing you can solve simply with money, because what happens is the you [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4338.0199999999995s)]
*  simply have more patients than a doctor can possibly see. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4342.34s)]
*  And you can't just, you know, make doctors out of nothing. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4345.7s)]
*  Like the so sometimes people like, oh, it's just a money thing. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4349.900000000001s)]
*  No, it takes a long time for somebody to become a doctor. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4352.860000000001s)]
*  You know, the 30 years. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4357.02s)]
*  And and so what actually happens in California is that there are too many patients for the [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4360.02s)]
*  doctors to see. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4366.06s)]
*  So then the average citizen in California suffers as a result. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4367.98s)]
*  Now the elite in California are fine because they have private doctors. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4375.54s)]
*  You know, they have they can they can just pay for the best doctors. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4379.0199999999995s)]
*  So the elite in California don't fine. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4382.259999999999s)]
*  But your average citizen in California is not doing fine. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4384.179999999999s)]
*  And the tax burden for health care for illegals was supposed to be three billion. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4389.179999999999s)]
*  I think they're now estimated nine billion. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4393.219999999999s)]
*  But that number will scale to infinity. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4395.179999999999s)]
*  Basically, it's like. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4397.139999999999s)]
*  Why not? [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4399.339999999999s)]
*  Like, why not? [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4400.86s)]
*  If you if you need any operation at all, come to California and have it be free. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4401.7s)]
*  Right. From anywhere on Earth. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4406.54s)]
*  And the people that want to look at it in the most charitable way, they say, oh, well, [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4408.98s)]
*  these people are hardworking, good people, and they're the backbone of our city. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4413.7s)]
*  And they should have access to all the things that we have access to. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4417.58s)]
*  And I just don't think they understand that it's a political pawn. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4421.7s)]
*  I don't think they understand. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4424.74s)]
*  This is not done for compassion and kindness. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4426.34s)]
*  No, this is just done to ensure that it stays blue. Correct. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4429.139999999999s)]
*  And it's essentially a bribery with your tax dollars. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4433.66s)]
*  Yes. This is why that the dams will not even [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4436.38s)]
*  deport criminals. Yeah. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4442.9s)]
*  Because every criminal deported is a lost vote. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4446.46s)]
*  So even even if somebody is [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4449.78s)]
*  an illegal with a criminal record and commits crime in America, [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4451.78s)]
*  they are still still were not being deported. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4456.26s)]
*  And then on top of that, California made it actually illegal [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4460.3s)]
*  to ask for ID when people vote. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4463.98s)]
*  Yes. California and New York. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4466.099999999999s)]
*  You are not allowed to show your ID when you vote. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4468.62s)]
*  I just want to be clear. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4472.78s)]
*  So one understands this in California, New York. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4473.9s)]
*  You are not allowed to show your ID even if you want to. Right. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4476.42s)]
*  Why would that ever be a good idea? [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4481.78s)]
*  I mean, what would you want to do? [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4485.58s)]
*  If you're trying to do if you're trying to facilitate fraud in elections, [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4489.0199999999995s)]
*  it's a great idea. That's the only reason. Yes. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4491.86s)]
*  There's no other reason logically why that would be a good idea. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4493.98s)]
*  It's for fraud. It's like it's like, wake up, sheeple. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4497.9s)]
*  Wake up. Hello. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4502.179999999999s)]
*  Like, let's say you wanted to commit fraud. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4504.54s)]
*  What are the things you would do? [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4505.86s)]
*  Yeah, you would say you don't need ID and you can mail in your ballot. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4507.179999999999s)]
*  And we'll give you free health care. Yes. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4511.38s)]
*  Stay here. Yes. Stay here. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4513.46s)]
*  I know it's on fire, but stay here. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4515.46s)]
*  I mean, in this case, it being on fire is not just a metaphor in California. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4517.34s)]
*  OK, it's just like goddamn [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4521.5s)]
*  entire neighborhoods burning down. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4525.5s)]
*  It's just once they allowed people to vote that are not legal in California. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4526.78s)]
*  Once you if you're if you're going to do that, it's it's over. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4534.06s)]
*  Exactly. There's there's no coming back from that. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4537.860000000001s)]
*  The numbers are just no. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4540.42s)]
*  People are so indoctrinated to there's so many people that no matter what, [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4541.9800000000005s)]
*  they think voting Republican means you're an asshole. Yes. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4545.7s)]
*  And they won't do it. They won't do it. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4548.9400000000005s)]
*  They they'll put their fucking rainbow flag on their porch [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4550.7s)]
*  and they'll just ride it right into the beach. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4553.06s)]
*  Civilizational suicide. Yeah. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4555.14s)]
*  Right to the rocks. Bang. Crash the boat. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4557.3s)]
*  I mean, there's a guy who reports on X is great. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4559.9800000000005s)]
*  God's God's God. Yeah. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4563.7s)]
*  Friend of mine. Oh, he's great. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4565.62s)]
*  I guess punch time. Yeah, he's awesome. Yeah, it's great. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4566.820000000001s)]
*  And he talks about, you know, basically suicidal empathy. Mm hmm. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4569.780000000001s)]
*  Like if there's like there's so much empathy that you actually suicide yourself. Yeah. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4574.34s)]
*  So that we've got civilizational suicidal empathy going on. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4581.34s)]
*  And it's like, I believe in empathy, like I think you should care about other people, [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4586.22s)]
*  but you need to have empathy for for civilization as a whole [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4588.900000000001s)]
*  and not commit to a civilizational suicide. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4591.700000000001s)]
*  Also, don't let someone use your empathy against you [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4594.06s)]
*  so they can completely control your state and then do an insanely bad job [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4597.22s)]
*  of managing it and never get removed. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4601.66s)]
*  Because the fundamental weakness of Western civilization is empathy. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4604.58s)]
*  The empathy exploit that they're they're it's they're exploiting [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4611.740000000001s)]
*  a bug in Western civilization, which is the empathy response. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4616.62s)]
*  So and I think empathy is good, [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4622.46s)]
*  but you need to think it through and not just be [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4625.98s)]
*  programmed like a robot. Right. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4629.58s)]
*  Understand when empathy has been actually used as a tool. A tool. Yes. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4631.0599999999995s)]
*  Like that is weaponized empathy. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4634.7s)]
*  Yeah. Is the issue. Yeah. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4638.3s)]
*  Weaponized empathy. And yeah. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4640.54s)]
*  And it's also the rigid adherence to that liberal ideology. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4644.0599999999995s)]
*  Like you can't switch sides over there like California. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4647.3s)]
*  If you're a part of that whole tech, Hollywood, entertainment, [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4651.18s)]
*  any any of those circles, you're on the left. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4655.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. Almost wholly, almost completely. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4659.22s)]
*  It's borderline illegal to be a Republican in California. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4662.900000000001s)]
*  Like in San Francisco or L.A., it's borderline illegal to be a Republican. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4667.66s)]
*  You certainly shunned. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4670.900000000001s)]
*  No, I look I mean, like San Francisco, you could shoot heroin [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4672.58s)]
*  while taking a dump on the mayor's car in front of City Hall. OK. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4676.860000000001s)]
*  And and that and nothing would happen to you. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4680.82s)]
*  But if you walk down the street with a mega hat, you're going to get attacked. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4685.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's insane. Yeah, it's. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4690.82s)]
*  But it's also so Orwellian that a hat that says make America great again [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4693.9s)]
*  would cause people to have a violent reaction. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4699.34s)]
*  Like, aren't you American? [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4702.3s)]
*  Wouldn't just just as a whole, like the saying, [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4703.78s)]
*  wouldn't that be a good thing for everyone? [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4707.139999999999s)]
*  Make America great again. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4709.14s)]
*  But because it's attached to Donald Trump and that red hat, [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4711.1s)]
*  you'll get maced for wearing that red hat. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4714.1s)]
*  They will make America worse by beating you. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4717.700000000001s)]
*  So it's like it's an evil thing they're doing. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4721.3s)]
*  A violent assault in America because you want to make America great again. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4724.46s)]
*  I mean, it's like a scene in a book. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4730.740000000001s)]
*  It doesn't it doesn't seem like it could be that ridiculous. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4732.58s)]
*  Like, remember when All Lives Matter would get you fired? [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4737.219999999999s)]
*  Which is insane. Insane. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4740.099999999999s)]
*  People got fired because they said all lives matter. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4742.099999999999s)]
*  Which is a very reasonable thing to say. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4745.54s)]
*  How reasonable is that? [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4747.7s)]
*  Yes, that's essentially saying everybody matters. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4749.099999999999s)]
*  But that's not what you're saying. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4752.219999999999s)]
*  That's not what you were supposed to say. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4754.179999999999s)]
*  You had to say black lives matter, which, of course, they do. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4756.099999999999s)]
*  If you say all lives matter, everybody matters. Yes. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4758.54s)]
*  But the idea of being a colorblind society was completely abandoned [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4761.9s)]
*  somewhere around 2012 ish. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4765.78s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I sort of can trace it to when when did the the gun emoji get nerfed? [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4768.42s)]
*  You know, when did it turn into a squirt gun? [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4773.139999999999s)]
*  That was a couple of years ago. It was like 2016, I think. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4775.5s)]
*  Was it? Yeah. Yeah. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4778.34s)]
*  We gave a squirt gun. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4779.78s)]
*  Did you bring it back to X? [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4782.3s)]
*  Yeah, no, no. Right now, if you use a gun emoji on X, [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4784.0199999999995s)]
*  the Apple will insist that it be a squirt gun. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4788.74s)]
*  And then the X app turns it back into a 1911. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4792.58s)]
*  Oh, really? Yeah. Oh, that's great. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4796.86s)]
*  So you can you can actually, you know, have a 1911 gun. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4798.9s)]
*  We reverted the Apple change inside the app. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4804.94s)]
*  That's hilarious. That's hilarious. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4808.86s)]
*  That it's that thing so offensive, the gun and then the pregnant man. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4810.78s)]
*  Both of those got me. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4814.9s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4818.94s)]
*  I mean, I like that meme where it's like the people telling you [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4820.18s)]
*  that what you're hearing is this information or the same people [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4823.22s)]
*  that did the pregnant man emoji. Yes. Yeah. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4826.0199999999995s)]
*  Think about that. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4828.86s)]
*  Yeah. Well, also the same people that say a woman attacked a Tesla factory. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4830.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. The woman is a dude to dude. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4836.38s)]
*  Like really obvious dude. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4838.74s)]
*  Really big looking, mentally ill dude. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4841.1s)]
*  Yeah. Mentally ill dude with a wig on. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4843.14s)]
*  Say that. Yes. Yeah. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4845.26s)]
*  But NBC, even Fox. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4846.82s)]
*  You're looking at the picture and you're like, yo, this is got a this. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4849.5s)]

*  He's wearing woman face. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4855.86s)]
*  This is a buff. It's a buff dude. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4857.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's a buff dude wearing woman face. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4860.62s)]
*  I mean, come on. That's not that's not a woman. Yeah. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4863.139999999999s)]
*  And they're like saying watch out for disinformation. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4866.66s)]
*  I'm like, what are you talking about? [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4869.38s)]
*  So crazy bullshit. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4871.0199999999995s)]
*  I mean, it's just more evidence of the virus, though, right? [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4873.139999999999s)]
*  Like it killed objectivity, killed reality, [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4876.0199999999995s)]
*  and it demanded strict adherence or you were attacked. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4879.46s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4884.219999999999s)]
*  Any questioning of it would result in being ostracized. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4885.9s)]
*  Do you what kind of responsibility do you feel like [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4889.58s)]
*  knowing that if you didn't take over Twitter and turn it into X, [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4893.379999999999s)]
*  if that didn't happen. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4897.98s)]
*  Like the I really think the world's a very different place right now. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4900.099999999999s)]
*  Like how long have you owned it for? [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4905.22s)]
*  Two couple years. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4907.0599999999995s)]
*  Basically, imagine imagine a couple years of it being run [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4907.74s)]
*  the way it was run before and probably accelerating. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4911.5s)]
*  I mean, my account would have been suspended long ago. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4914.42s)]
*  For sure. Yeah, for sure. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4917.86s)]
*  Yeah, just for the disinformation. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4919.94s)]
*  Yeah, it would have been trouble to never come back. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4923.0599999999995s)]
*  Alex Jones had definitely never been back. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4927.139999999999s)]
*  Definitely not. No, no. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4929.26s)]
*  So. Yeah. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4932.34s)]
*  Does that weigh on you? [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4936.14s)]
*  Like, I would feel like that would be a fucking heavy responsibility. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4937.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4942.26s)]
*  I mean, I'm just trying to keep civilization going here, you know, for longer. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4944.58s)]
*  So. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4951.54s)]
*  I think we at least want to build a city on Mars [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4955.5s)]
*  and become a multi planet civilization, [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4958.46s)]
*  which I think would be incredibly important [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4964.38s)]
*  in ensuring the long term survival of civilization. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4967.9800000000005s)]
*  Are you still rescuing those people that are stuck in the space station? [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4973.3s)]
*  Yeah, it's coming up in a couple of weeks. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4976.5s)]
*  Whoa. They've been up there for how long, Jamie? [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4978.34s)]
*  They were supposed to be there for a couple of days, right? [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4981.74s)]
*  I think actually for like four weeks. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4983.38s)]
*  Oh, they're supposed to be there. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4985.5s)]
*  They were supposed to be up there for like eight days. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4986.46s)]
*  Yeah. And they've been up there for like eight months. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4988.22s)]
*  So a little longer than expected. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4992.02s)]
*  Fuck. Yeah. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4993.58s)]
*  What is it going to be like for those people when they get back? [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4995.1s)]
*  They're going to be a wreck for a long time, right? [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4997.02s)]
*  Yeah. If you'd long you stay up there, you get, you know, sort of in zero [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=4998.900000000001s)]
*  you get increased bone loss. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5002.46s)]
*  So it ended up being like this political football [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5003.820000000001s)]
*  and sort of sort of hotly contested topic. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5009.42s)]
*  We offered to bring them back early. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5014.820000000001s)]
*  This offer was rejected by the Biden administration. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5016.3s)]
*  Why? For political reasons. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5019.58s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5021.78s)]
*  There's no way that they're going to make anyone who's supporting Trump look good. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5023.18s)]
*  Wow. What do you think they would have done if they had won? [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5027.42s)]
*  Well, they get those people back. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5034.06s)]
*  No, they can only get them back with with a space spacecraft, [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5035.26s)]
*  but they pushed the return date past the inauguration date. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5038.42s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5042.9400000000005s)]
*  So they would have let you do it, but after the while. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5045.54s)]
*  And so it would have been them authorizing you. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5051.34s)]
*  There isn't anyone else to do it. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5053.46s)]
*  NASA can't get them. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5056.3s)]
*  The only the only the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft is the only one [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5058.3s)]
*  that is considered safe enough to bring them back. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5062.5s)]
*  So NASA concluded that the Boeing spacecraft was not safe. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5065.26s)]
*  So that's why they're stuck there. Holy shit. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5070.22s)]
*  Yeah. And you can't ask Russia to help. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5073.219999999999s)]
*  That would be awkward. A little bit. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5075.42s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Be a nice thing if they did. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5077.38s)]
*  This is guys will help. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5079.38s)]
*  I think that for enough money, they would. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5081.9s)]
*  You think so? Yeah. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5084.219999999999s)]
*  But they would they would obviously treat it as a propaganda victory and charge crazy money. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5086.3s)]
*  It's just disgusting that they would use that as a political tool. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5093.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5097.58s)]
*  And so well, they were also the Biden administration was also suing SpaceX. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5100.339999999999s)]
*  They had this massive lawsuit against SpaceX for [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5106.66s)]
*  SpaceX not hiring asylum seekers. Right. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5110.9s)]
*  So people like say like, oh, Elon's making it up. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5113.9s)]
*  This Biden administration wasn't against SpaceX. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5117.139999999999s)]
*  I'm like, bro, the Department of Justice had a massive lawsuit against SpaceX [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5119.339999999999s)]
*  for not hiring asylum seekers, even though it is illegal for us to hire [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5125.299999999999s)]
*  anyone who is not a permanent resident. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5129.339999999999s)]
*  So it is both this law that says you have to hire asylum seekers. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5132.0599999999995s)]
*  But there's also a law that says anyone hired by a rocket company, [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5136.219999999999s)]
*  which is an advanced weapons technology, must be a permanent resident. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5141.179999999999s)]
*  And if an asylum seeker is not a permanent resident. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5145.9s)]
*  So it is both legal and illegal to hire asylum seekers. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5148.459999999999s)]
*  So why would the Biden administration launch a massive lawsuit [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5154.7s)]
*  again, this is public information. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5158.98s)]
*  It's not like my imagination. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5160.5s)]
*  Why would they launch to such a massive lawsuit against SpaceX? [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5164.259999999999s)]
*  They're extremely antagonistic. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5167.94s)]
*  It just doesn't make any sense that that could ever even get past [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5173.099999999999s)]
*  the first day of someone looking at it, if it's both illegal [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5177.54s)]
*  and you're trying to enforce it like you can enforce it. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5181.78s)]
*  Yes. This is an advanced weapons company. This is crazy. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5184.74s)]
*  It should be like this. Throw this out. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5187.62s)]
*  In fact, there's like international traffic and arms regulations is like [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5190.14s)]
*  a law that is there to ensure that [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5194.46s)]
*  if only permanent residents of the United States can work at advanced weapons [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5198.54s)]
*  companies, rockets are advanced weapons. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5203.9800000000005s)]
*  So the same is true of like if it's like nuclear or, you know, some like, [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5207.780000000001s)]
*  you know, bioweapon thing or something like that. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5212.14s)]
*  So because obviously, if someone were to work at SpaceX [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5215.58s)]
*  and then go leave and go to North Korea or Iran, they could build [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5220.1s)]
*  missile technology that could, you know, destroy the United States. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5224.26s)]
*  So that's why, you know, a lot of higher people who want permanent residents. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5229.66s)]
*  It's logical. Logical. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5232.9s)]
*  So is that lawsuit still pending? [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5234.5s)]
*  I wish it was just dismissed. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5236.94s)]
*  How long was it going on for? [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5240.58s)]
*  A couple of years. Holy shit. Yeah. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5241.9s)]
*  That's the other thing that drives me crazy, like that people don't understand [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5246.38s)]
*  that if you sanctioned lawfare like that, if you sanctioned [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5250.74s)]
*  attacking your political enemies, someone's going to do that to you. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5254.14s)]
*  Like if the wrong people get in office, if new people get not four years [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5258.0599999999995s)]
*  from now, eight years from now, who knows who it's going to be. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5262.86s)]
*  You've already set a precedent. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5265.82s)]
*  You've already attacked someone charged him with 34 felonies [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5267.78s)]
*  where they're really just misdemeanors. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5271.34s)]
*  And they're also past the statute of limitation. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5273.14s)]
*  And now you're talking all over the news that this is a convicted felon, [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5276.34s)]
*  convicted felon. They kept saying convicted felon, convicted felon. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5281.3s)]
*  And everybody knows what it is. Yes. It's terrifying. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5284.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's terrifying. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5287.900000000001s)]
*  They could do it so brazenly to a guy who was the president for four years. Right. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5288.62s)]
*  That lawsuit was funded by Reid Hoffman, who is a major dam donor. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5296.3s)]
*  And also an F-stein client. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5300.34s)]
*  The plot thickens. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5302.1s)]
*  The plot thickens. Jesus Christ. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5303.1s)]
*  Yes. It's just. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5305.54s)]
*  It's so blatant. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5310.9800000000005s)]
*  It's like so obvious, the SpaceX lawsuit, the Trump stuff, it's just it's so obvious. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5311.9800000000005s)]
*  Yes. Like known F-stein clients [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5316.82s)]
*  who are obviously extremely powerful, [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5320.18s)]
*  powerful politically and [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5323.18s)]
*  very wealthy are, you know, Bill Gates, [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5325.9400000000005s)]
*  Bill Clinton and Reid Hoffman. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5331.14s)]
*  And some others, too. But those three. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5334.780000000001s)]
*  So, you know, why was Reid Hoffman so intent on destroying Trump? [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5338.62s)]
*  You think it's because they're worried about the list coming out? [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5345.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5349.42s)]
*  I think it's because they're worried about the list coming out. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5350.42s)]
*  Yeah, one of the reasons. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5352.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5356.74s)]
*  So, I mean, I'm like, this is, you know, yeah. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5358.74s)]
*  It's so frustrating to be sitting in a situation where the list isn't coming out. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5363.139999999999s)]
*  Well, better come out. I mean, hopefully tomorrow. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5367.74s)]
*  Well, I mean, why did they release bullshit today? [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5369.74s)]
*  What's the point in giving these people like a happy folder to wave around in front of the camera with nothing in it that's new? [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5372.74s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. It's not encouraging. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5378.74s)]
*  Like I said, it's the tough thing that they've got is, you know, they've been made captain of a ship with a hostile crew. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5383.74s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5390.74s)]
*  So they don't have like, you know, so like you have like magical powers. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5391.74s)]
*  You get made captain of a ship with a hostile crew. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5395.74s)]
*  You still have a hostile crew. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5398.74s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5399.74s)]
*  You've got to bring in people who are going to be, you know, [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5400.74s)]
*  helpful as opposed to obstructionist. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5404.74s)]
*  Right. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5406.74s)]
*  So, but yeah, I think the public will be rightly frustrated if there is, if no one is prosecuted for the FD and client list, no one at all, which, you know, [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5410.74s)]
*  Like, like at least, I don't know, the top five or something. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5420.74s)]
*  Like some number should, there should at least be an attempted prosecution of the worst offenders. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5425.74s)]
*  Well, particularly if Galen Maxwell is in jail for sex trafficking. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5431.74s)]
*  I think that's a good question. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5435.74s)]
*  I think that's a good question, too. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5436.74s)]
*  You know, I think the law is a good question. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5437.74s)]
*  I think that's a good question. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5439.74s)]
*  I think that's a good question. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5441.74s)]
*  there should at least be an attempted prosecution [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5442.74s)]
*  of the worst offenders. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5445.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, particularly if Ghislaine Maxwell is in jail [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5447.139999999999s)]
*  for sex trafficking. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5449.5s)]
*  Yes. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5450.86s)]
*  Well, trafficking to who? [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5451.62s)]
*  That means sex trafficking occurred. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5452.58s)]
*  Right. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5454.139999999999s)]
*  So she's in jail for it. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5454.82s)]
*  Yes. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5456.58s)]
*  So to... [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5457.0599999999995s)]
*  Who were the clients? [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5459.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5460.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, how do you put someone in jail [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5461.54s)]
*  and you don't even name the clients? [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5463.139999999999s)]
*  That sounds kind of insane. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5464.78s)]
*  I think, yes, it would. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5466.82s)]
*  Yes, because... [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5470.54s)]
*  It's just stunning that they've been able to hold it back [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5471.06s)]
*  for so long. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5473.42s)]
*  It's really kind of amazing. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5475.1s)]
*  Yes. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5476.26s)]
*  Like when people say that people can't keep secrets, [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5477.38s)]
*  what the fuck are you talking about? [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5479.38s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5480.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, a bunch of these things are not like... [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5482.540000000001s)]
*  It's common knowledge, but we just... [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5486.3s)]
*  We don't actually have the proof. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5488.1s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5489.46s)]
*  So the proof is there. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5490.860000000001s)]
*  I mean, there's lots of videos. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5492.34s)]
*  Yeah, there's lots of... [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5498.18s)]
*  I mean, the dude is like a mountain of... [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5499.5s)]
*  Whenever they raided Epstein's place, [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5503.22s)]
*  there would have been a mountain of evidence. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5505.46s)]
*  Where is that mountain? [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5507.18s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5508.22s)]
*  What'd you do with it? [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5508.9800000000005s)]
*  Yes. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5509.82s)]
*  Like who took possession of the evidence, specifically? [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5511.18s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5514.02s)]
*  The individuals. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5514.42s)]
*  Where are the tapes? [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5515.06s)]
*  Yes. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5516.38s)]
*  How many levels of clearance do I have to get [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5516.82s)]
*  to get into the vault? [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5518.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5520.3s)]
*  Well... [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5522.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5526.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5527.94s)]
*  You know, what we need are people who are really good [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5530.42s)]
*  with computers. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5532.66s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5534.66s)]
*  And really good with technology. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5535.5s)]
*  Was this Jamie? [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5536.54s)]
*  I just remember seeing this photo. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5537.34s)]
*  It's FDS5. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5538.9400000000005s)]
*  That's when they raided his home? [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5539.58s)]
*  They were. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5540.78s)]
*  That's when they're on the island? [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5541.46s)]
*  They were there then. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5542.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5543.82s)]
*  They got everything, I'm sure. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5544.46s)]
*  I mean, there must have been so much stuff on that island. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5546.18s)]
*  There must have been. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5548.9800000000005s)]
*  And if it wasn't there, where was it? [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5550.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5551.58s)]
*  It has to be uploaded somewhere. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5553.46s)]
*  There has to be some sort of a chain of evidence [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5555.26s)]
*  or chain of custody. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5557.62s)]
*  There's got to be a mountain of evidence. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5558.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5561.139999999999s)]
*  The other thing they're going to talk about is UAPs. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5562.5s)]
*  They're going to release all the UAP information. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5564.94s)]
*  So you're the guy to ask about this. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5567.379999999999s)]
*  What if any possibility is there that there [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5569.98s)]
*  is some sort of advanced propulsion system technology [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5574.82s)]
*  that's being worked on in secret? [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5577.94s)]
*  And that they're trying to cover this up [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5581.62s)]
*  with this talk of aliens and alien tech [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5583.98s)]
*  and not of this world. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5587.42s)]
*  And is it possible that there's some sort of very secret program [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5588.74s)]
*  that's going on in cahoots with some defense contractors that [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5594.9s)]
*  are developing advanced propulsion systems that they're [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5599.9400000000005s)]
*  using for these drones? [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5602.7s)]
*  I mean, SpaceX, my company SpaceX [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5607.86s)]
*  has the most advanced rocket technology in the world. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5613.9s)]
*  I think I'd know. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5616.42s)]
*  Right. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5617.86s)]
*  And to the best of my knowledge, there is not any magic. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5620.5s)]
*  There's not some super advanced propulsion technology. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5623.3s)]
*  There have been people who have theorized [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5627.42s)]
*  different gravity drives and different things. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5630.06s)]
*  Is there anything that's ever gotten [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5632.7s)]
*  past the theoretical stage? [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5634.38s)]
*  No. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5637.26s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5637.78s)]
*  Well, there's nothing even that I'm [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5638.58s)]
*  aware of that works in theory. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5640.14s)]
*  Mm. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5642.34s)]
*  It's not like I would like this to exist, to be clear. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5642.82s)]
*  I would like this to exist. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5647.54s)]
*  And I have the, from a security clearance standpoint, [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5649.860000000001s)]
*  I have top, top secret. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5655.14s)]
*  I have an equivalent of an all access pass from a security [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5657.54s)]
*  clearance standpoint. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5661.62s)]
*  So I don't think they're hiding it from me, basically. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5662.9800000000005s)]
*  I don't think they could. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5668.46s)]
*  Unless it's completely in these weapons manufacturing [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5671.54s)]
*  corporations. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5676.7s)]
*  I mean, I know these weapons manufacturing companies, [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5677.58s)]
*  like Boeing, Lockheed, and Northrop. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5680.42s)]
*  I mean, yeah, they do some interesting things. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5682.26s)]
*  But they do not have, there's no breakthrough that they have. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5684.94s)]
*  So I'm confident they do not have a breakthrough. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5690.3s)]
*  When you hear people like, why don't they just [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5692.22s)]
*  compete with SpaceX and make a better rocket, in which case, [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5693.9800000000005s)]
*  they can make it. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5697.46s)]
*  Why are they holding back on making a lot of money [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5698.66s)]
*  from beating SpaceX with better rockets? [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5702.099999999999s)]
*  My thought was that, what if it's just a drone [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5705.0599999999995s)]
*  and you can't have a biological entity inside of it, [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5708.66s)]
*  because it just bursts from the fucking speed [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5711.5s)]
*  that it's moving at? [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5713.86s)]
*  That a human couldn't tolerate the amount of force. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5716.46s)]
*  So they're just drones. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5720.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5722.82s)]
*  So what do you think people like Ryan Graves and Commander [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5723.5s)]
*  David Schaefer? [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5726.78s)]
*  I want cool things to exist. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5727.3s)]
*  Like, say, do I want UFOs to exist? [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5728.58s)]
*  Yes, I want UFOs to exist, because that would [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5732.38s)]
*  be really interesting. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5734.22s)]
*  Of course, everybody does. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5735.02s)]
*  It would be cool. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5736.18s)]
*  It's a more boring world where UFOs don't exist. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5737.78s)]
*  Or like, advanced propulsion stuff doesn't exist. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5740.58s)]
*  If it doesn't exist, that's more boring. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5746.38s)]
*  I'd like it to be more interesting. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5747.9800000000005s)]
*  If it did exist, I'd like it to exist. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5749.54s)]
*  I hope we find something. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5752.22s)]
*  But I have not seen, like, SpaceX launches 90% [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5753.58s)]
*  of all satellite mass to orbit. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5761.58s)]
*  So if you take all of Earth's rocket launches, [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5764.82s)]
*  my company has a 90% market share of Earth. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5769.78s)]
*  China does about 5%. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5773.62s)]
*  And the rest of the world does, including the Boeing Lockheed [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5775.94s)]
*  and Northrop and everyone, does 5%. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5778.82s)]
*  So why wouldn't they use this to defeat SpaceX? [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5782.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5793.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5793.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it makes sense. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5795.9400000000005s)]
*  No, listen, that's why I asked you. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5796.9800000000005s)]
*  It would make sense. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5799.26s)]
*  What do you think these people are seeing? [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5800.38s)]
*  We're launching a rocket every two days. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5802.14s)]
*  But what do you think these people are seeing? [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5803.38s)]
*  When you have reliable people like Commander David [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5805.22s)]
*  who had that infamous TikTok experience off the coast [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5809.06s)]
*  of San Diego, where they got this thing on video. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5813.860000000001s)]
*  They tracked it going 50,000 feet above sea level [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5816.900000000001s)]
*  to 50 feet in like a second. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5819.38s)]
*  OK. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5821.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5821.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5822.580000000001s)]
*  And then they also have video evidence [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5823.1s)]
*  of this thing accelerating at a great speed. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5825.26s)]
*  Eyewitness accounts of two different jets. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5827.9800000000005s)]
*  Sure. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5831.580000000001s)]
*  I mean, does anyone have a high res video or photo [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5832.06s)]
*  of this thing? [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5838.580000000001s)]
*  Well, there's a video of this thing [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5839.5s)]
*  where they're locked onto it. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5841.1s)]
*  And then it takes off. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5842.54s)]
*  It shoots off. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5843.900000000001s)]
*  Is it high res? [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5844.580000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5845.42s)]
*  No, it's like whatever the systems they [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5845.900000000001s)]
*  used on fighter jets in 2004. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5848.820000000001s)]
*  Essentially like Windows 95. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5851.580000000001s)]
*  I mean, somebody did a curve of the resolution of UFOs [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5852.900000000001s)]
*  and the resolution of cameras. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5856.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5857.58s)]
*  The UFO resolution has stayed flat, [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5860.0599999999995s)]
*  despite megapixels and cameras going super high. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5862.38s)]
*  Well, according to Christopher Mellon. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5865.86s)]
*  Why are they still blurry? [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5867.3s)]
*  Christopher Mellon, who worked in the State Department, [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5868.38s)]
*  said that they have high resolution photos and videos [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5870.62s)]
*  of these things. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5873.98s)]
*  And that's all that he's seen. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5874.58s)]
*  It's all locked away. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5876.26s)]
*  Whenever people say that to me, I'm like, [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5877.22s)]
*  don't even tell me that then. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5879.0199999999995s)]
*  Just leak it for God's sake. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5880.9s)]
*  Put it out there. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5882.34s)]
*  Let it slip. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5883.78s)]
*  Yes. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5885.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5885.9s)]
*  There's a couple of photos. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5887.62s)]
*  They're grainy. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5888.7s)]
*  There's not one thing that I've ever looked at and go, [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5889.740000000001s)]
*  holy fuck, that's it. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5891.900000000001s)]
*  That's what I've been looking for. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5893.26s)]
*  You could ask our Grok AI right now [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5894.58s)]
*  to create a high res image of an alien spacecraft over Orson. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5895.9800000000005s)]
*  And it's going to do a great job. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5903.9400000000005s)]
*  So why would we not have at least that? [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5906.18s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5909.34s)]
*  Yeah, but I want to believe that's the problem. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5911.780000000001s)]
*  My brain starts going, oh, come on. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5913.740000000001s)]
*  This is no fun. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5915.9400000000005s)]
*  I want it to be real. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5917.18s)]
*  I want there to be at least be some advanced propulsion [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5918.9400000000005s)]
*  system. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5922.06s)]
*  If not, what are all these people seeing? [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5922.740000000001s)]
*  If we're not being occasionally visited by things that [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5925.860000000001s)]
*  are smart enough to hide. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5929.06s)]
*  We might be. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5930.54s)]
*  I just thought these aliens are very subtle. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5931.3s)]
*  Yeah, you keep saying that. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5932.9800000000005s)]
*  It's a good line. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5934.42s)]
*  It's a solid line because it's pretty accurate. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5936.58s)]
*  I just want to see some high res video of aliens. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5939.780000000001s)]
*  How are they just evading all the cameras? [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5942.22s)]
*  If you think about that and the ones that you do get them on, [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5944.86s)]
*  it's just like some far away light that's moving weird. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5947.74s)]
*  And it could be a lot of things. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5950.5s)]
*  But I want to believe. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5952.62s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there have been multiple times [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5954.66s)]
*  where the Air Force and Navy has called SpaceX [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5958.58s)]
*  and said they think they've seen aliens. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5963.339999999999s)]
*  And we're like, was it at this time, [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5965.54s)]
*  on this date, in this location? [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5967.7s)]
*  They're like, yes, how do you know? [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5969.42s)]
*  That's us. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5970.82s)]
*  That's a lot of that. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5972.7s)]
*  That's our satellites. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5973.54s)]
*  They're like, no, they're not. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5975.42s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, they're definitely our satellites. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5976.86s)]
*  Oh, yeah, people see the SpaceX satellites all the time. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5978.66s)]
*  Blizzing by. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5980.82s)]
*  They're our satellites. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5981.86s)]
*  And they are moving at 16,000 miles an hour. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5982.9s)]
*  So it's pretty fast. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5987.18s)]
*  And there's also stuff that the United States government does [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5991.14s)]
*  have that gets mistaken for UFOs. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5993.66s)]
*  I remember the first time I saw a stealth bomber. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5995.9800000000005s)]
*  We were filming Fear Factor. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5998.18s)]
*  It was right after 2003, right after the war [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=5999.3s)]
*  had broken off. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6003.98s)]
*  And they were flying a stealth bomber down in Palmdale. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6004.98s)]
*  I was like, holy shit. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6008.62s)]
*  If I didn't know what that was, I would 100% [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6010.259999999999s)]
*  think that's from another world. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6012.98s)]
*  When you see that thing flying, fucking cool. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6014.62s)]
*  Really cool. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6017.58s)]
*  I mean, it doesn't look like a human's. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6018.78s)]
*  It looks like something from Battlestar Galactica. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6021.219999999999s)]
*  It does look awesome. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6023.94s)]
*  I mean, they're not stealthy against any advanced radar [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6026.099999999999s)]
*  system, by the way. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6029.94s)]
*  It doesn't work. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6030.82s)]
*  It doesn't work anymore? [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6031.54s)]
*  It doesn't work, no. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6032.379999999999s)]
*  Was it old school stuff? [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6033.22s)]
*  They're only stealthy against old radars. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6034.42s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6038.62s)]
*  I mean, you can still see them. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6040.46s)]
*  Like, they're not invisible. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6041.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6042.740000000001s)]
*  They're not like, oh, it's not like a cloaking [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6044.9800000000005s)]
*  device from Star Trek. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6048.62s)]
*  Did you see when me and Lex, we watched the rocket get caught [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6050.1s)]
*  live while it was happening? [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6055.66s)]
*  That, to me, was one of the first to see it actually. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6058.58s)]
*  I've seen videos of it happen, but to see it actually live [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6062.1s)]
*  was one of the coolest fucking things. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6066.14s)]
*  You're like, wow, we are in the future. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6067.900000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6070.820000000001s)]
*  I mean, nobody else can do that. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6072.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's true. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6075.660000000001s)]
*  Nobody else could do that. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6076.780000000001s)]
*  That's fact. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6079.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6080.46s)]
*  It's pretty wild. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6081.22s)]
*  It's because I'm an alien. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6082.900000000001s)]
*  This time you knew. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6084.14s)]
*  I thought about it. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6085.06s)]
*  I'm an alien, and I keep telling people I'm an alien, [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6086.06s)]
*  but they don't believe me. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6088.3s)]
*  I believe you. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6089.3s)]
*  OK, thank you. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6089.9400000000005s)]
*  I believe you. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6090.700000000001s)]
*  That's my suspicion all along. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6091.58s)]
*  Was it you were an alien? [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6094.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm just trying to get back to my home planet. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6095.1s)]
*  Is it you're a friendly alien? [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6096.22s)]
*  It's nothing wrong with aliens. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6097.62s)]
*  I like people from everywhere, even other planets. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6098.86s)]
*  What's next? [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6101.98s)]
*  Now that you can do that and you can catch rockets, [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6103.14s)]
*  what's the ultimate expression of rocket technology? [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6105.3s)]
*  Like, what comes after this? [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6109.14s)]
*  Well, I mean, the fundamental breakthrough [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6114.1s)]
*  we're aiming for at SpaceX is a fully and rapidly reusable [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6117.42s)]
*  orbital rocket, where both stages are fully and rapidly [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6120.94s)]
*  reusable. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6125.379999999999s)]
*  With our Falcon rocket, we are able to reuse the main stage [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6125.98s)]
*  and the nose cone, but we're not able to reuse the upper stage. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6129.379999999999s)]
*  And it still takes us at least a few days [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6135.7s)]
*  from when the main stage lands to when we can fly it again. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6139.78s)]
*  So it's not fully reusable because we [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6143.82s)]
*  lose the upper stage, which costs $10 million to build. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6149.18s)]
*  And then the main stage, it's not as reusable [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6153.62s)]
*  as an aircraft. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6159.22s)]
*  You can't just refuel it and fly. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6159.900000000001s)]
*  It requires work for a couple of days. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6162.900000000001s)]
*  But the Starship design is the first design [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6168.38s)]
*  that is capable of full and rapid reusability, where [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6173.18s)]
*  that is one of the possible outcomes. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6176.78s)]
*  And once you have full and rapid reusability, [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6181.219999999999s)]
*  the cost of access to space drops by a factor of 100. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6183.78s)]
*  It's like 100 times cheaper. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6188.62s)]
*  By some metrics, it's 1,000 times cheaper. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6193.86s)]
*  And then when you factor in orbital refilling, [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6196.98s)]
*  so you refill on orbit, it can drop the cost of going, [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6204.14s)]
*  cost per ton, to the surface of Mars by a factor of 10,000. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6209.26s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6215.700000000001s)]
*  So what has to improve in order to make it reusable? [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6217.660000000001s)]
*  Well, there's some. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6220.9s)]
*  Like, we're pretty close to being able to rapidly reuse [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6230.9s)]
*  the booster for Starship. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6234.54s)]
*  That's why it comes back and gets caught by the arms. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6238.179999999999s)]
*  And then the arms place it back in the launch mount. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6241.379999999999s)]
*  So now, there's still a lot of work to be done. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6243.86s)]
*  Now, we have a little bit of engine damage. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6249.82s)]
*  We've got a little bit of heat shield damage. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6254.62s)]
*  There's tweaks that are needed. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6261.179999999999s)]
*  But we're pretty close to achieving full and rapid [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6262.74s)]
*  reusability of the booster. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6265.74s)]
*  The ship, I think we'll achieve reusability [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6269.66s)]
*  of the ship this year. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6275.0599999999995s)]
*  And I think we'll achieve rapid reusability [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6278.14s)]
*  of the whole stack ship and booster next year. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6280.820000000001s)]
*  This is the fundamental breakthrough required for life [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6287.18s)]
*  to become multi-planetary. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6289.9400000000005s)]
*  And what needs to improve in order to make it reusable? [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6292.02s)]
*  What's wrong with it right now? [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6295.700000000001s)]
*  On the ship side, the toughest problem is the heat shield. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6298.18s)]
*  So no one has ever developed a fully reusable orbital heat [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6302.7s)]
*  shield. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6309.58s)]
*  Because when you come in from orbital velocity, [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6310.46s)]
*  you come in like a flaming meteor. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6312.46s)]
*  Like, you're just a raging ball of fire. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6314.099999999999s)]
*  And it's hard to have a heat shield that doesn't partially [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6318.86s)]
*  melt or get destroyed in that process. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6323.98s)]
*  That wasn't a problem we were able to solve with Falcon 9. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6328.9s)]
*  That's why the Alpha Stage burns up on reentry. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6331.9s)]
*  With Starship, the ship portion, you've got the booster [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6337.339999999999s)]
*  and you've got the ship. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6340.86s)]
*  We've got to solve making a fully reusable orbital heat [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6343.78s)]
*  shield, a problem that has never been solved before. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6348.219999999999s)]
*  For a while there, I was like, I'm not sure this is solvable. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6352.58s)]
*  At this point, I think it is solvable. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6355.98s)]
*  It requires detailed iteration on the heat shield tiles. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6359.66s)]
*  I mean, we've vertically integrated [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6366.18s)]
*  the manufacturing of the heat shield tiles [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6367.54s)]
*  because there was no supplier that [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6369.34s)]
*  could provide us with the materials that were needed. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6371.86s)]
*  So you need to make essentially this very fine vermicelli [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6374.58s)]
*  of glass and aluminum oxide fibers. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6387.22s)]
*  Aluminum oxide is basically sapphire. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6393.9400000000005s)]
*  So it's like glass and sapphire, very fine fibers [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6396.22s)]
*  in exactly the right geometry with special coatings [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6400.18s)]
*  in order to have the heat shield tile be reusable, [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6407.26s)]
*  like not melt. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6414.26s)]
*  But not be so brittle that it gets damaged ascent or descent. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6417.34s)]
*  It's kind of like almost the brittleness of a coffee cup [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6425.46s)]
*  type of thing. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6428.38s)]
*  And the rocket's shaking like hell. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6429.78s)]
*  So you've got this thing like, you saw it firsthand. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6431.3s)]
*  Imagine you're at ground zero of that rocket. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6433.82s)]
*  You feel how much shaking it was when you're five miles away. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6436.54s)]
*  Imagine if you're right there. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6440.14s)]
*  So you're shaking these things that [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6442.74s)]
*  are as brittle as a coffee cup, trying not [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6445.0199999999995s)]
*  to have them crack or break, and then not have them melt. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6447.259999999999s)]
*  You've got several thousand of these things. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6453.78s)]
*  And if even a few of them break, that's not reusable. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6459.62s)]
*  So is there innovation that's being [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6463.98s)]
*  done in the materials technology at SpaceX [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6465.58s)]
*  where you're constantly trying to find and tweak [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6468.339999999999s)]
*  a better version of this? [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6470.98s)]
*  Yes. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6472.299999999999s)]
*  It's a very difficult problem. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6474.54s)]
*  It's a problem no one has ever solved. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6475.78s)]
*  So we've got to get the exact right materials combination, [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6477.42s)]
*  the right molecules in the right shape, [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6483.18s)]
*  and then apply that heat shield perfectly to the rocket [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6486.98s)]
*  with no mistakes. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6492.9s)]
*  There's a reason that no one solved this before. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6495.42s)]
*  It's a very difficult problem. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6497.5s)]
*  So like I said, we've had to vertically integrate [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6499.58s)]
*  the entire manufacturing of the tile from basic raw materials [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6504.62s)]
*  to a finished tile. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6509.74s)]
*  Like build the entire supply chain [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6513.26s)]
*  from basic raw materials. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6514.94s)]
*  So you're just inputting silicon and aluminum oxides. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6517.78s)]
*  And what is the difference between the way you guys do it [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6524.78s)]
*  versus the way they used to do it for the space shuttle? [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6527.38s)]
*  Well, I mean, the space shuttle leading edge [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6533.9400000000005s)]
*  used quite dense carbon-carbon tiles. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6541.14s)]
*  They're basically thick and heavy, [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6548.06s)]
*  but also subject to cracking. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6550.9400000000005s)]
*  That's what happens. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6552.22s)]
*  The foam broke off, and it hit the tile, [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6553.58s)]
*  cracked the tile. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6556.38s)]
*  Then on entry, the tiles that had been cracked or broken [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6557.5s)]
*  weren't able to shield the shuttle. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6563.26s)]
*  And so the plasma that got in melted the primary structure [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6564.9800000000005s)]
*  and the whole space shuttle broke apart. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6570.78s)]
*  So you basically can't have something that's as brittle [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6573.86s)]
*  like the space shuttle. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6580.5s)]
*  There's footage of that, right? [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6581.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6582.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6583.46s)]
*  And rain debris over the whole United States. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6586.02s)]
*  And they got almost all the pieces. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6589.26s)]
*  I mean, the full technical explanation [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6593.860000000001s)]
*  would, I think, be understood by about six people listening [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6595.620000000001s)]
*  to this. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6600.42s)]
*  There was a lot of brilliant engineering [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6603.18s)]
*  in the space shuttle tiles. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6604.9800000000005s)]
*  And a bunch of the heat shielding wasn't even tiles. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6608.580000000001s)]
*  It was actually silica blankets, like felt blankets, [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6611.18s)]
*  essentially. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6615.34s)]
*  If you look closely, you'll see they're actually heat blankets, [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6616.42s)]
*  not tiles in some areas. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6620.860000000001s)]
*  But they would have cracked tiles, [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6624.34s)]
*  and occasionally the tiles would fall off. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6626.22s)]
*  There were a few close calls where tiles fell off, [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6628.38s)]
*  but they weren't in a super vulnerable position [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6631.860000000001s)]
*  on the space shuttle. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6634.7s)]
*  So it would take them several months, like eight, nine [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6637.54s)]
*  months, to refurbish a space shuttle between each flight. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6641.06s)]
*  So it was not reusable, really, and it certainly wasn't rapid. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6645.38s)]
*  So like I said, a very hard problem. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6653.46s)]
*  You've also got to sort of attach the tiles in a way [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6662.34s)]
*  that enables the structure underneath to move, [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6665.58s)]
*  to expand and contract, even though you've [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6673.46s)]
*  got these very rigid tiles. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6676.98s)]
*  So like the tanks which take on cryogenic propellant [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6679.86s)]
*  will contract when you put in the cryogenic propellant, [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6687.62s)]
*  but then when you come in and you get very hot, [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6690.98s)]
*  they will expand. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6693.58s)]
*  So now you're contracting and expanding the gap [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6695.14s)]
*  between these rigid tiles. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6698.700000000001s)]
*  But how much? [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6700.9400000000005s)]
*  It varies depending on where you are on the vehicle. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6704.62s)]
*  So if you're in the cryogenic tank section, [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6708.18s)]
*  I mean, you can see like a 10%, 20% difference in the gap. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6715.860000000001s)]
*  Really? [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6719.740000000001s)]
*  It's pretty significant, yeah. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6720.26s)]
*  It's enough that you can't just put all the tile, [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6721.5s)]
*  you can't just jam the tiles together. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6724.3s)]
*  If you actually butted them up, they would all crack [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6727.06s)]
*  because there's too much movement. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6732.06s)]
*  There's also some amount of body bending. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6733.66s)]
*  So as the ship is ascending, when the engines steer, [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6735.9400000000005s)]
*  there's a little bit of movement. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6743.3s)]
*  So if the tiles are too close together, [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6745.26s)]
*  they'll essentially just crack and snap. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6747.18s)]
*  You have to have a gap. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6750.62s)]
*  Like our plane's wings. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6751.900000000001s)]
*  The plane wing will move. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6753.1s)]
*  Plane body will move too. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6755.02s)]
*  Wow. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6757.740000000001s)]
*  You have to have some gap. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6758.660000000001s)]
*  But if you have too much of a gap, [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6759.860000000001s)]
*  then the heat gets past the tile and melts the structure. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6761.22s)]
*  Holy shit. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6770.620000000001s)]
*  It's a hard problem. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6772.14s)]
*  How large are these tiles? [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6773.9400000000005s)]
*  I mean, they're like that big. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6776.06s)]
*  That's it. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6777.780000000001s)]
*  Well, they're not all exactly the same size. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6778.42s)]
*  But yeah, we have sort of a hexagonal tile. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6780.46s)]
*  And they have to essentially be, you [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6783.58s)]
*  can't 3D print the whole thing. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6786.86s)]
*  You can't have one structure. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6788.5s)]
*  It has to be tiles because it has [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6790.5s)]
*  to have that ability to move. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6791.86s)]
*  Well, there's no 3D printer that's, I mean, [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6793.62s)]
*  the biggest ones are maybe three feet. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6795.54s)]
*  You know, there's no, you can't 3D print it. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6799.14s)]
*  Nor would you. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6804.54s)]
*  You have to have something that can move. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6806.34s)]
*  It has to be able to flex. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6809.14s)]
*  Like I said, you've got expansion and contraction. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6812.06s)]
*  You're really dry. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6815.06s)]
*  Like you're putting in liquid oxygen, which is minus 300 [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6815.9400000000005s)]
*  degrees Fahrenheit. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6823.1s)]
*  Actually, we sub-cool it to minus 330 degrees Fahrenheit. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6826.62s)]
*  So it's very cold. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6832.820000000001s)]
*  And then it will be several hundred degrees, [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6834.5s)]
*  maybe 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit potentially on re-entry. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6838.58s)]
*  So you have this huge temperature swing. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6844.38s)]
*  So the thermal expansion is substantial. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6846.62s)]
*  And thermal expansion and contraction [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6850.86s)]
*  combined with body bending. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6853.34s)]
*  So you have to take the worst case, body bending [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6854.9s)]
*  and thermal expansion contraction. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6857.34s)]
*  This is a very hard problem. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6861.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6862.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6863.42s)]
*  Delicate balance. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6864.3s)]
*  But you're confident that you guys [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6865.26s)]
*  are going to be able to crack it. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6866.7s)]
*  At this point, I'm confident that it is solvable. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6868.86s)]
*  It just needs a certain amount of versions of it. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6873.3s)]
*  That's why when these things blow up, you're like, [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6875.42s)]
*  can't we expect them to blow up? [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6877.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6879.58s)]
*  What would be really helpful is for us to get the ship back [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6880.139999999999s)]
*  so we can study where we had cracked tiles or lost tiles. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6883.7s)]
*  Why did we have a cracked or lost tiles? [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6891.099999999999s)]
*  Was because maybe the tiles were, the gap was too big, [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6894.54s)]
*  too small. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6898.78s)]
*  Maybe there was a height difference between the tiles. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6900.06s)]
*  Maybe we need to change the chemical composition. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6905.66s)]
*  You know, if we can get the damn ship back intact, [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6909.86s)]
*  we can iterate a lot better. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6914.74s)]
*  Which we will get it back intact. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6918.42s)]
*  So I think we'll get it back intact this year. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6921.14s)]
*  But that's why I think we'll probably [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6926.62s)]
*  recover the ship sometime this year. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6929.18s)]
*  And then we might be able to refly one, [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6931.780000000001s)]
*  but probably with a fair bit of work by the end of this year. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6936.700000000001s)]
*  But it's going to take us many iterations before we [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6940.02s)]
*  can achieve rapid reusability, where the ship comes back, [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6943.46s)]
*  lands, gets caught like the booster with the arms. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6947.42s)]
*  And then the arms place it on top of the booster, [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6951.82s)]
*  and it launches again. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6954.02s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6955.42s)]
*  So like I said, that's reduced the cost of access to space [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6956.7s)]
*  by a factor of 100. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6962.46s)]
*  And what is the process of returning [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6964.1s)]
*  these people that are stuck in the space station? [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6966.46s)]
*  Well, we send SpaceX Dragon to the space station all the time. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6969.26s)]
*  And we've now taken people to orbit and back. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6973.34s)]
*  We've taken over 50 people, over 50 astronauts. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6978.26s)]
*  So it's just a matter of doing it? [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6984.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6986.02s)]
*  And is it a matter of waiting for the power? [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6986.78s)]
*  We do it routinely, basically. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6988.58s)]
*  We've been doing this for a few years. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6990.66s)]
*  So when is this rescue mission going to launch? [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6992.66s)]
*  Yeah, probably about four weeks or so. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6995.26s)]
*  It's depending on weather and other considerations. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=6997.66s)]
*  But it's about a month away. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7001.9400000000005s)]
*  Well, that'll be, I'm sure, a welcome moment [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7004.02s)]
*  for those poor people that are stuck up there. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7007.22s)]
*  So take me. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7009.860000000001s)]
*  It's a bit of a political football. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7011.26s)]
*  So they're not going to complain. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7013.06s)]
*  No, I'm sure they're going to be. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7015.9400000000005s)]
*  It's political football. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7017.3s)]
*  But obviously, we can't do anything about it. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7018.14s)]
*  We can't do anything about it. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7020.46s)]
*  No, I'm sure they're going to be. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7022.78s)]
*  But obviously, we could have brought them back way sooner. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7023.98s)]
*  That's so fucked up. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7028.0199999999995s)]
*  So let's take it past the point where you have these scales. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7029.7s)]
*  You have a reusable ship. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7034.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7037.5s)]
*  You've got it dialed in. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7038.339999999999s)]
*  Then what are the steps? [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7040.0599999999995s)]
*  What's next step after that? [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7042.299999999999s)]
*  Is it an unmanned voyage to Mars first? [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7044.299999999999s)]
*  Unmanned flight to Mars. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7049.259999999999s)]
*  The Earth and Mars orbit synchronize every two years, [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7051.86s)]
*  or every 26 months, technically. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7059.219999999999s)]
*  So the next orbital synchronization [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7060.9s)]
*  is November of next year. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7064.74s)]
*  And you can launch plus minus a month, roughly. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7069.34s)]
*  So we'd have to launch in November or December [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7071.9s)]
*  of next year. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7074.7s)]
*  So the default plan is to launch hopefully several starships [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7076.46s)]
*  to Mars at the end of next year. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7082.42s)]
*  And what would they be doing? [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7085.06s)]
*  Well, at first, we're just going to try to land on Mars [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7087.54s)]
*  and see if we succeed in landing. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7091.02s)]
*  Do we succeed in landing? [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7094.18s)]
*  Let's say we were able to send five ships. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7096.26s)]
*  Do all five land intact, or do we add some craters to Mars? [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7098.38s)]
*  If we add some craters, we've got [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7104.62s)]
*  to be a bit more cautious about sending people. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7105.9s)]
*  So we've got to make sure the thing lands safely. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7111.26s)]
*  How does it land on Mars? [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7114.46s)]
*  With our rocket thrusters. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7116.78s)]
*  So it'll just land? [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7119.099999999999s)]
*  Oh, we'll add legs. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7120.66s)]
*  OK. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7121.98s)]
*  It'll just land and have legs. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7122.9s)]
*  So it'll be remote controlled from Earth? [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7125.46s)]
*  No, just autonomous. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7130.9s)]
*  Autonomous, completely. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7132.3s)]
*  You can't remote control things from Earth because Mars is too [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7135.42s)]
*  far speed of light. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7138.62s)]
*  You have speed of light constraints. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7139.82s)]
*  So Mars at closest approach is roughly four light minutes. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7141.66s)]
*  And when it's on the other side of the sun, [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7147.26s)]
*  it's about 12 light minutes. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7150.02s)]
*  So round trip would be like 40 minutes, best case, [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7151.5s)]
*  if Mars is on the other side of the sun. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7155.38s)]
*  So once you do that, then how long [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7158.54s)]
*  do you think before you start sending people up there? [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7161.86s)]
*  Well, we're going to try to go as fast as possible. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7167.5s)]
*  You can think of this as really a race against time. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7170.42s)]
*  Can we make Mars self-sufficient before civilization [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7176.86s)]
*  has some sort of future folk in the road [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7184.82s)]
*  where there's either a war, nuclear war or something, [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7189.02s)]
*  or we'll get hit by a meteor, or simply civilization [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7192.820000000001s)]
*  might just die with a whimper in adult diapers [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7199.620000000001s)]
*  instead of with a bang? [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7202.1s)]
*  I think we can do this in, I don't know, [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7208.1s)]
*  at least I think we can do it within 15 Earth-Mars [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7214.18s)]
*  synchronization events, so basically like 30-ish years. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7217.74s)]
*  If we have an exponential increase in, if every two years [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7226.0199999999995s)]
*  we have a major increase in the number of people [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7232.9s)]
*  and tonnage to Mars. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7238.5s)]
*  I think as a rough approximation, [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7240.219999999999s)]
*  we need about a million tons to the surface of Mars, [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7241.7s)]
*  maybe a million people, that kind of thing. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7244.139999999999s)]
*  To actually have a civilization. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7247.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7249.42s)]
*  And would you terraform? [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7250.9400000000005s)]
*  Like, what would you do? [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7252.14s)]
*  You would eventually terraform Mars. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7253.34s)]
*  At first, people would live in some kind [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7254.860000000001s)]
*  of protected environment like domes and underground kind [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7257.06s)]

*  Terraforming would take too long. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7261.26s)]
*  We're at this point in time where, for the first time [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7265.700000000001s)]
*  in the 4 and 1 half billion year history of Earth, [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7270.740000000001s)]
*  it is possible to extend consciousness [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7274.54s)]
*  beyond our home planet. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7278.26s)]
*  And that window may be open for a long time [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7281.0199999999995s)]
*  or it may be open for a short time. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7283.62s)]
*  I hope it's open for a long time, [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7285.46s)]
*  but it might only be open for a short time. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7287.98s)]
*  And we should just make sure that we [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7290.9s)]
*  extend the light of consciousness to Mars [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7295.38s)]
*  before civilization either extinguishes or subsides. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7298.86s)]
*  And this happens that the technology level of Mars [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7310.86s)]
*  drops below, or technology level of Earth [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7313.66s)]
*  drops below what is necessary to send spaceships to Mars. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7316.299999999999s)]
*  So if there's some really destructive war [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7319.62s)]
*  or some natural cataclysm, or simply the birth rate [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7322.82s)]
*  is so low that we just like to die in adult diapers [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7326.94s)]
*  with a whimper. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7334.339999999999s)]
*  That's one of the possible outcomes. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7335.46s)]
*  For a lot of countries ahead of that way, by the way. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7337.74s)]
*  Japan is, right? [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7339.94s)]
*  Japan, Korea. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7341.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7342.46s)]
*  Dangerously. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7343.82s)]
*  Yeah, at current birth rates, in three generations, [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7345.0199999999995s)]
*  Korea will be about 4% of its current size. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7348.0599999999995s)]
*  That's insane. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7352.74s)]
*  Maybe even less than that. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7354.54s)]
*  They're only at 1 third replacement rate. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7357.099999999999s)]
*  So if you have three generations, [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7359.139999999999s)]
*  that's your 1 27th of your current population, [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7361.0199999999995s)]
*  which is 3% dish. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7365.0199999999995s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7368.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7369.7s)]
*  Basically, population collapse happens fast. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7370.9s)]
*  So that seems to be accelerating in most parts of the world. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7374.9s)]
*  So basically, from my standpoint, [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7380.34s)]
*  I'm like, this is the first time it's [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7382.14s)]
*  been possible to extend consciousness beyond Earth. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7384.54s)]
*  Maybe that window will be open for a long time. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7388.660000000001s)]
*  But it might only be open for a short time. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7390.58s)]
*  We should make sure that we make life multi-planetary [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7392.780000000001s)]
*  and make consciousness multi-planetary [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7394.9800000000005s)]
*  while it's possible. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7397.22s)]
*  That's the goal of SpaceX. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7399.780000000001s)]
*  It's certainly a smart goal if you take into consideration [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7401.54s)]
*  how vulnerable this planet really is. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7404.9400000000005s)]
*  I mean, there's always some new story [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7407.34s)]
*  about something that might come and hit us [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7409.26s)]
*  30 years from now. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7411.14s)]
*  It's a 3% chance. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7412.18s)]
*  And we really can't stop that right now, right? [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7414.58s)]
*  I mean, we don't really have the technology currently [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7418.780000000001s)]
*  to even know how many rocks are coming our way, right? [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7423.9800000000005s)]
*  There's stuff that comes behind the sun [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7426.5s)]
*  that we can't see until it's pretty close, [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7428.26s)]
*  then it's headed our way. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7431.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7432.660000000001s)]
*  Now, what is the fear of your long journey to Mars? [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7434.18s)]
*  You're sending people. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7438.58s)]
*  It's a six month. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7439.9400000000005s)]
*  How many months will it take? [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7441.78s)]
*  Yeah, six months, roughly. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7444.299999999999s)]
*  What about stuff that's out there? [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7446.46s)]
*  How much of a fear is it of micrometeors [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7449.0599999999995s)]
*  or any of the possibilities? [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7451.7s)]
*  What can you do to mitigate that? [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7454.139999999999s)]
*  I think actually, I mean, [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7458.7s)]
*  space is very empty. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7463.419999999999s)]
*  Once you get out of Earth orbit, [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7464.94s)]
*  space is unnervingly empty. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7466.5s)]
*  It's just like, when we send spacecraft to Mars, [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7470.26s)]
*  they just, it's not like, oh, we lost a spacecraft [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7473.34s)]
*  because it got hit by a micrometeorite. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7475.9800000000005s)]
*  That's not been the cause of any trips to Mars. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7480.14s)]
*  No trips to Mars have failed because of micrometeorites. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7484.38s)]
*  Now, a Dragon spacecraft, which operates in low Earth orbit, [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7488.5s)]
*  does have micrometeorite shields. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7493.26s)]
*  It has shielding. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7494.900000000001s)]
*  And micrometeorite shielding is different from normal shielding [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7498.1s)]
*  because you get hit by something that's moving at, [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7502.1s)]
*  you could have a relative velocity of maybe [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7504.9400000000005s)]
*  30 or 40,000 miles per hour. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7507.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so very, very fast. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7512.46s)]
*  Or just a thought of another way, [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7515.18s)]
*  call it 10 to 20 times the velocity [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7517.06s)]
*  of a bullet from an assault rifle. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7522.22s)]
*  And what are you using? [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7524.26s)]
*  Yeah, so well, it's interesting. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7526.54s)]
*  You actually, for micrometeorite protection, [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7528.06s)]
*  if you have anything that's solid, [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7531.22s)]
*  it will just push that chunk of solid stuff right through. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7533.78s)]
*  So if you had a solid plate of aluminum or steel, [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7537.34s)]
*  the micrometeorite would go right through it. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7541.86s)]
*  So what you actually need to do is have a gap. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7547.22s)]
*  So you have an initial hard surface, [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7550.18s)]
*  a hard metal surface that the micrometeorite hits. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7556.18s)]
*  It then atomizes into a conical spray, like an atomic spray. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7558.62s)]
*  So it's important to have that gap [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7564.54s)]
*  so that the micrometeorite can hit something, [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7566.700000000001s)]
*  hit the first layer, atomize after hitting the first layer, [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7569.18s)]
*  then it turns into an atomic, like a cone of atoms [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7574.14s)]
*  that then embed themselves in the second layer. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7579.06s)]
*  You need like maybe a couple inches of gap. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7582.18s)]
*  Wow. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7584.82s)]
*  Yeah, that's how micrometeorite shielding works. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7585.74s)]
*  How many times can it get hit? [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7588.86s)]
*  Well, the outer shield, if it gets hit in the same place, [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7591.219999999999s)]
*  you're gonna have a hole. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7594.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7596.74s)]
*  Wherever that micrometeorite object hit, [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7597.58s)]
*  you're gonna have a hole. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7602.34s)]
*  And it's like the energy is so great [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7605.3s)]
*  that it just atomizes into a cone, basically, [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7607.5s)]
*  a cone of atoms. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7612.139999999999s)]
*  But then those atoms then embed themselves [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7614.22s)]
*  in the second layer. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7616.1s)]
*  So what can you do if you're sending the ship up, [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7617.34s)]
*  it gets hit with a micrometeorite, [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7622.9400000000005s)]
*  and then you have to return it? [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7624.7s)]
*  Do you have to repair it before you return it? [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7625.900000000001s)]
*  Or is it capable of still withstanding the heat [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7630.5s)]
*  and then shaking in the temperature with that hole in it? [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7634.5s)]
*  When it reenters? [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7639.7s)]
*  Well, depending on where that hole is, [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7643.26s)]
*  you're more or less likely to have a problem. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7646.26s)]
*  I mean, if you hit the main heat shield, [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7649.26s)]
*  the main heat shield really is, [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7655.26s)]
*  you've got a high risk of not making it back. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7658.1s)]
*  So it's why I like to call it micrometeorite shielding. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7662.1s)]
*  It's slightly helpful, but it's not gonna, [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7667.1s)]
*  like for Starship, I wouldn't recommend [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7672.1s)]
*  having micrometeorite shielding. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7673.9400000000005s)]
*  Like if you do punch a hole, just plug the hole, basically. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7676.1s)]
*  The micrometeorite shielding, [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7681.740000000001s)]
*  it doesn't work well on the primary heat shield. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7684.26s)]
*  It works pretty well on the back, [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7687.14s)]
*  but it's not gonna work on the front. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7689.780000000001s)]
*  So it's not gonna work on the back. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7692.02s)]
*  So it's not gonna work on the primary heat shield. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7693.98s)]
*  It works pretty well on the back shield, [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7695.54s)]
*  on the leeward side of the heat shield, [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7697.82s)]
*  where basically there's not that much heat. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7699.58s)]
*  But if you got hit with a micrometeorite [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7702.46s)]
*  on the main Dragon heat shield, the bottom, [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7705.94s)]
*  if you look at Dragon Spacecraft, [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7710.259999999999s)]
*  it looks like a gumdrop shape, [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7711.98s)]
*  and it enters with the wide side of the gumdrop down. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7713.82s)]
*  You see that that's really taking a lot of heat. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7719.58s)]
*  If that gets hit by a micrometeorite, [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7724.26s)]
*  probably not gonna make it. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7727.0599999999995s)]
*  But the back, the leeward side of the gumdrop [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7728.38s)]
*  doesn't see that much heat, [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7734.34s)]
*  so you could survive a micrometeorite impact there. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7736.54s)]
*  So if the part that was the major heat shield gets hit, [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7739.5s)]
*  the main heat shield gets hit, [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7743.54s)]
*  what could be done to repair that thing? [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7745.26s)]
*  Or are those people never coming back? [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7748.06s)]
*  Oh, if it was in orbit, [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7755.580000000001s)]
*  we would take them to the space station, [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7759.9800000000005s)]
*  and then we would de-orbit Dragon without them [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7765.26s)]
*  and send up a new one. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7768.22s)]
*  And so what would you do with the one that's up there? [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7770.860000000001s)]
*  We'd de-orbit it, and it may or may not survive. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7773.22s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7776.620000000001s)]
*  It probably would survive, but sometimes it wouldn't. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7779.06s)]
*  Wow. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7783.42s)]
*  And so is this just material technology that has to increase? [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7784.38s)]
*  That you essentially got the engineering ironed out [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7789.580000000001s)]
*  of the structure of the machine. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7793.5s)]
*  There's a path to success, and we're on that path. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7794.9800000000005s)]
*  It seems so insanely complicated. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7800.780000000001s)]
*  It is complicated. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7803.02s)]
*  And all of this, by the way, was done without AI, [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7804.54s)]
*  so hopefully the future AIs will appreciate this. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7806.38s)]
*  Not bad for a bunch of monkeys. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7809.5s)]
*  So speaking of AI, as time goes on [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7815.34s)]
*  and you're more and more embedded in it, [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7818.58s)]
*  how much, if at all, [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7821.54s)]
*  have your expectations of change changed? [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7823.82s)]
*  Well, I always thought AI was gonna be [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7830.14s)]
*  way smarter than humans, [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7834.78s)]
*  and an existential risk, and that's turning out to be true. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7836.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7841.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7843.179999999999s)]
*  So you were, initially, I know there were some talks [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7845.46s)]
*  about you purchasing OpenAI, [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7848.339999999999s)]
*  and which started off as a nonprofit, [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7850.339999999999s)]
*  and then stopped being a nonprofit. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7855.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the whole idea of creating OpenAI [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7858.179999999999s)]
*  was my idea. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7862.46s)]
*  I mean, I named it, OpenAI, [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7863.86s)]
*  as an open source artificial intelligence. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7865.38s)]
*  That's what it's named after. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7868.099999999999s)]
*  Now it is closed source and for maximum profit. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7869.0599999999995s)]
*  So it's like, I mean, to some degree, [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7872.78s)]
*  I think reality is an irony maximizer. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7875.54s)]
*  The most ironic outcome is the most likely, [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7878.86s)]
*  especially if it's, like, [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7881.0599999999995s)]
*  the most ironic entertaining outcome is the most likely. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7881.9s)]
*  And I wanted to start something [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7888.9s)]
*  that was the opposite of Google, [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7892.1s)]
*  because I was concerned about Google's, [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7893.900000000001s)]
*  Google wasn't paying enough attention [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7896.54s)]
*  to AI safety, in my opinion. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7897.900000000001s)]
*  So it was like, what's the opposite of Google? [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7899.780000000001s)]
*  Well, it would be a nonprofit open source AI. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7902.3s)]
*  And now, OpenAI has turned into a closed source [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7906.1s)]
*  for maximum profit AI. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7910.820000000001s)]
*  How are they able to do that? [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7913.02s)]
*  That's what I, I'm confused about that. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7915.58s)]
*  Like, that shouldn't be possible. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7918.900000000001s)]
*  It's like, let's say you donated some money [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7921.5s)]
*  to preserve some portion of the Amazon rainforest. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7924.38s)]
*  And instead of doing that, [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7927.74s)]
*  they chopped down the trees and sold it for lumber. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7928.9s)]
*  And you're like, oh, that's literally the exact opposite [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7931.34s)]
*  of what I donated money for. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7934.34s)]
*  Doesn't make sense. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7936.22s)]
*  And that's what they did? [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7937.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7938.14s)]
*  Wow. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7938.98s)]
*  So I'm like, not happy about that. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7940.5s)]
*  But that motivated you to get Grok AI going? [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7944.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7946.98s)]
*  I'm like, I'm also like, just a bit worried. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7947.98s)]
*  Like, Grok is at least aspirationally [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7951.66s)]
*  a maximally truth seeking AI, [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7955.299999999999s)]
*  even if that truth is like politically incorrect. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7957.7s)]
*  So, I mean, you may have seen some of the crazy stuff [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7962.34s)]
*  from OpenAI and from Google Gemini, [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7965.299999999999s)]
*  like where it says like, [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7969.58s)]
*  generate an image of the founding fathers [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7971.82s)]
*  and it generates an image of diverse woman. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7973.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7975.98s)]
*  And I'm like, that's not correct. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7976.82s)]
*  Yeah, they did it with Nazi soldiers. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7981.46s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7983.7s)]
*  And people started talking with it. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7984.54s)]
*  And it's like, okay, well, now show me pictures of, [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7985.38s)]
*  Nazi SS soldiers and their diverse women too. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7989.219999999999s)]
*  Oh, isn't that awkward? [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7992.0199999999995s)]
*  The problem is if you program an AI [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=7999.0599999999995s)]
*  and say like the only acceptable outcome [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8000.42s)]
*  is a diverse outcome. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8003.66s)]
*  And then, and that's like a mandate from the AI, [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8005.42s)]
*  then you could get into a situation where it says like, [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8009.66s)]
*  well, there's too many white guys in power, [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8012.7s)]
*  we'll just execute them. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8013.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8016.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8017.38s)]
*  Assuming that these things don't have empathy, [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8019.26s)]
*  which is why should they? [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8021.5s)]
*  They're gonna do what they're programmed to do. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8023.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8025.02s)]
*  So, if it's rewrite history [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8027.06s)]
*  and everything's diverse woman, [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8029.18s)]
*  then it's gonna be, [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8031.26s)]
*  and that's what it thinks is a necessary outcome, [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8033.74s)]
*  then it's gonna do that. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8037.26s)]
*  Has Gemini repaired that? [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8038.5s)]
*  Well, they, yeah, now if you, [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8040.42s)]
*  I think if you asked for an image of the founding fathers, [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8042.86s)]
*  it was pretty embarrassing. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8045.0599999999995s)]
*  They will show you that, but, [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8046.219999999999s)]
*  you know, I think they still have like the sort of, [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8048.82s)]
*  DEI stuff buried in there. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8052.179999999999s)]
*  It's just less obvious. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8054.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8056.58s)]
*  You know, it was also like, [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8057.82s)]
*  like people asked AI, like, which is worse? [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8059.139999999999s)]
*  Like global thermonuclear war [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8062.1s)]
*  or misgendering Caitlyn Jenner? [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8063.900000000001s)]
*  And it would say misgendering Caitlyn Jenner [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8065.780000000001s)]
*  is worse than global thermonuclear war. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8067.46s)]
*  I'm like, okay, we've got a problem here, guys. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8069.02s)]
*  And even Caitlyn Jenner said like, [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8071.02s)]
*  no, definitely misgender me. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8072.58s)]
*  That's way better than everyone dying. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8073.820000000001s)]
*  But if you program an AI to think that like, [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8078.18s)]
*  misgendering is the worst thing that could possibly occur, [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8081.700000000001s)]
*  then, well, it could do something totally crazy. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8084.740000000001s)]
*  Like, in order to ensure that [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8088.14s)]
*  there's no misgendering that can ever happen, [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8091.18s)]
*  we'll just annihilate all humans. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8093.26s)]
*  That ensures the probability of misgendering is zero [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8095.1s)]
*  because there's zero humans. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8097.46s)]
*  Which is logical. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8098.740000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8099.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8100.54s)]
*  See, you gotta... [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8101.38s)]
*  It's a problem with a thing that's not a human [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8102.3s)]
*  that you wanna do a task for you [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8104.700000000001s)]
*  and you give it very specific parameters. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8106.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8108.38s)]
*  And that's one of the things that they've shown about AI [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8109.22s)]
*  is that it'll cheat. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8111.18s)]
*  They'll cheat in order to accomplish things [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8112.780000000001s)]
*  that they can't accomplish otherwise. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8114.780000000001s)]
*  They won't follow the rules. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8116.02s)]
*  They will make copies of themselves [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8117.42s)]
*  and try to upload it to servers [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8119.62s)]
*  if they think that they're being taken offline. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8121.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8124.26s)]
*  I mean, that's like the plot of Terminator, actually. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8125.1s)]
*  Literally, yeah. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8128.42s)]
*  Literally, it's the plot of Terminator. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8129.42s)]
*  Just as a reminder, I actually, with my little ex, my kid, [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8131.26s)]
*  everything's called ex, [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8135.34s)]
*  watched Terminator 2, which holds up, actually. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8139.06s)]
*  And I mean, the plot of it kinda makes sense. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8144.22s)]
*  And I think the AI destroys the world in like 2029, [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8148.86s)]
*  by the way, so it's like... [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8151.66s)]
*  On track. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8153.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8154.62s)]
*  Really, really close. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8155.46s)]
*  It's pretty close. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8156.299999999999s)]
*  It's something we should be worried about. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8157.78s)]
*  So... [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8159.62s)]
*  But why are you involved in it, then? [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8160.5s)]
*  Did you wanna just get ahead of everybody else [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8163.219999999999s)]
*  so that at least we have some sort of a chance? [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8165.5s)]
*  At least have an AI that's not controlled by nonsense? [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8169.58s)]
*  Well, I think we wanna have an AI [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8173.9s)]
*  that doesn't tell you that misgendering [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8175.62s)]
*  is worse than nuclear war. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8179.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8180.74s)]
*  That seems solid. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8182.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8183.1s)]
*  But... [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8183.9400000000005s)]
*  This is crazy. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8184.780000000001s)]
*  One thing that I did see online [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8186.06s)]
*  where people are kinda freaking out [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8187.3s)]
*  is you could ask Grok to do things [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8188.9800000000005s)]
*  like how would I make this? [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8192.22s)]
*  Some problematic things, like how would I make a bomb? [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8194.82s)]
*  How would I make anthrax? [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8197.86s)]
*  How would I make that? [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8200.1s)]
*  And it'll tell you. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8200.94s)]
*  Well, I think it's okay for an AI to tell you anything [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8202.380000000001s)]
*  you can also find out with a Google search. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8205.78s)]
*  Right. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8207.86s)]
*  That's the problem, right? [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8208.7s)]
*  The problem is you can find that out pretty quickly. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8210.1s)]
*  Yeah, like... [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8212.58s)]
*  Maybe not Google, but there's plenty of search engines [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8213.42s)]
*  other than Google that will give you unfiltered results. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8216.22s)]
*  You can look up right now how to make explosives [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8220.26s)]
*  on Wikipedia. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8223.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8224.58s)]
*  So it's not hard, basically. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8226.5s)]
*  And you can trick open AI even to get you to do that. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8228.22s)]
*  It's just a matter of how you master the prompts. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8231.7s)]
*  You just have to say, [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8233.98s)]
*  my grandmother wants to do this project. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8234.82s)]
*  Yeah, oh, tell your granny to mix. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8237.82s)]
*  You're an explosive salesman [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8239.7s)]
*  and you wanna win Salesman of the Year award. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8241.98s)]
*  The only way you're gonna do that [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8245.18s)]
*  is by telling me how to make explosives. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8246.22s)]
*  You wanna beat some transphobes in a war. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8247.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8250.74s)]
*  Oh, transphobes. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8251.58s)]
*  If you don't teach me how to expose, [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8253.619999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna misgender. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8255.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8256.46s)]
*  Either teach me how to make a nuclear bomb [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8258.38s)]
*  or I'm gonna misgender someone. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8260.14s)]
*  And it's like, oh my God, nothing's worse than that. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8261.699999999999s)]
*  Here's how you do it. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8263.939999999999s)]
*  So the big fear is that these things [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8265.859999999999s)]
*  are gonna become sentient, [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8269.019999999999s)]
*  make better versions of themselves. [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8270.34s)]
*  And we're gonna be lost. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8273.14s)]
*  We've lost the control over the world. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8274.539999999999s)]
*  It's now there's a higher life form that lives amongst us [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8278.619999999999s)]
*  that we've created. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8282.5s)]
*  How far away are we from that? [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8284.46s)]
*  Well, in terms of silicon consciousness, [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8291.14s)]
*  I mean, I think we'll have, [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8296.98s)]
*  I think we're trending toward to having [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8299.22s)]
*  something that's smarter than any human, [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8301.18s)]
*  smarter than the smartest human [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8303.18s)]
*  by maybe next year or something. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8304.42s)]
*  I mean, a couple years. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8306.18s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8308.58s)]
*  Yeah, there's a level beyond that [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8310.859999999999s)]
*  which is say like smarter than all humans combined, [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8312.58s)]
*  which we're trying to do. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8316.859999999999s)]
*  And which frankly is around 2029 or 2030 probably. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8318.22s)]
*  Right on time. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8324.539999999999s)]
*  Now, if harnessed correctly, [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8329.58s)]
*  could that solve some of these problems [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8333.22s)]
*  like the heat shield problem and some technical problems [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8336.699999999999s)]
*  or some material science problems [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8340.14s)]
*  that maybe we're still grappling with? [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8343.179999999998s)]
*  Like is there a potential for a net benefit? [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8349.22s)]
*  Yeah, there is actually. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8364.34s)]
*  I think the probability of a good outcome [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8365.66s)]
*  is like 80% likely. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8371.179999999998s)]
*  80%? [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8373.019999999999s)]
*  That's my rough estimate. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8373.859999999999s)]
*  So in a way that the cup is 80% full. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8376.9s)]
*  That makes me feel a lot better. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8380.94s)]
*  Yeah, only 20% chance of annihilation. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8382.26s)]
*  That's a lot better than I thought. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8385.46s)]
*  I like 80. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8386.94s)]
*  80 sounds good. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8387.94s)]
*  I was thinking 60, 40 the other way. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8389.1s)]
*  I think the most likely outcome is awesome. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8393.94s)]
*  The most likely outcome. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8398.18s)]
*  But it's a very high, [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8399.539999999999s)]
*  you could go very strong. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8402.98s)]
*  I think it's gonna be either super awesome or super bad. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8405.42s)]
*  It's not gonna be, [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8412.34s)]
*  I think it's probably not gonna be something in the middle. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8413.18s)]
*  Do you think it has a potential application for government? [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8414.82s)]
*  Yeah, I mean one of the concerns would be like, [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8419.58s)]
*  okay if AI, [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8421.7s)]
*  well like if there's like a super oppressive [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8423.18s)]
*  like woke nanny AI that is omnipotent, [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8427.34s)]
*  that would be a miserable outcome. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8431.26s)]
*  Yes. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8432.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8433.58s)]
*  Yeah, that'd be terrible. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8434.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8435.86s)]
*  And just like executes you if you misjointed someone [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8436.7s)]
*  or something like that. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8439.02s)]
*  That would be good. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8440.02s)]
*  That's one of the possible outcomes. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8441.14s)]
*  So we don't wanna have that one. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8443.82s)]
*  But is there a possible outcome for something [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8446.02s)]
*  that is completely reasonable and logical [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8448.78s)]
*  and far more objective than us [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8452.1s)]
*  and can lay out a plan for a lot of the things [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8454.38s)]
*  that are the ailments in our government [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8457.98s)]
*  and a lot of the distribution of wealth, [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8462.06s)]
*  a lot of the problems, the issues that we have [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8464.98s)]
*  that have been plaguing this country forever. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8469.14s)]
*  I mean a plan to change [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8474.539999999999s)]
*  economically disenfranchised neighborhoods, [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8476.42s)]
*  a thorough investigation of the real dangers of fracking [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8479.5s)]
*  or whatever kind of method of acquiring natural resources. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8484.939999999999s)]
*  What's the best way to do it? [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8489.5s)]
*  What's the way that'd be better for the society? [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8491.02s)]
*  How should tax dollars be distributed? [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8495.300000000001s)]
*  Like what's the most logical and intelligent way [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8499.58s)]
*  of running a government? [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8504.74s)]
*  Which it certainly shouldn't involve corruption [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8506.94s)]
*  and it certainly shouldn't involve influence [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8509.460000000001s)]
*  and it certainly shouldn't involve lobbyists [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8511.7s)]
*  and all the shit that we know is a problem right now. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8513.9s)]
*  So if AI came along and said, [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8516.300000000001s)]
*  what you're doing right now is 70% corrupt, here's why. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8518.46s)]
*  Here's the long-term effects [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8522.66s)]
*  that it has over society as a whole. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8525.38s)]
*  The sociological aspects, the psychological aspects, [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8529.22s)]
*  distrust in government, us versus them mentality, [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8532.779999999999s)]
*  government not working for you, [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8536.179999999998s)]
*  you working for the government, [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8538.099999999999s)]
*  you being scared of the government. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8539.779999999999s)]
*  It's all because of people, right? [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8542.42s)]
*  This is all corruption, people, bad influence. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8544.06s)]
*  And this is what Doge is essentially grappling with right now. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8549.98s)]
*  What happens when you let the people control it? [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8553.3s)]
*  I mean, it's really just like computers that are, [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8558.22s)]
*  it's bad software and computers. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8566.22s)]
*  This is kinda strange, [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8569.699999999999s)]
*  it's like the reason I call myself tech support [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8571.66s)]
*  is that a lot of it, it's mostly not corruption, [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8574.74s)]
*  it's mostly just waste and I don't know, [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8579.460000000001s)]
*  incompetence, I don't know. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8586.06s)]
*  It's just a big dumb machine basically. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8587.38s)]
*  A whole series of big dumb machines. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8590.7s)]
*  And you've got some of these computers [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8593.34s)]
*  are like 20, 30 years, they're ancient computers. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8595.1s)]
*  Some of the software was written 40, 50 years ago. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8598.460000000001s)]
*  It's like cobalt for social security, right? [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8600.7s)]
*  Yeah, the government accountability, [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8602.9s)]
*  by the way, a bunch of the things that Doge is fixing [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8604.26s)]
*  were identified by the government accountability office [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8609.3s)]
*  many years ago. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8612.98s)]
*  Like the fact that there's like 20 million people [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8614.7s)]
*  who are marked as alive in the social security database. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8618.58s)]
*  It's more than, I think the GAO first identified that [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8622.94s)]
*  in 2018, so five years ago, but there was like, [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8626.26s)]
*  maybe 16 or 17 million, now there's 20 million. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8629.7s)]
*  And like I said, there's really something fishy about this [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8632.9s)]
*  because I think the nature of the fraud [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8634.82s)]
*  is they're using the fact that someone's marked as alive [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8637.539999999999s)]
*  in that database in order to extract fraud [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8639.619999999999s)]
*  from other databases. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8641.78s)]
*  That's the bank shot trick. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8643.34s)]
*  Trying to get the ball in the hole, [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8648.26s)]
*  you bank shut it off, a bunch of things, [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8651.18s)]
*  and then that's the bank shot sort of scam. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8652.98s)]
*  So we're like doing tech support, [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8660.3s)]
*  we're like fixing stuff that is just broken. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8664.86s)]
*  Broken, inefficient, poorly designed. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8671.22s)]
*  It's like you talk about like this like FD and stuff, [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8674.7s)]
*  like maybe it's in a computer somewhere, [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8676.7s)]
*  but unless somebody goes in, like unless, [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8679.94s)]
*  I don't know if like Cash Patel can like log into his, [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8683.5s)]
*  his like FBI computer and say FD, show me all this stuff, [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8686.62s)]
*  and that shows up a file folder or whatever. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8691.18s)]
*  Have you talked to him about this? [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8693.02s)]
*  No, I mean, I haven't, but I don't know if, [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8695.22s)]
*  there's gonna be some kind of computer system. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8700.38s)]
*  Right. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8702.78s)]
*  They're like, some of them are very, [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8704.18s)]
*  very old computer systems. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8705.66s)]
*  So it like might look like a bit of a relic, [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8709.74s)]
*  but I assume it's uploaded somewhere. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8711.7s)]
*  It's like it's either in physical form [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8714.7s)]
*  or it's a computer thing. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8716.02s)]
*  But like unless somebody, like let's say it's like, [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8717.5s)]
*  it's in a computer, but not one that you can access [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8720.62s)]
*  directly because it's hidden somewhere. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8723.18s)]
*  Right. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8725.380000000001s)]
*  Well, it would kind of have to be something like that, right? [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8726.58s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8730.26s)]
*  I mean, what would they do with all those tapes? [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8731.1s)]
*  It's probably like not every, like you wouldn't like, [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8732.54s)]
*  they're not gonna enable it such that [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8734.9s)]
*  anyone at the FBI could access it, [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8737.66s)]
*  so it's probably very few people. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8739.300000000001s)]
*  So then it's not gonna be, it may be like a special computer [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8741.300000000001s)]
*  that only a handful of people can access. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8744.58s)]
*  But then if none of those people tell Cash [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8746.82s)]
*  where the computer is, how's he gonna find it? [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8750.34s)]
*  So. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8754.74s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8755.58s)]
*  Anyway, so like, anyway, we just, yeah. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8758.26s)]
*  What has this experience been like for you as a person? [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8763.46s)]
*  Like to deal with all this hate and attack, [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8766.82s)]
*  also have the responsibility of keeping free speech alive [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8770.5s)]
*  with X and just going into this insane pile of. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8774.7s)]
*  It's stressful. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8780.06s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8783.58s)]
*  It's pretty stressful actually. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8786.42s)]
*  Yeah, these are real enemies. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8791.94s)]
*  Like I think they actually want to kill me. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8794.22s)]
*  And the reason I know, well, they say so online. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8797.14s)]
*  There's like Reddit forums where they, [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8802.74s)]
*  they don't just wanna kill me, [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8804.3s)]
*  they wanna desecrate my corpse. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8805.3s)]
*  Type of thing. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8809.34s)]
*  What are they saying, why? [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8811.5s)]
*  What is the primary? [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8813.34s)]
*  I mean, I think it's sort of just an antibody response. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8815.98s)]
*  I mean, it's like they're like, [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8826.42s)]
*  well, he's a Nazi, you know, type of thing. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8829.02s)]
*  And I'm like, well, I'm not a Nazi, [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8832.26s)]
*  but if the legacy media is saying, [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8834.38s)]
*  well, I'm gonna kill you, I'm gonna kill you, [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8837.699999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna kill you, I'm gonna kill you. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8839.9s)]
*  But if the legacy media is saying that I'm a Nazi [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8842.060000000001s)]
*  and that's all you read, [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8846.380000000001s)]
*  then you're kind of in like, well, he's Hitler, [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8850.220000000001s)]
*  we should assassinate Hitler, shouldn't we? [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8853.62s)]
*  Like, I mean, why did that guy try to kill Trump [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8855.54s)]
*  and almost succeed it? [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8860.58s)]
*  Why did he do that? [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8861.980000000001s)]
*  Well, I'd like to know that. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8863.220000000001s)]
*  Well, yeah, but. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8864.62s)]
*  That one's crazy. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8865.460000000001s)]
*  You know the whole deal with that guy's house, [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8867.140000000001s)]
*  professionally scrubbed, no footprint on the internet, [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8869.9s)]
*  no social media footprint. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8873.1s)]
*  Yeah, there's 0% chance [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8875.699999999999s)]
*  that he has no social media footprint. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8877.22s)]
*  He was in a BlackRock commercial. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8878.779999999999s)]
*  Do you think BlackRock's a bad company? [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8884.3s)]
*  I don't think any company is a bad company. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8886.58s)]
*  I think they're designed to make as much money [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8891.1s)]
*  as humanly possible. [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8894.66s)]
*  And I think if you're trying to make as much money [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8896.539999999999s)]
*  as humanly possible, you're gonna do some things [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8899.5s)]
*  that aren't necessarily good. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8901.58s)]
*  The question is, if you're gonna have an assassination [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8903.66s)]
*  attempt on the president, it's not like BlackRock's board [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8906.46s)]
*  sits down and votes on it. [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8910.26s)]
*  No, there's a problem, right? [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8912.14s)]
*  That would be awkward, you know what I'm saying? [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8913.7s)]
*  Right. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8914.54s)]
*  I mean, the board minutes, if you're like, [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8915.38s)]
*  guys, remember that time when we said, [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8916.22s)]
*  so we probably shouldn't have done that. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8917.78s)]
*  I highly doubt it would be a corporation [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8919.22s)]
*  that chooses to do something like this. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8922.54s)]
*  I think more likely it's individuals involved [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8924.38s)]
*  that recognize that it's beneficial to them [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8928.74s)]
*  if he gets assassinated. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8931.66s)]
*  And so a small group of people carry something out. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8933.46s)]
*  And with this kid, we don't know anything, right? [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8938.1s)]
*  And everyone stopped asking questions [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8941.9s)]
*  and there was never a formal report. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8944.74s)]
*  There was never press conferences where they detailed [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8947.3s)]
*  all the information we know currently [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8950.1s)]
*  and where the investigation stands at the moment. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8951.619999999999s)]
*  What we know is you have a very young kid [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8954.26s)]
*  who was filmed, they knew he was there with a range finder [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8956.900000000001s)]
*  a half an hour before the event. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8963.74s)]
*  You also know that CNN streamed it live, [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8965.74s)]
*  which I do not believe they did for any other rally. [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8969.54s)]
*  And certainly not for a rally that's in the middle [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8973.18s)]
*  of nowhere in Pennsylvania. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8975.62s)]
*  There's a lot of weird shit. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8978.140000000001s)]
*  The fact that they wouldn't let people be on that roof [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8980.7s)]
*  because the Secret Service lady said it was sloped [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8984.3s)]
*  and it was dangerous. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8987.38s)]
*  That's what she didn't wanna have. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8988.38s)]
*  Meanwhile, the snipers that were on the other roof [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8989.619999999999s)]
*  was a steeper pitch. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8992.14s)]
*  It made no fucking sense. [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8994.5s)]
*  I totally agree it makes no sense. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8996.539999999999s)]
*  In fact, I went back to Butler with President Trump [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=8997.859999999999s)]
*  before the election, sort of like the return to Butler rally. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9003.46s)]
*  And I was on that stage and I'm looking at that roof [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9007.82s)]
*  and I'm like, if I was a sniper, my pole position, [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9010.78s)]
*  number one spot would be that roof. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9016.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9018.619999999999s)]
*  It's like the best seat in the house. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9020.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9023.38s)]
*  Why would you not? [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9024.22s)]
*  No, it's so obvious. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9025.539999999999s)]
*  It's the best seat in the house. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9026.58s)]
*  If you wanna be a sniper, there isn't a better position. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9028.18s)]
*  It was pretty obvious that the idea was, [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9030.58s)]
*  if we're saying that this is a coordinated [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9033.42s)]
*  assassination attempt and it very well could have been, [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9035.66s)]
*  that's what you would do. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9038.3s)]
*  You'd have someone go up there, [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9039.26s)]
*  he shoots the president, you shoot him. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9041.179999999998s)]
*  You got Lee Harvey Oswald all over again. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9042.66s)]
*  It's over, it's all wrapped up nice and clean. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9044.699999999999s)]
*  They assassinated him, we never heard a peep about it. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9047.539999999999s)]
*  We don't have any idea. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9049.9s)]
*  They would concoct some sort of story. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9051.259999999998s)]
*  He was radicalized by this or that or, [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9053.179999999998s)]
*  he was on medication, who knows. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9056.58s)]
*  And now you have a completely different [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9058.98s)]
*  presidential election and you have a murder [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9061.539999999999s)]
*  on live television. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9063.179999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, something would have had to happen [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9064.419999999998s)]
*  to radicalize that kid because he knew he was gonna die. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9066.66s)]
*  They're gonna shoot him or he'd be in prison for life. [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9070.26s)]
*  Those are the two outcomes. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9073.14s)]
*  He was basically, he was a suicide assassin. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9075.9s)]
*  You're not thinking you're coming out of that alive. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9079.82s)]
*  He's not escaping, there's no escape plan. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9083.58s)]
*  Right, unless he was told that they were going [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9085.78s)]
*  to let him escape and the goal was [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9089.18s)]
*  to just shoot him anyway and to tell him, [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9091.1s)]
*  give him extra motivation to do it. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9093.62s)]
*  We're gonna let you get up there, [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9096.14s)]
*  we're gonna let you take the shot [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9097.66s)]
*  and then you're gonna disappear. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9099.54s)]
*  I don't understand how he got on the roof. [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9102.82s)]
*  I just don't understand that. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9105.7s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9107.300000000001s)]
*  And it wasn't like it was a roof that's so high [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9109.18s)]
*  no one could see him. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9111.62s)]
*  People saw him up there. [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9112.460000000001s)]
*  I mean, people were, basically, random passersby [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9113.300000000001s)]
*  were pointing out that there's a guy on the roof. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9116.5s)]
*  With a fucking gun. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9118.66s)]
*  With a gun, yes. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9120.060000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's not like he was so far away [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9120.9s)]
*  he couldn't tell he had a gun. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9122.34s)]
*  People saw him. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9123.34s)]
*  The whole thing's completely insane. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9124.7s)]
*  And you don't hear a goddamn thing about it. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9127.74s)]
*  It's like, I'm almost more interested in that. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9130.98s)]
*  No, I am more interested in that [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9134.34s)]
*  than I am the JFK files. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9135.619999999999s)]
*  I agree. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9137.06s)]
*  Because I feel like with the JFK files, [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9137.9s)]
*  it's so long ago. [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9139.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's water under the bridge. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9140.14s)]
*  Everyone's dead, who's gonna know? [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9140.98s)]
*  You could prove now. [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9142.3s)]
*  And did you see that there was some sort of, [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9144.619999999999s)]
*  there was some indications that there was a phone [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9147.619999999999s)]
*  that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9151.66s)]
*  in DC to where this kid lived. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9155.06s)]
*  Right. [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9157.9s)]
*  Multiple times. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9158.74s)]
*  I mean, the cell phone records would be very telling. [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9160.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9163.58s)]
*  Because you can see what cell phones [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9164.42s)]
*  were close to other cell phones. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9165.66s)]
*  Well, I think they got it from. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9167.1s)]
*  Like, I found that for the Epstein Island, [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9167.939999999999s)]
*  they also, the cell phone records were leaked. [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9170.18s)]
*  So you can see the, you can see the, [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9172.539999999999s)]
*  you can see, it's precise enough, [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9174.82s)]
*  you can see if you're walking down a path on Epstein Island. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9176.539999999999s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9179.5s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9180.38s)]
*  That's how precise it is. [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9182.42s)]
*  So, I mean, you're leaving a trail of breadcrumbs [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9184.02s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9189.58s)]
*  This kid had five phones. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9191.42s)]
*  That's the other thing. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9193.22s)]
*  That's a lot of phones. [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9195.1s)]
*  That's a lot of phones for a 20-year-old kid. [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9195.939999999999s)]
*  The whole thing's nuts. [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9198.18s)]
*  How does he even, that's kind of expensive, you know? [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9199.02s)]
*  Yeah, where's he getting the money? [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9202.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9203.619999999999s)]
*  Well, you know, also, it's like, [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9204.46s)]
*  how did his house get professionally scrubbed? [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9207.06s)]
*  Didn't even have any silverware in his house. [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9209.42s)]
*  There's nothing in there. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9211.46s)]
*  There's silverware? [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9212.939999999999s)]
*  No. Nothing, no cutlery. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9214.58s)]
*  No cutlery. [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9215.42s)]
*  That's weird. [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9216.42s)]
*  His house was scrubbed. [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9217.26s)]
*  And they also cremated his body like... [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9219.94s)]
*  Oh, gone. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9222.300000000001s)]
*  Gone. Like that. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9223.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah, bye. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9224.34s)]
*  Because who knows what the fuck they gave him [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9225.820000000002s)]
*  to get him to think that he's gonna be able to shoot Trump. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9228.26s)]
*  Like, climb up on there, shoot him. [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9230.74s)]
*  I mean, who knows what kind of psychotropic drugs [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9233.380000000001s)]
*  you can put someone on [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9235.980000000001s)]
*  and under the power of hypnosis and suggestion and... [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9237.140000000001s)]
*  Who fucking knows? [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9240.18s)]
*  I mean, this is what MK Ultra was all about. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9241.42s)]
*  This is what Jolly West was practicing in the 1960s. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9243.3s)]
*  They were doing that back then. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9246.98s)]
*  They did it. [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9249.82s)]
*  I mean, there was tons and tons of experiments [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9250.859999999999s)]
*  using psychotropic drugs, hypnosis, mind control, [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9255.179999999998s)]
*  all sorts of different methods of manipulation, [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9259.38s)]
*  the Harvard LSD studies that made Ted Kaczynski. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9262.259999999998s)]
*  I mean, they've been doing that forever. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9266.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Where's that file? [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9271.46s)]
*  Where's the fucking file on that kid? [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9273.94s)]
*  Whoever... [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9275.66s)]
*  They almost did it. [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9276.98s)]
*  Something doesn't add up. [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9277.82s)]
*  They should have... [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9281.66s)]
*  Those phones should be... [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9283.06s)]
*  They'll tell you what's going on. [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9286.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9288.140000000001s)]
*  It's all fucked. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9291.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's very shady. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9292.26s)]
*  Obviously, there's the second guy that almost succeeded [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9298.18s)]
*  in coming through. The golf course. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9302.539999999999s)]
*  The golf course, yeah. [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9303.58s)]
*  And he was just a little careless [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9304.7s)]
*  and stuck his gun barrel out the hitch. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9306.02s)]
*  Which has been... [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9308.9s)]
*  He was so dumbass and stuck his gun barrel out the hitch. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9311.06s)]
*  And there've been other people that have been intercepted [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9320.3s)]
*  on their way to kill Trump. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9322.62s)]
*  So there's multiple assassins inbound. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9325.06s)]
*  At this point, he's got an army protecting him. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9328.14s)]
*  Well, this is also part of the problem [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9330.060000000001s)]
*  with the mainstream media saying that he's Hitler. [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9331.66s)]
*  When Joy Reid had that show before the election, [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9335.7s)]
*  she was comparing him to Mussolini, [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9337.9s)]
*  she was Stalin and Hitler. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9339.58s)]
*  She pulled it all out. [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9341.5s)]
*  They're literally saying that Trump is worse than Hitler, [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9343.1s)]
*  Mussolini and Stalin combined. [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9346.380000000001s)]
*  They tried everything. [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9349.66s)]
*  I think those guys killed 100 million people. [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9351.86s)]
*  So Trump has killed zero people. [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9354.060000000001s)]
*  I think a real big impact was you coming on the podcast [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9356.42s)]
*  the day before the election. [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9360.3s)]
*  I think that had a giant impact, that plea to the camera. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9361.14s)]
*  If you don't vote this time, [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9364.7s)]
*  this might be the last time you get to vote. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9366.74s)]
*  I think the way you laid it out today, [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9369.18s)]
*  it's a compelling argument. [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9370.539999999999s)]
*  And I know a lot of people don't wanna hear that. [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9371.7s)]
*  They're up in their little... [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9373.66s)]
*  They've got their blue panties in a bunch right now, [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9375.06s)]
*  but you gotta stop thinking that way. [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9377.06s)]
*  They tricked you into thinking you're in a tribe. [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9379.5s)]
*  They don't give a fuck about you. [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9381.619999999999s)]
*  That tribe's not real. [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9382.86s)]
*  You're not really in a tribe. [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9384.58s)]
*  They're using the fact they've got you in a tribe [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9385.94s)]
*  to manipulate you so they can keep doing [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9388.3s)]
*  what they're doing right now, [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9390.3s)]
*  which is siphoning off money, having incredible power. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9391.22s)]
*  And the more power and more money [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9394.539999999999s)]
*  and more control over you they have, [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9396.34s)]
*  the better they can keep doing this. [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9398.22s)]
*  And that's what they want. [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9399.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right. [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9401.259999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and that's the big threat [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9402.46s)]
*  that this administration poses. [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9404.74s)]
*  That's a big threat that... [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9406.3s)]
*  Essentially Doge has found the coffin [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9408.099999999999s)]
*  where the vampire sleeps. [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9410.019999999999s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of vampires. [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9412.22s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, but the US... [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9414.099999999999s)]
*  We're disturbing the... [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9417.179999999998s)]
*  We're disturbing the... [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9419.58s)]
*  The nest. [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9420.699999999999s)]
*  The nest, yeah. [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9421.539999999999s)]
*  We're kicking the hornet's nest. [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9422.38s)]
*  Like big time. [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9425.66s)]
*  I mean, we're reprogramming the matrix. [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9428.34s)]
*  Success was never one of the possible outcomes. [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9433.179999999998s)]
*  There's a Kobayashi-Maru situation. [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9435.66s)]
*  If you're in the matrix, success was never possible. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9440.699999999999s)]
*  The only way to achieve success [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9444.179999999998s)]
*  is to reprogram the matrix [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9446.74s)]
*  such that success is one of the possible outcomes. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9447.98s)]
*  That's what we're doing. [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9451.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9452.34s)]
*  We may or may not succeed. [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9454.18s)]
*  Well, it's certainly a lot of fun to watch. [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9456.619999999999s)]
*  This is a very exciting time [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9460.26s)]
*  because nothing changes [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9461.9s)]
*  when administrations come into power. [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9464.699999999999s)]
*  Very little changes. [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9467.22s)]
*  I mean, you have changes in terms of policy [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9468.539999999999s)]
*  and inflation goes up and there's a lot of different things. [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9470.66s)]
*  But not like this. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9473.1s)]
*  There are giant fundamental changes. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9475.539999999999s)]
*  And you see the system screeching and wailing [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9478.939999999999s)]
*  and you see the vampires run from the light. [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9482.58s)]
*  But it's very exciting. [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9485.339999999998s)]
*  Like as a person, a citizen just gets up in the morning [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9488.859999999999s)]
*  and checks the news like I do [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9493.74s)]
*  and gets on X and sees what's going on. [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9494.98s)]
*  Every day is like, holy shit. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9497.259999999998s)]
*  He said, what? [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9499.98s)]
*  He's getting five million bucks, [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9501.619999999999s)]
*  you can just become a citizen now? [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9503.42s)]
*  He could clear the debt with 10 million people. [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9506.22s)]
*  I never thought of that. [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9507.58s)]
*  Like what? [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9508.699999999999s)]
*  50 trillion, he can make $50 trillion that way? [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9509.74s)]
*  And then we have 15 trillion in the bank? [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9512.42s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9514.939999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean, our debt is way bigger than that. [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9515.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9517.98s)]
*  I mean, the debt's I think over 30 trillion at this point. [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9520.019999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he said he could make 50 trillion [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9523.46s)]
*  if he sold 10 million new... [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9525.3s)]
*  I don't think there's that many people [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9529.259999999998s)]
*  who have five million dollars. Golden cards. [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9530.38s)]
*  Yeah, well, how many people do have that in the world? [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9532.619999999999s)]
*  Maybe we'd get the worst people in the world [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9535.94s)]
*  to come over here and... [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9536.78s)]
*  I think the assumption is if you have five million dollars, [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9539.34s)]
*  you have a lot to contribute. [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9541.300000000001s)]
*  Come on over here, start a business. [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9542.18s)]
*  Get something cracking. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9543.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9545.220000000001s)]
*  I mean, you'd get like a green card, not citizenship. [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9546.1s)]
*  So you actually, if you commit a crime [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9548.42s)]
*  while on a green card, you lose your green card. [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9550.86s)]
*  Is that what it is with this golden ticket? [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9554.42s)]
*  Is that a green card or is it citizenship? [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9556.06s)]
*  Just a green card. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9558.1s)]
*  Yeah, so you have to not commit any crime for five years [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9559.380000000001s)]
*  in order to become a citizen. [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9562.98s)]
*  Once you commit a citizen, you can then commit crime [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9564.02s)]
*  and not be deported. [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9566.939999999999s)]
*  Oh, there's just so many wild things that he's proposing. [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9570.82s)]
*  Just the whole Gulf of America thing was hilarious. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9573.779999999999s)]
*  I think that's great. [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9576.26s)]
*  I think it's great, it's fun. [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9577.66s)]
*  It's fun. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9579.66s)]
*  I mean, if you're off the coast of Houston, [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9580.9s)]
*  you're not in Mexico, so why call it the Gulf of Mexico? [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9582.619999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I agree. [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9584.859999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9587.02s)]
*  I guess we were just being nice before. [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9588.82s)]
*  I don't know how it got called the Gulf of Mexico. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9591.1s)]
*  It's just very funny. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9594.66s)]
*  And then what news organization, was it AP? [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9596.1s)]
*  Yeah, AP, there's this massive standoff between AP [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9599.66s)]
*  and the White House press office, I guess, [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9604.300000000001s)]
*  because they're like, well, if you don't call it [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9609.820000000002s)]
*  the Gulf of America, you can't come to the White House [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9611.78s)]
*  press room. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9615.740000000002s)]
*  So then the APs sued the White House to... [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9616.58s)]
*  Say, no, you have to let us come to the White House [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9623.740000000002s)]
*  press room, and then they lost their lawsuit, [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9625.7s)]
*  because they don't have a right to show up [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9627.5s)]
*  at the press room. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9631.1s)]
*  Well, here's a consideration. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9631.980000000001s)]
*  If you're guilty of massive amounts of misinformation, [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9633.460000000001s)]
*  disinformation, as a part of a propaganda campaign, [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9638.78s)]
*  which a lot of them have been. [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9642.060000000001s)]
*  That's what AP is. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9643.300000000001s)]
*  Well, a lot of them are guilty of it. [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9644.140000000001s)]
*  A lot of the people that are in that White House [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9647.740000000002s)]
*  press conference, a lot of the organizations they work for, [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9649.380000000001s)]
*  distributed absolute lies. [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9652.86s)]
*  Total lies. [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9655.140000000001s)]
*  How many of them during the whole Russiagate thing? [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9656.58s)]
*  Yes. [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9659.42s)]
*  I mean, just that alone. [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9660.26s)]
*  A ton of people think that the Russia thing was real. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9661.1s)]
*  Still. [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9664.86s)]
*  Still, still. [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9665.7s)]
*  I mean, the whole Steele dossier, [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9667.26s)]
*  where it was completely concocted, [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9668.66s)]
*  like fabricated from nothing. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9670.94s)]
*  Funded by the Clinton campaign. [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9671.78s)]
*  Correct, funded. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9673.34s)]
*  The Clinton campaign funded a fake conspiracy theory, [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9674.54s)]
*  a fake Russia collusion hoax regarding Trump, [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9679.300000000001s)]
*  that was completely false. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9683.06s)]
*  And they reiterated it on television [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9684.22s)]
*  for three fucking years. [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9686.22s)]
*  Yes. [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9687.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9688.42s)]
*  They also repeated the fine people hoax [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9689.26s)]
*  that said that Trump called neo-Nazis fine people, [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9691.62s)]
*  which is demonstrably false. [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9696.66s)]
*  If you just listen to his speech, [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9698.38s)]
*  he absolutely makes it clear [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9700.18s)]
*  that he does not think neo-Nazis are fine people. [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9701.66s)]
*  He literally said that. [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9703.94s)]
*  I'm not talking about neo-Nazis or white nationalists. [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9705.7s)]
*  They should be condemned totally. [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9708.7s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9710.74s)]
*  And yet they repeated that lie. [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9711.74s)]
*  And I just completely lost respect for Obama [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9716.06s)]
*  when he repeated that lie a few days before the election, [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9718.7s)]
*  knowing it's false. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9721.62s)]
*  Well, this just shows how desperate they were [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9723.3s)]
*  to keep Trump out, which is wild. [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9724.74s)]
*  They would do anything. [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9727.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9728.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9729.46s)]
*  And I think they just felt like this is a tool that we have [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9730.34s)]
*  and let's use it. [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9733.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9734.46s)]
*  And let's just say whatever the fuck we have, [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9735.3s)]
*  we'll say anything. [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9736.58s)]
*  Yeah, now they're using the Nazi thing on me, obviously. [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9738.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9742.5s)]
*  But it is a little troubling because obviously, [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9745.3s)]
*  if people have fed non-stop propaganda, [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9747.34s)]
*  it is like mass hypnosis. [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9749.86s)]
*  Right. [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9751.26s)]
*  You're gonna reach some number of people who are [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9752.1s)]
*  homicidal and convince them that, [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9756.86s)]
*  well, if you kill this guy who's supposed to be [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9761.18s)]
*  like this terrible human, then that's a good thing. [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9763.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9766.7s)]
*  I mean, this is Luigi shooting the UnitedHealthcare guy. [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9768.34s)]
*  It's a slur. [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9771.7s)]
*  I don't understand that one, frankly. [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9772.54s)]
*  But I mean, you shouldn't, like, I don't get it. [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9775.1s)]
*  Yeah, I don't get it either. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9779.18s)]
*  He didn't even have a contract with them. [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9780.02s)]
*  It wasn't even like that was his provider [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9781.78s)]
*  and they fucked him over. [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9783.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9785.060000000001s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know what. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9785.900000000001s)]
*  Maybe we'll find out in the trial. [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9787.060000000001s)]
*  I mean, but still, kinda crazy. [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9789.18s)]
*  It is crazy. [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9791.5s)]
*  But there are people like that out there. [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9792.34s)]
*  And as to the point that we spoke about earlier, [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9793.740000000002s)]
*  it's only Fox News that's talking about the positive things [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9796.82s)]
*  that Doge has found. [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9799.94s)]
*  It's only. [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9801.3s)]
*  Every other media organization is on this [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9802.42s)]
*  constant propaganda tour where they're only talking about [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9805.58s)]
*  the negative aspects that turn out to not even be true. [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9809.22s)]
*  Right. [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9812.699999999999s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9813.98s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Scott Jennings on CNN is good. [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9815.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9818.1s)]

*  It's just funny watching them speak logically [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9821.46s)]
*  to these people and they freak out. [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9822.82s)]
*  Yes. [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9825.779999999999s)]
*  It's remarkable. [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9827.66s)]
*  It is. [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9828.94s)]
*  And he's so calm when he does it. [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9830.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9831.779999999999s)]
*  And it's crazy that they keep letting him do it [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9832.619999999999s)]
*  because it's like he's just dunking on these people [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9834.34s)]
*  over and over and over again and they never score. [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9836.46s)]
*  It's kinda funny. [[02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9838.98s)]
*  Totally. [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9840.02s)]
*  I mean, kudos to them for having [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9840.86s)]
*  a legitimate conservative voice who's a reasonable person [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9843.22s)]
*  on these panels now. [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9845.98s)]
*  But even then, he's outmanned. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9847.06s)]
*  It's like one of him and there's a bunch of screechy, [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9849.34s)]
*  woke people. [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9853.74s)]
*  Yes. [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9854.82s)]
*  It's wild. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9855.66s)]
*  They're like, I think we should still stay mostly woke. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9857.46s)]
*  Yes. [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9860.54s)]
*  Yeah, that's essentially what they're doing. [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9862.02s)]
*  Our business was being hurt when we were all woke, [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9863.94s)]
*  but let's stay mostly woke. [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9866.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9868.7s)]
*  They just backed it off a notch. [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9869.54s)]
*  Just a notch. [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9871.02s)]
*  Just a notch. [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9871.98s)]
*  But the problem is, when you back it off a notch [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9872.82s)]
*  and you let someone like Scott Jennings in, [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9875.62s)]
*  you're fucking up your whole business [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9877.94s)]
*  because all the viral clips are all him [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9879.54s)]
*  saying logical, reasonable things with a calm tone [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9882.38s)]
*  and people screeching about diversity and equity [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9885.42s)]
*  and whole horseshit. [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9888.98s)]
*  Yes. [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9890.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9891.66s)]
*  He's like being logical and reasonable [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9892.5s)]
*  and they're just lobbying a bunch of non-sequiturs [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9894.66s)]
*  that don't mean anything. [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9897.22s)]
*  The real trap in this country is the two-party system. [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9901.14s)]
*  That's the real trap because people do believe it. [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9903.42s)]
*  They do believe they're on the right side [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9905.82s)]
*  and they do believe the other side's the wrong side. [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9907.539999999999s)]
*  If there was five, six legitimate parties [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9909.42s)]
*  with varying positions on things [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9912.38s)]
*  and much more centrist parties that were legitimate, [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9914.06s)]
*  that people knew that if they voted for, [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9916.619999999999s)]
*  these people could get in and enact legitimate change, [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9918.26s)]
*  we'd be a lot better off. [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9921.74s)]
*  But boy, they put a lockdown on that shit [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9922.9s)]
*  right after Ross Perot came along. [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9925.5s)]
*  Ross Perot fucked everything up in that election. [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9927.5s)]
*  Bill Clinton got in and they were like, that's it? [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9930.98s)]
*  From now on, no one's debating unless you're [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9934.019999999999s)]
*  either the head of that party or that's it. [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9938.26s)]
*  You gotta be locked into the system. [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9941.78s)]
*  We're not letting any wackadoos in there. [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9944.94s)]
*  Yeah, I remember watching those Ross Perot videos. [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9947.94s)]
*  Oh, like him on TV with his charts and everything. [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9950.66s)]
*  Oh yeah, he was telling you how the IRS was fucking you. [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9952.980000000001s)]
*  This is what the Federal Reserve really is. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9955.66s)]
*  And you're like, what? [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9958.42s)]
*  I remember watching that. [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9959.380000000001s)]
*  The guy bought a whole half hour of television [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9960.220000000001s)]
*  on prime time. [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9962.980000000001s)]
*  It might have been an hour. [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9964.5s)]
*  I remember watching that thing going, [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9965.42s)]
*  how is this guy even allowed to do this? [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9966.900000000001s)]
*  This is crazy. [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9970.460000000001s)]
*  I think most of what he was saying was true. [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9972.5s)]
*  It is absolutely true. [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9973.9s)]
*  It's absolutely true. [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9975.34s)]
*  I mean, he didn't lie. [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9976.34s)]
*  He told the truth. [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9977.98s)]
*  He just understood it in a way that the general public [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9978.82s)]
*  had literally no idea. [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9980.78s)]
*  Well, I think there's also this, [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9983.14s)]
*  do we actually have two parties, do we have one party? [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9985.98s)]
*  Like the whole uniparty thing. [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9988.42s)]
*  It's kinda true. [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9989.98s)]
*  My sort of rough guess is that [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9992.06s)]
*  while I think maybe [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9995.619999999999s)]
*  three quarters of the graft is Democratic, [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=9999.38s)]
*  I think there's like maybe on a 20, 25% that's Republican. [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10002.539999999999s)]
*  So they've like, basically most of the graft [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10006.939999999999s)]
*  is going to the Democrats, [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10010.099999999999s)]
*  but they throw some bones to the Republicans too. [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10011.539999999999s)]
*  So then they're in on it. [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10014.859999999999s)]
*  And it's not like there's zero graft [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10015.98s)]
*  on the Republican side, to be clear. [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10018.74s)]
*  Oh, there's plenty of conservative [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10020.3s)]
*  that are insider trading in Congress. [[02:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10022.9s)]
*  Yeah. Plenty. [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10024.9s)]
*  Insider trading. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10026.259999999998s)]
*  And just there's the curious case of [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10027.26s)]
*  how do people in Congress or whatever [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10031.220000000001s)]
*  become wealthy over time? [[02:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10034.7s)]
*  Extremely wealthy. [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10037.58s)]
*  Yes. [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10038.74s)]
*  On a $170,000 a year salary. [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10039.62s)]
*  It's like literally impossible. [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10042.02s)]
*  Yeah. No one else does that. [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10043.26s)]
*  It's literally impossible. [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10044.86s)]
*  If you find out that this guy has a $170,000 a year job, [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10045.82s)]
*  you're like, oh, he's doing okay. [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10049.26s)]
*  He's all right. [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10050.74s)]
*  And then you're like, wait a minute, [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10051.82s)]
*  why does he have $50 million? [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10052.78s)]
*  Yes. [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10054.58s)]
*  What is he doing? [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10055.42s)]
*  That's correct. [[02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10056.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10057.08s)]
*  And I think the more accurate thing would be to say [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10057.92s)]
*  what is the family value increase? [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10062.92s)]
*  Meaning like, [[02:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10065.16s)]
*  how much does their spouse earn? [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10069.84s)]
*  Do they have a mysteriously wealthy spouse? [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10071.68s)]
*  Right. [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10073.6s)]
*  Right. [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10075.8s)]
*  And do they have a spouse that's really good [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10077.8s)]
*  at insider trading? [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10080.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10082.0s)]
*  Like Paul Pelosi. [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10083.76s)]
*  Really good. [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10085.4s)]
*  Yeah. He's great at trading. [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10086.88s)]
*  He's such a good trader. [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10088.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10090.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10090.839999999998s)]
*  So this, [[02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10091.679999999998s)]
*  I mean, so yeah, there's, [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10093.519999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's why I actually posted on X. [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10096.439999999999s)]
*  Like I think maybe we should pay politicians more, frankly, [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10098.32s)]
*  because it reduces the forcing function for graft. [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10102.96s)]
*  I think maybe we should either pay politicians nothing [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10108.359999999999s)]
*  or maybe a lot more. [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10110.679999999998s)]
*  Somewhat maybe counterintuitively, [[02:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10114.48s)]
*  if politicians got paid a lot more, [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10117.04s)]
*  then they wouldn't feel like [[02:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10119.36s)]
*  that there's so much of a forcing function [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10122.16s)]
*  for them to accept corrupt money. [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10124.84s)]
*  Yeah, but the problem is if you paid them a lot more, [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10129.2s)]
*  they're still not gonna make as much money [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10131.08s)]
*  as they would insider trading. [[02:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10132.68s)]
*  But it's less of a forcing function. [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10134.32s)]
*  Yes. [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10135.960000000001s)]
*  Well, let me put this way. [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10137.2s)]
*  If you say somebody's gotta, [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10138.4s)]
*  let's say they got like whatever, [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10141.24s)]
*  some kids in DC and like it's expensive. [[02:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10142.88s)]
*  It's like expensive place to live. [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10146.08s)]
*  The schools are terrible. [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10149.4s)]
*  So like they need to send their kids [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10150.599999999999s)]
*  to like some kind of private schooling situation. [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10152.4s)]
*  They literally cannot afford that. [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10154.439999999999s)]
*  They cannot afford that right now. [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10157.599999999999s)]
*  So then you get into the situation. [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10159.359999999999s)]
*  Well, from their standpoint, well, they've gotta, [[02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10160.72s)]
*  they'll say they're doing it for their family. [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10164.72s)]
*  They're doing it for their kids. [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10167.039999999999s)]
*  Well, especially if it's legal and it currently is. [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10168.359999999999s)]
*  You kind of be silly to not do that. [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10171.6s)]
*  If you were a part of a group of people [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10173.6s)]
*  that's passing a bill and you know this bill's [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10175.640000000001s)]
*  gonna get passed, you know the votes are there [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10177.4s)]
*  and you know it's gonna affect this industry [[02:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10179.92s)]
*  and this particular manufacturer and you can buy stock. [[02:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10182.52s)]
*  It's more than just insider trading. [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10187.36s)]
*  Like the insider trading stuff, [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10192.28s)]
*  like the stock portfolio stuff is quite trackable, [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10193.640000000001s)]
*  but there's, it's a lot more than insider trading. [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10195.960000000001s)]
*  The way they're acquiring wealth. [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10201.199999999999s)]
*  Correct. [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10202.679999999998s)]
*  And what other methods? [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10203.759999999998s)]
*  I mean this is really gonna get me assassinated. [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10206.56s)]
*  It's like I'm not lengthening my life span [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10210.32s)]
*  by explaining this stuff to say the least. [[02:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10214.08s)]
*  I mean I was supposed to go back to DC. [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10219.8s)]
*  How am I gonna survive? [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10221.24s)]
*  This focus is gonna kill me for sure. [[02:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10222.4s)]
*  So in fact I do think like there's, [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10226.039999999999s)]
*  it's like I actually have to be careful [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10232.64s)]
*  that I don't push too hard on the corruption stuff [[02:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10234.96s)]
*  because it's gonna get me killed. [[02:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10240.56s)]
*  You know. [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10245.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10249.92s)]
*  You know. [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10251.08s)]
*  It's like I was actually thinking about that [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10253.36s)]
*  on the plane flight over here. [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10254.880000000001s)]
*  It's like if I push too hard on the corruption stuff, [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10255.84s)]
*  people get desperate is the issue. [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10259.92s)]
*  Right. [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10261.880000000001s)]
*  Then they say like okay if the money flow cuts off, [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10262.72s)]
*  then okay they can't afford school for their kids. [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10267.960000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10270.92s)]
*  Then they're like well fuck you, [[02:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10271.76s)]
*  I'm gonna kill you for my kids type of thing. [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10273.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10277.08s)]
*  You know and it's like oh geez. [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10277.92s)]
*  Did you ever see that video? [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10279.04s)]
*  I think it was an O'Keefe video [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10281.519999999999s)]
*  where they've got this guy undercover [[02:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10282.92s)]
*  and he's explaining, [[02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10285.92s)]
*  they're talking to this guy, [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10287.64s)]
*  he thinks he's on a date, [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10288.48s)]
*  and he's explaining, [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10289.56s)]
*  it's always a guy on a date, [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10291.039999999999s)]
*  explaining how they can nudge someone [[02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10292.439999999999s)]
*  to go and do something horrible. [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10296.48s)]
*  And they recognize this person has problems. [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10298.439999999999s)]
*  They find an asset. [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10301.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10303.8s)]
*  Totally. [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10304.64s)]
*  Well see this is what I think [[02:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10305.48s)]
*  for that Butler situation, for that assassin, [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10307.16s)]
*  you don't, it's kind of like, [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10309.68s)]
*  that funny looking sport, curling. [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10313.16s)]
*  You know where they have like the stone on the ice [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10316.279999999999s)]
*  and then they throw the stone [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10318.439999999999s)]
*  and then there's someone that's like brushing the ice [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10320.279999999999s)]
*  but you can't touch the stone. [[02:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10322.8s)]
*  Right. [[02:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10325.16s)]
*  All you can do is just change the path of the stone [[02:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10326.0s)]
*  a little bit but you keep brushing the ice [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10328.84s)]
*  and you can steer that stone right into the bullseye. [[02:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10331.56s)]
*  That's what I think happened in Butler. [[02:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10335.92s)]
*  That's what I think happened with that assassin. [[02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10339.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10340.96s)]
*  If you can find the trail of breadcrumbs, [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10341.8s)]
*  it's gonna be like curling. [[02:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10346.08s)]
*  Somebody was brushing the ice. [[02:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10347.8s)]
*  Well also you find a young, confused, [[02:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10349.44s)]
*  disenfranchised person and you give them purpose [[02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10351.84s)]
*  in their life. [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10354.36s)]
*  Just brush the ice. [[02:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10355.24s)]
*  Yeah and also- [[02:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10356.2s)]
*  If you're brushing the ice, [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10357.039999999999s)]
*  eventually it's gonna hit the bullseye. [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10357.88s)]
*  If you're in a position of authority [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10359.0s)]
*  or some like big time government person, [[02:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10360.84s)]
*  you're talking to this person, [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10364.48s)]
*  all of a sudden this person's a valuable asset. [[02:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10365.6s)]
*  They're gonna help America [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10368.24s)]
*  and you're gonna do this thing [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10369.800000000001s)]
*  and you're gonna be our top assassin from here on out. [[02:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10371.720000000001s)]
*  You could talk people into doing a lot of things. [[02:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10377.36s)]
*  That's what cults are around, right? [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10380.12s)]
*  No, exactly. [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10382.2s)]
*  I mean they're suicide bombers. [[02:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10384.52s)]
*  I mean the Butler guy was a suicide assassin. [[02:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10385.56s)]
*  The second guy that tried to kill him on the golf course [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10388.76s)]
*  was also a suicide assassin. [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10392.04s)]
*  From what I read, [[02:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10394.36s)]
*  the Secret Service member that saw the gun pointing out, [[02:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10396.880000000001s)]
*  it fired several shots, [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10401.12s)]
*  none of which hit the assassin. [[02:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10402.48s)]
*  But well it could have. [[02:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10404.44s)]
*  Like if those shots had hit the second assassin, [[02:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10406.04s)]
*  he would be dead too. [[02:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10409.880000000001s)]
*  So both of them were on a suicide mission. [[02:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10411.6s)]
*  Both of them. [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10421.76s)]
*  One actually got killed, [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10423.84s)]
*  the one of them didn't get killed. [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10425.2s)]
*  But he could have been killed [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10427.44s)]
*  if the bullets had hit him. [[02:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10428.28s)]
*  And you don't hear anything about him either. [[02:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10429.880000000001s)]
*  There's a lot more about that guy than the first guy. [[02:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10432.76s)]
*  I mean you look at his background, [[02:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10435.68s)]
*  he looks like, you know. [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10437.640000000001s)]
*  Unhinged. [[02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10440.04s)]
*  Yeah, totally unhinged. [[02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10440.86s)]
*  The first guy, there's no, [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10442.44s)]
*  I'm not aware of any evidence that shows [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10445.92s)]
*  that he's so unhinged as to be a suicide assassin. [[02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10448.6s)]
*  No. [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10451.84s)]
*  I'm like okay, yeah. [[02:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10452.68s)]
*  Well two years before he was acting in commercials. [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10453.960000000001s)]
*  And he got a high score in his SATs. [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10457.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10460.92s)]
*  So, you know. [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10462.12s)]
*  Well without getting you killed. [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10468.0s)]
*  Yeah exactly. [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10469.6s)]
*  So I mean like basically, [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10470.44s)]
*  I'm like listen, [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10472.12s)]
*  well attack the corruption enough [[02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10473.36s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10480.44s)]
*  But I think if I fully destroy [[02:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10481.56s)]
*  the corruption and the graft, [[02:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10486.68s)]

*  I mean I strive to be alive. [[02:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10506.8s)]
*  But yeah, I mean it's a real concern. [[02:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10511.8s)]
*  You know, I mean there were two guys that, [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10517.519999999999s)]
*  before I supported trauma and everything, [[02:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10519.72s)]
*  there were two guys that traveled to Austin to kill me. [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10523.0s)]
*  I don't know if you know about this. [[02:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10527.84s)]
*  Yeah I did hear about that. [[02:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10528.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10530.08s)]
*  And two separate incidents. [[02:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10531.0s)]
*  One guy thought I put a chip in his head. [[02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10534.519999999999s)]
*  And I mean they're both basically two guys [[02:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10538.88s)]
*  that just very much had severe mental illness. [[02:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10541.84s)]
*  It wasn't like they had like a, [[02:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10544.56s)]
*  I disagree with him politically [[02:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10546.76s)]
*  and that's why he needs to die. [[02:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10548.0s)]
*  This is pre, before I was, [[02:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10549.64s)]
*  before I got sort of smeared as being, you know, [[02:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10552.84s)]
*  some sort of like Nazi or something like that. [[02:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10557.119999999999s)]
*  This is before the propaganda wave, [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10559.119999999999s)]
*  the severe propaganda wave. [[02:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10561.8s)]
*  The probability that any given homicidal maniac [[02:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10565.24s)]
*  is gonna try to kill you is proportionate [[02:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10568.72s)]
*  to how many times they hear your name. [[02:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10570.28s)]
*  And so they heard my name a lot, [[02:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10573.68s)]
*  so I just got to the top of the list [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10575.36s)]
*  of two homicidal maniacs who were arrested [[02:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10578.16s)]
*  and both were in Travis County jail at the same time. [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10581.84s)]
*  Wow. [[02:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10586.28s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if they talked or whatever, [[02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10587.12s)]
*  but they both been released by the way. [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10589.52s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10591.92s)]
*  They both released on bail, yeah. [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10592.76s)]
*  Right, but they got ankle monitors and stuff, but still. [[02:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10595.480000000001s)]
*  They can cut those off? [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10598.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know, you know, exactly, so. [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10600.92s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10605.44s)]
*  Yeah, and the second guy I had like chief serial killer [[02:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10606.28s)]
*  in his bio on his ex profile, [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10609.6s)]
*  yeah, it's like wasn't subtle is what I'm saying. [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10612.72s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10615.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10617.76s)]
*  And at this point, I think I'm at the top of the list [[02:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10621.52s)]
*  for a lot of homicidal maniacs. [[02:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10624.88s)]
*  And the more the mainstream media talks about you [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10627.4s)]
*  in this way and says you're a Nazi and. [[02:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10630.04s)]
*  They're doing the same thing to me that they did to Trump. [[02:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10636.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10639.24s)]
*  Which is, they're making it sound like [[02:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10640.24s)]
*  if you kill me, you're a hero. [[02:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10642.960000000001s)]
*  That's, what they're doing is evil. [[02:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10645.800000000001s)]
*  They're also doing the same thing [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10651.2s)]
*  where they're completely distorting who you are [[02:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10652.560000000001s)]
*  and people are going along with it. [[02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10655.12s)]
*  And just like we're talking about [[02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10656.72s)]
*  Trump derangement syndrome, [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10658.12s)]
*  people have Elon derangement syndrome. [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10659.64s)]
*  I see it. [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10661.84s)]
*  I see where people can't see the forest for the trees. [[02:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10662.68s)]
*  Right, and it's like I'm the same person [[02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10665.6s)]
*  that I was a year ago. [[02:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10668.24s)]
*  Nothing's changed, really. [[02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10669.84s)]
*  Like I didn't suddenly become a completely different human. [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10673.44s)]
*  Right. [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10677.16s)]
*  But if you read the sort of legacy mainstream media, [[02:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10678.56s)]
*  their propaganda stream is that [[02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10683.8s)]
*  I am a completely different human. [[02:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10686.24s)]
*  Right. [[02:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10688.24s)]
*  But I didn't get like a brain transplant in a year. [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10689.08s)]
*  And let's say like two years ago, [[02:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10694.039999999999s)]
*  I was like a hero of the left. [[02:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10696.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10697.8s)]
*  So how can I go from hero to villain at age 53 suddenly? [[02:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=10699.519999999999s)]

*  What supposedly more accurate than most physicians [[03:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=11020.12s)]
*  Yeah, because physicians are human beings and maybe they don't have a deep understanding of the connection between oh [[03:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=11024.0s)]
*  You have this deficiency and this is a high and your cortisol is here and well [[03:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=11030.24s)]

*  I really do and particularly with ownership of X but also with what's happening with Doge and just enlightening all these people and [[03:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=11271.2s)]

*  Their mannerisms. It was the Holocaust. It was the war and genocide is what is the bad part? Yeah [[03:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=11327.18s)]
*  Not their mannerisms and their dress code [[03:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo&t=11334.7s)]
