# Joe Rogan Experience #1884 - Anthony Kiedis
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6.0s)]
*  Good to see you man, what's happening? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=12.0s)]
*  What is really happening? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=14.0s)]
*  Your show was fucking great. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=16.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=17.0s)]
*  I really enjoyed it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=18.0s)]
*  I'm so happy to hear that. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=19.0s)]
*  What that means to me is even on an off night, we're still pretty good. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=20.0s)]
*  That was an off night? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=24.0s)]
*  Way off. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=25.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=26.0s)]
*  Bad sound. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=27.0s)]
*  Sound was bad? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=28.0s)]
*  For me. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=29.0s)]
*  Sounded good. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=30.0s)]
*  We have high standards. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=31.0s)]
*  I guess. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=33.0s)]
*  It was excellent. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=34.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=35.0s)]
*  So what else was wrong? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=36.0s)]
*  High, the sound? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=37.0s)]
*  Well, I like to dance and I like to get the mojo flowing at maximum photon speed. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=38.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=46.0s)]
*  And my knee was locked up so I couldn't fully flow, which is disconcerting and it actually [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=47.0s)]
*  throws my singing off as well. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=54.0s)]
*  Well, we talked afterwards about your knee injury, but while you were on stage, I didn't [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=57.0s)]
*  notice anything. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=62.0s)]
*  You move great. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=63.0s)]
*  I can move better, but thanks. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=64.0s)]
*  The good news for me is I'm surrounded by John, Chad and Flea, which is just like a [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=66.0s)]
*  huge uplifting energy circle. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=74.0s)]
*  So they carry me. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=78.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=80.0s)]
*  How did you injure your knee? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=81.0s)]
*  Is it just from all the years of dancing on stage? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=82.0s)]
*  Pounding, pounding on stage for a hundred years. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=84.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=87.0s)]
*  You know, Maynard from Tool, he's got an artificial hip. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=88.0s)]
*  Stomping. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=92.0s)]
*  From stomping. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=93.0s)]
*  From stomping on stage, he blew his fucking hip out. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=94.0s)]
*  I'm not surprised. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=97.0s)]
*  What I am surprised is that Mick Jagger hasn't blown both of his hips out. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=99.0s)]
*  Oh man, we saw him when he was at CODA, the Circuit of the Americas here in Austin. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=102.0s)]
*  It was insane. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=107.0s)]
*  First of all, it was like a psychedelic experience just seeing him because you can't believe [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=108.0s)]
*  that's really Mick Jagger up there. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=113.0s)]
*  Like that's the fucking Rolling Stones. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=114.0s)]
*  They were incredible. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=116.0s)]
*  And he's still dancing around. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=118.0s)]
*  He's as old as Biden. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=120.0s)]
*  He's as old as Biden. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=122.0s)]
*  Which is an official expression by the way. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=124.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=127.0s)]
*  I mean, that's he's like commensurate. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=128.0s)]
*  It's like, I think he's basically the same age, right? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=129.0s)]
*  Like what is Biden? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=131.0s)]
*  Biden's like 78. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=132.0s)]
*  And I think Mick Jagger is like 78 as well. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=134.0s)]
*  I think he's in the neighborhood, right? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=137.0s)]
*  How old is he? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=140.0s)]
*  You can ask your father. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=142.0s)]
*  I think it's because he's 79. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=143.0s)]
*  He's so light. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=146.0s)]
*  His bone structure, his anatomy is light. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=148.0s)]
*  And he's written a song or two. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=152.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=154.0s)]
*  He's older by four months or so. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=155.0s)]
*  He's older than Biden. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=156.0s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=157.0s)]
*  As you said, he's older than Biden. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=158.0s)]
*  But meanwhile, he talks great. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=160.0s)]
*  No, he's not. No, he's not. I'm sorry. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=162.0s)]
*  No? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=163.0s)]
*  No, I misread that. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=164.0s)]
*  They're twins. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=165.0s)]
*  Biden's older by like eight months. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=166.0s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=167.0s)]
*  November 42 versus. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=168.0s)]
*  Those eight months are a motherfucker. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=169.0s)]
*  The eight months are the difference. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=170.0s)]
*  You and I shall see. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=171.0s)]
*  Hopefully we'll see. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=172.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=173.0s)]
*  If we're lucky. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=174.0s)]
*  We need those black. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=175.0s)]
*  How old are you now? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=176.0s)]
*  I am looking at 60. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=177.0s)]
*  Looking at it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=178.0s)]
*  I'm looking at it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=179.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=180.0s)]
*  Two weeks away. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=181.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=182.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=183.0s)]
*  How's it feel? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=184.0s)]
*  You look great. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=185.0s)]
*  I feel, thank you. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=186.0s)]
*  You look great too. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=187.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=188.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=189.0s)]
*  I don't know how old you are, but. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=190.0s)]
*  55. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=191.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=192.0s)]
*  You look real good. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=193.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=194.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=195.0s)]
*  We could grapple later. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=196.0s)]
*  It feels wonderful. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=198.0s)]
*  It feels so good. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=202.2s)]
*  If I can do what I want to do for the next 20, 30 years, I'm just hallelujah. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=203.46s)]
*  It's just a matter of the joints. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=210.0s)]
*  The joints holding up. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=211.48s)]
*  I think they're going to repair. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=212.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=213.48s)]
*  I think they're going to repair. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=214.48s)]
*  I went hard last night and I feel better today than I did when I saw you a week ago. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=215.48s)]
*  Oh, that's great. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  Did you get any treatments done on the knee or anything? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=220.12s)]
*  Osteopathy. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=223.0s)]
*  Osteopathy. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=224.0s)]
*  What is that? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=225.0s)]
*  Osteopathy is a medicine, a hands-on medicine where you have to study for 12 years before [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=226.96s)]
*  you can touch a patient. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=232.20000000000002s)]
*  They study anatomy, connectivity, all tissues, all bones. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=234.4s)]
*  This girl is French, Lucille, and she gets in there and she starts feeling the hamstrings [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=240.20000000000002s)]
*  connected to the knee bones, connected to the calf things, connected to the archery [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=244.72s)]
*  foot. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  She just starts allowing your body to heal. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=249.64000000000001s)]
*  She makes some space with her hands and her mind. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=252.44s)]
*  Her mind. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=255.84s)]
*  You have to be focused. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=257.71999999999997s)]
*  There's a concentration to it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  It's not the biggest part, but it's a part. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=260.84s)]
*  You're looking at me. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=264.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=265.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=266.56s)]
*  Anyway, I had a frozen shoulder. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=267.56s)]
*  Went to every doctor in the world, nothing. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=270.2s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=272.0s)]
*  Three visits with Lucille. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=273.0s)]
*  You know what's great for shoulders is hanging from your hands? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=275.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=278.59999999999997s)]
*  A chin-up bar. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=279.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=280.59999999999997s)]
*  It's really good for that. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=281.59999999999997s)]
*  Sounds good. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=282.59999999999997s)]
*  If you have frozen shoulders, impingements and things like that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  There's a theory that, as we are primates, our ancestors swung from trees and hung on [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=285.56s)]
*  trees and that the joint expresses itself better when it's constantly put through a [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=292.0s)]
*  range of motion and hanging from things. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=298.56s)]
*  People, especially people with sedentary lifestyles that never really put that kind of like where [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=302.04s)]
*  your body weight sort of stretches out your joint, your joints can kind of collapse and [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=307.72s)]
*  they get impinged and they get kind of fucked up. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=313.32s)]
*  I hear that. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=316.92s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=317.92s)]
*  We are primates and it's also mental. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=319.04s)]
*  Your brain depends on walking. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=321.14s)]
*  So old school us, we would walk all day every day, however, 20, 30 miles and it's good for [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  your brain. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=331.36s)]
*  It keeps the Alzheimer's away. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=332.36s)]
*  You stop walking and the brain kind of freezes up. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=334.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=337.40000000000003s)]
*  That's true. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  Activity is one of the very best ways to fight off all sorts of mental degeneration. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=339.79999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=345.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=346.56s)]
*  And music. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=347.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=348.56s)]
*  Well, that's why you look so great at 60 because you're always bouncing around and moving. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=349.56s)]
*  I feel bad for people that aren't like active because you will deteriorate to a point where [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=355.64s)]
*  you're not going to be able to bring it back. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=362.23999999999995s)]
*  If you can maintain, it's so much better to maintain than it is to try to rebuild. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=364.15999999999997s)]
*  Agreed. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=369.35999999999996s)]
*  People need a push. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=370.35999999999996s)]
*  People need an inspiration. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=371.96s)]
*  They need something that they love and they need maybe somebody to do it with. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=372.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=376.4s)]
*  They need something fun. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=377.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=378.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=379.4s)]
*  That's one of the key. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=380.4s)]
*  Some people love running. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=381.4s)]
*  Some people love skiing. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=382.4s)]
*  Whatever you love. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=383.4s)]
*  Doing something that you really enjoy doing that keeps you active, I think, is a great [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=384.4s)]
*  key to that. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=387.96s)]
*  I need to push. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=388.96s)]
*  You've been, I mean, when did you start? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=390.24s)]
*  You've basically been doing music your whole life. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=394.28000000000003s)]
*  I feel like I started late, relatively speaking. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=398.36s)]
*  Relatively. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=402.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=403.40000000000003s)]
*  But you've been performing since you were how old? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=404.40000000000003s)]
*  83, which would put me at 21. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=406.40000000000003s)]
*  That's pretty young. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=408.44s)]
*  But my friends had been studying and playing and practicing music since they were 10, the [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=410.12s)]
*  guys that I hooked up with musically. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=415.64s)]
*  So 21 is kind of like, you already have to have started music. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=418.96s)]
*  Like with a sport. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=424.84s)]
*  If you start at 21, it's kind of late in the game. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=425.84s)]
*  That's true. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=428.88s)]
*  So I just got lucky that I had been studying other things that fed into music. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=429.96s)]
*  So I had something to say. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=435.76s)]
*  I had rhythm. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=437.28s)]
*  I had love for dance, love for sound, love for my friends. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=438.28s)]
*  But I have been performing since I was 21. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=444.0s)]
*  It's a long time to be in the public eye, living that life. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=446.24s)]
*  It is. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=451.64s)]
*  And it's both wonderful and horrific at the same time. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=453.24s)]
*  The public eye specifically. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=457.84s)]
*  I don't think I would trade it because it comes with joy and perks and it's a unique [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=461.12s)]
*  experience. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=467.2s)]
*  But I love my anonymity to pieces. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=468.9s)]
*  I love going out in the world and just... [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=473.28s)]
*  Can you still do that? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=476.47999999999996s)]
*  Yes, not often. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=479.12s)]
*  But when I do, I love it. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=481.64s)]
*  When you can sneak by. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=483.84s)]
*  I'm not even sneaking. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=484.84s)]
*  I mean, you don't have to sneak. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=485.84s)]
*  I think it's the anti-sneak approach that makes you invisible. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=487.84s)]
*  You go about your business and maybe you just blend in. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=491.32s)]
*  Los Angeles, California is the place where I get noticed and mess with the least. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=496.28s)]
*  Because they're so used to famous people there. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=504.56s)]
*  Jaded. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=506.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=507.59999999999997s)]
*  In a bubble, self-obsessed. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=508.59999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=509.92s)]
*  They could care less. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=510.92s)]
*  The minute I walk around New York City, hey, Kedis, caught you on the TV, whatever. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=511.92s)]
*  Yeah, completely different sort of scenarios with giant masses of people. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=520.12s)]
*  The New York mass of people is not connected to show business. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=526.4799999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=529.4799999999999s)]
*  So you have less of the self-obsession. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=530.4799999999999s)]
*  And they love seeing people that they relate to. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=532.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=534.92s)]
*  And they'll let you know about it. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=535.92s)]
*  They'll stop the car. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=536.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=537.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=538.92s)]
*  But the Los Angeles scene, yeah, that's so true. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=539.92s)]
*  One of the reasons why a lot of people that are famous actually enjoy living in Los Angeles [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=545.4399999999999s)]
*  is because people are jaded. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=548.96s)]
*  You can hang out. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=550.96s)]
*  People don't care. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=553.36s)]
*  They'll leave you alone. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=554.36s)]
*  I agree. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=555.36s)]
*  I miss you as a fellow resident. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=556.52s)]
*  I understand. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=560.04s)]
*  But yeah, LA, geographically, it's gorgeous. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=562.64s)]
*  It's a harsh toke these days. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=567.56s)]
*  It's different. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=569.4399999999999s)]
*  You know, I got out in, we started looking in May of 2020. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=570.4399999999999s)]
*  Like right when they expanded two weeks to flatten the curve and it got to a month and [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=575.24s)]
*  a half. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=582.36s)]
*  And I was like, oh, this is not going away. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=583.36s)]
*  And I started seeing that there was other places where they were taking a more sane [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=586.6s)]
*  approach. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=590.08s)]
*  I immediately started looking. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=591.16s)]
*  But I had been thinking about getting out of LA anyway. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=592.84s)]
*  Just that I get anxiety about the sheer numbers of people. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=596.8s)]
*  The traffic, just the untenable volume of human beings was just like there's a certain [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=601.9599999999999s)]
*  level of anxiety that comes with that. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=610.36s)]
*  And when I would go to other places, like if I would go to Montana or go to like Utah, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=612.48s)]
*  it was like, oh, this feels better. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=617.04s)]
*  Like this is relaxing. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=619.52s)]
*  It's like less humans. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=620.9599999999999s)]
*  I hear that. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=622.48s)]
*  You did live in the boondocks, did you not? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=625.16s)]
*  I lived a little outside. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=627.0s)]
*  I didn't live in the city city. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=629.0s)]
*  So it was nice that I got my little break there. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=631.0400000000001s)]
*  But I was always aware it was around the corner. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=633.48s)]
*  It was always there. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=636.2s)]
*  I mean, I was living near. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=637.36s)]
*  There was a lot of like owls and coyotes and mountain lions. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=639.44s)]
*  There's a lot of shit out where I live. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=644.6s)]
*  Those are my people. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=646.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=647.44s)]
*  Those are my people. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=648.32s)]
*  You're naming my people. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=649.76s)]
*  Creatures. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=650.88s)]
*  There's a lot of that here. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=652.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the traffic thing is hell. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=654.52s)]
*  I ride a motorcycle to circumvent as much of it as possible every day. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=658.76s)]
*  Wow. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=663.56s)]
*  Every day unless it's freezing or raining. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=664.28s)]
*  That is a wild thing to do in Los Angeles, to ride a motorcycle, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=666.92s)]
*  because there's so many people on their phone and there's so many cars. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=670.0799999999999s)]
*  You just have to be defensive. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=674.1999999999999s)]
*  It's normal to me. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=675.1999999999999s)]
*  It's second nature. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=676.3199999999999s)]
*  Have you always ridden a motorcycle? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=677.84s)]
*  I started off crashing minibikes through backyard fences in Michigan. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=680.36s)]
*  And I put it down for a while. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=686.6800000000001s)]
*  And then sometime in the 80s, Chad Smith showed up on a Suzuki. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=688.6s)]
*  And I was like, let me try that big bike. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=694.24s)]
*  And I was hooked. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=696.48s)]
*  Wow. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=697.84s)]
*  So you just get around on motorcycles. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=698.6s)]
*  I do on a cop bike. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=700.1600000000001s)]
*  Really? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=701.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's the bike that the California Highway Patrol use. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=703.08s)]
*  So it's a big cruiser. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=707.84s)]
*  It's big. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=709.48s)]
*  It has a windshield. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=710.04s)]
*  It's fast. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=710.84s)]
*  It handles like a magic carpet. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=711.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=714.16s)]
*  Yeah, I love it. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=715.6s)]
*  Wow. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=717.32s)]
*  Do you have a car too? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=718.96s)]
*  No, I have a couple of cars. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=721.04s)]
*  But it's a pain in the ass to go down the PCH and just wait for an hour [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=723.96s)]
*  to go somewhere. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=728.16s)]
*  That's the thing about LA too. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=729.72s)]
*  You're allowed to split the lanes. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=731.0s)]
*  And people are starting to recognize. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=734.4s)]
*  Oh, there's a bike. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=737.76s)]
*  I have to make space. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=738.4s)]
*  Well, that's nice. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=740.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=741.36s)]
*  Some people are dicks though. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=741.88s)]
*  They just like scoot over so you can't go by. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=743.0799999999999s)]
*  I have moments. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=747.9599999999999s)]
*  It's also an opportunity to see where I'm at as a human being. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=748.88s)]
*  Like, do I want to kill these people or do I just want to forgive them? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=753.24s)]
*  Just forgive them and carry on with my life. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=756.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's better. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=758.9599999999999s)]
*  It's better. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=760.68s)]
*  It's a little opportunity to just exercise that aspect of your thought. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=761.28s)]
*  Yeah, also in a car. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=765.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=766.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah, for sure. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=767.72s)]
*  Who am I? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=769.0s)]
*  Well, that's one of the nice things about here. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=770.16s)]
*  People let you in. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=772.36s)]
*  It's so different. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=773.72s)]
*  They let you in the lane. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=775.04s)]
*  They wave. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=776.32s)]
*  They're more friendly. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=778.64s)]
*  People feel like, I think in Los Angeles, the problem is there's so many human [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=780.04s)]
*  beings that human beings become a bother. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=784.44s)]
*  Like, god, there's so many people. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=787.44s)]
*  Whereas here, it's only like a million people. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=788.92s)]
*  So it's like people are just a little bit more appreciative of each other. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=791.52s)]
*  It's not that level of tension. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=796.44s)]
*  This is what I hear. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=798.68s)]
*  I had a conversation with Guy on the way over here who's kind of investigating options. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=800.4399999999999s)]
*  Texas, nice, no taxes. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=807.0s)]
*  And I said, well, what do you like about it? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=810.12s)]
*  What's your main attraction? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=811.92s)]
*  And he said, people are kinder. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=813.4399999999999s)]
*  People are more thoughtful. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=815.16s)]
*  Yeah, and I don't think that's something that people would necessarily associate [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=816.48s)]
*  with Texas. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=820.08s)]
*  But they call it Texas-friendly. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=821.68s)]
*  That's literally how they describe it. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=823.92s)]
*  There is no LA-friendly. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=827.7199999999999s)]
*  Not really, unfortunately. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=829.56s)]
*  There's some friendly people. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=831.64s)]
*  On the plus side is when you do meet a person who's friendly, you really appreciate it. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=833.16s)]
*  It's like a sunny day in Seattle. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=836.8s)]
*  Yeah, good point. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=838.16s)]
*  They mean a lot to you. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=840.1999999999999s)]
*  You could find a really kind, cool person in Los Angeles. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=841.2399999999999s)]
*  It means a lot. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=843.76s)]
*  Well noted. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=845.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=846.7199999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=847.1999999999999s)]
*  So what's the horrific aspect of being famous for so long? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=849.92s)]
*  Lack of anonymity. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=857.8399999999999s)]
*  So that's the big one for you. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=859.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=861.64s)]
*  I really have no complaints. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=862.64s)]
*  I love my job so much. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=864.4399999999999s)]
*  I don't know what I did to deserve it, but it is... [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=867.0799999999999s)]
*  You're really good at it. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=870.3599999999999s)]
*  That's what you did to deserve it. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=871.3199999999999s)]
*  I do work hard, but I was taught how to work hard by my boys in the band, because they [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=874.3199999999999s)]
*  all work hard, really hard. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=879.68s)]
*  They get down. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=882.04s)]
*  They're obsessed. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=882.8s)]
*  They're obsessed with practicing and learning and pushing the boundaries and evolving and [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=883.92s)]
*  tapping into that which you cannot see or totally understand. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=889.16s)]
*  Horrific. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=895.36s)]
*  Maybe I exaggerated with the word horrific. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=896.52s)]
*  It's a good word, though. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=899.4s)]
*  It's a good word. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=900.4399999999999s)]
*  It's got the word horror. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=901.96s)]
*  I know you like some horror. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=903.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=905.92s)]
*  It's not really horrific if I think about it. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=906.56s)]
*  No. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=909.48s)]
*  I take that back. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=909.72s)]
*  It's just inconvenient sometimes, maybe. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=910.68s)]
*  Sometimes I'm shy and bashful and reclusive and I just want to... [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=915.4399999999999s)]
*  Chill. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=920.16s)]
*  Chill. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=920.68s)]
*  And people want to take pictures or have me talk to their girlfriend on the phone. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=922.0799999999999s)]
*  Small price. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=928.7199999999999s)]
*  Small price. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=929.3199999999999s)]
*  This brings me to my new philosophy in life, which I remind myself every day. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=931.88s)]
*  Can I give it to you? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=937.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=938.8s)]
*  So two months ago, we were playing at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=940.5999999999999s)]
*  Big, beautiful stadium full of people excited to sing and dance. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=945.76s)]
*  These two painter sisters from Texas raised in Manhattan brought their friend to the show. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=950.3199999999999s)]
*  We're like, great. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=956.64s)]
*  Come and we'll hook you up with tickets and passes. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=957.56s)]
*  Come say hello. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=959.68s)]
*  Beautiful people. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=960.56s)]
*  And the girl they brought was radiant in every aspect of the word. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=962.5999999999999s)]
*  Physically beautiful, energy, kindness, just light. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=968.68s)]
*  And all of my friends are like, who's that girl? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=974.36s)]
*  That girl's amazing. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=976.12s)]
*  Just a friend of our painter friends. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=978.12s)]
*  And a week went by and I opened the paper and I saw this girl had died unexpectedly. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=981.08s)]
*  33-year-old actor, model, artist. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=989.0s)]
*  And she woke up and died. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=993.4399999999999s)]
*  And they're not sure why maybe sepsis. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=995.92s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=999.92s)]
*  Young people are dying these days. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1000.92s)]
*  And I thought to myself, I woke up today and I complained about how long my room service [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1004.84s)]
*  took, how muggy it was outside and the traffic. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1009.4s)]
*  And I decided this girl was just a giver of a human being. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1015.56s)]
*  And she got plucked. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1021.2s)]
*  So I said to myself, don't be a bitch. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1024.04s)]
*  Nothing to do with gender or animals, just bitchliness, selfishness, self-obsessed, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1027.28s)]
*  self-centered, whiny. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1034.64s)]
*  Weakness. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1036.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1037.56s)]
*  And what do I have to complain about? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1038.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1040.08s)]
*  Very little, very little. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1041.52s)]
*  Relatively speaking, it's almost like you can't complain. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1043.44s)]
*  Can't complain? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1046.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1046.96s)]
*  I mean, let's look around the world. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1047.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1049.08s)]
*  Syria, Yemen, Ukraine. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1049.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1052.88s)]
*  On and on. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1053.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1054.36s)]
*  So every time I go there, which is daily, I wake up and I'm like, where's my thing? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1054.6799999999998s)]
*  And how come these people aren't doing what I want them to do? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1059.8799999999999s)]
*  The voice comes into my head, don't be a bitch. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1062.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1065.08s)]
*  So that's my new live by philosophy. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1065.76s)]
*  It's a good philosophy. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1068.12s)]
*  It's hard for people sometimes to have perspective. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1069.4799999999998s)]
*  Because your life is your life. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1072.56s)]
*  And any little irritation, if you just allow momentum to take you in that general direction, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1073.8s)]
*  which is a lot of what people do, they sort of [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1080.7199999999998s)]
*  operate on momentum. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1082.8s)]
*  They don't think. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1084.28s)]
*  They just react. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1085.0s)]
*  And then you lose perspective. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1086.32s)]
*  It's hard sometimes to pull it back. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1088.68s)]
*  Do you meditate at all? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1091.48s)]
*  I do meditate at all. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1093.3999999999999s)]
*  Not enough. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1095.6s)]
*  But I do. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1096.96s)]
*  And I love it. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1097.84s)]
*  And it's my go-to. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1099.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1100.36s)]
*  And I believe in it. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1101.0s)]
*  Rick Rubin actually shared the art of meditation with me when I was a kid, younger, early 90s. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1103.56s)]
*  He brought the TM Institute into his living room and offered the whole band an opportunity to learn. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1112.96s)]
*  And we were so crass and obnoxious that we laughed through the entire lesson. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1122.1599999999999s)]
*  This East Indian guy's up there with a chalkboard pointing at sound waves and different [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1128.24s)]
*  transcendental meditation concepts. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1134.04s)]
*  And we're just laughing obtrusively. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1136.2s)]
*  Can't stop. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1138.72s)]
*  But it wasn't because we didn't feel it or understand it or believe in it. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1140.76s)]
*  It was just a presentation itself. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1145.2s)]
*  But it stuck. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1148.4s)]
*  And we got our mantras. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1149.72s)]
*  And we got our practice. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1151.8s)]
*  And I did it religiously for a while. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1153.68s)]
*  And then I put it down. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1159.6000000000001s)]
*  But now whenever I feel like the monkey mind in a car, in a plane, in a train, in my bathtub, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1160.56s)]
*  in a tiny little kid's chair somewhere on the back porch, I'll take 10 minutes, 15 minutes. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1168.04s)]
*  And it's profound. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1175.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1177.36s)]
*  You? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1178.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1178.6399999999999s)]
*  I like to do it in different places. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1179.24s)]
*  I do it a lot of times in the sauna. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1182.04s)]
*  I like to do deep breathing exercises in the sauna. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1184.68s)]
*  So I'm kind of uncomfortable at the same time. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1187.44s)]
*  And also, I multitask. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1190.6399999999999s)]
*  Kill two birds with one stone that way. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1192.44s)]
*  But it allows me to resetting. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1194.88s)]
*  Like, just having time alone with your thoughts. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1197.5200000000002s)]
*  I have friends in show business that are never alone. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1201.4s)]
*  And they're the most troubled, I find, because they don't have space to just sit and just [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1205.3600000000001s)]
*  sort of put it all into perspective and bring yourself back to baseline and appreciate it. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1212.0400000000002s)]
*  Sometimes you just constantly look what I was talking about, momentum. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1218.0800000000002s)]
*  That's a real problem with people. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1221.2800000000002s)]
*  You're doing things, and things are happening, and you keep going. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1223.68s)]
*  And then the stresses of these things compile and pile on. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1227.1200000000001s)]
*  And you never have a chance to step back and go, wow, what a wild ride I'm on. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1230.64s)]
*  This is incredible. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1235.4s)]
*  This is amazing. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1236.64s)]
*  I should be so thankful and so appreciative. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1237.52s)]
*  Instead, you're just so caught up. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1239.88s)]
*  My agent said, what? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1241.2s)]
*  What am I doing? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1242.68s)]
*  Why do we have to be there then? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1243.28s)]
*  You have to bring it back to baseline, appreciate where you're at, and say, wow, how lucky. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1245.92s)]
*  How lucky just to be a human in 2022. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1253.1999999999998s)]
*  What a great time. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1255.76s)]
*  You don't die of cholera. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1256.4399999999998s)]
*  What a great time with all the medicine and fucking technology and all the, obviously, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1259.04s)]
*  there's downsides to all that stuff, too. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1264.6s)]
*  But pretty fucking good time to be alive. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1266.6s)]
*  What a great role the die is to be here and to be an American. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1269.12s)]
*  And this is a place where you're free to pursue your goal. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1272.36s)]
*  You don't have to wear a head scarf. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1275.48s)]
*  You're not in a religious autocrat society where you're told what to do, which happens [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1277.4s)]
*  in 2022. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1283.64s)]
*  So you're in this place, as imperfect as it is, which provides you with an immense amount [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1284.68s)]
*  of freedom. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1289.4s)]
*  We're fucking so fortunate. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1290.6000000000001s)]
*  So fortunate. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1292.72s)]
*  We're fortunate at this very moment. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1294.0800000000002s)]

*  Oh, he has to. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1299.88s)]
*  That's part of his gig, though. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1300.96s)]
*  It's New Jersey. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1302.0s)]
*  It's a law. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1302.72s)]
*  Well, seeing him on The Sopranos with the fucking wig on, it was like, wow. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1305.6s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1308.6799999999998s)]
*  He was amazing. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1309.6799999999998s)]
*  Isn't it amazing when someone's a really great musician but also can act their ass off? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1311.6799999999998s)]
*  He did great. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1317.24s)]
*  I think it was very custom for his sensibility. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1318.1599999999999s)]
*  And he's a good musician. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1323.12s)]
*  I respect him as a musician, no doubt, not that he cares. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1325.1599999999999s)]
*  But he's an even better musical historian. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1328.76s)]
*  Is he? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1331.44s)]
*  His radio show, Underground Garage. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1332.44s)]

*  Oh my god. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1335.68s)]
*  I've heard it's amazing. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1336.76s)]
*  He breaks it down. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1337.76s)]
*  The players, the people, the producers, the eras, the cities, the what led to what led [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1339.76s)]
*  to what. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1345.28s)]
*  He's good. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1347.1200000000001s)]

*  You know who's great about that? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1354.92s)]
*  Henry Rollins. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1356.1200000000001s)]
*  That motherfucker loves music so much. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1357.8400000000001s)]
*  He has this incredible stereo system in his house, this amazing collection of records. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1361.3999999999999s)]
*  He has a radio show as well. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1367.24s)]
*  I'm not sure if he's still doing it. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1368.4399999999998s)]
*  But when I had him on the podcast to talk to him about his love of music and love of [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1369.9199999999998s)]
*  collecting records, just the fucking excitement in his voice and the passion in his eyes, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1374.9599999999998s)]
*  the way he describes these things. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1381.1599999999999s)]
*  So infectious. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1382.6s)]
*  It's infectious. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1383.8799999999999s)]
*  It's also a beautiful subject, a historical subject to spend your life studying. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1384.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, you're in it. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1391.16s)]
*  You are a musician. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1392.6000000000001s)]
*  But to someone observing it from the outside, like myself, it's one of the more fascinating [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1394.16s)]
*  aspects of human culture, is that people create sounds and you create them with lyrics and [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1400.8400000000001s)]
*  you put it together in this way that literally acts as a drug. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1410.04s)]
*  It makes people feel good. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1414.88s)]
*  There's something about that. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1417.76s)]
*  There's something about it. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1420.6399999999999s)]
*  When a song comes on that you haven't heard in a long time, like Midnight Rider, like [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1422.6s)]
*  the Almond Brothers, like the big... [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1429.8799999999999s)]
*  Holy shit, that fucking song. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1433.36s)]
*  Like, woo, it's a drug. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1436.44s)]
*  It's a drug. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1439.12s)]
*  Well, literally, your brain is releasing its serotonin. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1440.12s)]
*  And there's something that we've come to expect because it's a normal part of life. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1444.4399999999998s)]
*  We all listen to music. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1451.0s)]
*  But there's moments where you can just step outside of it and realize how amazing the [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1452.84s)]
*  creation of music is. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1459.1999999999998s)]
*  It's so amazing. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1461.6399999999999s)]
*  That's why I became a musician. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1463.8s)]
*  Because of the high that I got from listening to Henry Rollins, Black Flag, Drink a Black [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1465.8799999999999s)]
*  Coffee, made me feel so alive, so full of everything, so drugged up. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1470.92s)]
*  I want to make people feel like that. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1478.64s)]
*  Defunked, made me dance like lightning bolts on the dance floor. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1481.0s)]
*  I want to make people feel like that. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1486.52s)]
*  That was my number one motivation. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1488.3600000000001s)]
*  And the love of my found family, my high school boys, just wanting to hang out with them. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1490.6000000000001s)]
*  But more than anything, I heard the message by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1496.72s)]
*  And I just wanted to roll down the street lighter than air. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1502.76s)]
*  How do I make people feel like that? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1507.72s)]
*  How can I be a part of something that makes people feel like floating down the street? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1509.2s)]
*  It really is. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1516.8400000000001s)]
*  It's a drug. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1518.8400000000001s)]
*  It's a super positive, creative drug that makes you incredibly connected to the people [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1520.04s)]
*  that make it. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1526.24s)]
*  I was watching the, I don't know if you've seen the Elvis movie, the new movie on Elvis? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1530.04s)]
*  Did not. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1533.8s)]
*  Pretty interesting. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1534.8s)]
*  I have my own movie of Elvis in my head that I didn't want to change. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1535.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1540.3999999999999s)]
*  But go ahead. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1541.3999999999999s)]
*  I don't think it'll change it. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1542.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's dramatization. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1543.3999999999999s)]
*  Obviously Tom Hanks is the Colonel. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1545.9199999999998s)]
*  You're seeing Tom Hanks. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1548.6399999999999s)]
*  Oh, he's great in it. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1550.44s)]
*  He's great in it. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1552.3200000000002s)]
*  It's really good. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1553.3200000000002s)]
*  I mean, it leaves out a lot. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1554.3200000000002s)]
*  It kind of glosses over a lot of shit. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1556.3200000000002s)]
*  But you realize that the reaction that these people are having to his music, and everybody's [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1559.6000000000001s)]
*  like, what the fuck is going on? [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1567.2800000000002s)]
*  It's like they're all on drugs. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1569.0s)]
*  All these women are on drugs. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1570.72s)]
*  They're screaming, they're throwing panties at them. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1572.1200000000001s)]
*  And back then, there wasn't really someone like him before him. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1575.16s)]
*  And also he comes around and they all freak out because it's a new drug. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1580.3600000000001s)]
*  It's this new feeling that you get from this creation, this combination of artists and [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1585.64s)]
*  music and sounds delivered by this one guy. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1590.96s)]
*  And he's saying, you ain't nothing but a hound dog. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1594.24s)]
*  And they're all going, it's wild. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1596.68s)]
*  That's what I have been. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1598.76s)]
*  Wild. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1600.76s)]
*  It was great. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1601.76s)]
*  It took me so long to realize how good he was. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1603.42s)]
*  Part of my fuel as a teenager and young 20s was just hate of other people's art. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1607.5400000000002s)]
*  Like, we'll show you. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1613.8600000000001s)]
*  We'll make something different and better. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1615.98s)]
*  Which is positive. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1618.7800000000002s)]
*  It has to happen. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1619.7800000000002s)]
*  You have to rebel against that which has come before you at a certain point. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1620.7800000000002s)]
*  But as I got older, I realized this man is the real deal. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1625.8200000000002s)]
*  This was Little Richard, as were the Everly Brothers, as were all the boys that led up [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1631.02s)]
*  to Elvis. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1635.06s)]
*  Sure. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1636.06s)]
*  Flea and I went to Graceland in the early 80s. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1637.06s)]
*  We were on tour, we were in a van. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1642.9s)]
*  We hadn't slept on a bed for months. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1645.26s)]
*  All we had was the leather jackets on our back and nothing else. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1648.98s)]
*  But we were like in Memphis playing a show, probably in a barn or something. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1654.1399999999999s)]
*  And we're like, didn't Elvis have a house here? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1659.22s)]
*  Can't we go walk through his house? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1660.9s)]
*  So we went to Graceland when it was not commercialized. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1663.46s)]
*  It was a very small little tour. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1667.26s)]
*  You could walk right through the house into his cars, the garage. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1669.68s)]
*  There were no restrictions. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1673.3s)]
*  And I went in there and I was so obnoxious and so horrible because all these people were [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1676.82s)]
*  just in awe of every little element of Elvis's life. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1682.48s)]
*  I was like, this isn't this where he took a shit on the toilet and OD'd on pills? [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1687.22s)]
*  Because I was just a little idiotic punk rocker who had no broader sense of greatness and [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1692.6599999999999s)]
*  how people might be relating to this guy. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1699.62s)]
*  It's just a stupid little memory I feel embarrassed about, but that's who I was at the time. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1702.62s)]
*  Well that's so normal for young artists to hate on art that they think is uncool or [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1710.62s)]
*  commercial or derivative. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1717.4199999999998s)]
*  That was the knock on Elvis who was derivative of black culture. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1721.26s)]
*  But what's he going to do? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1724.26s)]
*  That's what he likes. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1725.86s)]
*  He's affected and influenced by those people and he's creating his own music. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1727.9399999999998s)]
*  What is he supposed to do? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1732.06s)]
*  Not do it? [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1733.54s)]
*  Obviously people loved it. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1734.54s)]
*  It was amazing. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1735.78s)]
*  But I get the resentment from those artists. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1737.6599999999999s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1740.3s)]
*  There's a thing from young people coming up where you just want to hate on the things [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1742.4199999999998s)]
*  that you think are uncool. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1747.98s)]
*  We made a career out of that for a couple of years. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1751.22s)]
*  But as far as borrowing and using culture that you love, which can be construed as appropriation, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1756.54s)]
*  I'm all for it. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1766.3s)]
*  I want to be appropriated. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1767.56s)]
*  I think that's what culture is for. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1770.06s)]
*  Enjoying and loving and learning and taking and assimilating. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1773.18s)]
*  It should be that. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1777.7s)]
*  We went to a... [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1779.7s)]
*  Yeah, it should be that. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1780.7s)]
*  I want to dress like you because you look great. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1781.7s)]
*  It should be that with art, with food, with everything. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1783.62s)]
*  With architecture. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1786.86s)]
*  Appropriate on. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1787.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1788.86s)]
*  That's literally we are building on the backs of the people that came before us. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1789.86s)]
*  All of us are in everything we do. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1794.22s)]
*  The way we talk, in literature, in everything, we build upon the people that came before. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1797.1399999999999s)]
*  This idea of cultural appropriation being a negative thing to me is preposterous. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1806.62s)]
*  It's a respect. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1812.34s)]
*  You don't culturally appropriate things that you don't love. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1813.86s)]
*  It's a love. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1816.58s)]
*  You love those things. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1817.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1818.58s)]
*  If you're cooking Mexican food and you happen to be Dutch, who gives a shit, man? [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1819.58s)]
*  That's not going to be good Mexican, but yes. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1823.96s)]
*  It might be. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1825.62s)]
*  Who's that guy, Rick Bayless? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1827.5s)]
*  Skip Bayless' brother. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1830.3799999999999s)]
*  What? [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1831.3799999999999s)]
*  Skip Bayless' brother. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1832.3799999999999s)]
*  Rick Bayless is one of the premier Mexican food chefs in the world. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1833.3799999999999s)]
*  He's an American. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1840.82s)]
*  People shit on him because this guy has this deep love of Mexican cuisine. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1842.4199999999998s)]
*  It's very infectious. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1847.02s)]
*  Don't shit on him. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1848.02s)]
*  Please. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1849.02s)]
*  He makes all these videos and he talks about... [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1850.02s)]
*  He's famous. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1853.82s)]

*  This is the guy. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1858.74s)]
*  But this guy, he's super into Mexican food. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1859.74s)]
*  Is that his Instagram? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1863.54s)]
*  Rick underscore Bayless. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1864.82s)]
*  It's really all about the burrito. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1868.1799999999998s)]
*  Can he make a good burrito? [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1869.62s)]

*  Not do it? [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1878.3s)]
*  I want him to do it. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1879.3s)]
*  Yeah, but imagine people that are mad at him. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1880.3s)]
*  Do what you love because you weren't born on the same patch of dirt as the people. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1882.82s)]
*  Come on. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1887.3s)]

*  About nine months ago, we were putting out all this music and Flea had been to a powwow [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1903.42s)]
*  and he was like, the dancing blew me away. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1912.0600000000002s)]
*  They're so dedicated. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1914.3000000000002s)]
*  They're so beautiful, so artful. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1915.3000000000002s)]
*  It's like, we got to get to a reservation and play music. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1917.18s)]
*  I was like, great idea. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1920.02s)]
*  Let's do it. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1922.02s)]
*  So it finally came to pass last Wednesday and somehow we chose the Hoopa tribe in Northern [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1923.3400000000001s)]
*  California in Hoopa Valley, California. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1929.8200000000002s)]
*  And we arrive and it's a school gymnasium and it's a free concert and all of our equipment [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1934.5800000000002s)]
*  is there. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1939.98s)]
*  It's just cool people. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1942.66s)]
*  They're very poor and very isolated and we just wanted to go rock out for them. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1943.66s)]
*  But the first thing they did was give us all this cool stuff that they made, which is Native [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1950.34s)]
*  American gear and they wanted us to wear it. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1956.6200000000001s)]
*  They're not worried about appropriation. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1961.1s)]
*  We could sing songs all day long about our take, like my band, on their experience. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1963.5s)]
*  They love it. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1968.78s)]
*  If we get it right, if we get it wrong, they just love that we care. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1970.58s)]
*  And it was the best show of the year for us because nobody paid. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1973.66s)]
*  It was kids in a school gymnasium in the middle of nowhere. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1979.54s)]
*  Surreal. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1983.3799999999999s)]
*  They didn't believe we were coming. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1984.3799999999999s)]
*  They're like, we don't believe it. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1985.58s)]
*  Why? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1987.78s)]
*  Why us? [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1988.78s)]
*  We chose you. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1989.78s)]
*  Let's just have fun. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1990.78s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1992.34s)]
*  But they definitely defied the concept of appropriation right off the bat. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=1993.86s)]
*  Here's our stuff. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2000.14s)]
*  Please wear it. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2001.14s)]
*  Well, I think that's great. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2002.14s)]
*  They love the fact that you appreciated their culture. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2005.18s)]
*  We love the culture. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2008.5s)]
*  We love it. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2010.14s)]
*  And people are people. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2011.6200000000001s)]
*  I don't care what class you come from, what race you come from, what gender you come from. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2014.9s)]
*  People are people. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2021.1000000000001s)]
*  You're going to be assholes and you're going to be amazing people. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2022.1000000000001s)]
*  Just people are people. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2024.7s)]
*  And the variables, the differences, that's one of the cooler things. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2027.42s)]
*  Of course. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2031.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2032.5800000000002s)]
*  I mean, I don't want everybody to assimilate and become one thing. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2033.5800000000002s)]
*  But I do love the fact that there are so many variety of types of cultures. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2036.38s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2043.22s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2044.78s)]
*  It's one of the cooler things about humans. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2045.98s)]
*  There's so many different ways to live life. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2048.26s)]
*  It's one of the cooler things about the USA. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2051.78s)]
*  That was our secret weapon to being a culturally interesting place that invented things like [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2055.14s)]
*  jazz and the blues and rock and roll. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2062.5s)]
*  Stand-up comedy. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2065.06s)]
*  Stand-up comedy. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2066.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2067.06s)]
*  It's an American art form. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2068.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2069.74s)]
*  Because we have the great confluence of everybody. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2070.74s)]
*  Everybody together. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2074.54s)]
*  Everybody. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2075.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2076.54s)]
*  I love all these other countries we visit on tour, but it's one flavor. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2077.54s)]
*  It's primarily one flavor. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2081.54s)]
*  And then you get here and it's the appropriated, assimilated melting pot. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2083.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2089.7400000000002s)]
*  It really is. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2090.7400000000002s)]
*  It's a wild place to be. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2091.7400000000002s)]
*  We're very fortunate in that regard. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2092.86s)]
*  Even Texas barbecue. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2095.5s)]
*  Texas barbecue comes from Germany. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2097.46s)]
*  But, yeah, it's Germans. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2099.5s)]
*  The Germans that moved to this part of Texas, they smoked their meats. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2102.7400000000002s)]
*  They changed it a little bit and adapted it and it ultimately became Texas barbecue. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2108.86s)]
*  But Texas barbecue, brisket, brisket is a cheap cut of meat. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2114.38s)]
*  Brisket was for poor people. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2119.7000000000003s)]
*  Everybody the expensive cuts of meats like T-bones and rib eyes, right? [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2122.2200000000003s)]
*  Well brisket, they had to figure out how to cook it and make it edible because it's a [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2126.3s)]
*  tough ... [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2132.1800000000003s)]
*  Brisket is like the below the rib cage, like chest area. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2133.18s)]
*  It's like a tough, like grisly, not that much fat in it. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2138.66s)]
*  And so they figured out cooking it slowly over low heat and doing it with smoke. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2145.22s)]
*  And that's how they created Texas brisket, which is now the preferred meat. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2151.3599999999997s)]
*  You go to a barbecue, everybody wants the brisket. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2156.4199999999996s)]
*  I got introduced to brisket through the Jewish community. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2158.66s)]
*  Yes. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2161.4199999999996s)]
*  I always thought it was Jewish. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2162.86s)]
*  I didn't even realize it was a German Texas barbecue. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2164.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2167.82s)]
*  Well, I mean, that's different chains of it, right? [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2168.82s)]
*  That's what's interesting. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2171.14s)]
*  Like corned beef, like pastrami, very Jewish, right? [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2172.34s)]
*  And that's their way of cooking that food. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2177.54s)]
*  And if you go to Montreal, they call it smoked meat. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2180.94s)]
*  And you get smoked meat sandwiches and it's basically like pastrami and corned beef. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2187.02s)]
*  They have their version of it up there. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2192.34s)]
*  It's delicious. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2194.2200000000003s)]
*  Have you considered starting a wild animal barbecue establishment? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2195.2200000000003s)]
*  It's so funny that you say that because I actually have. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2202.5s)]
*  I actually talked to my friend Philip Franklin Lee, who's a Michelin star chef. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2204.98s)]
*  He started this place, Sushi Bar ATX, and now he runs Sushi by Scratch, which is literally [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2212.9s)]
*  the most amazing sushi I've ever had in my life. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2220.74s)]
*  And he's got a new burger place out here that he just opened. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2222.62s)]
*  Was it called Not a Chance Burgers? [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2226.7799999999997s)]
*  Is that what it's called? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2228.74s)]
*  Not a Damn Chance Burgers. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2229.74s)]
*  Fantastic chef. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2231.2599999999998s)]
*  And he and I actually talked about that because one of the things about Texas as opposed to [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2232.2599999999998s)]
*  most other states is that you can actually sell wild game here because wild game that's [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2238.06s)]
*  not indigenous to Texas. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2245.3799999999997s)]
*  They have a lot of introduced species. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2248.38s)]
*  There's an insane amount of animals that they've introduced into private ranches in Texas that [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2251.6600000000003s)]
*  have come from Africa and India. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2258.6200000000003s)]
*  Animals that are endangered in other countries are prevalent here, like oryx, like a scimitar [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2261.9s)]
*  oryx. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2268.7000000000003s)]
*  Very endangered. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2269.7000000000003s)]
*  I think, where are they from? [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2270.7000000000003s)]
*  From India or Africa? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2272.1800000000003s)]

*  Here they're common. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2275.5s)]
*  Sounds like a deer. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2276.5s)]

*  That is a wild looking animal, right? [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2297.46s)]
*  Well in Texas, they're common. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2301.1s)]
*  A lot of people have them, but wherever the fuck, what part of North Africa they're from, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2304.54s)]

*  I have a tiger with Miyamoto Musashi from the Book of Five Rings. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2326.42s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2331.18s)]
*  Do you know who that is? [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2332.18s)]
*  I don't. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2333.18s)]
*  He's a samurai from the 1400s who defeated 62 men in one-on-one combat and he wrote a [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2334.8199999999997s)]
*  book on strategy that I read when I was a teenager when I was doing martial arts competitions. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2343.98s)]
*  It's called the Book of Five Rings and it sort of shaped my philosophy in many ways [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2349.62s)]
*  on life because as a samurai, he believed that to be the best sword fighter, you had [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2355.5s)]
*  to be balanced. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2362.74s)]
*  You had to do calligraphy and poetry and art and you couldn't have any holes in your game, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2364.2999999999997s)]
*  your mental game, your spiritual game. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2371.04s)]
*  I like that. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2374.2999999999997s)]
*  He had a statement that he had a thing that he wrote that carried me throughout my whole [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2375.2999999999997s)]
*  life. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2380.06s)]
*  It's once you understand the way broadly, you can see it in all things. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2381.06s)]
*  The way of sword fighting was much like the way of carpentry, was much like the way of [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2387.38s)]
*  art. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2393.06s)]
*  You see what the way is. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2394.06s)]
*  It's like get out of your own way and see the path to greatness, see the path to creation [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2396.22s)]
*  and that you can find it in all things. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2402.5s)]
*  Once you see it, once you truly understand it, you're not bullshitting yourself, you're [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2404.74s)]
*  not filled with ego, you're not filled with false bravado and fake confidence. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2408.14s)]
*  Get out of that. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2413.8199999999997s)]
*  Once you see the path, you'll see it in everything. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2415.16s)]
*  It's like you see a pattern and that pattern is of creation. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2417.68s)]
*  I think you recognize that. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2423.3599999999997s)]
*  It's one of the things that I love about great things. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2425.12s)]
*  When I see something great, whether it's great piano playing or someone who's great at chess [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2427.24s)]
*  or someone's great, I love seeing the path and seeing someone who just finds the thing [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2432.12s)]
*  to express whatever the energy inside of them is. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2439.44s)]
*  You do have to get out of your own way. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2443.12s)]
*  You've got to get out of your own way. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2444.6s)]
*  You really do. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2445.6s)]
*  And people that don't get out of their own way, it's so sad. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2446.6s)]
*  I have friends that don't get out of their own way. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2448.8s)]
*  I'm like, oh, I wish I could tell you how to do that. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2451.52s)]
*  Did I see your man in the lobby, the book of five rings chap? [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2454.4s)]
*  Is he pictured? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2458.8s)]
*  The armor? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2460.84s)]
*  There's a painting, a Greg Overton samurai painting, but it's not necessarily Musashi. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2463.24s)]
*  This is Musashi. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2467.32s)]
*  OK. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2474.52s)]
*  That's him with the tiger. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2476.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2477.68s)]
*  Did he study animals? [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2479.04s)]
*  No. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2480.6s)]
*  To figure out there. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2481.6s)]
*  My buddy Aaron Delevadova, who's the tattoo artist that did that, he came up with this [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2482.6s)]
*  design. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2487.24s)]
*  Just like it's nice to have a tiger. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2488.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2490.48s)]
*  Tigers are always cool. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2491.48s)]
*  But anyway, Texas. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2492.48s)]
*  So circling back, you can get wild gear here and you can sell it. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2494.48s)]
*  So there's a lot of restaurants here. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2497.92s)]
*  There's a great place called the Lonesome Dove here in Austin. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2499.08s)]
*  And Lonesome Dove actually serves wild game, Texas wild game. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2502.36s)]
*  They serve like they have like rattlesnake sausage. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2507.4s)]
*  And I would eat that Neil Guy, which is an Indian animal. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2511.2400000000002s)]
*  It's really cool looking. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2515.8s)]
*  Ever seen a Neil Guy? [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2517.04s)]
*  Show that. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2519.4s)]
*  I'm actually going hunting for one of these things and with the television show Meat [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2520.32s)]
*  in December. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2525.68s)]
*  But a Neil Guy is this enormous, like 700 pound crazy antelope looking thing. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2526.68s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2533.56s)]
*  That's a Neil Guy. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2534.56s)]
*  Looks meaty. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2535.56s)]
*  Isn't that wild looking? [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2536.56s)]
*  Buff. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2537.56s)]
*  Powerful. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2538.56s)]
*  You were a vegetarian for a while, right? [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2539.56s)]
*  So on the subject of food. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2542.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2544.64s)]
*  I love food. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2545.64s)]
*  I love eating food. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2546.64s)]
*  Who doesn't? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2548.68s)]
*  I love it. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2549.68s)]
*  I eat it all day. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2550.68s)]
*  And I really respect everybody's choice to find their path for eating. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2552.72s)]
*  I don't impose my concepts of eating on other people. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2559.6s)]
*  I want everyone to find what works for them because we're all different. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2563.08s)]
*  We all have different metabolisms, different genetics. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2566.8399999999997s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2569.68s)]
*  And it has been a fantastic journey of trying everything under the sun. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2571.24s)]
*  For the longest time, I just ate whatever you had. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2576.2s)]
*  I was so poor and so hungry. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2579.8s)]
*  Whatever you're cooking, that's my diet. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2583.0s)]
*  And then when it got to the point where I started learning about food, I met a girl [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2586.36s)]
*  and her family was vegetarian. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2591.96s)]
*  And she was so full of love, Ioni Sky. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2594.6400000000003s)]
*  Love and light and just a good person and her whole vibe in the family house. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2597.5800000000004s)]
*  I was like, I'll try that. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2602.84s)]
*  So I did the vegetarian for a few years, got poor again and started eating whatever [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2605.52s)]
*  is available to sustain. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2610.32s)]
*  And then I tried everything. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2613.56s)]
*  Pescetarian, vegan. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2615.52s)]
*  And my body just never totally vibed with any of those things perfectly. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2618.8s)]
*  Then I met this girl, Terri Cochran, who's a scientist and a nutritionist. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2626.28s)]
*  And she studies your genes, 23andMe, takes days to study your genes and plans out your [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2631.24s)]
*  food based on your genetics. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2639.4399999999996s)]
*  And for me, it was wild freaking animals. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2642.3599999999997s)]
*  That's what I was resonating with. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2646.1s)]
*  She's like, I want you to eat alligator, elk, moose, kangaroo. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2648.24s)]
*  I was like, really? [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2654.3999999999996s)]
*  She's like, yes, all the injuries you're having are going to sort out for you. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2655.3999999999996s)]
*  I was like, I'll try it. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2659.72s)]
*  And the pandemic hit. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2661.52s)]
*  I went to Kauai. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2662.96s)]
*  I hired a chef who could source all of those things. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2663.96s)]
*  Half of these pictures you're showing, antelope. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2667.44s)]
*  And I had no choice but to eat it because that's all that was in my fridge. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2671.2799999999997s)]
*  The dude would cook and leave me food. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2675.16s)]
*  I felt the best I've ever felt in my life. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2677.2s)]
*  The strongest, the fastest, the sharpest, mental clarity. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2680.54s)]
*  So that's my diet now. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2685.96s)]
*  Well, it's the most nutrient dense food on Earth. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2687.56s)]
*  If you get Wild Game, it has the most protein, the most vitamins. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2691.4s)]
*  We're talking about a piece of elk meat. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2696.48s)]
*  If you look at it, it's a deep red color. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2699.48s)]
*  It's very red. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2702.2s)]
*  And it's just rich with protein and amino acids. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2703.32s)]
*  It's fantastic for you. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2707.38s)]
*  I know a lot of people ethically. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2708.84s)]
*  They don't like the idea of eating animals. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2711.04s)]
*  I understand it. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2713.68s)]
*  I get where you're coming from. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2714.68s)]
*  Yeah, I understand that too. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2715.68s)]
*  I love animals. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2717.04s)]
*  Yeah, I do too. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2718.04s)]
*  That's how I relate to. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2719.48s)]
*  The thing about animals is they don't live forever. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2720.48s)]
*  And the way they die in the wild is horrific. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2723.0s)]
*  In comparison to the way I get them, the way they die without me is way worse. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2726.24s)]
*  And they're not going to live forever. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2732.2799999999997s)]
*  If they're lucky, they get to 10, 11, 12. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2735.0s)]
*  Crazy if they get to 12. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2738.56s)]
*  And most of the time they're getting torn apart by animals or they freeze to death. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2740.4s)]
*  And the farm world is no bueno. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2746.24s)]
*  No bueno. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2748.24s)]
*  No, not good for us, not good for them. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2749.24s)]
*  No. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2750.9199999999996s)]
*  Except regenerative agriculture. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2751.9199999999996s)]
*  When people are doing it correctly and they're allowing these animals to roam free on grass-fed [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2753.24s)]
*  farms. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2758.3199999999997s)]
*  There's ways that people do it. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2759.8399999999997s)]
*  There's a guy named Joel Salatin who's got this place called Polyface Farms. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2761.3599999999997s)]
*  And he is an expert and a proponent of regenerative agriculture where the manure from the cows [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2766.7599999999998s)]
*  is the fertilizer for the plants. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2774.64s)]
*  And the pigs, they roam free and they chew up the ground to get roots. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2777.88s)]
*  And the chickens come along. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2783.3199999999997s)]
*  And it's like all these animals, they have this symbiotic relationship with the earth [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2784.96s)]
*  and that it's actually carbon neutral when it's done correctly. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2789.8399999999997s)]
*  Well done. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2793.72s)]
*  The real question is though, and this is what I've asked a lot of people this and I can't [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2794.4s)]
*  really get a square answer. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2798.92s)]
*  It's like, is that sustainable for enormous populations? [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2800.0s)]
*  It doesn't seem like it is. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2803.84s)]
*  I think nature has a way of creating sustainability. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2806.04s)]
*  And if you study nature, which that sounds closer to, it might be more sustainable than [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2809.2400000000002s)]
*  we think. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2814.76s)]
*  Population is a beast. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2816.6800000000003s)]
*  Population is a beast. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2818.5600000000004s)]
*  The issue is what's unnatural is a city where you can jam 20 million people into an area [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2819.5600000000004s)]
*  that's not grown anything other than weed. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2825.44s)]
*  It's kind of weird. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2827.6400000000003s)]
*  It's kind of weird. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2829.1200000000003s)]
*  They're stuffing all these people into this area. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2830.2s)]
*  Like Los Angeles, for example, very little water. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2832.7999999999997s)]
*  And everybody's condensed and they're all getting food from somewhere. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2836.24s)]
*  Well, they're not growing it. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2839.64s)]
*  They're getting the weed too. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2840.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2841.88s)]
*  Everything has to be shipped in. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2842.88s)]
*  So you've got all this, the carbons coming from all the trucks that are shipping things in. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2844.04s)]
*  My favorite is the wild boar. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2849.12s)]
*  I love it to pieces. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2852.24s)]
*  And really it comes down to what are these animals eating because that's what makes their [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2854.4s)]
*  composition. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2858.64s)]
*  So you look at a wild boar, like you said, they're eating roots and leaves and grubs [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2860.16s)]
*  and all this good stuff off the forest floor. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2866.24s)]
*  And that's turning their meat into something beautiful. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2869.8799999999997s)]
*  And I honor their life and I respect the fact that I'm taking a life, but they don't live [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2873.3199999999997s)]
*  forever. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2879.16s)]
*  And you're taking the body, you're not taking the spirit. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2880.3599999999997s)]
*  The thing about wild boar here in Texas and in California as well, they have to shoot [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2885.0s)]
*  them because they're an invasive species. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2889.4s)]
*  They brought them in. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2892.0s)]
*  And when the Europeans came, like in whatever year they brought them over to this country, [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2893.0s)]
*  and now they're everywhere. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2900.0s)]
*  There's millions of them in Texas and they literally have to hunt them. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2901.28s)]
*  They have to because there's no natural predators or certainly not enough. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2906.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean, their only natural predators really are mountain lions. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2909.84s)]
*  And there's no way mountain lions can keep up with the way they breed. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2913.68s)]
*  Their gestation period is, I think it's like three months, three weeks and three days. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2916.96s)]
*  So they can, in a perfect world, they can have three cycles of gestation every year. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2923.48s)]
*  So they could have three litters a year. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2930.32s)]
*  They're making babies. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2932.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy how many they make. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2933.32s)]
*  And they just go. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2935.72s)]
*  From the time they're six months old, when they're six months old, they can give birth, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2936.96s)]
*  which is crazy. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2942.8s)]
*  A little young. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2943.8s)]
*  And they're just shooting out piglets. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2944.8s)]
*  Yep. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2945.8s)]
*  And those little piglets are running around destroying crops and there's no natural predators. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2946.8s)]
*  Well let me know when you start your wild game barbecue joint. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2951.12s)]
*  All right, buddy. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2954.1600000000003s)]
*  Please. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2955.1600000000003s)]
*  I will. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2956.1600000000003s)]
*  I wish if you lived out here, man, I'd supply you with food. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2957.1600000000003s)]
*  I have a lot of meat. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2958.8s)]
*  I hook up a lot of my friends with elk meat. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2960.28s)]
*  It's surprisingly attainable. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2963.4s)]
*  I got elk coming down the pike. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2965.92s)]
*  I have a little tiny Irish chef called Anya. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2967.44s)]
*  And if I say any animal to her, like, I'd like to try some alligator. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2971.76s)]
*  She's like on the phone getting the alligator scent. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2975.68s)]
*  It works. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2980.32s)]
*  Nice. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2981.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2982.32s)]
*  Yeah, I alligator hunted in Florida this year. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2983.32s)]
*  You hunted. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2984.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2985.48s)]
*  It's heavy. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2986.48s)]
*  I respect that. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2987.48s)]
*  I can't do it. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2988.48s)]
*  I'm too much of a punk to be able to do it. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2989.48s)]
*  You're not a punk. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2991.48s)]
*  You just don't want to do it. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2992.48s)]
*  It's okay. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2993.48s)]
*  I get it. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2994.48s)]
*  I don't want to do it either if I didn't. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2995.52s)]
*  I was either going to become a vegan or I was going to become a hunter. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=2999.44s)]
*  That was my, those are my two paths. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3003.6s)]
*  You should be able to kill the animal. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3005.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3006.84s)]
*  That's what I had. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3007.84s)]
*  I had seen too many of those factory farming videos and I was like, fuck all that. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3008.84s)]
*  And then my friend Steve Rinella from the show Meat Eater that I was talking to you [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3013.88s)]
*  about, he took me hunting and I actually shot that deer right there. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3017.88s)]
*  That's the first animal I ever shot. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3021.52s)]
*  That skull on the table. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3023.36s)]
*  That's a mule deer that we shot. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3024.36s)]
*  That's a mule? [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3026.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3027.32s)]
*  Well, it's a deer. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3028.32s)]
*  It's called a mule deer. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3029.32s)]
*  Yeah, mule deer. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3030.32s)]
*  And it's from Montana. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3031.32s)]
*  We shot that and I ate it and I was like, okay, that makes sense. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3032.32s)]
*  This makes sense. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3036.28s)]
*  The experience is difficult to attain. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3037.28s)]
*  You have to work really hard for it. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3039.0s)]
*  You're hiking in the mountains. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3041.1600000000003s)]
*  You have to play the wind. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3042.44s)]
*  You have to be smart. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3044.2000000000003s)]
*  You know, there's a lot going on. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3045.2000000000003s)]
*  And then the reward for it is, you know, mule deer like that was like a 250 pound animal. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3047.58s)]
*  So I'm eating that for a couple months. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3052.48s)]
*  You've got some freezers. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3054.64s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3055.64s)]
*  No, I respect that and I wish I had it in me to come face to face with the creature [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3056.64s)]
*  that I'm eating that I'm taking. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3062.2s)]
*  I just haven't found it yet. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3063.76s)]
*  You don't have to. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3065.16s)]
*  You don't have to. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3066.16s)]
*  Especially an alligator. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3067.16s)]
*  I love those guys. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3068.16s)]
*  I fucking hate those things. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3069.16s)]
*  I love them. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3070.24s)]
*  I hate those things. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3071.24s)]
*  Because when I was a little kid, I used to live in Florida. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3072.24s)]
*  I lived in Gainesville and there was a lady that lived in my neighborhood and her dog [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3073.8s)]
*  got snatched. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3077.56s)]
*  She's walking her dog and this fucking alligator comes over and snatches her dog. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3079.04s)]
*  There's no convenient market for the alligator. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3082.6s)]
*  He's got to find his dog every day. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3085.2799999999997s)]
*  We can walk into a shop. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3088.72s)]
*  They cannot. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3089.96s)]
*  That's true. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3090.96s)]
*  But fuck them. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3091.96s)]
*  I love them. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3092.96s)]
*  They eat kids, man. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3093.96s)]
*  They eat everything. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3094.96s)]
*  They should. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3095.96s)]
*  They've been here 500 million years. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3096.96s)]
*  Second only to the damn shark. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3101.16s)]

*  I love them. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3110.64s)]

*  This guy raised a baby alligator on his couch watching NFL games. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3118.04s)]

*  It hasn't bitten his dick yet. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3124.92s)]
*  They cuddle. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3126.92s)]

*  Is it really? [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3180.64s)]
*  The single oldest city. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3181.64s)]
*  Is that where like Cabeza de Vaca landed or something? [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3182.64s)]

*  Blue hue. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3214.6s)]
*  The albino was the wildest looking one. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3216.44s)]

*  I saw an albino elk a couple of years ago. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3228.4s)]
*  They're very rare, but it was a cow elk, female elk, and it was albino. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3232.7599999999998s)]
*  It was really wild to see. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3237.2799999999997s)]
*  It was like a ghost. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3239.08s)]
*  That's like a spirit animal. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3240.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3241.64s)]
*  It was really fascinating because I was hunting the males, so I wasn't interested in shooting [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3242.64s)]
*  her at all. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3248.08s)]

*  I was like, wow, look at that thing. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3250.08s)]
*  It's white. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3251.8399999999997s)]
*  Just a pure white elk. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3252.8799999999997s)]

*  And buffalo. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3259.6s)]
*  Oh, they get white buffalo? [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3260.6s)]
*  White buffalo, very sacred to the natives of Dakota. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3262.0s)]
*  Didn't Ted Nugent have a song about that? [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3264.6s)]
*  Ted Nugent might have a song about the white buffalo, great white buffalo. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3267.56s)]
*  Song about him getting trampled by the buffalo. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3271.2s)]

*  Buffalo. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3287.28s)]
*  Not necessarily the white, but just buffalo in general. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3288.28s)]
*  No, not necessarily the white. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3290.52s)]
*  I probably wouldn't shoot the white ones. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3291.52s)]
*  Nope. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3293.0s)]
*  It's too rare. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3294.0s)]
*  You're supposed to let it go. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3295.0s)]

*  You can't even, I mean, you know they're big, [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3371.88s)]
*  but until you actually see them in real life, [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3375.28s)]
*  like it doesn't sort of compute. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3377.92s)]
*  And strong. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3380.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3381.08s)]
*  And majestic, like intelligent, bizarre. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3382.2400000000002s)]
*  Beyond. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3385.92s)]
*  Mammals. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3386.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3387.76s)]
*  That live in the ocean. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3388.6s)]
*  For some reason don't have hands and can't build stuff. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3390.04s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3392.96s)]
*  Which is maybe a blessing for them. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3394.06s)]
*  And they talk. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3395.8s)]
*  And sing. Yeah. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3397.12s)]
*  And love. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3398.8s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3400.2400000000002s)]
*  I had a day of surfing with a mother and her calf. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3402.2400000000002s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3406.04s)]
*  Where I live in Malibu. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3406.88s)]
*  And it was a great wave day. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3408.52s)]
*  Just epically beautiful, clear, perfectly shaped waves. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3410.44s)]
*  But then we had a humpback and her kid on the sandbar [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3414.92s)]
*  cause they like to rub their bellies on the sandbar. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3419.44s)]
*  And she was kind of sitting right on the takeoff spot [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3422.6s)]
*  for surfing. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3425.1400000000003s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3425.98s)]
*  I was like, I don't really want to disturb mother and child, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3426.82s)]
*  but I do have to get that wave. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3429.88s)]
*  So I got as close as I could to the takeoff spot [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3432.2400000000002s)]
*  and they didn't care. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3435.2400000000002s)]
*  They were like, go for it. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3436.1600000000003s)]
*  You know, we're just, we're here, you're here. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3438.56s)]
*  Spent hours surfing with a whale in my company. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3440.36s)]
*  Wow. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3443.6400000000003s)]
*  My friend, Peter Atiyah, he's a doctor. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3446.0s)]
*  He told me that orcas, the sounds that they make [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3448.76s)]
*  and the sounds that their ability to detect sounds, [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3454.2400000000002s)]
*  like the frequency that they can project [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3459.04s)]
*  is similar to ultrasound. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3462.68s)]
*  Like, you know how they use ultrasound to detect an injury [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3465.24s)]
*  and they rub it. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3468.84s)]
*  They can see through you. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3469.68s)]
*  They can see through you. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3470.52s)]
*  Literally can see through you through the ocean. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3471.98s)]
*  He goes, it's mind boggling. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3474.72s)]
*  Like we don't even understand like what's going on in them. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3476.2799999999997s)]
*  And when you see like an orcas brain [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3478.52s)]
*  in comparison to a human brain, [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3481.32s)]
*  like they've done, and the dolphins as well. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3483.48s)]
*  Like dolphins, their cerebral cortex [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3486.8s)]
*  is like 40% larger than a human being. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3489.0800000000004s)]
*  So they have massive brains where dolphins can have one. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3490.96s)]
*  And an orca is basically a dolphin. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3494.88s)]
*  It's like the cousin of a dolphin. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3496.84s)]
*  Dolphin family, dolphin family, yeah. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3497.6800000000003s)]
*  They can, they shut one half of their brain down [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3499.0400000000004s)]
*  when they go to sleep. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3503.1600000000003s)]
*  Beautiful. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3504.0800000000004s)]
*  So one half is always awake to look out for danger [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3504.92s)]
*  and problems. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3508.6000000000004s)]
*  So that's how they sleep. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3510.0s)]
*  They don't sleep like us. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3510.98s)]
*  They sleep like one half shuts off. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3512.0s)]
*  Orcas, my guy. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3515.0400000000004s)]
*  They're amazing, man. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3516.88s)]
*  That's what's on my back. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3517.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3518.6800000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3519.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3520.96s)]
*  Only killed people in captivity. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3521.8s)]
*  As long as we're showing ink. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3524.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3526.04s)]
*  So that face in the middle is the Haida [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3527.1600000000003s)]
*  interpretation of the orca. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3531.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, they don't kill people. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3535.36s)]
*  Only in captivity. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3536.78s)]
*  Which is fair game. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3538.0s)]
*  Fuck yeah, it's fair game. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3539.32s)]
*  They're getting tortured. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3541.2000000000003s)]
*  Anybody who's seen blackfish [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3542.36s)]
*  or anybody who knows what's going on in marine land [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3544.12s)]
*  or the shit that's going on in Canada right now. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3547.52s)]
*  It's horrible, man. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3549.72s)]
*  It's horrible. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3550.96s)]
*  It's like, it's a form of torture to a sentient animal [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3551.92s)]
*  that might be as smart as us. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3556.92s)]
*  And one day we're gonna look back on the captivity [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3558.64s)]
*  of orcas and dolphins and we're gonna be horrified [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3561.7999999999997s)]
*  that people are so callous. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3565.7999999999997s)]
*  Or right now. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3567.04s)]
*  Or right now. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3567.88s)]
*  Pretty horrified right now. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3568.7s)]
*  Yeah, but I think there's too many people [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3569.54s)]
*  that still don't understand. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3571.16s)]
*  They still don't know. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3572.6s)]
*  And they'll still go to Sea World [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3573.44s)]
*  and watch them jump out of the water. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3575.16s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3577.6s)]
*  And they're very family. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3578.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3579.76s)]
*  They're all about their pod. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3580.6s)]
*  Right, which is why it's so sick [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3581.7200000000003s)]
*  that they take them from their pod [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3583.48s)]
*  and put them in a fucking swimming pool. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3584.92s)]
*  Yeah, we can do better than that. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3587.08s)]
*  Yeah, well, you know, we should observe them [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3588.88s)]
*  only in the wild. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3591.12s)]
*  That's what we should do. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3592.08s)]
*  I mean, they shouldn't allow those places. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3593.54s)]
*  They shouldn't exist. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3595.96s)]
*  If you wanna have a marine land or a Sea World, [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3597.12s)]
*  it should literally be like a place [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3600.36s)]
*  where you can go and they have a giant screen [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3602.96s)]
*  and you watch documentaries of these creatures [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3605.2s)]
*  so you could appreciate them. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3606.92s)]
*  And maybe you could donate [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3608.12s)]
*  to some sort of a conservation group [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3609.32s)]
*  and they put some of that money into it. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3610.8s)]
*  But to have them in captivity, fuck that. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3612.2400000000002s)]
*  There's no reason for that. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3615.6s)]
*  There's zero reason for that. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3617.12s)]
*  On my bucket list, which I don't really have, [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3620.16s)]
*  but if I did have a bucket list, [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3622.44s)]
*  hanging out in the wild with the orca, [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3624.7200000000003s)]
*  preferably surfing, which can be done, [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3627.92s)]
*  but also I would just swim out to one. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3630.32s)]
*  I feel it has to be done. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3633.12s)]
*  That's a fear that I wanna face. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3634.6s)]
*  Cause they could just. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3636.68s)]
*  If they wanted to, just swallow you. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3638.38s)]
*  Yeah, swallow. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3640.2400000000002s)]
*  But they won't cause they never have. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3641.64s)]
*  No, they don't. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3643.12s)]
*  Isn't that wild? [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3643.96s)]
*  That they've actually helped people. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3645.08s)]
*  There's people that have been drowning, [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3646.88s)]
*  people that have fallen off of boats [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3648.16s)]
*  and they've helped them. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3649.52s)]
*  They've actually rescued humans. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3650.6s)]
*  Like they're so smart, man. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3652.56s)]
*  They've just evolved in a way [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3655.28s)]
*  where they've never figured out [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3657.16s)]
*  how to manipulate their environment. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3658.54s)]
*  They don't have to. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3660.08s)]
*  They don't have to. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3660.92s)]
*  They maneuver through 3D space. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3661.76s)]
*  They use sound and they communicate [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3663.48s)]
*  in a way that we can't even decipher. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3667.0400000000004s)]
*  I mean think of all the code smashers. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3669.5200000000004s)]
*  All these people that have figured out [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3672.5200000000004s)]
*  these complex codes and they can decipher them. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3673.84s)]
*  They have no idea what those orcas are saying. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3676.7200000000003s)]
*  They know that they have dialects. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3679.28s)]
*  So they know they sound different [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3681.1600000000003s)]
*  in one part of the world [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3682.6000000000004s)]
*  than they do in other parts of the world. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3683.6400000000003s)]
*  But they don't know what the fuck they're saying. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3685.1200000000003s)]
*  They have no idea. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3686.7200000000003s)]
*  Half of it's song. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3687.6000000000004s)]
*  They just like singing. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3689.32s)]
*  I bet. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3690.84s)]
*  Have you ever heard of John Lilly? [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3692.5s)]
*  John Lilly's the man who developed [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3695.58s)]
*  the sensory deprivation tank. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3697.06s)]
*  And he's also a pioneer in interspecies communication. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3699.3799999999997s)]
*  And one of the things he was doing, [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3703.3799999999997s)]
*  he was a legitimate scientist. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3705.42s)]
*  One of the things he was doing was [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3707.46s)]
*  trying to decipher dolphin communication [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3709.8199999999997s)]
*  and trying to get dolphins to speak English. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3713.98s)]
*  And they, yeah he was a wild dude. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3717.54s)]
*  He would take acid and get it in a sensory deprivation tank [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3722.3s)]
*  right next to a tank filled with orcas. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3724.5s)]
*  And he would try to communicate with them [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3728.02s)]
*  while he was tripping. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3729.5s)]
*  And one of the things he did was [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3730.7400000000002s)]
*  he developed this research center [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3732.7s)]
*  where they had an orca that lived with a woman. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3735.02s)]
*  And she lived in this house that was filled with water [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3738.66s)]
*  so the orca could swim around. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3742.7400000000002s)]
*  So for her to get to her bed, [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3744.62s)]
*  she had to like, you know, the water was like, [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3746.66s)]
*  it wasn't an orca, excuse me, it was a dolphin. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3749.1s)]
*  And the water was like, you know, chest high. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3751.58s)]
*  So the dolphin would swim around in this house. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3753.62s)]
*  And then to get into the bed, [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3756.62s)]
*  she'd have to like climb out of the water and into the bed. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3757.82s)]
*  And the dolphin was a male dolphin [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3760.94s)]
*  and it would get distracted [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3763.18s)]
*  because it was so hypersexual. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3764.74s)]
*  So she would jerk off the dolphin. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3766.58s)]
*  And when they found out about it, [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3768.66s)]
*  they killed the research. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3770.42s)]
*  They should have upped the money. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3772.3s)]
*  They should have upped the money. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3773.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3774.78s)]
*  Hire someone to jerk them off more. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3776.1s)]
*  They're just as fricking sexual as we are. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3778.46s)]
*  Maybe even more so. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3780.5s)]
*  But the only way it would participate in these activities [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3781.7s)]
*  was if it got jerked off. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3785.5s)]
*  Hand job, hand job. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3786.58s)]
*  So they found out and they killed the science. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3787.58s)]
*  Yeah, they're humping everything. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3791.82s)]
*  Yeah, constantly. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3793.02s)]
*  So without knowing any of that story prior to right now, [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3794.66s)]
*  great story, in 1983, [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3798.42s)]
*  the sensory deprivation tank [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3802.1s)]
*  had become a little bit of a thing in Hollywood [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3804.18s)]
*  and you could go and rent a little time. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3806.7400000000002s)]
*  We have one here. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3809.86s)]
*  You have one here. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3811.46s)]
*  But this is early days. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3812.3s)]
*  This is John Lilly days. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3813.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3814.58s)]
*  And out of nowhere, [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3816.38s)]
*  I decided to give my best friend at the time, Tree, [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3817.54s)]
*  some LSD. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3821.86s)]
*  I said, let's take this LSD, [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3823.86s)]
*  go up to the apartment complex [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3825.94s)]
*  and we're gonna rent an hour in the tank, side by side. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3827.6600000000003s)]
*  And he was like, okay, let's do it. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3832.26s)]
*  So we took the LSD, [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3834.06s)]
*  we drove his car, we got in the tanks, [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3836.1800000000003s)]
*  I thought it was just gonna be, [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3840.26s)]
*  ooh, trippy dippy. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3841.86s)]
*  Forget it. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3843.46s)]
*  I was 10 billion miles away in outer space, [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3844.42s)]
*  an astral plane experience. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3849.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3852.6200000000003s)]
*  Completely conscious, but no body, [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3853.46s)]
*  just flying through the quiet vastness of space. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3856.46s)]
*  It was almost more than we could handle, [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3861.78s)]
*  but those things are real. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3864.6200000000003s)]
*  The elements combined. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3866.6200000000003s)]
*  I don't do LSD anymore, [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3868.1s)]
*  but as a young man, it made sense to me. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3869.98s)]
*  The combination of the two things [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3872.86s)]
*  is what's really phenomenal, [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3874.46s)]
*  because what Lilly, [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3875.58s)]
*  he invented the sensory deprivation tank [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3877.02s)]
*  because he was trying to figure out a way [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3879.42s)]
*  to separate the mind from any of the physical input [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3881.14s)]
*  of the body. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3885.02s)]
*  It works. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3885.86s)]
*  It does work. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3886.7000000000003s)]
*  Probably without LSD. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3887.52s)]
*  Oh, it definitely does. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3888.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3889.34s)]
*  Without LSD. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3890.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's one of the best ways [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3891.0s)]
*  to achieve a psychedelic state without any drugs. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3892.54s)]
*  And also you can end it at any time. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3895.86s)]
*  Just open the door. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3897.38s)]
*  The door. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3898.2200000000003s)]
*  It's not like you have to come down from it. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3899.62s)]
*  Just goes away. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3901.62s)]
*  I had to come down on that day. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3902.46s)]
*  Oh yeah? [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3903.54s)]
*  I bet. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3904.38s)]
*  I had to get home. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3905.2s)]
*  I bet you did. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3906.04s)]
*  How'd you get home? [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3906.88s)]
*  It was tough. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3907.7s)]
*  It was tough. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3908.54s)]
*  The roads were disappearing under the car. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3909.38s)]
*  You have a tank here in the office? [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3911.18s)]
*  It's in the gym. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3913.72s)]
*  Okay. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3914.66s)]
*  Yeah, it's right next door. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3915.5s)]
*  I'll show it to you. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3916.32s)]
*  Okay. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3917.16s)]
*  It's awesome. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3918.0s)]
*  It's from Los Angeles. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3918.82s)]
*  There's a place called the Float Lab. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3919.66s)]
*  It's in Venice. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3921.06s)]
*  It's the premier float destination on earth. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3921.88s)]
*  My friend Crash runs it. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3924.46s)]
*  It's incredible. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3925.74s)]
*  Crash is a mad scientist. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3927.76s)]
*  And he's developed a sensory deprivation tank [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3929.76s)]
*  that's super advanced with ozone filtration. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3932.2000000000003s)]
*  He gets these systems that are from commercial water [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3938.76s)]
*  filtration for people's drinking water and shit. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3942.32s)]
*  And he has this whole process of, [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3945.7200000000003s)]
*  and then it's a giant tank too. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3948.76s)]
*  It's like a meat freezer. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3950.8s)]
*  Size of this room? [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3952.6s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3953.44s)]
*  Like from this, from this back to there. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3954.32s)]
*  But it's like nice and wide. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3957.8s)]
*  We could reach about, [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3960.2000000000003s)]
*  you touch this side and touch that side. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3961.0400000000004s)]
*  So you sort of sent to yourself. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3962.8s)]
*  How about just floating on water? [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3963.96s)]
*  Yeah. Pretty good. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3965.5600000000004s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3966.98s)]
*  And there's a thousand pounds of Epsom salts in there. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3967.84s)]
*  So it's, you're very buoyant. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3970.1800000000003s)]
*  You just like- Body temp? [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3971.6800000000003s)]
*  Body temp. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3972.88s)]
*  You don't feel it. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3973.7200000000003s)]
*  95 degrees, you don't feel it. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3974.5600000000004s)]
*  It's incredible. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3975.38s)]
*  Dark. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3976.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Pitch black. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3977.0600000000004s)]
*  Yep. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3977.88s)]
*  Yeah. And you just, you just blended in nothingness. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3978.7200000000003s)]
*  And when the mind is detached [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3981.2s)]
*  from the physical sensations of the body, [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3984.48s)]
*  your brain becomes supercharged. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3986.9199999999996s)]
*  And the way I always describe it as like, [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3988.52s)]
*  if we were having this conversation, [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3990.14s)]
*  there was someone next to us with a jackhammer, [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3991.48s)]
*  it'd be super distracting. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3993.24s)]
*  It'd be like, let's get over there so we can talk. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3994.48s)]
*  We can't hear. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3996.24s)]
*  But everything is input. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=3997.46s)]
*  The sensory input of your butt touching this chair, right? [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4000.04s)]
*  Your hands touching this desk, the ear, [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4003.3599999999997s)]
*  the earphones on, the microphone in front of your face, [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4006.3199999999997s)]
*  the physical space, the you and I exchanging social cues [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4009.26s)]
*  and communicating with sound. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4012.3s)]
*  Like all that stuff is input. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4013.9s)]
*  Well, in the sensory deprivation tank, there's none. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4016.34s)]
*  Zero. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4019.26s)]
*  And then with the water being the same temperature [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4020.36s)]
*  as your skin, it feels like you're flying. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4022.6200000000003s)]
*  That was my experience. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4025.42s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4026.5s)]
*  On acid, it must be insane. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4027.78s)]
*  I've never done it on acid. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4029.78s)]
*  I think it just, you know, [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4030.94s)]
*  exacerbated the whole aspect of what you're talking about, [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4032.0200000000004s)]
*  where there's no body. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4035.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4037.0800000000004s)]
*  Your brain is free to go wherever it likes. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4037.92s)]
*  I loved it. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4041.52s)]
*  To me, it was pretty monumental. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4042.36s)]
*  I don't think I would repeat it under those circumstances. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4044.0s)]
*  But I'm happy I did. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4047.52s)]
*  Well, if you did, you'd want more time. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4048.36s)]
*  One hour is like, beem, time's up, Anthony. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4050.02s)]
*  Time was up. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4052.2400000000002s)]
*  Time was up. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4053.28s)]
*  What do you mean time's up? [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4054.12s)]
*  I'm on Jupiter. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4055.2400000000002s)]
*  But now for me, I get an even better feeling in the ocean. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4056.56s)]
*  The ocean is so full of life and peace and nature [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4062.34s)]
*  and excitement. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4065.6800000000003s)]
*  That's my tank these days. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4068.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you were telling me about your love [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4070.6s)]
*  of surfing the other day. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4071.92s)]
*  You love it, huh? [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4073.54s)]
*  I do because it gives me that feeling, [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4075.12s)]
*  that freedom in the, there's an energy. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4078.56s)]
*  I'm late to the game, late to the party, [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4081.98s)]
*  late as you can be. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4083.96s)]
*  Started in my 40s, tried a handful of times before that, [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4085.16s)]
*  made no sense. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4089.2000000000003s)]
*  And then when I finally found it, [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4090.64s)]
*  through Takuji Masuda, my teacher, my Japanese teacher, [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4093.3s)]
*  that's what I wanna do till the day I die. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4098.8s)]
*  Go sit out there waiting for a wave. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4101.2s)]
*  If you think about the storms, [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4105.84s)]
*  3,000 miles away raging in the ocean, [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4108.0s)]
*  sending that wave of energy through the water. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4110.4400000000005s)]
*  When it finally releases, when it hits the shallows, [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4114.0s)]
*  it's a rush, it's a drug, it's a high, [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4118.16s)]
*  it's a natural high where you're next to whales and dolphins [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4121.34s)]
*  and pelicans and eels and anemones [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4125.72s)]
*  and just looking back at the coast [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4128.6s)]
*  with a different point of view, [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4131.56s)]
*  no phone, no technology whatsoever, just water and a board. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4133.2s)]
*  And that water's charged too. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4139.0s)]
*  It's like there's life in that water. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4140.88s)]
*  That water's not just water. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4142.4800000000005s)]
*  That water's like a giant living superorganism. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4144.240000000001s)]
*  Superorganism. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4147.14s)]
*  Sustains life. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4148.400000000001s)]
*  Ions and minerals. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4149.88s)]
*  Yeah, there's energy to it. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4150.88s)]
*  A lot of my Jiu-Jitsu friends love surfing [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4154.08s)]
*  because a lot of Brazilians surf. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4156.76s)]
*  I see them out there. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4158.6s)]
*  Yeah, and a lot of them come from Rio [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4159.52s)]
*  and a lot of surfers in Rio [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4163.08s)]
*  and they come over to America so they surf in America. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4164.280000000001s)]
*  All over the world, you see them in the water. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4166.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, they love it. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4169.200000000001s)]
*  And it's also, it's a great exercise for Jiu-Jitsu too [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4170.360000000001s)]
*  because it's so balance-based. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4172.64s)]
*  There's so much going on. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4174.08s)]
*  It's also a flow exercise. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4175.6s)]
*  Jiu-Jitsu's very much about flowing. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4178.360000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4180.84s)]
*  Scrambling. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4182.52s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4184.02s)]
*  You gotta scramble with the wave. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4184.860000000001s)]
*  You don't know what it's gonna give you. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4186.26s)]
*  One wave jacks up more than another. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4187.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4189.74s)]
*  Have you ever done one of those wave pools? [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4190.58s)]
*  Those crazy places that they develop? [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4192.66s)]
*  There's one out here in Waco. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4194.9400000000005s)]
*  Develops waves and apparently it's a great way to learn [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4196.82s)]
*  because you get to ride a lot of different waves. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4200.42s)]
*  It's not an organism. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4204.18s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4205.34s)]
*  But it's a way to get used to surfing itself. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4206.54s)]
*  If you wanna train and really work on your technique [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4209.26s)]
*  and get better rather than have this experience with nature, [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4214.7s)]
*  it's definitely the place to go. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4219.24s)]
*  And also if you live in Texas. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4220.860000000001s)]
*  Mm, right. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4222.54s)]
*  So people that are competitive and in the leagues [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4224.18s)]
*  and wanna go to the Olympics, [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4227.02s)]
*  it's the greatest invention ever [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4228.3s)]
*  because you can just work on turns, specific turns. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4229.9800000000005s)]
*  I don't care about any of that. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4233.66s)]
*  I just wanna go paddle out into the unknown. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4234.9800000000005s)]
*  I get it. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4238.02s)]
*  But I see the value and they're popping up everywhere. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4239.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they're everywhere, right? [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4243.82s)]
*  There was one that just got shot down in Palm Springs. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4245.82s)]
*  Shot down. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4248.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah, unfortunately. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4249.179999999999s)]
*  There's a concern that it's gonna bring [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4251.42s)]
*  a bunch of fucking crazy hippies in their VW buses [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4254.38s)]
*  playing their loud rock and roll. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4257.219999999999s)]
*  I don't know why they shot it down. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4259.86s)]
*  I mean, I think they might've shot it down also [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4261.42s)]
*  because of concern that it uses a lot of water. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4263.179999999999s)]
*  Water, yeah. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4265.339999999999s)]
*  Can't they just get that water from the ocean? [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4267.02s)]
*  You would think it's not that far from the Sea of Cortez. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4269.660000000001s)]
*  There's plenty of water out there. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4273.38s)]
*  They gotta just get the salt out of the water. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4275.14s)]
*  They do. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4277.1s)]
*  That's the problem. They do. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4277.9400000000005s)]
*  The problem's not the lack of water, it's salt. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4278.780000000001s)]
*  Well, there are lots of people working on that. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4281.26s)]
*  Yeah, they should. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4285.860000000001s)]
*  That would fix California like that. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4287.06s)]
*  It's expensive right now. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4289.700000000001s)]
*  Fuck yeah, it's expensive. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4290.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but why? [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4292.38s)]
*  Why haven't you guys, nuclear powered desalination plants? [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4293.86s)]
*  You're welcome. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4298.219999999999s)]
*  Fix it. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4299.179999999999s)]
*  Fix it. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4300.38s)]
*  California should look like a fucking jungle. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4301.219999999999s)]
*  It should be beautiful and green and lush. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4303.38s)]
*  All that fucking sun, all that sun. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4306.62s)]
*  If you're constantly spraying water over everything, [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4309.62s)]
*  it would be amazing. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4312.0199999999995s)]
*  We have some lush. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4312.86s)]
*  We have some lush. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4315.0199999999995s)]
*  I just, Hoopa Valley, lush. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4315.86s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4318.74s)]

*  Well, that's the thing about California, right? [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4330.78s)]
*  There's so many different ecosystems that are all combined. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4332.219999999999s)]

*  There's so much mountains right there. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4340.46s)]
*  Mountains, see the whole deal. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4342.78s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4344.66s)]
*  It is. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4345.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's an amazing state. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4346.42s)]
*  I can't pull myself away. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4347.7s)]
*  I get it. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4349.139999999999s)]
*  I get it. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4350.139999999999s)]
*  If I was gonna live somewhere, [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4350.98s)]
*  I'd live where you live though. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4351.9s)]
*  I have a spare lot. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4353.9s)]
*  I do. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4355.74s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4363.179999999999s)]
*  I would live in Malibu. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4364.0199999999995s)]
*  If I was gonna live anywhere in California, [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4364.98s)]
*  I think Malibu's got a great vibe. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4366.62s)]
*  There's also a thing about being next to the ocean [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4369.339999999999s)]
*  that's very humbling. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4371.459999999999s)]
*  I think it's very good for people to be just confronted [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4372.9s)]
*  by inescapable beauty and power of nature. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4377.74s)]
*  And that's what oceans do. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4381.58s)]
*  I need that. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4383.5s)]
*  I need to be humbled daily. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4384.46s)]
*  It's good for everybody. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4385.82s)]
*  The mountains do the same thing. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4387.0199999999995s)]
*  They do. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4388.42s)]
*  100%. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4389.42s)]
*  You know what the root of that word is? [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4390.94s)]
*  Which word, humble? [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4394.099999999999s)]
*  Humble. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4394.94s)]
*  To be close to the ground, to be low to the ground. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4395.9s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4398.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4399.42s)]
*  That makes sense. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4400.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4401.219999999999s)]
*  Feels right. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4402.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4402.88s)]
*  Yeah, humble, like people look at that as like a negative. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4403.719999999999s)]
*  Like, that's so good. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4406.22s)]
*  So positive. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4407.18s)]
*  You should be humble, man. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4409.1s)]
*  You're in space. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4410.3s)]
*  I go to the Big Island. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4412.860000000001s)]
*  I try to go like once every few years. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4416.3s)]
*  But whenever I do go, we go to the Keck Observatory. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4419.06s)]
*  I don't know if you've ever been up there. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4421.46s)]
*  Mauna Kea or whatever it is. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4423.14s)]
*  I think that's it. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4424.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4425.38s)]
*  The big mountain. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4425.88s)]
*  Mauna Loa, maybe? [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4426.62s)]
*  Mauna Kea? [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4427.5s)]
*  Whatever the mountain is that's up there, [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4428.54s)]
*  there's an observatory that you get to. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4430.5s)]
*  It's like many thousand feet above sea level. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4432.14s)]
*  And if you can time it right, if you could visit during no [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4434.34s)]
*  moon, when the moon's not out, it's fucking spectacular. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4437.74s)]
*  You're in space. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4442.7s)]
*  You literally are on a spaceship with a glass dome over you. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4444.46s)]
*  That's what it looks like. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4448.02s)]
*  You have an unhindered view of the cosmos [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4449.66s)]
*  that I've never experienced before. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4454.74s)]
*  I mean, I've been in the country when [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4456.26s)]
*  it's a beautiful dark night and you get to see all the stars [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4458.3s)]
*  and it looks amazing. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4461.7s)]
*  But up there, you're through the clouds. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4463.02s)]
*  I think you're like 11,000 feet above sea level. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4465.42s)]
*  I think it's 13. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4469.06s)]
*  Super high up there. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4469.820000000001s)]
*  That's what it looks like. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4470.820000000001s)]
*  But that's literally what it looks like, man. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4471.820000000001s)]
*  That's not an exaggeration. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4474.1s)]
*  That's not a fake image. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4476.3s)]
*  It's so incredible that I remember going there once, [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4477.780000000001s)]
*  changed the way I feel about our relationship to space forever. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4481.700000000001s)]
*  And I also got so upset thinking, how fucked is it [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4487.1s)]
*  that that's not available to us just because we're [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4490.9s)]
*  so weird with light? [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4494.0199999999995s)]
*  We want everything lit up at night. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4495.58s)]
*  We want the cities lit up and they [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4497.9s)]
*  want everything to be lit up. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4499.58s)]
*  And when you get that light pollution, [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4501.42s)]
*  you miss the majesty of the cosmos, which is what I think [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4503.339999999999s)]
*  humbled our ancestors. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4507.74s)]
*  I think all of our ancestors were completely [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4510.0599999999995s)]
*  connected to the cosmos. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4512.379999999999s)]
*  If you look at the Mayans, the Mayans, [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4513.54s)]
*  they designed all of their structures and their cities [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4517.02s)]
*  to represent the cosmos, to represent constellations. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4522.14s)]
*  And so did the Egyptians. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4525.780000000001s)]
*  They were connected to the cosmos. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4527.02s)]
*  Yes, it was inescapable. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4528.42s)]
*  They also didn't have television, radio, film, [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4529.9400000000005s)]
*  computers. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4534.820000000001s)]
*  So you had to deal with the elements, which [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4536.34s)]
*  is what made a lot of those people so smart. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4539.26s)]
*  Because from sun up to sun down, you're [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4542.38s)]
*  working on your connection. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4544.86s)]
*  Da Vinci, no distractions. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4547.139999999999s)]
*  None, just art. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4549.179999999999s)]
*  Just art and invention and philosophy [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4551.139999999999s)]
*  and all day, every day. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4554.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4556.46s)]
*  There's something about that view of the cosmos [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4558.099999999999s)]
*  that I really wish more people would get. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4560.38s)]
*  I'm going to go check it out. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4562.339999999999s)]
*  I have never been up there. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4563.5s)]
*  I've ridden my motorcycle all around that island many times, [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4564.66s)]
*  but I've never ridden up to the top of that mountain. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4568.259999999999s)]
*  It's wild. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4570.42s)]
*  You got to go up there when, like, [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4571.179999999999s)]
*  find out when the next dark night is. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4573.18s)]
*  Like, what do they call it? [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4575.9800000000005s)]
*  Was it a dark? [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4577.22s)]
*  What is it called? [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4577.900000000001s)]
*  It's like no moon at all? [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4578.780000000001s)]
*  New moon? [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4580.820000000001s)]
*  New moon. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4581.42s)]
*  Obviously, you could look at it on a calendar. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4585.780000000001s)]
*  But if you get up there during that time, [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4587.66s)]
*  it's pretty fucking amazing. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4589.34s)]
*  I mean, it really blew me away. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4591.54s)]
*  My oldest daughter was, I think she was like 9 or 10 [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4593.66s)]
*  at the time. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4597.820000000001s)]
*  I think she was too young to appreciate it. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4599.02s)]
*  But when we were up there the last time, [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4601.1s)]
*  we were just standing there staring at it. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4603.740000000001s)]
*  I remember thinking, I'm never going to forget this. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4606.860000000001s)]
*  I'm never going to forget what this feels like. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4609.740000000001s)]
*  It just, it's just, I was like, oh, we're in space. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4612.18s)]
*  I don't think she'll forget it either. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4617.580000000001s)]
*  Hope not. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4619.46s)]
*  I don't think she will. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4620.14s)]
*  I think at that age, you're still impressionable. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4621.900000000001s)]
*  I think so. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4626.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4626.740000000001s)]
*  Shit, I'm impressionable now and I'm 55. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4627.38s)]
*  But you might have gone through a patch where [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4629.94s)]
*  you were less impressionable. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4632.0199999999995s)]
*  Hopefully. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4633.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah, my teenage son is like, what? [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4634.299999999999s)]
*  Cosmos. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4638.0199999999995s)]
*  Fuck out of here, bitch. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4639.5s)]
*  I'm on TikTok. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4640.419999999999s)]

*  What are you talking about? [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4641.7s)]
*  Well, teenage boys in particular, [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4644.98s)]
*  they're feeling their oats and their testosterone [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4647.139999999999s)]
*  flowing through their system. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4650.379999999999s)]
*  Rebels. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4651.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4652.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4652.7s)]
*  Well, you need that. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4653.0599999999995s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4654.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's a push and a pull. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4656.179999999999s)]
*  Does he have a physical outlet to express his physical energy? [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4659.1s)]
*  Not enough. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4666.06s)]
*  I wish he had more. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4667.54s)]
*  He is a baller. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4668.780000000001s)]

*  Well, that's good. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4671.620000000001s)]
*  Basketball is a great way. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4672.58s)]
*  It is. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4673.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4674.26s)]
*  I beg him to go surfing, but it's my thing in his mind. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4674.9800000000005s)]
*  That's your thing, dad. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4680.1s)]
*  Oh, he doesn't want to fuck with your thing. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4682.22s)]
*  Doesn't want to fuck with my thing. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4683.860000000001s)]
*  He's got to be a rebel. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4685.18s)]
*  He does paddle out. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4686.18s)]
*  His eyes light up. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4689.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4691.02s)]
*  And he's a natural. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4691.5s)]
*  He's a big, strong boy. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4693.54s)]
*  So I'll just let him find it. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4695.700000000001s)]
*  Get him into jujitsu. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4697.700000000001s)]
*  He was in jujitsu as a child, as a little boy. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4699.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I had good teachers coming over, and he was willing. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4702.820000000001s)]
*  Not anymore. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4707.860000000001s)]
*  One thing about California, there's a lot of jujitsu out there. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4708.5s)]
*  Good teachers. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4712.06s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4712.62s)]
*  I could steer you in the right place. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4713.66s)]
*  Let me know. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4715.06s)]
*  Could you? [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4715.54s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4716.1s)]
*  You know something about that? [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4716.780000000001s)]
*  I know a lot of my good friends out there teach. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4718.02s)]
*  I tried it three times in my life. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4721.42s)]
*  Yeah? [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4723.14s)]
*  It hurt. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4725.26s)]
*  It freaking hurt. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4727.54s)]
*  It's designed to hurt. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4729.1s)]
*  It hurt. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4730.46s)]
*  I liked it, but I was so competitive that I got home, [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4732.620000000001s)]
*  and I realized there was no skin on my feet from the mats. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4737.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4741.14s)]
*  I had no technique, so I'm just trying to muscle it, dig in. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4741.900000000001s)]
*  I did all right. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4745.98s)]
*  I fought some guys. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4748.0599999999995s)]
*  It was fun. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4748.9s)]
*  Hurt. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4750.219999999999s)]
*  The key to learning jujitsu is to learn how to play. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4751.099999999999s)]
*  The Gracys, they always have this phrase, [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4755.419999999999s)]
*  Hannah Gracie and Huron Gracie, they say, keep it playful. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4758.62s)]
*  And it's great advice. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4761.9s)]
*  If you could really follow that advice, that's how you learn. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4764.0199999999995s)]
*  Because you learn how to not muscle things. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4767.259999999999s)]
*  You learn how to only use technique and to have fun. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4769.9s)]
*  And just don't be crazy competitive. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4772.66s)]
*  Know that you're going to get tapped out. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4775.62s)]
*  Know that you're going to tap other people. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4777.0599999999995s)]
*  It's going to be fine. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4778.82s)]
*  But if you just always try to win every time, [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4780.0199999999995s)]
*  you're not going to learn. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4782.22s)]
*  You're going to be too tense. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4783.18s)]
*  You're going to be too, you're not [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4784.58s)]
*  going to open yourself up. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4786.0599999999995s)]
*  So you're not going to take chances, [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4787.46s)]
*  or you're not going to learn as much. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4788.86s)]
*  It'll hinder you. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4790.7s)]
*  You think you're doing good because you're not getting tapped, [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4791.74s)]
*  but really you're doing bad because you're not [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4794.46s)]
*  learning enough. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4796.78s)]
*  That was my experience. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4798.0599999999995s)]
*  It's normal. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4799.54s)]
*  Most men do. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4800.42s)]
*  I mean, it's interesting when you [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4801.74s)]
*  see guys do it for the first few times. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4803.62s)]
*  You see the tension in them. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4806.0199999999995s)]
*  They can't breathe. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4807.94s)]
*  They're so fucking tense. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4808.9s)]
*  And they get tired so quick. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4809.98s)]
*  Got to play. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4811.38s)]
*  Yeah, you got to keep it playful. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4812.22s)]
*  Relax. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4813.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4814.66s)]
*  I love watching it. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4815.78s)]
*  I love the art. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4816.86s)]
*  I love the chess match of all that. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4818.3s)]
*  Fascinating. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4822.18s)]
*  Can't get enough of it. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4823.7s)]
*  What do you do physically other than surf? [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4825.0199999999995s)]
*  You're in really good shape. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4827.42s)]
*  Um, very, I mean, not to be a jerk, but very little. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4829.34s)]
*  Very, very little. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4833.98s)]
*  You just have great jeans? [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4834.86s)]
*  No, I am a performer for a living. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4836.02s)]
*  So that's two hours of good exercise. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4840.18s)]
*  That's a lot of aerobics. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4841.82s)]
*  I like the bicycle very much. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4843.42s)]
*  I get on a bike almost every day just [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4845.54s)]
*  to go ride next to the ocean and be humbled. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4847.1s)]
*  And surf is super limited because we [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4851.46s)]
*  don't always have waves. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4853.22s)]
*  And if it's a show day or a rehearsal day, [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4856.18s)]
*  I can't go surf. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4858.42s)]
*  Being a dad, wrestling my son a bit, that kind of thing. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4861.82s)]
*  But I don't have a discipline that I go to. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4865.9400000000005s)]
*  Just engaging life physically, always, since I was a kid. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4871.06s)]
*  But I don't really have a routine. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4876.9400000000005s)]
*  I don't have a beach workout or a weight thing or any of that. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4878.3s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4882.18s)]
*  I like some push-ups here and there. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4883.02s)]
*  A lot. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4886.1s)]
*  I like the isometrics when I can get into that. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4887.1s)]
*  But by the way, if you surf, if you [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4890.7s)]
*  do go to Hawaii for a month and surf every day, [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4892.9400000000005s)]
*  you're the strongest you've ever been in your life. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4896.5s)]
*  Kayaking. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4899.820000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4901.3s)]
*  Haven't done it for a while, but. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4902.54s)]
*  Kayaking's hard. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4904.780000000001s)]
*  It's great on the shoulders. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4905.58s)]
*  It's so good. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4906.66s)]
*  You get strong. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4907.46s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4908.62s)]
*  It's also just your core, your balance. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4910.5s)]
*  And then like you're saying, getting in tone. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4914.58s)]
*  You're connected to Mother Earth in an undeniable way. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4917.74s)]
*  You're a part of the ocean. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4925.74s)]
*  You're floating around. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4927.02s)]
*  Instantly. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4928.06s)]
*  From the minute the board hits the water, [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4928.86s)]
*  you're in another world. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4931.34s)]
*  Ever have any shark encounters? [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4932.3s)]
*  I wish. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4934.14s)]
*  Really? [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4935.06s)]
*  Well, I mean, not a bad one. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4935.58s)]
*  Not a bad one. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4938.94s)]
*  I've never seen a shark in all my days of surfing. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4939.78s)]
*  Have you ever seen the drone footage [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4943.34s)]
*  when they fly drones over Malibu? [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4944.94s)]
*  You see how many sharks are out there? [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4946.62s)]
*  Thank goodness. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4947.78s)]
*  If they're not there, we're screwed. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4948.82s)]
*  It's true. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4950.62s)]
*  Yeah, they're important. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4951.54s)]
*  The more I see, the better. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4952.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4953.74s)]
*  Of course, you have a little shark phobia. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4956.86s)]
*  It's like an internal thing. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4959.139999999999s)]
*  We're born with it. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4961.34s)]
*  These are strong animals. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4962.38s)]
*  But we're not on the menu. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4964.86s)]
*  We've never been on the menu. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4967.0199999999995s)]
*  They have a very specific understanding [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4968.5s)]
*  of what they want to do with their lives, and it's not us. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4971.26s)]
*  When it is us, I believe it's a mistake. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4975.22s)]
*  It's like a puppy going, who's this guy? [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4977.14s)]
*  They bite. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4979.9s)]
*  I think they think we're seals, right? [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4980.62s)]
*  They don't. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4982.7s)]
*  No, when they make a mistake. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4983.46s)]
*  When they make a mistake. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4984.82s)]
*  Yeah, we could. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4986.06s)]
*  But that's a big mistake. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4987.94s)]
*  But if you look at the numbers of sharks [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4989.22s)]
*  that kill people versus sharks that get killed by people, [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4991.7s)]
*  the number of sharks that get killed by people [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4995.9s)]
*  is something crazy. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4997.94s)]
*  I think it's like 70 million a year. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=4999.9s)]
*  Something really nuts. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5002.9s)]
*  And they kill about five of us if we're lucky. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5003.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's like five or six on a bad year. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5006.58s)]
*  What is it? [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5009.299999999999s)]
*  Let's find it out. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5010.179999999999s)]
*  Google it. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5011.82s)]
*  Oh, you got it already? [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5012.7s)]
*  Oh, 100 million sharks. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5014.099999999999s)]
*  Holy shit. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5016.0199999999995s)]
*  We're killing ourselves when we kill them. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5017.139999999999s)]
*  100 million. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5019.139999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5020.74s)]
*  They are the great balance keepers of the sea. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5021.86s)]
*  Sharks fin soup is what it is. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5025.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, not happening. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5026.66s)]
*  Wow, the fishing industry. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5027.98s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5030.0199999999995s)]
*  Out of control. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5031.22s)]
*  Now, how many people get killed by sharks every year? [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5032.18s)]
*  I say, I think it's, I don't think it's more than like 60 [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5036.0599999999995s)]
*  or 70. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5039.5s)]
*  A year? [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5040.66s)]
*  Killed way less. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5041.26s)]
*  In the world. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5042.099999999999s)]
*  Way less. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5043.0199999999995s)]
*  Really? [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5043.62s)]
*  Way less. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5044.0199999999995s)]
*  Is it? [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5044.38s)]
*  Give us the numbers, please. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5045.5s)]
*  Let's take a guess. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5046.7s)]
*  What do you think it is? [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5047.74s)]
*  Less than 10. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5049.22s)]
*  Less than 10. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5049.98s)]
*  Killed. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5050.74s)]
*  Wow. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5051.46s)]
*  Bit? [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5051.94s)]
*  70. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5053.22s)]
*  Killed. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5054.22s)]
*  OK, OK. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5054.74s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5055.34s)]
*  There's always little, they're puppies. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5057.1s)]
*  They want to see what you are. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5058.34s)]
*  I just saw this number recently. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5059.38s)]
*  That's why now it's like five. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5060.66s)]
*  Five? [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5063.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5063.7s)]
*  Six to eight, it says. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5064.18s)]
*  So that could be. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5065.02s)]
*  Whoa, six to eight a year. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5065.82s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5067.26s)]
*  It could be the animal that kills [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5067.82s)]
*  the least amount of people. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5069.58s)]
*  For every 100 million sharks killed per year, [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5071.7s)]
*  about six to eight humans are killed by sharks. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5073.86s)]
*  Wow. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5076.1s)]
*  This is why I support Paul Watson. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5077.14s)]
*  How many people get bit every year? [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5079.58s)]
*  Here you go, 73 shark bites. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5081.900000000001s)]

*  It's people running up to Buffalo going, woo. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5107.94s)]
*  Why? [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5110.98s)]
*  And then they get launched through the air. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5111.62s)]
*  That's 3,000 pounds of launch muscle. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5114.06s)]
*  Fuck that. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5117.5s)]
*  But some people just have zero respect for what nature is. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5119.26s)]
*  They just, for some reason, they think [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5123.5s)]
*  they live in a movie or they're immune to the natural laws. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5125.38s)]

*  They were only like 40 or 50 yards away. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5139.9400000000005s)]
*  And when I saw them, all these people [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5142.1s)]
*  got their cameras out. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5143.66s)]
*  They were like closing in. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5145.0199999999995s)]
*  And here it goes. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5146.58s)]
*  OK, this is elk. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5147.94s)]
*  Is this the launch? [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5148.98s)]
*  It's going to chase this guy down in just a second. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5151.099999999999s)]
*  This is going to get fucked up. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5153.3s)]
*  Well, you don't ever want to fuck with an elk. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5153.86s)]
*  Why would you? [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5156.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5156.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5157.5s)]
*  Oh, you got off easy. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5158.3s)]
*  Get out of here, bitch. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5159.3s)]
*  That was a love tap. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5160.099999999999s)]
*  That's a big ass elk, too. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5161.58s)]
*  What was I going to say? [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5165.5s)]
*  The bison that lived there, they're in these like packs. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5167.78s)]
*  And these people were taking photos of them. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5172.22s)]
*  And I was with my kids. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5175.02s)]
*  And my kids, they were young at the time. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5176.9800000000005s)]
*  And they were like, we want to see the buffalo. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5179.02s)]
*  We want to see the buffalo. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5180.740000000001s)]
*  And we got close. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5181.3s)]
*  And I'm like, OK, let me get in front of you here. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5181.820000000001s)]
*  Let me get in front. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5184.42s)]
*  And I'm just thinking, OK, I'm just [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5185.58s)]
*  going to grab the two of them, like two fucking footballs, [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5188.1s)]
*  and run behind a car if some shit goes down. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5190.62s)]
*  Because at any moment now, you're only 50 yards away, [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5193.14s)]
*  the buffalo could just get pissed off and go, [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5196.58s)]
*  why the fuck are you taking my picture? [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5198.66s)]
*  And just take a wild run at them, [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5201.1s)]
*  especially if they're breeding, especially [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5203.1s)]
*  if they're in the rut. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5204.860000000001s)]
*  The one thing those people have going for them [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5206.780000000001s)]
*  is that the bison doesn't really want to waste [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5209.5s)]
*  its time crushing you. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5212.38s)]
*  Yes. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5214.02s)]
*  It'll give you a warning. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5214.54s)]
*  It might give you a smash. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5215.660000000001s)]
*  That's true. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5217.860000000001s)]
*  But they want to go back to doing what they were doing. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5218.46s)]
*  They're also super used to being around people, [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5221.700000000001s)]
*  because people are around there all the time. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5224.780000000001s)]
*  I'm going to go toward the grizzly bear now. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5228.26s)]
*  You're going to go towards them? [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5231.9800000000005s)]
*  In the conversation. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5233.26s)]
*  Oh. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5234.26s)]
*  Just for a moment. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5234.9400000000005s)]
*  OK. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5235.740000000001s)]
*  I've heard a couple of your comments about the grizzly. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5237.02s)]
*  And I just want to share my little experiences. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5241.42s)]
*  I went kayaking in Alaska. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5245.06s)]
*  It was a fantastic fjordal. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5247.54s)]
*  This is some years ago. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5249.860000000001s)]
*  Flea was part of the party. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5251.3s)]
*  So this is like a glacier river? [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5253.5s)]
*  It's a river that goes between glaciers. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5255.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5258.5s)]
*  Stunning. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5259.22s)]
*  And three grizzly bear encounters, all of which [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5261.86s)]
*  were lovely and mellow and harmless. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5267.86s)]
*  Well, you know why, though? [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5272.62s)]
*  You're near a food source. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5274.38s)]
*  You're near salmon. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5276.26s)]
*  Salmon. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5277.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5277.66s)]
*  And blueberries. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5277.900000000001s)]
*  By the way, they eat blueberries all day. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5278.58s)]
*  All day. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5280.54s)]
*  Their poop is blue. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5281.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5282.34s)]
*  Isn't that wild? [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5282.84s)]
*  With bones coming out of it. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5283.34s)]
*  Salmon bones. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5284.46s)]
*  One time, I got ahead of the pack. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5286.82s)]
*  I stopped at a little beach. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5288.9800000000005s)]
*  It had a berm above my head, maybe 10 feet up. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5290.38s)]
*  When the pack caught up with me, the kayakers in the water, [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5293.74s)]
*  they're waving and hollering. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5297.3s)]
*  I'm like, it's beautiful. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5298.74s)]
*  Isn't this beautiful? [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5300.1s)]
*  We're out here in the wild. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5301.22s)]
*  There was a grizzly 10 feet above my head [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5302.66s)]
*  looking down at me as I'm just parked on the beach. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5304.74s)]
*  No problem. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5309.3s)]
*  No beef. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5310.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5311.42s)]
*  Second time was a mother feeding her cubs mollusks and oysters [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5312.22s)]
*  or whatever she could get. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5318.3s)]
*  And a hiker said, there's a mama grizzly with her cubs [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5320.46s)]
*  eating around the corner. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5323.780000000001s)]
*  I was like, I got to go see. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5325.58s)]
*  I cannot help myself. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5327.740000000001s)]
*  Really? [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5328.820000000001s)]
*  I must go look at this beautiful animal. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5329.62s)]
*  That's dangerous. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5332.1s)]
*  I walked slowly, gently around the corner. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5333.820000000001s)]
*  She saw me. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5338.18s)]
*  She sent her cubs up a tree. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5339.3s)]
*  She's like, guys, go up. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5341.58s)]
*  And she continued to eat as she kept one eye on me. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5343.66s)]
*  No grief. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5347.54s)]
*  No snarling. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5348.94s)]
*  Because you didn't surprise her. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5349.98s)]
*  No snarling. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5351.58s)]
*  Just like, I see you. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5353.26s)]
*  I'm doing my thing. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5355.54s)]
*  You stay there. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5358.22s)]
*  I'll stay here. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5358.86s)]
*  Then I brought my son up, and we went looking for grizzlies. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5360.7s)]
*  And we found them. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5364.78s)]
*  And one crossed a river straight towards us [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5366.62s)]
*  and just walked right past us. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5369.9s)]
*  There's a distinction. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5373.82s)]
*  What you're talking about is a coastal brown bear. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5375.259999999999s)]
*  They're the ones that are eating a lot of salmon. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5379.0199999999995s)]
*  There's a difference between them and grizzlies. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5381.82s)]
*  The grizzlies are the inland bears. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5384.179999999999s)]
*  The grizzly is a bear that you would encounter, say, [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5386.42s)]
*  in Montana. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5388.339999999999s)]
*  And they're much more likely to eat you. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5389.0199999999995s)]
*  Is that right? [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5390.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5391.0599999999995s)]
*  Eat you. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5391.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5392.139999999999s)]
*  They are eating animals. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5393.339999999999s)]
*  They're not eating fish, because there's not much fish [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5395.9s)]
*  to eat there. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5399.22s)]
*  I mean, they might catch a trout every now and then. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5399.900000000001s)]
*  But for the most part, they're eating moose and deer, [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5401.860000000001s)]
*  and mostly calves, too. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5404.54s)]
*  That's what they prefer to eat. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5406.66s)]
*  That's a good meal. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5408.42s)]
*  It's a good meal. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5409.66s)]
*  I don't think I'm a good meal. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5410.34s)]
*  You definitely would be. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5412.18s)]
*  And they definitely would eat you. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5413.34s)]
*  My woman got killed in Montana recently. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5416.14s)]
*  She got killed in her tent. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5419.42s)]
*  I forget what she was doing there. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5424.1s)]
*  But she was in her tent. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5425.42s)]
*  And this bear came into her tent and killed her. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5426.94s)]
*  It does happen. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5429.86s)]
*  It's more likely to happen with grizzlies [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5431.179999999999s)]
*  than it is with brown bears. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5433.259999999999s)]
*  Because brown bears are actually far larger, too, [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5434.58s)]
*  because they have an almost endless supply of fish, [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5437.339999999999s)]
*  especially in Alaska. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5440.82s)]
*  The biggest brown bears in the world used to be in California. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5442.299999999999s)]
*  California, even though our state flag has a grizzly bear [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5446.339999999999s)]
*  on it, we don't have any grizzly bears in California, [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5450.259999999999s)]
*  because they killed them all. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5453.139999999999s)]
*  Misnomer? [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5454.339999999999s)]
*  No. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5455.339999999999s)]
*  No, I'm saying the flag is a misnomer. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5455.86s)]
*  No, no, they used to have them. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5457.94s)]
*  We had grizzlies? [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5459.46s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5460.46s)]
*  There's a place called Leveque, Leveque, California. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5461.219999999999s)]
*  I know we had the brown bear, but now with the distinction. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5464.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5467.5s)]
*  Well, it's the same bear. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5468.099999999999s)]
*  Same bear. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5469.0199999999995s)]
*  It's the difference between them is one of them [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5469.5s)]
*  is on the coast, and they're far larger. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5471.42s)]
*  California had the biggest, because California [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5473.099999999999s)]
*  doesn't have a hibernation. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5475.219999999999s)]
*  It's not winter. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5476.38s)]
*  There's no winter there. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5477.38s)]
*  California, like Leveque, California. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5478.78s)]
*  Where is that? [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5481.58s)]
*  It's on the way to Bakersfield, up the 5. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5482.26s)]
*  And it's named after the last person in California [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5485.900000000001s)]
*  to get killed by a grizzly bear. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5489.18s)]
*  I think his name was Stephen Leveque. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5491.06s)]
*  You had it right the first time. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5493.38s)]
*  With a B, Leveque. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5494.780000000001s)]
*  Leveque. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5495.740000000001s)]
*  It's Peter Leveque. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5496.1s)]
*  Leveque, yeah. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5497.02s)]
*  What did I say, Leveque? [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5497.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5498.860000000001s)]
*  Leveque. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5499.360000000001s)]
*  That's the guy. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5499.900000000001s)]
*  So he got killed by a bear in 1837, which now Fort Tahone. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5500.780000000001s)]
*  So that is up near Tahone Ranch. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5508.34s)]
*  And so this guy was the last person killed by a bear. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5511.42s)]
*  And then they basically eradicated brown bears [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5515.3s)]
*  from California, because they were killing people. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5518.82s)]
*  Because they were hunting them down. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5521.42s)]
*  Because they are predators. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5523.54s)]
*  And if they didn't have fish, and they found a person, [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5525.46s)]
*  they're like, I'll eat you. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5529.54s)]
*  I would have to see it to believe it. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5532.86s)]
*  See him eat a person? [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5535.1s)]
*  Well, I've read all the accounts of them eating people. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5535.9s)]
*  And it always seems like they have a reason. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5540.78s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5543.42s)]
*  Other than hungry. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5543.98s)]
*  Well, in California, I think the issue [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5545.46s)]
*  was people were making their way to California, [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5547.7s)]
*  and they were a new food source. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5550.66s)]
*  They weren't there originally. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5553.259999999999s)]
*  So people started showing up. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5555.099999999999s)]
*  I'm sure they were a nuisance. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5556.86s)]
*  If you're a bear, and you're trying to kill a deer, [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5558.5s)]
*  and then this asshole with a musket comes along [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5561.0199999999995s)]
*  and kills your deer, and then he tries [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5563.38s)]
*  to chase you off that deer, you're like, fuck the fuck out [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5565.38s)]
*  of here. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5567.74s)]
*  This is my deer you shot. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5567.9s)]
*  Get out of here. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5569.0599999999995s)]
*  How about the black bear? [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5569.74s)]
*  Black bear are more likely to try to kill people [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5571.219999999999s)]
*  than grizzly bears are. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5574.58s)]
*  When a person gets attacked by a grizzly bear, [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5576.74s)]
*  generally it's a surprise. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5578.74s)]
*  When a person gets killed by a black bear, [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5580.34s)]
*  it's generally a bear that's trying to kill people. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5582.179999999999s)]
*  They get predatory bears. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5585.0599999999995s)]
*  They do occasionally hunt people. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5586.54s)]
*  But it's rare. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5588.74s)]
*  For the most part, when a black bear sees you, [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5590.0199999999995s)]
*  they just try to run away. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5592.62s)]
*  They also think of people as a threat. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5594.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5596.7s)]
*  We got charged by a black bear in Alaska. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5597.3s)]
*  And it was as big as a brown bear. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5601.1s)]
*  They're big, man. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5603.26s)]
*  Oh, no. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5604.18s)]
*  This was a house running fast at us. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5604.68s)]
*  And then it made a right turn. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5608.34s)]
*  It was a bluff. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5609.900000000001s)]
*  It was a bluff charge. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5611.14s)]
*  It was a bluff. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5611.900000000001s)]
*  Thank god. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5612.5s)]
*  It didn't know what to do. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5613.7s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5614.860000000001s)]
*  Bears are wild animals. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5616.860000000001s)]
*  I mean, they're beautiful, too, though. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5617.9800000000005s)]
*  They're so cool. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5619.38s)]
*  I'm so glad they're real. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5620.14s)]
*  We love them. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5621.26s)]
*  In Pasadena, Monrovia. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5623.58s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5625.34s)]
*  They just come down from the hills and like. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5625.94s)]
*  Jump in people's pools. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5627.62s)]
*  Jump in pools, roam the streets, [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5628.78s)]
*  get a little snack out of the garbage. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5630.419999999999s)]
*  This is a great video from Pasadena. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5632.099999999999s)]
*  There's a guy who's on his phone. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5633.86s)]
*  And he goes and turns down this alley while he's on his phone. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5635.78s)]
*  And as he's looking at his phone, he looks up, [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5640.0199999999995s)]
*  and there's a bear. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5642.259999999999s)]
*  He's like, fuck! [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5643.0199999999995s)]
*  And he runs away. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5644.0199999999995s)]
*  But it's like a security camera footage of this fucking guy. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5645.259999999999s)]
*  Every day. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5649.7s)]
*  They're around. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5650.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5651.9s)]
*  Well, they come down from those mountains out there. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5652.54s)]
*  I'm happy that we have them. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5654.78s)]
*  It makes me feel like we're still alive. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5656.62s)]
*  Well, they're cool animals, man. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5658.7s)]
*  They're cool. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5660.54s)]
*  They're cool to see. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5661.099999999999s)]
*  They're all cool to see. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5663.0599999999995s)]
*  So are raccoons. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5664.099999999999s)]
*  They're cool to see, too. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5666.42s)]
*  I always love when I see raccoons. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5667.42s)]
*  They have personality. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5668.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5670.3s)]
*  I posted a video the other day on my Instagram [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5671.099999999999s)]
*  of a raccoon killing an iguana in Florida. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5673.34s)]
*  And I didn't know that raccoons are like little savages. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5676.7s)]
*  He's like killing a little bear, like biting down [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5679.86s)]
*  the head of this giant ass iguana that's the size of him. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5683.9s)]
*  Huh. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5686.74s)]
*  Killing it. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5687.259999999999s)]
*  Haven't seen that. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5687.86s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5688.62s)]
*  Savage. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5691.0599999999995s)]
*  Isn't that wild? [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5691.74s)]
*  That's like you and the alligator the other day. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5693.259999999999s)]
*  Well, iguanas are another weird invasive species in Florida. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5696.259999999999s)]
*  And I guess these raccoons are adapting. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5700.78s)]
*  Just decided to eat them. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5702.86s)]
*  That's a big challenge right there. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5704.219999999999s)]
*  And that wild thing's as big as him. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5706.0599999999995s)]
*  There's a lot of iguanas in Florida, apparently. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5709.139999999999s)]
*  I would imagine that's a tasty meal for him. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5712.3s)]
*  They apparently taste good. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5714.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5716.06s)]
*  Because there's a bunch of videos on YouTube [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5716.54s)]
*  of people hunting iguanas in Florida and then cooking them. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5718.66s)]
*  They cook them in like a chicken dish. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5722.860000000001s)]
*  I would try that. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5725.02s)]
*  I would? [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5725.900000000001s)]
*  Why not? [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5726.38s)]
*  They're invasive. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5727.66s)]
*  They have to kill them. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5729.06s)]
*  It's a good move. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5730.26s)]
*  So do you cook yourself? [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5732.58s)]
*  No. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5736.34s)]
*  Not at all? [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5737.14s)]
*  I will cook pancakes for my son. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5737.780000000001s)]
*  I will cook eggs for myself. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5740.86s)]
*  And that's kind of my limit. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5743.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5745.179999999999s)]
*  I see the attraction to people who [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5746.82s)]
*  love to be in the kitchen cutting and dicing and chopping [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5749.099999999999s)]
*  and frying. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5751.46s)]
*  My son can cook. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5752.58s)]
*  That's not for me. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5756.0599999999995s)]
*  No. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5756.94s)]
*  I just never got into it. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5757.46s)]
*  You? [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5758.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5758.82s)]
*  I cook all the time. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5759.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5760.299999999999s)]
*  I do see the beauty. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5761.339999999999s)]
*  I would be a good sous chef. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5764.38s)]
*  But I just haven't mastered the real chef thing. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5767.299999999999s)]
*  There's something cool about it. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5770.82s)]
*  There's something exciting about cooking something [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5772.34s)]
*  and then eating a meal that you prepared yourself. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5774.38s)]
*  It's very exciting. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5776.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5777.46s)]
*  Now, I like to be in the kitchen when that's happening. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5777.98s)]
*  But I prefer someone with a larger skill [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5780.299999999999s)]
*  set to be at the helm. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5782.62s)]
*  I get it. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5784.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5785.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5785.62s)]
*  Someone who knows what they're doing. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5785.86s)]
*  You ever do any fishing? [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5787.58s)]
*  As a kid in Michigan, yes. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5790.219999999999s)]
*  It was kind of a go to. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5792.62s)]
*  Kind of have to. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5793.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5794.62s)]
*  If you're a kid in Michigan. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5794.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5795.66s)]
*  You got to fish. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5796.139999999999s)]
*  It's the rite of passage. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5797.0599999999995s)]
*  But now I have the same feeling about fish. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5799.5s)]
*  I just hate taking them. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5803.14s)]
*  I love eating fish. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5804.3s)]
*  I get it. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5806.18s)]
*  It's such a wild animal. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5806.66s)]
*  It's so good, so dissatisfying. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5807.62s)]
*  But when I see them getting pulled out of the ocean, [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5809.22s)]
*  I'm like, ugh. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5812.06s)]
*  I just ruined this dude's day completely. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5813.38s)]
*  That's true. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5816.34s)]
*  Especially the mahi mahi, which are flaming blue, yellow. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5817.34s)]
*  And then the minute they come out, they lose all their color. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5824.5s)]
*  They're just like, ah, game's over. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5828.26s)]
*  But I would. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5832.46s)]
*  I would. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5833.5s)]
*  That's like an animal that I have a slightly easier time [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5834.18s)]
*  ending. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5840.42s)]
*  I was in Mexico with my wife. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5840.9400000000005s)]
*  And we went fishing. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5842.9800000000005s)]
*  We caught mahi mahi. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5843.900000000001s)]
*  And we cooked them literally two hours after we caught them. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5845.06s)]
*  Cooked them, caught them, got them to shore. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5850.42s)]
*  Two hours later, we're eating them. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5853.1s)]
*  And it was like, holy shit, is this good. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5854.7s)]
*  Fish in particular, there's something [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5857.62s)]
*  about cooking them right when you catch them that makes them [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5860.42s)]
*  exponentially better. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5864.5s)]
*  They're so good. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5866.98s)]
*  It's like I almost feel like you're missing something [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5869.38s)]
*  if you buy commercially caught. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5871.66s)]
*  You're missing what the fish has to offer you. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5874.14s)]
*  You're not getting all of it. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5878.94s)]
*  It's almost, I mean, it's still great. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5880.3s)]
*  Mahi mahi's great no matter what. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5883.38s)]
*  But man, it's not as good. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5885.02s)]
*  Like right out of the water, it's the best. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5887.860000000001s)]
*  I did that with my uncle in the Bahamas in the early 70s. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5891.42s)]
*  Really? [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5895.9800000000005s)]
*  He was that guy. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5896.46s)]
*  He was a master surgeon. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5897.46s)]
*  So we spent all day in the hospital with open bodies, [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5900.3s)]
*  trying to heal them. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5903.42s)]
*  And then we would take a tiny little sailboat to the Bahamas [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5905.14s)]
*  and fish and swim and live. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5909.1s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5911.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5912.5s)]
*  What a cool experience that must have been. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5913.66s)]
*  It was. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5915.42s)]
*  He was a bad ass. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5916.099999999999s)]
*  He was a big barrel chested bad ass. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5917.26s)]
*  And I'm not afraid of sharks. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5919.74s)]
*  I had seen Jaws. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5922.0199999999995s)]
*  Show me a shark this big, and I'm just running over the top [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5923.86s)]
*  of the water to escape. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5927.66s)]
*  And we were on the island of Bimini, [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5930.74s)]
*  which is just a little sliver of an island out in the Atlantic. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5933.54s)]
*  Crystal clear water. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5937.66s)]
*  And one day a hurricane was coming. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5939.78s)]
*  And his job was to take his tiny motorboat [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5943.7s)]
*  and pull a huge sailboat out of the harbor [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5946.26s)]
*  so that it could get to the ocean [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5949.54s)]
*  before the hurricane arrived, because that sailboat [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5950.98s)]
*  needed to get to Florida. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5953.5s)]
*  It's raining. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5956.5s)]
*  The seas are high, and he's in a small motorboat. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5958.26s)]
*  And he's going to pull with a rope the boat out of the harbor. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5960.58s)]
*  And I was like, I'm coming. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5964.42s)]
*  He's like, you are not coming. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5966.099999999999s)]
*  There was an 11-year-old Tony. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5968.1s)]
*  It was like, no, I'm coming on this trip. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5971.06s)]
*  I'm going to help. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5973.14s)]
*  So my aunt sanctioned little Tony getting on the boat. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5975.3s)]
*  And we pull this racing sailboat out of the harbor [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5979.620000000001s)]
*  into the ocean, which is raging with massive waves. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5982.740000000001s)]
*  And we got a wave coming up over our bow, which sent us vertical. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5987.9400000000005s)]
*  got a wave pushing its nose down, [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5995.06s)]
*  which pulled our stern underwater. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=5997.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6000.54s)]
*  And it was my time-to-go moment. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6002.240000000001s)]
*  I was like, God, whoever you are, whatever you are, [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6004.8s)]
*  I feel a little bit young to be checking out right now. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6007.88s)]
*  I mean, is this what you had in mind, honestly? [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6011.14s)]
*  And as I'm having my time-to-leave-this-earth moment, [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6013.9800000000005s)]
*  my uncle grabbed a machete [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6019.080000000001s)]
*  and went underwater and cut that rope. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6020.92s)]
*  And we popped out like a cork. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6024.28s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6026.08s)]
*  He floored the engine, [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6026.88s)]
*  which sent most of the water out of the boat, [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6028.56s)]
*  and everything was fine. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6031.92s)]
*  Wow, he knew his shit. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6034.2s)]
*  He knew his shit, [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6035.6s)]
*  but this is the guy that also taught me [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6037.04s)]
*  how to pull big fish out of the ocean [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6038.86s)]
*  and in theory not be afraid of sharks. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6041.0s)]
*  That must have been an amazing experience, [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6045.0s)]

*  he told that story and he says, [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6055.360000000001s)]
*  that was the scariest thing that's ever happened to me [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6056.66s)]

*  Right after they retired. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6077.14s)]
*  That's ballsy. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6078.64s)]
*  Yeah, they were like, [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6079.4800000000005s)]
*  they didn't have a lot of experience on boats either. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6080.56s)]
*  They just decided to learn how to sail, [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6083.4s)]
*  and they lived in the Bahamas. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6085.8s)]
*  They lived in the Florida Keys. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6087.78s)]
*  They just decided, [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6089.14s)]
*  they even just fucking drifted around [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6091.54s)]
*  and that sailboat went to different places. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6094.94s)]
*  You ever think about it? [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6097.64s)]
*  No. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6098.68s)]

*  I love the ocean, [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6107.6s)]

*  I would live in the mountains for sure. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6110.9800000000005s)]
*  For sure. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6112.82s)]
*  You ever think about just taking that one time [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6115.06s)]
*  circumnavigation of the globe in a sailboat? [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6117.2s)]

*  Why? [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6122.12s)]
*  Fuck that. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6122.96s)]
*  It's just not attractive to me. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6125.4s)]
*  I respect it. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6126.74s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6127.6s)]
*  It's beautiful, [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6128.44s)]
*  but to be contained on a small wooden vessel [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6129.54s)]
*  bouncing around at the mercy of the waves [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6132.8s)]
*  and the way the moon affects the tides. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6135.36s)]
*  Fuck off. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6139.54s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6143.04s)]
*  Look, a lot of people would say fuck off [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6143.88s)]
*  about the mountains too. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6144.88s)]
*  I'm not judging. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6145.94s)]

*  I love this. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6151.12s)]
*  Ready? [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6152.259999999999s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6154.219999999999s)]
*  That silence that you get in the mountains [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6155.32s)]
*  when you're sitting on top of a peak [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6158.7s)]
*  and you're overlooking these valleys [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6161.719999999999s)]
*  and you don't hear shit except maybe a bird [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6164.32s)]
*  or a snap of a branch because an animal's running through. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6167.0599999999995s)]
*  That to me is the most centering and the most peaceful. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6171.2s)]
*  And it's just something that there's a vibration [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6175.7s)]
*  of being in the wilderness that puts me at ease. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6178.44s)]
*  Things make sense when I'm up there. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6181.88s)]
*  That I like. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6185.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I love that too. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6186.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6187.42s)]
*  The ocean can eat shit. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6188.38s)]
*  The ocean can go fuck off. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6191.12s)]
*  When it comes to being in the middle of the ocean, [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6193.6s)]
*  I share this sentiment. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6195.6s)]
*  On the edges, I'll take it all day. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6197.14s)]
*  Oh, the edges are gorgeous. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6199.080000000001s)]
*  I'm only kidding. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6200.280000000001s)]
*  I love it. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6201.18s)]
*  Like I said, if I was gonna live in California, [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6202.4800000000005s)]
*  I would live in Malibu. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6204.22s)]
*  When we were getting our kitchen fixed at one point in time, [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6207.160000000001s)]
*  so we could either stay in our house [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6210.120000000001s)]
*  or we decided to rent a house. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6213.06s)]
*  We decided, I've never lived on the water. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6214.3s)]
*  Let's rent a house on the water. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6216.160000000001s)]
*  So we rented a house in Malibu and in the morning, [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6217.660000000001s)]
*  I would eat breakfast and it was right there on the water. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6220.360000000001s)]
*  It's incredible. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6224.16s)]
*  That's good. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6225.5599999999995s)]
*  I was like, oh, I get it. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6226.4s)]
*  I get it. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6227.66s)]
*  Similar to the mountain feeling. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6228.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6230.639999999999s)]
*  What's your go-to mountain range? [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6231.7s)]
*  Wow, I don't know, man. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6234.38s)]
*  I love them all. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6235.28s)]
*  I was just in the Tatchipee Mountains last week [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6236.099999999999s)]
*  in California, which is gorgeous. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6240.219999999999s)]
*  The Wasatch in Utah is gorgeous. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6243.38s)]
*  I love the Rockies in Colorado. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6245.58s)]
*  I just love that. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6248.12s)]
*  When you're in unspoiled wilderness, [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6251.299999999999s)]
*  there's just a vibe to it. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6254.78s)]
*  When you realize that these animals are out there [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6257.0199999999995s)]
*  just doing what they've done for thousands of years [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6259.679999999999s)]
*  before humans ever even came around. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6262.88s)]
*  There's something about that that's just, [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6265.42s)]
*  it's very, very, very appealing to me. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6267.46s)]
*  It's just gorgeous to be around. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6269.5199999999995s)]
*  The view of it, I don't think there's a better [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6271.219999999999s)]
*  natural art in the world than mountains. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6273.46s)]
*  Good. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6276.299999999999s)]
*  Flea and I discovered it at 16. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6277.5s)]
*  We were city boys. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6281.0599999999995s)]
*  We didn't know from wilderness really. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6282.62s)]
*  Michigan, very flat. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6285.26s)]
*  There was a popular T-shirt said, [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6286.66s)]
*  go climb a rock. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6289.5599999999995s)]
*  Then on the back of the shirt it said Yosemite. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6291.099999999999s)]
*  I was like, Yosemite, what is this Yosemite thing? [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6294.099999999999s)]
*  When we were 16 I said, flea, [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6298.44s)]
*  let's get on a Greyhound bus [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6301.04s)]
*  and go see what Yosemite is all about. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6303.04s)]
*  We had shopping bags of food, canned food, [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6305.34s)]
*  nylon backpack with a blanket, [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6310.84s)]
*  and we took a Greyhound up to Yosemite. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6312.84s)]
*  Wow. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6315.080000000001s)]
*  And took a gnarly trail. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6316.42s)]
*  Like we went up Yosemite Falls and into the back country [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6319.080000000001s)]
*  carrying sacks of food, [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6323.120000000001s)]
*  because we didn't know any better. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6324.72s)]
*  So this is the 70s. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6326.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, 78 maybe. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6328.320000000001s)]
*  But it was a game changer. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6331.240000000001s)]
*  We connected, we connected with that space [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6333.360000000001s)]
*  and swam in rivers and made campfires and cooked food [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6336.9s)]
*  and saw those cosmos and maybe saw a UFO or two. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6341.7s)]
*  And we've been back ever since. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6349.04s)]
*  It was a moment where we tapped into something. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6352.14s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6356.08s)]
*  And we wrote a song, a nacapella song, [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6356.92s)]
*  which we hadn't been doing up to that point together. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6359.98s)]
*  When did you guys first start making music together? [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6362.88s)]
*  In 1983, we had this bizarre and beautiful friend [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6368.219999999999s)]
*  from Arkansas, gay and black and fashionable, [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6375.259999999999s)]
*  and very much on the scene of LA clubs. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6381.259999999999s)]
*  And Flea and Hillel and Jack Irons and Alan Yohannes [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6384.839999999999s)]
*  had all been playing in like new wave rock bands. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6388.88s)]
*  But not me. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6392.1s)]
*  I go, I support, I dance, I have fun. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6393.0599999999995s)]
*  But this character from Arkansas, who was a real misfit, [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6396.3s)]
*  and ahead of his time said, [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6400.3s)]
*  why don't you let Anthony be in the band? [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6401.68s)]
*  And they looked at him like, [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6405.18s)]
*  because he's not a musician, I don't know. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6407.08s)]
*  Why would we tell Anthony to be in the band? [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6408.84s)]
*  Let him sing one song. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6411.38s)]
*  And so they're like, all right, Anthony, [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6414.32s)]
*  go write some words, sing a song. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6416.26s)]
*  And we did that and it was so explosive [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6418.9s)]
*  and so chemically correct, the new guys together. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6421.38s)]
*  That we couldn't stop, we just never stopped. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6428.58s)]
*  That was just the beginning of a 40 year run. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6430.719999999999s)]
*  And so you didn't have any inclination, [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6433.5199999999995s)]
*  you didn't have any aspiration, [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6435.599999999999s)]
*  this one guy saying that to you? [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6437.759999999999s)]
*  To them. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6440.42s)]
*  Like he said, let Anthony sing a song. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6441.259999999999s)]
*  I was like, what? [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6443.839999999999s)]
*  What's going on over there? [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6444.679999999999s)]
*  He didn't run it by you first? [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6446.5s)]
*  No, no, but he knew that I loved to write poetry [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6448.44s)]
*  and dance and just emote. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6452.599999999999s)]
*  Did you have an idea what you wanted to do with your life? [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6455.24s)]
*  No, no, I started off thinking I would be an actor [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6458.0s)]
*  or a novelist, and then I thought maybe crime would work out. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6462.259999999999s)]
*  What kind of crime? [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6466.04s)]
*  Whatever was easy. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6468.12s)]
*  But my father had kind of inserted enough art [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6469.879999999999s)]
*  into my childhood with music and visual arts [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6473.259999999999s)]
*  and just ideas that I was built of this stuff. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6479.04s)]
*  I was built of words and sound. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6482.24s)]
*  And if you trace a musician's history [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6486.5199999999995s)]
*  back to when they're kids, [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6489.72s)]
*  it's never an accident that they ended up [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6490.96s)]
*  doing that for a living. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6493.36s)]
*  Like if you look at Chad Smith, our drummer, [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6494.48s)]
*  one of the greatest drummers to ever walk the earth today. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6497.2s)]
*  He's a phenom, but he was a little stoner [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6500.5599999999995s)]
*  living in the suburbs of Michigan [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6504.12s)]
*  who all he wanted to do was listen to music [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6505.72s)]
*  and be a part of music. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6509.2s)]
*  But he was also a natural born athlete. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6510.56s)]
*  He was so coordinated. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6514.08s)]
*  Pick up a golf club, boom. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6516.14s)]
*  Go on the ice, play hockey, boom. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6518.4400000000005s)]
*  He was just genetically coordinated. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6520.240000000001s)]
*  And then he played in 20 different rock bands as a kid, [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6523.6s)]
*  just honing and woodshedding and figuring it out [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6527.6s)]
*  until we met him when he was like in his 20s [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6531.88s)]
*  and hired him. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6535.36s)]
*  If you look at Flea, broken home, [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6537.32s)]
*  but his stepdad was a jazz bass player [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6541.04s)]
*  who would have jam sessions in the house all day every day. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6543.639999999999s)]
*  So there's a little boy just watching these jazz bands [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6547.139999999999s)]
*  and then he got a trumpet and he realized [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6550.88s)]
*  that if I play trumpet, people are gonna notice me. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6554.4s)]
*  So the little kid who wasn't getting much attention [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6557.24s)]
*  in this adult world of a broken home, [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6560.179999999999s)]
*  suddenly people are paying attention and listening [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6563.32s)]
*  and he had the discipline and the intellect. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6567.28s)]
*  John Frascante, his great grandfather, [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6570.799999999999s)]
*  immigrant from Italy, master musician, [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6573.639999999999s)]
*  his father, Juilliard pianist. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6577.16s)]
*  So from the time he's a kid, just music, [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6579.799999999999s)]
*  like let's see what you got. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6582.759999999999s)]
*  And then his psychosis and way of dealing with the world [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6585.78s)]
*  was I'm just gonna sit and play for 10 hours a day. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6591.0199999999995s)]
*  So it was never an accident that these people end up [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6595.099999999999s)]
*  where they end up. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6597.62s)]
*  It's a lifetime of just everything working out [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6598.46s)]
*  so that that's your life. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6603.86s)]
*  So you had no aspirations of singing. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6607.5s)]
*  This guy tells the band, let him sing a song. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6610.5s)]
*  You sing it and then was it immediately? [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6615.5s)]
*  Immediately. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6618.98s)]
*  It was too much fun and the club owner, [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6621.0199999999995s)]
*  we played one song in the club and Solomon Burke, [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6624.42s)]
*  this French guy who had started a club in Hollywood, [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6627.82s)]
*  charged the bandstand and said, [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6630.38s)]
*  will you always come back next week? [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6632.3s)]
*  Maybe play two songs. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6634.26s)]
*  We're like, we'll see you next week. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6636.0199999999995s)]
*  And we went home and we wrote a song [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6638.38s)]
*  and we came back next week and it just never stopped. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6640.139999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6643.82s)]
*  And you were 21. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6646.5s)]
*  And you were 21. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6647.74s)]
*  Yep. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6648.74s)]
*  21, homeless, sleeping in graveyards, backyards, [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6649.82s)]
*  park benches, back seats of cars, chaise lounges. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6656.62s)]
*  But I now had a direction. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6663.32s)]
*  And you just dive right in? [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6666.78s)]
*  Yeah, it stuck. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6669.02s)]
*  It's what I wanted to do from that point forward. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6670.22s)]
*  Started carrying around notebooks [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6674.5s)]
*  and just writing and writing and figuring it out [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6676.02s)]
*  and listening more and more carefully [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6678.580000000001s)]
*  to what these guys were playing. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6681.3s)]
*  Where did I fit into this rhythmically, [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6683.540000000001s)]
*  melodically, learning curve. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6685.580000000001s)]
*  Did you take any music lessons? [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6689.900000000001s)]
*  At the time, no. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6692.3s)]
*  But then as the years went by, [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6693.9800000000005s)]
*  I realized I had to train my voice just to sustain. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6696.22s)]
*  And I also wanted to do different things with my voice. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6700.740000000001s)]
*  So I found some teachers, [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6704.1s)]
*  old school opera vocal coach guys and girls, [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6706.900000000001s)]
*  which taught me a lot and made it a lot more fun [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6712.3s)]
*  and gave me a bigger playing field. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6715.18s)]
*  But really it's just about being present, [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6719.700000000001s)]
*  being emotional and listening to what's happening. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6723.26s)]
*  So what is the creative process like [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6726.88s)]
*  when you guys make a song? [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6729.3s)]
*  Do they have the music first? [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6731.42s)]
*  Do you have the lyrics first? [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6734.46s)]
*  Is it a combination of the two? [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6735.74s)]
*  Zero rules. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6738.82s)]
*  Zero rules. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6740.0199999999995s)]
*  Zero rules and it happens every which way [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6740.86s)]
*  and it could be anything. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6743.74s)]
*  As the Red Hot Chili Peppers don't have a, [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6746.099999999999s)]
*  it's gotta sound like this or it's gotta sound like that. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6748.98s)]
*  It's gotta be hard or it's gotta be, [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6751.179999999999s)]
*  it could be anything. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6752.42s)]
*  Could be funky, it could be bluesy, it could be jazzy. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6754.82s)]
*  It could be hip hop. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6758.78s)]
*  It could be folk. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6760.74s)]
*  We'll play anything. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6762.98s)]
*  Anything that we feel like playing, [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6763.98s)]
*  which is also a blessing because less boxed in. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6766.379999999999s)]
*  But often John and Flea will stay home [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6772.099999999999s)]
*  and go to their garage or their room or whatever [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6775.58s)]
*  and just play until they have something, [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6777.94s)]
*  a tidbit, a chord progression, a rhythm, a melody, [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6781.139999999999s)]
*  because that's what they like to do for hours. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6787.0599999999995s)]
*  Just play. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6789.259999999999s)]
*  And they'll come to band practice and they'll say, [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6790.86s)]
*  what do you think about this? [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6793.139999999999s)]
*  Be like, I love that and I think I know what to do with that. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6795.3s)]
*  And it starts there and Chad knows what to do [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6798.3s)]
*  and we just build together. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6803.0599999999995s)]
*  Or I'll come in and I'll say, I have these words, [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6805.42s)]
*  they're looking for a home, what do you think? [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6807.9s)]
*  And John is exquisite at listening to what I'm doing [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6811.26s)]
*  and I kind of feel like I'm surrounded by geniuses [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6816.5s)]
*  and I'm a little bit of the idiot, [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6819.82s)]
*  but he's good at deciphering the idiot's genius. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6821.78s)]
*  So he listens to me and he's like, [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6825.7s)]
*  I know what to put with that and then it just grows. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6827.38s)]
*  And what is your writing process like? [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6831.299999999999s)]
*  Do you write alone? [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6833.82s)]
*  Do you like to sit alone? [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6834.9s)]
*  Do you write with them around you? [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6835.9s)]
*  How do you write? [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6837.98s)]
*  I like to write alone, but I'm not afraid to write [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6839.5s)]
*  in a crowded room if it's flowing. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6842.54s)]
*  I think the number one thing is just to write. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6845.98s)]
*  If you go sit down and listen to music [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6851.379999999999s)]
*  and get a piece of paper and a pencil [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6854.179999999999s)]
*  or however you write, something's gonna happen. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6856.459999999999s)]
*  Something always happens. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6859.98s)]
*  Sometimes it's better than others, [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6861.86s)]
*  but if you make that time to write, [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6863.259999999999s)]
*  something's gonna happen. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6866.379999999999s)]
*  Or if you have an idea, no matter where you are, [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6869.58s)]
*  on a plane, riding a bike, sound asleep, [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6872.66s)]
*  you better get the fuck up and put that idea down [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6874.5s)]
*  because that could be it. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6878.34s)]
*  If it came to you, it means something. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6880.54s)]
*  So yeah, I like to sit on my back porch with a boombox [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6885.06s)]
*  and play today's rehearsal and just sit there and write. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6889.5s)]
*  And I owe some of that to my father, [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6893.9s)]
*  who kind of implanted that in me. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6897.02s)]
*  The writing, the creativity, understanding words. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6899.78s)]
*  But probably the most powerful thing [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6905.26s)]
*  that you could ever write is something that's honest. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6908.38s)]
*  So playful's fun, intellectual's fun, interesting is fun, [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6910.82s)]
*  but when you crack into that emotional thing where it hurts [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6916.22s)]
*  or just one of those moments of honesty, [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6920.78s)]
*  that's perhaps the most valuable. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6926.14s)]
*  That's the kind of music I think that resonates [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6928.3s)]
*  with people the most. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6931.3s)]
*  People love all kinds of music, right? [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6932.26s)]
*  But there's something about when you know that an artist [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6934.5s)]
*  is saying something that comes from the deepest part [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6937.22s)]
*  of their being, like there's some reality [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6943.3s)]
*  to what they're singing about. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6945.900000000001s)]
*  It at least represents some reality [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6947.58s)]
*  of what they're singing about, [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6950.46s)]
*  that you know it's a part of them. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6951.3s)]
*  That it excites people so much [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6954.780000000001s)]
*  because you're sharing something. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6957.900000000001s)]
*  You're sharing a part of your soul. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6959.660000000001s)]
*  You're sharing a part of your life experience. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6961.66s)]
*  You're sharing a part of your personality [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6963.42s)]
*  and you're doing so through your writing. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6965.14s)]
*  You're doing so through your singing. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6967.14s)]
*  It resonates. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6969.98s)]
*  We're all connected. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6971.86s)]
*  And when people like, I know that feeling. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6974.54s)]
*  I wanna experience this guy's version of that feeling. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6977.78s)]
*  I'm connected to that. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6981.0599999999995s)]
*  The hardest of the hard, the gangsters of LA. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6983.58s)]
*  I'll be writing down the Sunset Boulevard. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6988.42s)]
*  And I'll hear Under the Bridge coming out of a lowrider. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6991.9s)]
*  And it is the toughest, scariest, [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6995.26s)]
*  most, you know, loked out looking dudes [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6997.18s)]
*  just melting with Under the Bridge. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=6999.86s)]
*  I'm like, okay. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7003.26s)]
*  That was a day well spent in writing that song. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7004.82s)]
*  Do you always close with that song? [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7007.62s)]
*  Or do you guys mix up and play it? [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7009.82s)]
*  We mix it up. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7010.94s)]
*  But yeah, it's a meaningful tune. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7013.46s)]
*  It has stood the test of time. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7015.82s)]
*  When you guys closed with it the other night, [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7017.78s)]
*  I was like, yeah, you kinda have to. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7019.26s)]
*  I owe a lot of that to Rick Rubin, that song. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7022.3s)]
*  He's amazing, isn't he? [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7026.98s)]
*  He's all right. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7028.38s)]
*  What a trip. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7029.22s)]
*  He's all right. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7030.0599999999995s)]
*  He's such an unusual person. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7031.14s)]
*  For a beginner, he's pretty good. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7032.18s)]
*  So we were writing Blood, Sugar, Sex Magic. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7036.22s)]
*  And I was, at the time, [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7039.54s)]
*  we would just spend our days together. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7041.3s)]
*  He was a lot less busy. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7043.42s)]
*  He wasn't a dad. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7045.5s)]
*  And we would just hang all day. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7046.66s)]
*  What are you working on? [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7049.86s)]
*  Show me the songs you're writing. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7050.86s)]
*  Because he's producing our record. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7052.94s)]
*  And I showed him all my sexy songs, heavy, funky songs. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7054.78s)]
*  He's like, okay, that's good. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7059.74s)]
*  We can work on that. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7060.7s)]
*  He's like, anything else in the book? [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7061.54s)]
*  Just a poem that really isn't a song. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7064.46s)]
*  I mean, it has a melody, but I don't think it's for us. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7067.46s)]
*  Well, let me hear it. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7070.94s)]
*  I was like, it's kind of embarrassing. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7072.299999999999s)]
*  It's a little sentimental. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7074.0199999999995s)]
*  Love to hear it. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7076.099999999999s)]
*  It was Rick, because Rick knows, [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7077.62s)]
*  there's no rules. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7080.1s)]
*  You want the thing that's not expected. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7081.46s)]
*  So I sang him Under the Bridge, [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7084.46s)]
*  and he was like, that's your best song. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7085.9800000000005s)]
*  I was like, it's just a poem. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7088.34s)]
*  Bring it into the voice. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7090.9800000000005s)]
*  Show him the song. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7092.1s)]
*  So without Rick's push, [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7093.58s)]
*  for the counterintuitive, sensitive guy song, [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7097.5s)]
*  we might've never had a chance to write that. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7103.14s)]
*  There's some people in the world that are magic. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7105.780000000001s)]
*  I love Rick, and he is magic. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7109.139999999999s)]
*  He's a magic person. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7111.58s)]
*  He has, when you're talking to him, [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7113.0199999999995s)]
*  he has a sense of ignoring the bullshit, [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7115.7s)]
*  and just tuning into the magic. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7120.66s)]
*  You could tell when you're talking to him, [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7125.179999999999s)]
*  it's not nonsense. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7126.66s)]
*  It's like a science almost. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7129.34s)]
*  It's like an understanding of what it is, [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7131.58s)]
*  and he just follows that frequency. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7134.3s)]
*  He chases it down. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7137.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he's tuned into that. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7139.660000000001s)]
*  He's very good at that. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7141.46s)]
*  He's another person, if you look at his origins, [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7143.42s)]
*  it's no accident that he ended up [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7147.18s)]
*  being the person that he is. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7150.620000000001s)]
*  Single child, out in the suburbs of New York City, [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7153.700000000001s)]
*  I think, Long Beach, Long Island, [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7158.860000000001s)]
*  and he had an aunt. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7162.740000000001s)]
*  Very cerebral boy, already just like very smart kid, [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7165.18s)]
*  but living a boring, culture-free life of the island. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7169.18s)]
*  And he had an aunt who lived in Manhattan [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7175.9800000000005s)]
*  who loved her nephew, and every weekend, [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7177.9400000000005s)]
*  or every other weekend, whatever, [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7180.54s)]
*  he would go spend with her, and she was cultured. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7181.900000000001s)]
*  She was like, we're going to the opera, [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7184.42s)]
*  we're going to the symphony, we're going to the museum, [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7186.3s)]
*  we're gonna go see all this different stuff, [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7189.9400000000005s)]
*  and Rick was amazed by the music and the art [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7192.34s)]
*  and the culture that she was sharing with him, [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7196.5s)]
*  that he wasn't getting in his home life, [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7199.06s)]
*  and he just started tapping into the magic, [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7202.66s)]
*  and dedicating himself in a way that led to him [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7208.74s)]
*  starting his record company when he was in the NYU dorms. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7211.820000000001s)]
*  But it wasn't an accident. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7217.74s)]
*  He got fed the raw materials as a kid, [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7219.42s)]
*  and it opened up his dream. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7222.7s)]
*  And I think probably also being a single kid, [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7224.86s)]
*  you're not influenced by your siblings either, [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7227.38s)]
*  so you have a chance to sort of be who you actually are. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7230.06s)]
*  Less influence. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7235.02s)]
*  He would get on a bus and go 200 miles to see James Brown [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7236.22s)]
*  when James Brown was still on tour, by himself, [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7241.42s)]
*  and he would get there five hours early, [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7244.58s)]
*  and they were like, you gotta wait in the parking lot [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7247.22s)]
*  because doors don't open for five hours. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7248.9s)]
*  As a kid by himself to go see James Brown, [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7251.74s)]
*  I was like, eh, you're qualified. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7255.339999999999s)]
*  Just out of appreciation, [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7257.179999999999s)]
*  not even thinking there was a career involved in that. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7258.66s)]
*  That's what's so crazy about his story. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7260.94s)]
*  There was no career to be that guy. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7263.339999999999s)]
*  Nope. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7265.42s)]
*  No, he invented a career. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7266.42s)]
*  There was no future in hip hop. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7268.82s)]
*  No, people looked down upon it. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7272.259999999999s)]
*  They thought it wasn't even music. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7275.0199999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7276.54s)]
*  Call us back when you have some music, they would say. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7277.66s)]
*  Isn't that hilarious? [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7280.46s)]
*  He was telling me the whole story [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7282.06s)]
*  of the connection between Aerosmith and Run DMC [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7283.18s)]
*  about people like, what the fuck are you doing? [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7286.74s)]
*  You're ruining Aerosmith. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7289.26s)]
*  And then the hip hop people are like, [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7291.34s)]
*  what the fuck are you doing? [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7292.5s)]
*  You're putting hip hop together with rock? [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7293.9s)]
*  What the fuck is that? [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7296.06s)]
*  And then meanwhile, it's like, [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7297.62s)]
*  oh my God, you just united two worlds. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7299.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7301.22s)]
*  You united two worlds [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7302.06s)]
*  and opened up a whole new realm of possibility for music. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7303.42s)]
*  And you just did it by following magic. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7307.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7309.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7310.9800000000005s)]
*  So I met him in maybe 1985 [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7312.22s)]
*  and we were flailing. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7317.22s)]
*  I was lost in a retarded sea of drug addiction. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7320.38s)]
*  Just too thin to win. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7325.06s)]
*  How did that start? [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7327.42s)]
*  Huh? [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7328.54s)]
*  How'd that start? [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7329.38s)]
*  I'll tell you, but first I gotta show [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7330.38s)]
*  the little Rick tidbit. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7331.58s)]
*  So I was basically a junkie, [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7333.46s)]
*  but still showing up to work from time to time, [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7335.42s)]
*  which was the basement of the EMI studios [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7337.42s)]
*  on Sunset Boulevard. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7341.94s)]
*  They gave us a little basement to rehearse in. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7343.38s)]
*  They had signed us. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7346.06s)]
*  But we were going nowhere very slowly. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7348.58s)]
*  Couldn't get out of our own way. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7350.86s)]
*  But we were still making a buzz. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7354.3s)]
*  There was still something exciting about us [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7355.98s)]
*  that caught people's attention. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7358.9s)]
*  And it caught Rick Rubin's attention. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7360.42s)]
*  And he was with the Beastie Boys [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7362.86s)]
*  and they were exploding with success [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7364.9400000000005s)]
*  and greatness writing incredible music. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7368.06s)]
*  And so Rick brought the Beastie Boys [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7372.34s)]
*  to our dingy little recording or rehearsal spot. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7374.02s)]
*  And he sat there and we rehearsed while they watched. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7378.78s)]
*  They're in these little dirty couches watching us. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7382.58s)]
*  And we went through our songs. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7384.86s)]
*  And Rick stood up and said, we're gonna go now. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7388.18s)]
*  And I was like, okay, do we talk again? [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7390.82s)]
*  What's going on? [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7392.9400000000005s)]
*  We'll get back to you. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7394.58s)]
*  Didn't see him for years. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7395.78s)]
*  Years and years and years went by. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7397.58s)]
*  Eventually I got clean and he came back [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7400.1s)]
*  and said, let's make a record. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7402.26s)]
*  But I said, what happened that day? [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7404.3s)]
*  You came and we played and you disappeared [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7406.22s)]
*  and I never talked to you again. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7408.66s)]
*  He's like, I thought somebody was gonna get murdered [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7409.5s)]
*  in that rehearsal space. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7412.7s)]
*  I thought somebody was gonna die. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7413.74s)]
*  I had to leave. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7414.9800000000005s)]
*  That's how dark we had become. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7416.38s)]
*  That's how dark I had become [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7418.18s)]
*  is he was afraid someone was gonna die [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7419.46s)]
*  and it was time to leave. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7422.14s)]
*  Murdered. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7423.34s)]
*  That's what he said. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7424.34s)]
*  He's like, you guys were terrifying. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7425.18s)]
*  You were scary. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7426.9400000000005s)]
*  It felt like somebody was gonna die. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7428.66s)]
*  We had to go. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7430.22s)]
*  When you look back on those times, [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7433.62s)]
*  do you understand how he thought that? [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7435.38s)]
*  Not exactly, but everybody has their own perception [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7438.02s)]
*  and there was darkness in the room [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7443.18s)]
*  when you're following that lifestyle. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7447.700000000001s)]
*  There's definitely, instead of a magical energy, [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7449.26s)]
*  there's a very discernible dark energy. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7451.780000000001s)]
*  But I didn't realize it was that dangerous. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7456.3s)]
*  He was scared. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7460.02s)]
*  How did you get on the road, the drug road? [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7461.740000000001s)]
*  Well, I think the road was already in me from birth. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7468.26s)]
*  A combination of predisposed to addiction physically [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7474.02s)]
*  and then emotionally, I developed the tendencies [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7480.26s)]
*  that I needed to squash some of the noise. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7484.620000000001s)]
*  Spiritually, a little depleted. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7488.540000000001s)]
*  I started smoking weed and loved it. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7493.9800000000005s)]
*  It was a very fun and at the time subversive thing [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7496.06s)]
*  to be a part of. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7499.740000000001s)]
*  Today, it's pretty damn common. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7500.82s)]
*  But then it was very outlaw as a young teenage boy. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7504.0199999999995s)]
*  Years went by and there was no problem. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7510.0599999999995s)]
*  Then I started introducing narcotics at a pretty young age [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7512.54s)]
*  and really had nothing to say about it anymore. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7516.099999999999s)]
*  I was like the caboose of a train, [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7519.38s)]
*  just going wherever the hell that train said to go. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7522.66s)]
*  It was interesting and it was exciting, [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7526.66s)]
*  but it was also painful as hell. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7529.18s)]
*  It was just like in the end, this is a life of suffering. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7532.740000000001s)]
*  Fortunately, my destiny was meant to survive that. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7538.9400000000005s)]
*  It isn't really events or advice or anything [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7547.18s)]
*  that gives you the window to step out of that, [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7550.58s)]
*  but it's a little gift from the cosmos [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7554.38s)]
*  that just makes you look at yourself and say, [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7558.38s)]
*  I'm gonna give you a chance, I'm gonna give you [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7561.5s)]
*  an opportunity to put in the work to get better [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7562.9800000000005s)]
*  if you so choose. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7566.82s)]
*  If not, carry on. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7568.1s)]
*  What was the narcotic of choice? [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7571.26s)]
*  Of choice, I would have to say the combination [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7574.58s)]
*  of heroin and cocaine was at that moment, [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7578.22s)]
*  at that point in time. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7582.78s)]
*  Do you remember what you started with? [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7584.06s)]
*  Of those two? [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7585.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7586.64s)]
*  I probably did the cocaine shortly before the heroin, [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7587.48s)]
*  but right around the same time, very young age. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7591.0s)]
*  And did you do it because it was the thing [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7594.759999999999s)]
*  that people around you did? [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7598.16s)]
*  Was it just exciting? [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7600.32s)]
*  Was it rebellious? [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7602.12s)]
*  What was it? [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7603.4s)]
*  Was it a part of rock and roll? [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7604.24s)]
*  It had nothing to do with rock and roll [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7605.679999999999s)]
*  or trying to impress or put on a pretense. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7607.5199999999995s)]
*  It was happening around me in my world. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7611.4s)]
*  It was exciting and dangerous. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7614.9400000000005s)]
*  Everyone's afraid of that. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7618.8s)]
*  I think I'll do that thing that just the word scares people. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7620.66s)]
*  But it was also a way of checking out. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7625.34s)]
*  In the same way that one person will sit down in a bar [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7630.52s)]
*  and have some beers and just not stop. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7633.32s)]
*  That allergic reaction to the sensation [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7637.88s)]
*  of finding your medicine. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7640.82s)]
*  I had that reaction. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7643.78s)]
*  I felt whole by putting these things in me [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7646.0199999999995s)]
*  until I had to pay the toll. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7650.0199999999995s)]
*  It's like you steal from Peter, [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7653.58s)]
*  you got to pay Paul the next day [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7655.179999999999s)]
*  and it's a terrible paycheck to write. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7657.0599999999995s)]
*  Terrible paycheck to write. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7660.139999999999s)]
*  I can only imagine. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7661.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7662.84s)]
*  Yeah, it was finding the thing [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7664.139999999999s)]
*  that I thought was gonna make me well, [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7668.46s)]
*  but really it was just killing me. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7671.58s)]
*  And how long were you on that road for? [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7673.9s)]
*  Well, I think I was 27 [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7676.94s)]
*  the first time that I was able to put in the work [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7681.74s)]
*  and get sober. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7685.259999999999s)]
*  And then I went to my young 30s [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7687.3s)]
*  and kind of forgot where I came from [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7690.42s)]
*  and forgot the process of maintaining. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7692.54s)]
*  It's like you get physically fit, [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7695.42s)]
*  it's not gonna be for life. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7698.4s)]
*  You gotta show up or anything else. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7699.5199999999995s)]
*  You're a craft. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7703.7s)]
*  You put it down, it fades. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7704.86s)]
*  So I had put down the craft of sobriety [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7707.099999999999s)]
*  and it opened an opportunity. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7709.639999999999s)]
*  And I ended up going back out there [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7713.0199999999995s)]
*  for a bunch of years, like five years, [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7714.5s)]
*  which was even worse [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7717.099999999999s)]
*  because now I knew that there was a solution [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7718.0199999999995s)]
*  and I was just ignoring it. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7720.86s)]
*  So there was nothing fun about it. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7723.259999999999s)]
*  And then the window came back [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7725.82s)]
*  and I had another chance to commit to sobriety [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7729.62s)]
*  and I did and that was 21 years ago. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7733.5s)]
*  How'd you get sober the first time? [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7735.9s)]
*  So in a way, my best friend died, [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7740.18s)]
*  which did not instigate sobriety. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7743.24s)]
*  Did he die from drugs? [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7745.74s)]
*  He did. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7746.7s)]
*  But it definitely destroyed me emotionally, [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7749.5s)]
*  but I continued to use after he died. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7754.94s)]
*  And then I got to the point [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7758.14s)]
*  where I could not turn off the noise with drugs and alcohol, [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7759.26s)]
*  literally flooding my body with the substance [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7762.34s)]
*  and still wide awake. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7765.860000000001s)]
*  So I was not getting the desired effect. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7768.200000000001s)]
*  I was like, this is terrible. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7770.900000000001s)]
*  Like I'm putting all this poison in me and I'm still here. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7772.3s)]
*  And I called up a friend [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7777.8s)]
*  and rehabs were not a thing at that time. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7780.3s)]
*  I called up a sober friend and I was like, [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7783.46s)]
*  what are those rehab things? [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7786.22s)]
*  I gotta find one. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7787.22s)]
*  He's like, the only one I know of is very expensive, [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7788.860000000001s)]
*  10 grand, which in the 80s for a struggling musician [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7790.700000000001s)]
*  was a lot. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7795.62s)]
*  I was like, I have 10 grand. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7796.46s)]
*  That's exactly how much money I have. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7797.46s)]
*  And I spent it. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7800.26s)]
*  I gave my last 10 grand, my only 10 grand ever [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7801.76s)]
*  to a rehab and I went and I checked in [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7804.900000000001s)]
*  and there was 30 dope fiends in the room [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7808.240000000001s)]
*  of all walks of life, but all with a common sickness. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7812.44s)]
*  And the counselor said, I'm looking at 30 of you [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7817.799999999999s)]
*  and stats wise, one of you is gonna get sober out of here. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7822.2s)]
*  Wow. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7828.96s)]
*  And I was like, get out the way [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7829.799999999999s)]
*  cause I'm taking that spot. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7831.759999999999s)]
*  I was such a little- [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7833.78s)]
*  Competitive. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7835.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's an egomaniac. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7836.5599999999995s)]
*  You know, just like, I am taking that. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7837.879999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7840.5199999999995s)]
*  The rest of you can go back to where you came from. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7841.82s)]
*  Only one out of 30. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7843.62s)]
*  That's what he said to us. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7845.46s)]
*  And there was like a guy from the SWAT team. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7847.06s)]
*  There was professional athlete. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7849.62s)]
*  There was just every variety of person in there. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7851.860000000001s)]
*  I was like, I'll take it. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7855.42s)]
*  But then I realized there was a process to it [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7859.04s)]
*  and there's a being of service aspect to it [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7861.14s)]
*  and there's a becoming humble aspect to it all. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7864.26s)]
*  And that was the beginning of me taking many years [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7868.8s)]
*  to go from being a complete idiot to only a partial idiot. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7872.56s)]
*  So how long is this rehab for? [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7877.52s)]
*  That was a month and it stuck for a long time. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7880.0s)]
*  So you get out. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7885.2s)]
*  Yep. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7886.5s)]
*  Fully clean. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7887.34s)]
*  Did they try to get you to replace that habit [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7888.16s)]
*  with something positive, some sort of a positive habit? [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7891.84s)]
*  So- [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7896.12s)]
*  I've heard that advice before. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7896.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7900.16s)]
*  To get people to try jogging, do yoga. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7901.0s)]
*  No. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7903.84s)]
*  Do something you get addicted to. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7904.68s)]
*  It was more of a, [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7905.52s)]
*  there are lots of things you have to change [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7909.64s)]
*  about the way you're doing business [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7912.16s)]
*  with people in the world, [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7914.08s)]
*  but it's not really a replacement with an activity. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7915.92s)]
*  Prayer and meditation was a part of it. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7919.46s)]
*  Something I had never considered before, [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7921.92s)]
*  getting still and quiet and connecting. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7923.62s)]
*  Being of service was a part of it. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7927.56s)]
*  Taking a look at yourself was a part of it. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7928.4400000000005s)]
*  Admitting your faults was a part of it. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7930.360000000001s)]
*  Making amends was a part of it. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7932.92s)]
*  And being present for the next person [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7935.9400000000005s)]
*  who needs that help was a part of it. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7938.9800000000005s)]
*  So once you kind of get the gist and the gift [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7942.08s)]
*  and the experience of sobriety, [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7945.64s)]
*  when some new bastard shows up who's lost, [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7948.2s)]
*  you have to show up. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7951.4800000000005s)]
*  Because really the language of one addict [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7952.4400000000005s)]
*  talking to another is kind of where the magic happens, [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7955.72s)]
*  as it does when you associate with somebody [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7960.240000000001s)]
*  who only can relate to a very specific experience [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7962.64s)]
*  that you've had. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7965.88s)]
*  You could talk all day long to a normie [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7967.2s)]
*  and they're like, why don't you just put it down? [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7968.72s)]
*  I wish I could, it just doesn't work like that. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7971.52s)]
*  So. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7973.96s)]
*  I've never been addicted to a drug before, [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7974.92s)]
*  but is it like, [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7978.2s)]
*  it's not necessarily physical. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7982.44s)]
*  Right, because once you get the physical out of your system, [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7987.28s)]
*  the mental pull is still there, right? [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7990.54s)]
*  It is physical because it's like an allergy. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7994.12s)]
*  So yeah, you could get rid of the physical addiction, [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=7997.139999999999s)]
*  but then the minute you take that substance, [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8001.4s)]
*  whatever your addiction is, [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8003.5199999999995s)]
*  you react to it differently than a normal person. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8005.679999999999s)]
*  So that's the physical. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8008.799999999999s)]
*  Like a person who's drinking booze, [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8010.3s)]
*  the chemistry is physically different [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8012.76s)]
*  as it hits your bloodstream. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8014.74s)]
*  So you mean like you're naturally more physically addicted. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8018.46s)]
*  Yes. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8022.66s)]
*  And you don't think that has to do with your childhood [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8023.860000000001s)]
*  or with trauma? [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8026.26s)]
*  That's part of it. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8027.1s)]
*  It's part of it. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8027.9400000000005s)]
*  That's part of it. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8028.76s)]
*  So that's what naturally makes you more physically addicted. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8029.6s)]
*  No. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8030.9400000000005s)]
*  So that is the emotional and or spiritual element, [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8031.780000000001s)]
*  but the study that they do on people [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8037.18s)]
*  is that they're trying to make them feel better. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8040.82s)]
*  And that's the way they process alcohol is different. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8042.82s)]
*  The alcoholic. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8046.66s)]
*  So there's a genetic variables. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8047.5s)]
*  Yes, there's a genetic variable. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8049.339999999999s)]
*  So was what alcohol, [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8053.66s)]
*  was that the thing that got you off the wagon again? [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8055.259999999999s)]
*  No. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8061.419999999999s)]
*  Painkillers from a doctor visit. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8064.139999999999s)]
*  With my recovery, it wouldn't have been an issue. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8068.18s)]
*  Did you have a surgery or something like that? [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8071.54s)]
*  I did. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8073.22s)]
*  I had a wicked four tooth surgery. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8074.26s)]
*  And I went in there without my tools [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8081.3s)]
*  or my connection to where I come from. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8084.700000000001s)]
*  I had just kind of forgotten about it. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8087.38s)]
*  Like I'm good. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8088.66s)]
*  I'll live and die sober, but I stopped doing the work. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8089.740000000001s)]
*  And so they give you some sort of a painkiller [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8093.3s)]
*  because of your teeth. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8095.320000000001s)]
*  And I was done. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8097.62s)]
*  And you were right back. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8098.46s)]
*  Done. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8099.299999999999s)]
*  And I've since had all kinds of surgeries. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8100.139999999999s)]
*  No issue. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8102.339999999999s)]
*  And did they put you on painkillers [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8103.78s)]
*  with the other surgeries as well? [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8105.62s)]
*  Yes. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8107.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8107.94s)]
*  But you understand it now. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8108.78s)]
*  Yeah, well, I went in there like, [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8110.42s)]
*  talking to people before I went in [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8112.0599999999995s)]
*  and just, yeah, it's exercise. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8114.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8118.0199999999995s)]
*  My friend Artie Lang, [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8118.86s)]
*  he had some really heavy bouts with drug addiction [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8121.78s)]
*  and he had his nose collapse [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8127.62s)]
*  for a bunch of different reasons. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8131.74s)]
*  One, because he snorted pills that were mixed with glass [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8133.54s)]
*  because someone was crushing the pills up [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8139.259999999999s)]
*  with like a salt shaker and it had glass in it. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8141.74s)]
*  Cut his nose up. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8144.86s)]
*  It got infected. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8145.78s)]
*  And he also got punched out by some guy [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8146.7s)]
*  who was an enforcer for a dealer or a bookie [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8148.62s)]
*  who he owed money to. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8151.54s)]
*  And so his nose, it's collapsed. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8152.86s)]
*  And he was gonna get it fixed, but he can't [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8154.38s)]
*  because he's like, I can't take the risk [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8158.9400000000005s)]
*  of getting back on the painkillers. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8161.78s)]
*  That's a choice I understand. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8167.06s)]
*  Like the payment for going back [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8170.42s)]
*  to where it came from is too great. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8174.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8176.5s)]
*  There are people who can do it. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8178.66s)]
*  Like they go in there with a support. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8180.22s)]
*  Right, with tools. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8182.5s)]
*  And with the connection and doing all of the things [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8184.3s)]
*  that you have to do to be well. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8186.9s)]
*  But I understand his fear. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8189.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8191.58s)]
*  Like to not ever wanna go back to where he came from [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8192.42s)]
*  is a powerful thing. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8194.78s)]
*  It was so hard for him to get sober. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8195.74s)]
*  And last time I talked to him, we did a podcast together [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8197.58s)]
*  and he was so alive. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8200.02s)]
*  He was so sober and he was so funny. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8202.3s)]
*  His fucking stories were so good. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8204.7s)]
*  And he was like, I'm not gonna do it. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8207.46s)]
*  I'm not gonna take that fucking chance. [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8208.98s)]
*  I'd rather have a flat nose. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8210.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8212.18s)]
*  I get it, man. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8213.26s)]
*  I take the flat nose. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8214.1s)]
*  I fucking get it. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8214.94s)]
*  Yep. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8215.78s)]
*  Yeah, oddly enough, a lot of the addicts and alcoholics [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8216.62s)]
*  I know are the most interesting and- [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8219.7s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8223.300000000001s)]
*  It kinda comes with the territory. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8224.140000000001s)]
*  Some of my favorite funny people [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8226.7s)]
*  either used to be addicts or are addicts. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8229.1s)]
*  Yeah, Lenny Bruce. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8231.380000000001s)]

*  Oh yes. Yeah. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8237.34s)]
*  Oh yeah. Yeah. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8238.54s)]
*  Did you ever meet Richard? [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8240.66s)]
*  I met Richard. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8242.26s)]
*  You met Richard. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8243.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I actually worked with Richard [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8244.26s)]
*  for five weeks in a row at the Comedy Store before he died. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8246.98s)]
*  Damn. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8250.619999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8251.46s)]
*  Wheelchair? [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8252.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah. They had to carry him to the stage [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8253.119999999999s)]
*  and they would crank up the microphone [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8255.9s)]
*  and he was really sick at the time. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8259.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8262.58s)]
*  He was on his way out and I was 27. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8263.42s)]
*  I was just getting to Hollywood, [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8266.82s)]
*  just recently a paid regular at the Comedy Store, [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8269.82s)]
*  had no business being on stage with Richard Pryor [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8272.42s)]
*  and he would go on and then I'd go on after him every night. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8275.26s)]
*  Who has business being on stage with Richard Pryor? [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8279.98s)]
*  Nobody, right? [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8282.58s)]
*  He was the reason why I even understood what comedy was. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8284.94s)]
*  When I was 15 years old, [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8289.0s)]
*  my parents took me to see live on the Sunset Strip [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8290.18s)]
*  in the movie theater. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8293.46s)]
*  And I'll never forget. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8295.22s)]
*  Cause I had seen a bunch of great movies like Stripes [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8296.58s)]
*  and fucking all these funny, funny, funny movies. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8300.02s)]
*  I had never laughed so hard [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8302.26s)]
*  as I was laughing at this guy who was just talking. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8304.98s)]
*  And I couldn't imagine that this was, [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8308.06s)]
*  how is this happening? [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8309.62s)]
*  So I'm sitting in the audience [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8311.34s)]
*  and I remember looking around while I was laughing [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8312.62s)]
*  and people are falling out of their chairs, [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8315.74s)]
*  they're throwing their arms up in the air, [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8317.62s)]
*  they couldn't breathe. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8319.5s)]
*  And I was like, this is amazing. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8320.5s)]
*  All this guy's doing is talking. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8322.02s)]
*  And that planted the seed in my mind [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8324.380000000001s)]
*  about what standup comedy is. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8327.0s)]
*  I never considered doing it at the time. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8329.94s)]
*  I was just like, this is incredible. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8331.54s)]
*  And I became like this giant fan of standup comedy [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8333.74s)]
*  from that moment. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8336.9s)]
*  And then I started listening to his old albums [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8338.380000000001s)]
*  and I started listening to all sorts of different, [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8341.220000000001s)]
*  Cheech and Chong and Bill Cosby [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8344.1s)]
*  and all these different like standup comedy albums. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8346.1s)]
*  Those good records. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8348.86s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8349.7s)]
*  And that was sort of like the beginning of my obsession [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8351.06s)]
*  with the art of standup comedy. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8355.94s)]
*  Was that one time seeing him in the movie theater [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8357.48s)]
*  when I was a 15 year old kid. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8360.08s)]
*  So for me to be sharing the stage with him 12 years later [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8362.0s)]
*  was nuts. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8365.56s)]
*  Just nuts. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8367.0s)]
*  Was he still funny? [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8368.48s)]
*  Unfortunately, no. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8370.48s)]
*  No. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8371.52s)]
*  No, he was, it was sad. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8372.34s)]
*  It was sad and the audience was super bummed out. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8374.6s)]
*  And so I would have to like kind of like revive the crowd [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8377.64s)]
*  as best I could. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8381.24s)]
*  Because he was gone. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8383.68s)]
*  He was medicated and he was also drinking. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8385.12s)]
*  So he was drinking and he was medicated [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8387.8s)]
*  and they'd have to crank the microphone. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8389.84s)]
*  So he would go on and say, you hear. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8392.4s)]
*  Because the mic was just cranked [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8396.48s)]
*  because his voice was so soft. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8398.16s)]
*  In a way he kind of earned the right to go out like that. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8400.64s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8403.12s)]
*  I mean, five weeks of unfunny Richard. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8404.34s)]
*  I'll take it. [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8408.92s)]
*  I'm sure he had his moments. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8409.76s)]
*  There was some moments where he got some laughs [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8411.6s)]
*  but for the most part you would go on stage afterwards [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8413.72s)]
*  and people would look at me like this, [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8416.84s)]
*  like fuck, like what did we just see? [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8418.88s)]
*  They were coming to see Richard Pryor, [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8421.619999999999s)]
*  their hero in comedy. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8423.359999999999s)]
*  And they got to see a great artist at the end of his line. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8424.96s)]
*  My jam with Richard was everything but Long Beach. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8430.679999999998s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8433.8s)]
*  That's my jam. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8434.76s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8435.599999999999s)]
*  When that guy came up to take a picture [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8436.439999999999s)]
*  at the beginning of the show, [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8439.24s)]
*  it was like, hey motherfucker, what are you doing? [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8440.06s)]
*  People are coming to their seats as he's on stage. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8442.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8445.52s)]
*  Like he's on stage and people are, [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8446.36s)]
*  he's filming his comedy special [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8448.400000000001s)]
*  as people are walking in and sitting down. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8451.16s)]
*  Amazing. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8454.2s)]
*  Priceless. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8455.04s)]
*  Oh my God, and it's a great special too. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8455.86s)]
*  It's a fucking classic special. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8457.2s)]
*  That's a good one. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8459.78s)]
*  I performed in that very same place. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8460.7s)]
*  That's all I could think of was a man, Richard Pryor. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8462.720000000001s)]
*  He did a special here and there's only a few. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8466.2s)]
*  He only has a few specials. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8469.76s)]
*  It's a very small handful. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8471.44s)]
*  Some of the great ones are, [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8472.960000000001s)]
*  there's cassettes that are available [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8475.24s)]
*  that you can now get on YouTube [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8476.74s)]
*  of him performing at Red Fox Comedy Club. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8478.36s)]
*  Red Fox had a comedy club in Los Angeles. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8481.880000000001s)]
*  Sold Out. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8483.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8484.560000000001s)]
*  Called Sold Out. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8485.4s)]
*  And he performed there. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8486.220000000001s)]
*  I think it was just called Red Fox Comedy Club, wasn't it? [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8488.04s)]
*  Maybe it was. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8490.52s)]
*  No, I think he's had a few. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8491.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8493.36s)]
*  And I think Red Fox turned into Sold Out. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8494.2s)]
*  But I bought the cassettes at a gas station. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8495.720000000001s)]
*  I was at like a truck stop one place [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8498.0s)]
*  and they had cassettes. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8500.32s)]
*  And I was like, what is this? [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8501.96s)]
*  And they were just like raw recordings. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8504.22s)]
*  You could hear the clink of ice cubes in the glass [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8507.36s)]
*  and you could hear people in the crowd [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8510.44s)]
*  and he was just riffing and talking shit. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8511.72s)]
*  And it was amazing. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8514.24s)]
*  And so, I mean, some of his great work is not on video. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8515.84s)]
*  Some of his great work is really like cassettes. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8519.4s)]
*  Do you have those cassettes? [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8523.16s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8524.18s)]
*  You have those cassettes. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8525.02s)]
*  You're taking good care of those cassettes? [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8525.86s)]
*  I've got a lot of his stuff. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8527.72s)]
*  Did you digitize those? [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8528.56s)]
*  Did you digitize those cassettes? [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8529.8s)]
*  Well, I've got digital copies of some of them. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8531.039999999999s)]
*  You can still buy a lot of them. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8534.68s)]
*  You can still buy a lot of them online too, which is great. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8536.56s)]
*  You know, that's a beautiful thing about today. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8539.96s)]
*  Like someone could tell you about a great song [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8541.64s)]
*  or a great album and you can just go on your phone [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8544.359999999999s)]
*  and get it. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8546.84s)]
*  Yes. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8547.68s)]
*  Like that. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8548.5s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8549.34s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8550.18s)]
*  So we have a song. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8551.02s)]
*  We wrote 50 some odd songs during the pandemic. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8553.039999999999s)]
*  Oh wow. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8559.04s)]
*  50. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8560.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8561.2s)]
*  It was fun. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8562.2s)]
*  It was easy. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8563.12s)]
*  It was magic. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8563.960000000001s)]
*  When the world shuts down [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8566.92s)]
*  and you have your gang together to write, [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8568.84s)]
*  it was a special moment. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8572.240000000002s)]
*  But one of the songs, [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8574.0s)]
*  which did not make it onto either of our double records, [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8575.960000000001s)]
*  is called The Comedy Store. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8579.640000000001s)]
*  And I knew it wasn't the most like original title [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8583.0s)]
*  or anything like that. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8587.44s)]
*  But I have my connection to comedy [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8588.28s)]
*  and John Franchante has a deep love for standup comedy. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8590.800000000001s)]
*  He re-inspired my love for standup comedy [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8595.28s)]
*  when I met him in the late 80s. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8597.880000000001s)]
*  And so the Comedy Store song is kind of an ode to standup [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8600.84s)]
*  and the joy of like, you know, [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8607.42s)]
*  sneaking in the back door of a club and catching a set [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8608.980000000001s)]
*  and all these different little Hollywood references. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8612.28s)]
*  But the chorus spoke to Dave Chappelle, [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8615.800000000001s)]
*  who I love and admire. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8618.92s)]
*  As a human being, we're all full of everything. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8621.0s)]
*  But to me, he is, you know, [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8625.32s)]
*  kind of the reigning king of standup. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8626.800000000001s)]
*  And I love a lot of comedians, [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8631.68s)]
*  but that's, he's somebody who I can just listen to. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8633.0s)]
*  And the lyric did not sit well with everybody involved. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8636.4s)]
*  So sadly that song sits dormant, [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8642.56s)]
*  not yet on a record. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8645.04s)]
*  But I'm hoping that the energy will shift [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8647.2s)]
*  to the point where we can put out that song. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8650.64s)]
*  What was wrong with the lyric? [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8652.4s)]
*  In my opinion, it was beautiful. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8655.2s)]
*  And, you know, we're also full of greatness [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8657.28s)]
*  and fallibility and mistakes and accomplishments. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8662.2s)]
*  And so the lyric was Dave Chappelle for President. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8665.84s)]
*  And it's in a really beautiful melody. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8670.12s)]
*  And it's a very lighthearted statement. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8672.44s)]
*  But because, you know, there's kind of that tradition [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8675.56s)]
*  of campaign banners where it's like WC Fields for President. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8678.36s)]
*  And it just kind of fit into the chorus, [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8685.56s)]
*  Dave Chappelle for President. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8689.56s)]
*  I wasn't like making a serious statement. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8692.24s)]
*  It was just like- [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8694.48s)]
*  Oh, I see what you're saying. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8695.32s)]
*  So it was during the time of all of his controversy. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8696.32s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8699.24s)]
*  But the song is so flotacious and groovy and laid back. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8701.320000000002s)]
*  And you might just feel like you're in the mountains [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8706.44s)]
*  listening to the song. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8708.640000000001s)]
*  So someday I'll share it with you, [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8710.76s)]
*  whether it gets released or not. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8712.6s)]
*  I'll trade you a copy of that song for a copy [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8714.880000000001s)]
*  of one of your Richard Pryor cassettes. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8717.6s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8720.16s)]
*  Beautiful. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8721.400000000001s)]
*  I'll send you those in the email. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8722.220000000001s)]
*  They're available. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8723.84s)]
*  A lot of them are available online. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8725.76s)]
*  You know, the Red Fox ones. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8727.6s)]
*  They're fucking great, man. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8729.04s)]
*  Because you get to see them experiment. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8730.52s)]
*  You know, that's one of the joys of the internet today. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8732.4s)]
*  Back when I was a kid, I mean, [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8735.72s)]
*  you had to find those at a truck stop. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8737.0s)]
*  You know, now you can just find them like that online. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8739.56s)]
*  It's like there's a beautiful thing about that. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8743.64s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of, some of it's kind of fucked [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8745.84s)]
*  because like the magic of discovering this thing [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8748.359999999999s)]
*  is not there anymore. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8751.24s)]
*  You know, because now it's available instantaneously, [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8752.92s)]
*  but still it's better that way. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8755.439999999999s)]
*  It's different. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8758.08s)]
*  It's different. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8759.039999999999s)]
*  But it can reach more people. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8760.16s)]
*  That's what I like about it. [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8761.96s)]
*  If that's the goal, then yes, for sure it's more successful. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8762.92s)]
*  But I don't even mean more successful because he's gone. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8766.759999999998s)]
*  I mean, like right now, people listening can go [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8769.519999999999s)]
*  and one of them was called playing craps. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8773.599999999999s)]
*  Was it called craps? [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8775.56s)]
*  Something like that. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8778.199999999999s)]
*  I forget what it's called. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8779.199999999999s)]
*  But that someone can listen to this [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8781.08s)]
*  and then go on YouTube and then bam, they can get it. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8785.439999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8787.839999999998s)]
*  And then they can go and listen to this craps. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8788.68s)]
*  Ooh. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8790.2s)]
*  After hours. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8791.04s)]
*  Ooh, I like the cover. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8791.86s)]
*  It's fucking great. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8792.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8794.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8794.84s)]
*  I'm in, I'm sold. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8797.28s)]
*  How many minutes is that, Jamie? [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8798.52s)]
*  32 minutes? [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8800.44s)]
*  That's a great poster. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8801.28s)]
*  I'll put that up in my bedroom. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8802.64s)]
*  Yeah, 36 minutes. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8804.4s)]
*  It's fucking great. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8805.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8806.880000000001s)]
*  And this is, you know, probably it's put online. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8807.92s)]
*  Somebody put it online in 2011. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8811.68s)]
*  They probably put it online after we talked about it [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8813.4s)]
*  because we talked about it way back then for sure [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8815.800000000001s)]
*  because I talked about how great it was [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8817.92s)]
*  just to be listening to these live recordings [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8819.28s)]
*  from these comedy clubs. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8821.64s)]
*  It is a great thing. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8822.48s)]
*  It's 71, 1971. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8823.76s)]
*  There is something about the process of seeking out [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8825.36s)]
*  and searching and putting in the due diligence to find that [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8830.16s)]
*  or to show up to the show or go to the record store [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8834.32s)]
*  that made it all a bit more cool. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8839.4s)]
*  Right. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8841.48s)]
*  Then now you just tap that button and it's there. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8842.4s)]
*  So yeah, you're reaching a larger audience. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8846.24s)]
*  I think you said it right. [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8848.64s)]
*  I think it's different. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8849.72s)]
*  It's different. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8850.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8851.52s)]
*  It's not better or worse, right? [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8852.36s)]
*  It's different. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8853.76s)]
*  Same with Rock and Roll. [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8854.6s)]
*  What was it like for you guys when all of that, [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8858.48s)]
*  the streaming thing, when it all came to be with Napster [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8863.68s)]
*  and there was this big uproar, [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8867.64s)]
*  how did you guys, how did you feel about that [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8870.08s)]
*  when all that was going on? [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8872.6s)]
*  Because that was the giant shift, right? [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8873.44s)]
*  Napster was the great shift when the internet [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8875.2s)]
*  sort of realized like, oh, we can just get this stuff [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8877.32s)]
*  for free. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8880.16s)]
*  And then some people were furious about it. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8881.68s)]
*  Like I interviewed Paul Stanley from Kiss once [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8884.44s)]
*  and he was like, man, it's stealing. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8888.76s)]
*  You're fucking stealing my music. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8890.44s)]
*  And I was like, wow, that's an interesting way [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8892.92s)]
*  of looking at it. [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8894.52s)]
*  Because some people didn't think of it that way at all. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8896.28s)]
*  They thought of it like, well, this is a way my fans [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8899.24s)]
*  can get my music easier. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8901.96s)]
*  If you really want to support me and you like the music, [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8904.84s)]
*  go buy the CD too. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8906.880000000001s)]
*  But I'm happy you got it. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8908.68s)]
*  I did not have time or energy to even care about it. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8911.76s)]
*  My focus was so just wanting to make good music [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8915.880000000001s)]
*  and put in the effort that whatever happened to it [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8921.36s)]
*  afterwards, I didn't even care. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8924.64s)]
*  You guys had already made so much money [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8927.24s)]
*  selling actual physical records by then, right? [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8928.800000000001s)]
*  What year did Napster happen? [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8932.28s)]
*  I want to say it was like 99-ish, is that it? [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8933.68s)]
*  I think we made our lion's share of cash flow in the 2000s. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8938.56s)]
*  Really? [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8942.56s)]
*  I think so. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8943.039999999999s)]
*  Well, people were still 100% still buying CDs. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8943.68s)]
*  Yes. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8946.68s)]
*  And when did it die? [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8947.279999999999s)]
*  Ten years ago? [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8950.199999999999s)]
*  Ten years ago. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8951.16s)]
*  Ish. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8951.8s)]
*  I didn't care. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8952.92s)]
*  Napster didn't bother me. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8953.64s)]
*  It was like, if that's what's happening, that's happening. [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8956.519999999999s)]
*  Really, I just wanted to be a good band member [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8958.84s)]
*  and a productive bandmate and do our thing [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8962.12s)]
*  and go play live, which you can't replicate. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8965.68s)]
*  Right. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8968.52s)]
*  That's the thing that kind of kept us alive, [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8969.4s)]
*  even when record sales disappeared. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8971.2s)]
*  Right. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8974.039999999999s)]
*  When we go play live, people show up. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8975.6s)]
*  Right. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8977.48s)]
*  I wasn't worried about the money, [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8979.56s)]
*  but I think even if that had happened earlier [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8980.84s)]
*  when I was less financially capable, I don't care. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8984.0s)]
*  We were never in it for the money. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8989.56s)]
*  The money was a bonus. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8990.8s)]
*  You would just be like, well, this is how it is now. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8993.8s)]
*  This is how it is now. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8995.88s)]
*  We didn't miss a beat. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8997.039999999999s)]
*  We never wasted a moment. [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=8998.88s)]
*  A lot of people who are more commerce-oriented [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9001.599999999999s)]
*  fought tooth and nail. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9006.56s)]
*  This can't happen. [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9008.16s)]
*  And yeah, there's probably some injustices going on. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9009.359999999999s)]
*  And there were corporations are taking advantage [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9012.039999999999s)]
*  of those opportunities. [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9014.8s)]
*  I don't have that much time and space [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9018.48s)]
*  to devote to fighting, though. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9020.76s)]
*  I'd rather spend my time and energy making something good. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9023.24s)]
*  Good for you, man. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9027.6s)]
*  That's just a great attitude. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9028.359999999999s)]
*  Because I didn't disagree with how Lars Ulrich felt about it. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9030.64s)]
*  I understood what he was saying. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9035.96s)]
*  But I was like, man, that's a bad look. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9037.96s)]
*  It's just like you're so wealthy and so successful. [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9040.8s)]
*  And the people that are downloading your music for free [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9044.439999999999s)]
*  are your fucking fans. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9046.56s)]
*  And a lot of them are poor. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9047.88s)]
*  And now they can get it. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9050.119999999999s)]
*  And they can get it right away. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9051.96s)]
*  And for you to call them thieves and get angry [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9053.24s)]
*  and tell people not to do it, man, [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9056.92s)]
*  this is a new disruptive technology. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9058.8s)]
*  And you're not going to stop it. [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9062.279999999999s)]
*  Definitely not. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9064.08s)]
*  And I think some people, maybe some older folks who [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9064.92s)]
*  weren't in tune with the new internet, [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9068.24s)]
*  they thought somehow or another you were going to stop it. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9071.56s)]
*  I was like, man, you don't understand this genie. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9074.839999999998s)]
*  Because that bottle, that cork is off that bottle. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9077.56s)]
*  And this whole thing is the future, man. [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9080.359999999999s)]
*  It's going to change for everybody with everything, [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9082.279999999999s)]
*  whether it's with movies, with everything you could imagine. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9085.119999999999s)]
*  It's all going to be available now. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9089.119999999999s)]
*  And people that fought it were really just losing ground. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9091.439999999999s)]
*  So our record company, Warner Brothers, [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9095.24s)]
*  were very slow to recognize the power of the internet. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9097.68s)]
*  And they got hurt. [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9102.32s)]
*  And so we just put out a record a couple of days ago. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9105.96s)]
*  And another double record in the same year, [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9110.88s)]
*  which is kind of a beautiful thing. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9114.919999999998s)]
*  But the main guy from the record company showed up. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9116.64s)]
*  Very lovely dude, cares about music, super into the band. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9119.919999999998s)]
*  And I was like, well, we have to make sure that this doesn't leak. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9124.24s)]
*  This is two weeks ago. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9127.519999999999s)]
*  And he's like, well, we've kind of changed our tune on that lately. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9129.199999999999s)]
*  If it leaks, it leaks. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9134.6s)]
*  So even these gigantic behemoth companies are now like, OK. [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9136.720000000001s)]
*  So it leaked. [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9142.68s)]
*  Just makes it more popular. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9144.76s)]
*  More people tell people about it. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9146.76s)]
*  I don't care. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9148.960000000001s)]
*  Good for you, man. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9150.0s)]
*  I just want people to hear it. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9151.640000000001s)]
*  I believe that from you. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9154.52s)]
*  Some people would say that, I go, he fucking cares. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9156.800000000001s)]
*  For you, I really, really believe it. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9159.720000000001s)]
*  It's easy for me to say I'm not missing meals. [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9162.28s)]
*  But yeah. [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9166.560000000001s)]
*  I don't expect to sell records these days. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9168.800000000001s)]
*  That's not an expectation. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9171.720000000001s)]
*  There was a time when I did. [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9173.12s)]
*  But now I feel like music is made just to be played. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9175.36s)]
*  We get paid at our live shows. [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9179.400000000001s)]
*  We're doing just fine. [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9182.6s)]
*  Well, it was sold out the other day. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9184.24s)]
*  Zilker Park, it was fucking awesome. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9185.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's an institution. [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9187.880000000001s)]
*  So I think that sells out no matter what. [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9189.640000000001s)]
*  Well, you guys are an institution. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9192.2s)]
*  You were one of those guys when I first met you. [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9197.68s)]
*  I was like, oh, shit, he's right there. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9199.44s)]
*  It was weird. [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9201.56s)]
*  When was that? [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9202.039999999999s)]
*  I don't remember. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9203.24s)]
*  I don't know if we met. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9203.92s)]
*  Our kids went to school together. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9205.44s)]
*  I don't know if we met there for the first time [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9207.2s)]
*  or if we met at the UFC for the first time. [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9210.44s)]
*  I don't remember. [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9212.2s)]
*  I feel like I met you in an arena early in the day [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9212.92s)]
*  for some fights. [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9216.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9217.84s)]
*  And I was like, that guy's a UFC fan. [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9218.64s)]
*  That's wild. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9221.52s)]
*  It was weird. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9222.8s)]
*  I was like, I thought you liked this. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9223.6s)]
*  And you are. [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9225.48s)]
*  This super peaceful kind of hippie guy. [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9226.08s)]
*  And for you to be really into the UFC. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9228.72s)]
*  But then when we talked about it, I got it. [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9231.24s)]
*  Because you really respected the athletes [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9233.72s)]
*  and the difficulty of what they're doing [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9237.68s)]
*  and how tremendous the whole promotion was [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9240.16s)]
*  and the way they would put these fights together [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9244.6s)]
*  and the excitement of it all. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9246.76s)]
*  They're good. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9247.96s)]
*  That's a good promotion. [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9249.24s)]
*  They're the best. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9250.68s)]
*  I adore combat sports. [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9251.44s)]
*  I adored boxing when I was a kid. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9255.36s)]
*  Bruce Lee was everything to me in 1974. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9258.12s)]
*  Everything. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9262.24s)]
*  I built Noon Chucks out of a broom. [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9264.2s)]
*  Put them in my back pocket, went to school. [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9267.2s)]
*  And the evolution of mixed martial arts [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9270.48s)]
*  is divine and one of the most exciting things [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9274.76s)]
*  that's ever happened to me in my lifetime. [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9277.56s)]
*  Like talk about lucky to be born at a certain time and place. [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9280.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9285.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9285.880000000001s)]
*  It's exquisite. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9287.12s)]
*  And the funny thing is fighting outside of a ring or a cage [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9289.44s)]
*  or a mat, it crushes my heart. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9293.16s)]
*  Like violence in real life kills me. [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9297.24s)]
*  Like pain. [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9300.76s)]
*  Put it in, like dedicate your life to the art [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9304.0s)]
*  and it becomes a chess match. [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9307.04s)]
*  All day, every day. [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9310.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9312.08s)]
*  I'm a super fan. [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9312.68s)]
*  I agree. [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9313.720000000001s)]
*  I'm not really a big fan of fist fights. [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9314.28s)]
*  No. [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9317.12s)]
*  Fist fights in the street. [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9317.800000000001s)]
*  I'm like, god, don't do that. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9318.800000000001s)]
*  Don't do that. [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9320.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's just like there's nothing in there for you. [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9320.880000000001s)]
*  Don't do it. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9322.76s)]
*  And it's like just bravado and nonsense. [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9323.6s)]
*  But what I call fighting, I call it high level problem solving [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9328.2s)]
*  with dire physical consequences. [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9332.640000000001s)]
*  And that's really what it is. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9335.12s)]
*  To me, it's just like this ultimately exciting endeavor. [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9336.48s)]
*  And I love it when someone like you appreciates it. [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9340.439999999999s)]
*  It was very exciting for me to see you there, [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9343.92s)]
*  because I was a giant fan of chili peppers [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9346.0s)]
*  and to see that you actually appreciate it. [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9348.76s)]
*  You weren't just a guy there for a scene. [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9352.4s)]
*  Because there's a lot of people that go there, [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9355.279999999999s)]
*  they're just there for an event, which is great. [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9357.039999999999s)]
*  Fine. [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9359.4s)]
*  It's a great event. [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9359.92s)]
*  It's wild to see. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9361.64s)]
*  But you actually were asking questions [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9362.96s)]
*  and you were really into it. [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9365.4s)]
*  Still am. [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9367.56s)]
*  It does not fade. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9368.72s)]
*  I watched Alexa point out her victory two nights ago last night. [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9371.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Alexa Grosso. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9376.16s)]
*  She's a beast. [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9377.64s)]
*  She's a beast and she gets better with every fight. [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9378.44s)]
*  I don't know that she's ready for Shevchenko. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9383.359999999999s)]
*  I don't know if anybody is. [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9385.72s)]
*  That lady's a goddamn assassin. [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9387.119999999999s)]
*  No, we're not ready for that. [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9388.52s)]
*  She's wild. [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9390.44s)]
*  But I love Alexa's trajectory. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9391.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9393.359999999999s)]
*  No, it's an exciting, exciting time, man. [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9393.960000000001s)]
*  It's amazing what the sport has become. [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9396.72s)]
*  From when I first watched it in 93 or 94, [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9400.6s)]
*  I think was the first event that I saw. [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9404.04s)]
*  I've been working for them now. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9406.6s)]
*  I've been working as a commentator for 20 years. [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9409.04s)]
*  And before that, for two years, I [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9414.2s)]
*  was a post-fight interviewer in the late 90s, rather. [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9416.960000000001s)]
*  97. [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9421.08s)]
*  Amazing. [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9422.68s)]
*  I saw that first UFC event, compliments [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9423.32s)]
*  of Guy O'Seary, who had a cable box. [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9427.48s)]
*  And he called me up on a landline [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9431.16s)]
*  and said, there's a no-holds-barred fighting [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9432.72s)]
*  competition of one art form against another. [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9437.0s)]
*  And it happened in 30 minutes. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9440.84s)]
*  Get over to my house. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9442.119999999999s)]
*  And we sat on the couch and watched that. [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9444.039999999999s)]
*  And I was like, that's interesting. [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9445.8s)]
*  1993. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9447.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9449.119999999999s)]
*  Shout out to Horian Gracie and Hoyce Gracie. [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9449.6s)]
*  Because back then, it was one against another, [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9452.76s)]
*  like karate versus jujitsu, or shooto boxing versus a bouncer, [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9455.32s)]
*  whatever. [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9463.68s)]
*  Obviously, it's come a long way. [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9465.04s)]
*  Well, there's not really a sport that's evolved that much [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9466.960000000001s)]
*  since 1993 to 2022, where it's unrecognizable, [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9470.4s)]
*  the difference between the sport then and the sport now. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9475.12s)]
*  It's unrecognizable. [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9479.28s)]
*  It's so much different. [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9481.28s)]
*  There's never been a thing like that, [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9484.12s)]
*  where you get the chance to see a complete evolution [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9486.76s)]
*  of combat sports. [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9491.12s)]
*  Martial arts have evolved more since 1993 [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9492.400000000001s)]
*  than they have in the last 10,000 years. [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9495.6s)]
*  And that is 100% undeniable fact. [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9498.2s)]
*  Pretty exciting. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9502.28s)]
*  It's very exciting. [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9503.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9504.68s)]
*  It's very exciting. [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9505.44s)]
*  I get excited when I run into somebody [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9506.24s)]
*  on the street who watched the fights the night before. [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9508.12s)]
*  Because I'll sit there for 30 minutes and go over it. [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9511.04s)]
*  And yeah. [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9515.12s)]
*  To this day, I'm excited about it. [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9516.52s)]
*  To this day, me and Dana White, sometimes I'll [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9518.4s)]
*  call him at like 1 o'clock in the morning. [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9521.04s)]
*  And he and I will have a two-hour conversation [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9523.72s)]
*  about fights, just two hours. [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9527.08s)]
*  That's fun. [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9529.12s)]
*  About this and that. [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9529.64s)]
*  I mean, we should be so jaded. [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9530.52s)]
*  No. [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9532.84s)]
*  We've both been involved for so long. [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9533.24s)]
*  It's the opposite. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9534.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9535.76s)]
*  It's amazing. [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9536.96s)]
*  Yep. [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9537.64s)]
*  I love it. [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9538.14s)]
*  I love what you do for the sport. [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9539.320000000002s)]
*  Nobody does it better. [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9542.720000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9544.2s)]
*  And I love what Dana does for the sport. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9545.04s)]
*  He's the best. [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9547.0s)]
*  Nobody does it better. [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9547.640000000001s)]
*  He's the best. [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9548.6s)]
*  He's the best front man that any sport's ever had. [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9549.2s)]
*  I think so. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9551.24s)]
*  And he takes so much grief and gets so much hate. [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9552.12s)]
*  And he's done things that I am not down with. [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9556.320000000002s)]
*  I hate politics and sports. [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9559.52s)]
*  I'd rather keep them separate, like church and state. [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9561.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9564.12s)]
*  But I don't care. [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9565.12s)]
*  He has given the world joy. [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9565.84s)]
*  And he's given opportunities and jobs for so many athletes. [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9570.56s)]
*  People ignore the fact that he has given tens of thousands [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9574.8s)]
*  of people a dream and houses and food on the table. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9579.08s)]
*  It's endless. [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9584.68s)]
*  I look at all these fighters. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9585.84s)]
*  Fighter pay is an issue. [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9587.56s)]
*  Yeah, I want fighters to get paid. [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9589.28s)]
*  I know thousands that live in houses that would not normally [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9592.04s)]
*  be able to do that because Dana works his ass off. [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9595.32s)]
*  And he loves it. [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9599.36s)]
*  And he cares. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9600.0s)]
*  And he's relentless. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9600.52s)]
*  And he put in the years. [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9601.32s)]
*  So so many props to him for bringing those dreams to life. [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9604.44s)]
*  And I feel like I have to balance out [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9609.56s)]
*  some of the hate he gets. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9613.96s)]
*  Yeah, well, he's going to get hate no matter what you do. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9615.279999999999s)]
*  You're a person in a position like he's in, [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9617.84s)]
*  position of prominence. [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9620.6s)]
*  And whether or not the criticism is valid, [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9622.36s)]
*  what is valid is the praise. [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9625.320000000002s)]
*  When I introduce him, when I do the weigh-ins, [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9627.68s)]
*  I always say, without him, none of this would be possible. [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9630.160000000002s)]
*  Because it's true. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9633.76s)]
*  I know what that guy's done. [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9634.720000000001s)]
*  I know the work that he's put in. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9636.28s)]
*  I know how hard he's worked. [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9637.68s)]
*  And also, he's a guy who doesn't bow down to bullshit. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9639.2s)]
*  He doesn't back off. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9643.68s)]
*  And he kept that sport alive during the pandemic. [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9645.480000000001s)]
*  When everybody was saying, you're crazy. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9649.640000000001s)]
*  You're going to kill people. [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9651.76s)]
*  We're all going to die. [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9653.04s)]
*  He was like, what the fuck are you talking about? [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9654.800000000001s)]
*  We're going to test everybody. [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9656.04s)]
*  And we're going to put on fucking safe shows. [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9657.6s)]
*  We're going to create a COVID bubble. [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9659.84s)]
*  We're going to make sure everybody's safe. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9661.52s)]
*  And he did it. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9663.48s)]
*  And he did it, and then everybody else followed suit. [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9665.04s)]
*  Yes, we got the Apex Center. [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9667.24s)]
*  Well, the Apex Center was actually already in construction. [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9668.4s)]
*  In construction, but we got fight nights. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9670.800000000001s)]
*  Fight nights. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9673.16s)]
*  We got to see some world championship fights [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9673.92s)]
*  at the Apex Center, which were fucking incredible. [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9675.960000000001s)]
*  Stipe Miocic versus Francis Ngannou. [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9678.04s)]
*  Ngannou won the world title at the Apex Center. [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9680.32s)]
*  Tough night for Stipe. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9683.48s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9684.560000000001s)]
*  I don't think the hair helped his cause. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9685.880000000001s)]
*  He came out there with the fluffy hairdo. [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9688.68s)]
*  I was like, no. [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9690.4s)]
*  I don't think that had anything to do with it. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9692.76s)]
*  I think it was Francis had developed skills [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9694.880000000001s)]
*  to match with his power. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9697.92s)]
*  And he also developed patience. [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9700.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9702.24s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9702.92s)]
*  The hair threw me off. [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9704.4s)]
*  I was like, you're facing Francis. [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9706.08s)]
*  Come in with a buzz cut. [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9708.880000000001s)]
*  Well, he beat him the first time. [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9711.24s)]
*  And he was the first guy to beat him. [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9713.2s)]
*  Cardio wrestling. [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9715.44s)]
*  Cardio wrestling and his chin. [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9717.0s)]
*  And I think he took some tremendous shots in that fight. [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9718.960000000001s)]
*  And I think that fight, sometimes you win a fight, [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9723.52s)]
*  but you take an amount of punishment [[02:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9726.800000000001s)]
*  that will change who you are. [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9731.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9734.04s)]
*  It'll show up in the next fight. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9734.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9735.800000000001s)]
*  It'll change who you are for the future. [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9736.560000000001s)]
*  And you just don't get through a five round fight [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9738.400000000001s)]
*  with Francis Ngannou without taking some tremendous shots. [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9741.68s)]
*  They're talking about him fighting John Jones now, [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9747.32s)]
*  which is going to be very interesting. [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9749.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9750.720000000001s)]
*  If the Stipe fight falls through with John. [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9751.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9755.32s)]
*  Well, that's what I was saying. [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9755.800000000001s)]
*  John Jones and Stipe. [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9756.68s)]
*  They're talking about John Stipe. [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9757.68s)]
*  Oh, yes, yes. [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9758.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9759.44s)]
*  Great fight. [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9759.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9760.52s)]
*  Competitive fight. [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9760.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9761.64s)]
*  Well, it's going to be interesting, [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9762.32s)]
*  because we haven't seen John in a long time. [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9763.800000000001s)]
*  And now John is huge. [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9765.84s)]
*  He is? [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9767.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9768.16s)]
*  Power lifter? [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9768.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9769.6s)]
*  He's fucking put on a lot of muscle. [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9770.12s)]
*  But he's done it smart, taking his time. [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9771.64s)]
*  And I mean, he's got probably one of the highest fight [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9775.0s)]
*  IQs the sport's ever seen. [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9778.279999999999s)]
*  He does? [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9779.64s)]
*  So I'm excited to see that. [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9780.4s)]
*  If he was fighting Francis, that would [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9781.92s)]
*  be a little more concerned. [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9783.64s)]
*  But I feel like Stipe is older. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9785.279999999999s)]
*  And that, to me, seems like a competitive fight. [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9788.0s)]
*  Well, I have a feeling it'll be one or the other. [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9790.88s)]
*  I don't know when it's going to go down. [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9793.76s)]
*  I don't know when that fight is going to happen. [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9795.8s)]
*  I don't know when John's going to make his heavyweight debut. [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9797.359999999999s)]
*  But I'm very interested. [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9799.68s)]
*  I'm very interested. [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9801.16s)]
*  Whether I'm there for that fight or not, I am watching. [[02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9803.24s)]
*  Of course. [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9805.48s)]
*  Of course. [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9806.119999999999s)]
*  Look at this. [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9806.84s)]
*  John Jones still hopeful to make heavyweight debut at UFC 282. [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9807.4s)]
*  82. [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9810.2s)]
*  What is 282? [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9811.68s)]
*  Is that December? [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9812.32s)]
*  Yes. [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9813.08s)]
*  December 10? [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9813.58s)]
*  December 10. [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9814.08s)]
*  So I think the headliner in that is Glover Deshara's rematch [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9815.28s)]
*  with Yuri Prochaska. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9818.76s)]
*  That it? [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9820.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9821.2s)]
*  That'll be a good one. [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9822.039999999999s)]
*  You going to be there? [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9823.68s)]
*  You on tour still? [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9825.039999999999s)]
*  I'm off tour. [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9826.119999999999s)]
*  And I'm moving to the Hawaiian Islands for November, December. [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9827.2s)]
*  Are you really? [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9831.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9831.84s)]
*  I need to go be on a mountain as an island. [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9832.68s)]
*  I get it. [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9835.8s)]
*  I have to unplug for a minute and just get in the ocean. [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9836.8s)]
*  Which island? [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9839.24s)]
*  I never met a Hawaiian island I didn't like. [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9841.039999999999s)]
*  But I will be on Kauai. [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9844.4s)]
*  Kauai is supposed to be amazing. [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9846.24s)]
*  It's all right. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9847.8s)]
*  It's good. [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9848.56s)]
*  Where Laird and Gabby live. [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9849.88s)]
*  That's right. [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9852.0s)]
*  Shout out to them. [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9852.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9853.84s)]
*  They're my neighbors. [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9854.2s)]
*  Oh, nice. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9855.24s)]
*  They've always been very good to me. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9855.64s)]
*  They're great people. [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9856.96s)]
*  They've been very good. [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9858.039999999999s)]
*  I love them both. [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9858.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9859.12s)]
*  They're amazing people. [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9859.8s)]
*  Yeah, they really are. [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9861.0s)]
*  They're stunners. [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9861.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9863.44s)]
*  Yep. [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9863.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9864.88s)]
*  So sadly, if I was anywhere in the mainland, [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9866.48s)]
*  I would be at a bunch of these fights. [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9870.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9872.92s)]
*  But I have to go. [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9873.52s)]
*  I get it. [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9874.92s)]
*  Yeah, I miss being at the fights so much. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9875.96s)]
*  I got to see one live here in Austin for the first time [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9879.32s)]
*  in 20 years as a spectator. [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9882.52s)]
*  It was fucking amazing. [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9884.48s)]
*  And then I got to see one recently at the APEC Center. [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9886.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9890.24s)]
*  Me and Tony Hinchcliffe and my friend Radial Rahim, [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9890.84s)]
*  we did a triple header combat sports. [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9894.96s)]
*  We did the triple crown of combat sports. [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9898.439999999999s)]
*  We went to the Abu Dhabi World Jiu Jitsu Championships. [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9900.72s)]
*  Then we went to the UFC at the APEC Center. [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9904.039999999999s)]
*  Then we went to see Canelo Alvarez versus Triple G. [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9906.92s)]
*  Amazing. [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9909.64s)]
*  It was amazing. [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9910.359999999999s)]
*  What a day. [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9911.119999999999s)]
*  What a day. [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9911.679999999998s)]
*  Who is competing at the Abu Dhabis? [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9912.64s)]
*  Well, it was Gordon Ryan. [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9915.72s)]
*  And the champion. [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9917.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9919.0s)]
*  And he dominated again. [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9919.560000000001s)]
*  He's the best ever. [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9921.44s)]
*  What the hell? [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9922.28s)]
*  He's the best ever. [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9923.36s)]
*  He's fucking so dedicated, so smart, so driven, so dedicated. [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9924.560000000001s)]
*  And he's only 27. [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9930.24s)]
*  He's only 27. [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9931.32s)]
*  He looks older. [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9932.6s)]
*  Well, he's fucking training seven days a week. [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9934.0s)]
*  He's good. [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9938.6s)]
*  Guy's an animal. [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9939.12s)]
*  I love watching him. [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9939.84s)]
*  Yeah, no, he's incredible. [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9941.2s)]
*  I love watching him fight other super animals. [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9942.640000000001s)]
*  And destroy them. [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9945.48s)]
*  And destroy them. [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9946.16s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9946.92s)]
*  He's taking the best of the best. [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9948.08s)]
*  And he makes it look easy. [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9949.76s)]
*  It's very strange. [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9951.44s)]
*  It's very strange how good he is. [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9952.52s)]
*  But it's also his coach, John Donahue, [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9953.96s)]
*  who is a legitimate wizard. [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9956.6s)]
*  I mean, he's a guy who was a professor of philosophy [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9960.36s)]
*  at Columbia University and then fell in love with Jiu Jitsu [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9962.84s)]
*  and became the greatest coach of all time. [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9965.96s)]
*  That's the calligraphy thing that you were talking about. [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9967.6s)]
*  Yep, yep, yep. [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9970.72s)]
*  It's also this no bullshit, no frills, no excuses, [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9972.48s)]
*  no nonsense, just pure analysis of what it is, [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQxyrCU7ies&t=9979.32s)]
