# Joe Rogan Experience #2343 - Joe Pistone
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [July 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4)
*  Nice to meet you. My pleasure. You always wear sunglasses. Is that to hide your identity [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=0.0s)]
*  still? Yeah. Actually, it's, it's, I have to see, number one. But where I, where I reside [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=18.76s)]
*  now, my neighbors have no idea that they're living next to Donnie, Nebraska. So we have [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=26.16s)]
*  a very distinct voice. I know. I don't want to ask where you live. But you know, what [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=32.72s)]
*  a wild life you've had, sir. Well, pretty much. Yeah. Yeah. Never expected to go like [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=40.76s)]
*  that. But it, it took off. So when you, you first started working, it was with the FBI, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=47.32s)]
*  correct? Well, I was with Naval Intelligence for three years. And then I always wanted [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=55.36s)]
*  to be in law enforcement. And I was working in Philadelphia, actually. And you do a lot [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=62.16s)]
*  of work with the FBI because, you know, on the government installations, government bases. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=69.68s)]
*  So I became friendly with some FBI agents. And I figured if I, you know, when I get up, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  when I finish this tour with NIS, I'm going to go into law enforcement. So I might as [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=83.8s)]
*  well try to for the best and the best, you know, the FBI. And so how does that lead to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=90.92s)]
*  you infiltrating the mob? Well, you know, I didn't, I didn't infiltrate the mob right [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=97.2s)]
*  from the get go, you know, it, look, I grew up in, in Patterson, New Jersey. I grew up [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=104.67999999999999s)]
*  in an all Italian neighborhood. New wise guys, went to high school with sons of wise guys. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=111.6s)]
*  And when you're in a neighborhood, you know, you know, you know who the wise guys are. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=120.16s)]
*  You hang out at the, they let you hang out at the social clubs because, you know, you're [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=124.11999999999999s)]
*  a neighborhood kid, they know it. So I knew the streets. So when I went into the FBI, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=130.51999999999998s)]
*  I was, you know, I was street smart, basically, Joe, that's what it comes down to, you know. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=137.6s)]
*  And my first assignments were bank robberies, fugitives, gambling cases. And I started doing [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=144.48s)]
*  some little undercover work on gambling cases, because back then the FBI was big into gambling, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  interstate gambling cases. So what was your first undercover work? First was infiltrating [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=163.52s)]
*  a gambling house in Jacksonville, Florida, actually, that's what was my first office. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=169.36s)]
*  What kind of gambling were they doing? Craps. I had a regular casino going. And, you know, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=176.76000000000002s)]
*  I felt comfortable around that stuff because I grew up with that stuff. You know, I grew [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=184.32000000000002s)]
*  up, like I say, in the neighborhood, crap games, card games, it wasn't anything new [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=187.88s)]
*  to me. And being around gangsters was not like intimidating because I wasn't around [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=195.4s)]
*  gangsters growing up. So I didn't have any problem, you know, getting into these games [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=202.6s)]
*  and identifying the major players and who was running them. And that's basically what [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=212.64s)]
*  it was. So when you do this, did you have to testify in court with these guys? Yeah, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=217.12s)]
*  later on after the case goes down. But most of these guys plead guilty so you never go [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=223.4s)]
*  to trial because, you know, it wasn't where they were facing, you know, 15, 20 years, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=228.88s)]
*  you know, they might get a year or two years and then, you know, get some time knocked [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=236.20000000000002s)]
*  off their sentences. So most of it they plead and so you never have to appear in a court. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=243.44s)]
*  So but was there an issue with you being discovered and then getting found out and worrying about [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=249.52s)]
*  your safety afterwards? Well, not too much with these cases. No, not too much with those [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=256.6s)]
*  cases. And then I worked a lot of stolen art, buying, you know, buying stolen art, buying [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=261.4s)]
*  stocks and bonds, swag, stuff like that. So how many years did you do stuff like that [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=269.2s)]
*  before you started being undercover in the mob? Let's see, probably four or five years. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=274.64s)]
*  Yeah. So you slowly sort of got acclimated with being undercover, you do a bunch of cases [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  and then how do they approach you? Well, what happened was is that I'm working out in New [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=291.92s)]
*  York, the New York office of the FBI, and there's a big case in Tampa, Florida. They [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=297.12s)]
*  have a case going on guys that were stealing automobiles, high priced automobiles. In other [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=306.08s)]
*  words, you go to them and you say, hey, I want a Cadillac. Okay. What color you want. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=315.08s)]
*  All right. What model you want. And then they'd go out and hook it. So they had, they grabbed [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=325.2s)]
*  one of the guys and they flipped them and they grabbed his son and they said, hey, look, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=333.40000000000003s)]
*  you know, you help us and we'll cut your son a break. He said, okay. So he said, look, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=342.88s)]
*  we want to put an undercover agent in with this crew. They operated all up and down the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=354.64s)]
*  East coast from Baltimore all the way down to Florida. And the guy that was running it [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=359.44s)]
*  was what we call a half-assed wise guy out of Baltimore. So he says, all right, so he [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=366.4s)]
*  introduced me to this guy as a car thief. But before he introduced me, I said, look, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=373.0s)]
*  I got to know how to steal cars. So he gave me about a week's lesson on how to steal cars, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=381.96s)]
*  how to hook cars. This is like what year was this? This was in 19, let's see, 1970, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=390.04s)]
*  maybe 73, 74. So you essentially just pop in the ignition, pop in the ignition, crossing wires, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=401.4s)]
*  and some cars had alarm systems, told me how to get under the car, disarm the alarm system, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=412.52s)]
*  how to use a slim jim to get in the door, and then how to pop the ignition. And once I learned, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=420.04s)]
*  you know, I figured I can do that. Then he introduced me and I got in with this crew. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=429.64s)]
*  There was a crew about, he was running like five or six guys. And I did that for a year and a half. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=433.8s)]
*  Stole cars, stole the tractor trailers. I knew how to drive tractor trailers because I did that [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=442.04s)]
*  in college. During the summertime, I drove a tractor trailer during the summer. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=452.04s)]
*  So you take the cars, load them on a tractor trailer? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=457.24s)]
*  No, we just stole the cars and I bring them to you. But I mean, we stole rigs too. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=459.71999999999997s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=465.4s)]
*  Because we were dealing with companies too. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=466.12s)]
*  Got it. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=468.44s)]
*  These guys that own some trucking companies. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=469.48s)]
*  So you have to trust this guy though to get you inside, right? You have to trust this guy [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=473.88s)]
*  to not fuck this up and say, hey, this is a car thief. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=479.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=482.44s)]
*  That's got to be hair-raising. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=483.24s)]
*  Well, it is because, you know, the guy's an informant. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=484.6s)]
*  He's already in trouble. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=487.48s)]
*  He's in trouble. But his basic reason for getting me in was he wanted to get his son out of trouble. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=488.44s)]
*  So, you know, we had about a short years there that, hey, you know, if this goes good, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=497.64s)]
*  your son is free. We're going to cut your son free. So that's what happened. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=504.92s)]
*  So I did that for a year and a half. And I get back to New York. They make the arrest. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=510.04s)]
*  I went to trial in that case, but that case was in Florida. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=520.2s)]
*  And a funny story on that case is, if you want to hear it. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=524.76s)]
*  We had hooked one, hooked a Mercedes and delivered to this guy [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=534.52s)]
*  and go to his house. And he wasn't home, but his wife was there. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=541.48s)]
*  So I said, hey, you know, I've delivered this car for your husband. And she says, oh, okay. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=545.88s)]
*  I give her the keys and because he had already paid. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=550.44s)]
*  So me and the other guy, we leave fast forward now to court. I'm going to I'm sitting in the [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=555.24s)]
*  outside the court, getting ready to testify. And there's this lady. She looked familiar. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=563.64s)]
*  It was two ladies. And so she walks up to me. She says, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=571.08s)]
*  aren't you Donnie? I said, yeah. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=580.44s)]
*  She said, you delivered a car to my house, right? I said, yeah. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=585.8000000000001s)]
*  She said, we know my husband's on trial now. I said, yeah, I know. I'm going in to testify. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=591.8000000000001s)]
*  She says, after he goes to jail, you want to go to dinner? Dirty lady. No, thanks. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=598.52s)]
*  She might poison you. Yeah. So I get back to New York and [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=608.28s)]
*  I had a real great supervisor. Was she hot? I can't remember Joe so long ago. I would have [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=615.2399999999999s)]
*  remembered that part. If she was, I would have remembered. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=621.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you probably would have remembered. So I get back to New York and I had a real good [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=624.84s)]
*  supervisor named Guy Berada, an Italian guy from the Bronx, good street agent. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=630.36s)]
*  He was a supervisor of the truck hijacking squad. And back in the day, they were hijacked and all [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=639.72s)]
*  these hijackings were orchestrated by the mob, the mafia. And they were probably doing [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=646.12s)]
*  eight to 10 hijackings a day, which was big time money because they were pharmaceuticals, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=655.32s)]
*  high value food items like lobsters, coffee. You're talking about the 40 some foot trailers, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=663.64s)]
*  so you're talking a lot of money. But they were all run by the mob. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=671.24s)]
*  So I get back to New York. I get to New York and he says, hey, I'm thinking about doing this [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=676.52s)]
*  undercover operation, see if we can get something going with these truck hijackings. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=683.08s)]
*  So the idea was nobody had ever infiltrated the mob before. Actually, the mafia mafia [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=692.44s)]
*  hadn't had some informants in with them, but nobody had actually gotten in. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=700.8399999999999s)]
*  So the idea was, let's try to hit the fences. Fences are the guys that sell the swag and [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=706.92s)]
*  sell the goods. So you need to have a profession. I mean, nobody's going to do anything with you [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=717.88s)]
*  without a profession, and it has to be one that's attractive to them. And plus in the government, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=725.0s)]
*  if you're going to go undercover, your profession can't be one of violence. So [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=731.08s)]
*  who's not violent? Jewel thief. So I figure, okay, I'll go in as a jewel thief. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=735.72s)]
*  Well, if you're going to go in as a jewel thief, what do you have to know? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=743.88s)]
*  No, you got to know diamonds and precious gems. So I went to school. I went to diamond school, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=748.1999999999999s)]
*  diamond and precious gem school. Oh, so you have to be able to identify, use a lens. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=758.04s)]
*  Well, that's how you're going to get caught. Right. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=764.04s)]
*  You get into a conversation, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=768.4399999999999s)]
*  How long is the school for? I went, I think for a couple months until I got, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=771.88s)]
*  you know, where I was comfortable. Now, take it another step further. If you're a jewel thief, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=776.7600000000001s)]
*  what else do you have to know? You got to know how to get in places. Right. So pick locks. I had to [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=782.36s)]
*  learn how to pick locks. All right. What else you got to know? Crack safes. You got to know [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=789.08s)]
*  about safes. Yeah. You got to know about alarm systems. So I had my guys, when I say my guys, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=795.48s)]
*  our guys, you know, our tech guys, school me on lock picking, different types of safes and alarm [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=801.96s)]
*  systems. So all that took a few months before I felt comfortable, you know. And then I went out [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=811.08s)]
*  and on this operation, we didn't do anything with contacts. In other words, everything I did, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=819.88s)]
*  I did under Donnie Brasco. I rented an apartment. I bought a car, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=829.32s)]
*  utilities, you know, phones, everything. Everything as a citizen, in quotes, Donnie Brasco. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=839.6400000000001s)]
*  They get you a social security number and the whole deal? Social security, everything. But, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=849.0s)]
*  you know, I don't want to get into how they do that. But, you know, nothing could be, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=853.24s)]
*  at that time, they couldn't uncover anything. So once I got my apartment, I bought a car, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=860.76s)]
*  had all that set up. And again, you have to know the mafia, you have to know New York City. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=871.3199999999999s)]
*  You don't just walk into a place, you know, and say, hey, you know, I'm a jewel thief. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=878.6s)]
*  Doesn't work that way. You got to get seen, you got to be around. So I moved out of my residence. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=886.76s)]
*  Of course, my family wasn't in New York anyway, but I had to move into my apartment. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=898.44s)]
*  And we had certain bars and restaurants that we knew these fences and wise guys hung out in. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=904.6s)]
*  And the idea was just go in, get my face seen, and hopefully get into conversation with somebody. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=912.6800000000001s)]
*  How do you go and get your face seen? You just show up by yourself? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=919.72s)]
*  Just show up. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=922.52s)]
*  Is that suspicious, though? A guy shows up by himself, not from the neighborhood? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=924.12s)]
*  No, well, that's the thing. And I see it because I couldn't say, hey, I'm from Brooklyn. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=927.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm from Manhattan. I'm from the Bronx because these guys have the contacts everywhere. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=931.32s)]
*  So it was up to me if I got into conversation with anybody. My story was, and then again, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=936.84s)]
*  you have to know your enemy. Okay? And the enemy was the mafia. So you have to know about the mafia. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=944.9200000000001s)]
*  So you have to know about the mafia. You have to know if you do get into conversation with these guys [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=956.04s)]
*  and they're trying to check you out, what's your backstory? Where are you from? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=963.32s)]
*  My background was I was an orphan. Okay? And I moved between Florida and California. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=969.32s)]
*  Why an orphan? Because then I wouldn't have to produce a mother and a father. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=980.12s)]
*  Because again, if I was lucky enough to get in, they'd say, well, where are your parents at? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=985.24s)]
*  I couldn't have any siblings that I knew of. I couldn't have been married. So I couldn't have [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=994.52s)]
*  an ex-wife or anything because I would have had to produce somebody. So my backstory was I was an [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1000.36s)]
*  orphan. To back it up, we found an orphanage that had burnt down and all the records were destroyed. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1007.96s)]
*  So they couldn't check that. I mean, these are all things that if you're going to send somebody [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1019.4000000000001s)]
*  into an undercover operation that is deep cover, and remember I had no informant bringing me in, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1026.68s)]
*  it had to be a cold entree. So I hung around maybe five, six months. That's all I did. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1033.72s)]
*  And that's another thing too. It's a seven day a week job. Because if they see you Monday to Friday, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1043.64s)]
*  and then they don't see you Saturday and Sunday, where the hell are you Saturday and Sunday? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1050.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1054.1200000000001s)]
*  So it's seven days a week. It was seven days a week. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1055.4s)]
*  Did you have a family at the time? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1058.76s)]
*  I did. Yeah. But they lived across country at the time. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1060.04s)]
*  That would be crazy difficult for them. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1064.52s)]
*  Very difficult. It was. It was. Yeah. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1067.0s)]
*  So you just kind of just hang around restaurants, bars? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1073.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And my only conversation with anybody was what I'll have to drink and what I'll have to eat. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1076.6s)]
*  And I'm not a drinker. I never was a drinker. And for young undercovers, you don't have to be [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1083.96s)]
*  a drinker and you don't have to do shit that you think gangsters do. My extent of drinking, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1092.04s)]
*  and it still is, is a half a bottle of beer and maybe a glass of red wine. That's it. And I never [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1101.96s)]
*  went outside those boundaries because that's me. I didn't do it. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1108.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1115.3999999999999s)]
*  So I used to go to this one place, and actually this place wasn't too far from my apartment up in [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1117.1599999999999s)]
*  Yorkville. And wise guys would come in there, I don't remember if it was Wednesdays or Thursdays, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1125.24s)]
*  I don't remember, with their girlfriends for dinner. And I always would sit at the bar, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1133.56s)]
*  never talk to the bartender other than what do you want, what do you want to eat, what do you want [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1143.16s)]
*  to drink. So one night I go in there and the wise guys are there, one of the girlfriends, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1148.2s)]
*  but there's one guy missing. But the girl that he was always with was there. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1161.24s)]
*  So I'm at the bar and I guess she gets up, she goes to the ladies room, she comes by [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1168.44s)]
*  and she says hello. And I just said hello. Now again, knowing your enemy, know how they operate. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1175.24s)]
*  So the first thing I do is I call the bartender over. Right. Now I know his name, but I don't call [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1183.24s)]
*  him by his name because I was never introduced to him. So I just said, sir, would you, you know, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1189.96s)]
*  I said I want to go on record. That's a mob term. I want to go on record. I didn't ask that young [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1196.52s)]
*  lady to stop and say hello. And he just nods and that's it. Well, fast forward, this happens like [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1203.24s)]
*  three or four different times. And they're in there, she's in there, he's not there. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1211.16s)]
*  About the fourth time, the same thing, you know, she would come over and I would call him over. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1219.72s)]
*  So finally he says, hey, he said, if you want to talk to her, go ahead. Her boyfriend went bye-bye. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1226.6000000000001s)]
*  He didn't go to Disneyland, Joe. Right. They got whacked. They whacked him. So I said, no, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1234.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't have any, I don't have any, any interest. So now what does this guy know? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1239.16s)]
*  He knows that I'm a street guy. Right. So he, now he comes over to me and now we start talking. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1245.0800000000002s)]
*  Right. Talking about baseball, talking about how screwed up New York City is at the time. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1256.0400000000002s)]
*  And finally he says, hey, my name is Charlie. I said, my name is Donnie. Now that's another [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1261.24s)]
*  thing. These guys don't introduce themselves like normal people, you know, like, hey, my name is Joe [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1270.92s)]
*  Rogan or hey, my name is Donnie Brasco. It's nickname or first name. So that's another notch [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1276.1200000000001s)]
*  with him that this kid knows something. So a couple of weeks maybe go by and then one night [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1283.8799999999999s)]
*  he says, hey, you like to gamble. I said, sure. Why not? He said, when I bang up here, I'm going to [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1292.9199999999998s)]
*  go to a, I'm going to go to an all night game. I said, you want to come? I said, yeah. So we close [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1298.52s)]
*  up the joint with him and takes me to a game. And obviously it's run by the wise guys. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1307.0s)]
*  You know, they got a whole casino set up and doesn't introduce me to anybody, but I'm okay [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1317.48s)]
*  because I'm with him. All right. So now this is a couple more weeks maybe. So now I figured now, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1328.36s)]
*  and he don't ask me what I do and I don't say anything about jewelry. So, but now I figured [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1338.6799999999998s)]
*  now I got to try to set, set the hook. So I come in one night and I got a packet of diamonds. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1346.36s)]
*  All right. So I put them on a bar and I said, Hey, Charlie, I need X amount of money for this [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1353.72s)]
*  envelope. I don't tell them what's in it. I just said, I need X amount of money, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1360.28s)]
*  but I give them a street price where he can make him, you know, make money himself. So he, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1366.52s)]
*  he takes it, says, okay, puts it under the bar. A couple of weeks go by. I don't ask him about it. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1374.04s)]
*  He don't ask me, but you know, we're, I'm still hanging around with him. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1380.92s)]
*  Comes in one night, puts an envelope on a bar and he said, Donnie, somebody left this for you. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1386.68s)]
*  I was okay. I put it in my sport coat pocket, get back to my apartment and there's the money in it. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1392.44s)]
*  All right. So now what does he know? He knows I'm a thief because I'm giving him diamonds. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1400.28s)]
*  I'm not asking them at the prices for Tiffany prices. Right. Now we get to the game and he [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1408.1200000000001s)]
*  entered, you know, he introduces me as Don the jeweler. So he introduces me to this Colombo guy. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1418.04s)]
*  Guy's name was Jilly. So Jilly said, Hey, you know, Don, where you're from? I said, well, you know, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1426.84s)]
*  hung around and hung around some at Florida, hung around, you know, California. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1437.72s)]
*  I said, you know, just, just move around a lot. He said, well, why don't you come out to my place [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1445.72s)]
*  on Mount Brooklyn? And I said, yeah, okay. So I go out there and I go out to his club and he has a [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1453.72s)]
*  store, you know, all swag. And so he was at the Columbus. So I started hanging out there with the [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1461.6399999999999s)]
*  Columbus and I got in with him and got in with his crew, did some stuff with them, you know, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1470.9199999999998s)]
*  because you got to do something. Otherwise, right. If you ain't producing, if you ain't producing, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1479.8s)]
*  you ain't worth it. You know, like what kind of, what's the first thing you have to do with them? [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1484.6s)]
*  Well, they had, they did some hijacking and, you know, unloaded some trucks for them and [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1488.52s)]
*  different things. So that went on with the, with the Columbus and I was getting, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1498.92s)]
*  I was getting good information with these guys. That went on for a couple of months. And [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1506.6000000000001s)]
*  then finally I get to the club one day and there's two guys there that I didn't know. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1512.12s)]
*  So he introduced him, introduces them to me as Frankie and Patsy. He said, Donnie, you know, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1520.52s)]
*  Frankie Patsy. Okay. As it turns out, they just got out of the can. They were part of Jilly's crew. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1527.4799999999998s)]
*  One of the guys was a maid guy. Maid guy is a guy that's been officially inducted in, into a particular [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1534.84s)]
*  mafia family. And these guys were with the Columbus. One, I think Patsy was a maid guy and Frankie, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1543.8s)]
*  Frankie was an associate. Right. But they had just gone out of the can. So they're looking to set up [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1551.72s)]
*  scores because, you know, they've been away for a few years. So Jilly tells them, you know, hey, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1559.0s)]
*  Donnie's, you know, Donnie's a good thief and he knows, he knows, he knows alarms, he knows [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1567.32s)]
*  locks, he knows safes. So they had a couple of scores lined up. So we go out, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1574.68s)]
*  we case this place and I tell them, Hey, I can't bypass that alarm. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1582.12s)]
*  Because, you know, if you say you can do everything, nobody can do everything, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1589.8s)]
*  no matter how good you are. So I said, no, I said, I can't defeat that alarm. Okay. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1594.4399999999998s)]
*  A few, a few days later, they got another one set up and it's a safe. We go in. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1601.8799999999999s)]
*  I said, you got to blow this safe. You know, you'll wake up the whole neighborhood, you know. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1609.48s)]
*  Okay. So now this, this pisses them off. So a couple of days later, I get to the club [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1616.1200000000001s)]
*  and Jilly, he says, Donnie, let's, let's take a walk and talk. I said, okay. So we walk and [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1625.48s)]
*  we're talking. That's what a walk and talk is. You're walking on the street and you're talking [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1632.92s)]
*  because they don't think, you know, they don't think the FBI or anybody can hear you. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1637.8s)]
*  I said, what's the matter, Jilly? He said, well, he said, you know, I told, I told Frankie [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1641.8s)]
*  and, and Fancy what, you know, what a great thief you are. And he's, and they're pissed off [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1648.52s)]
*  because, you know, Fancy's pissed off because you turned down, you turned down the two scores. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1653.1599999999999s)]
*  I said, well, what do you want me to tell you, Jilly? I couldn't bypass the alarm. I'm honest [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1660.44s)]
*  with you. And I don't want to blow a safe that, you know, you got to blow, blow, blow. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1665.72s)]
*  So he said, well, they want to have a sit down. I said, okay. So we go back in the club and then [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1670.68s)]
*  they have a back room. So we're going to back room, sit down. They locked the door and [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1678.84s)]
*  Fancy pulls out, pulls out a 38, lays it on the table and said, Donnie, if you don't convince me [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1688.0400000000002s)]
*  that you're as good a thief as Jilly says you are, the only way you're going out of this room [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1699.0800000000002s)]
*  is rolled up in that rug. Oh boy. Oh boy. So it's crazy what goes through your head. So I look at [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1704.76s)]
*  the rug. I said to myself, I hope it's fucking Persian. If I'm going to go out of here, I might [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1712.12s)]
*  as well go out in the $50,000 rug. So we're in there and, and where are you from, Donnie? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1718.28s)]
*  Now, you know, in these situations, you want to be on the offense. You don't want to be on [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1728.28s)]
*  the defense, but I can't really disrespect him because he's a made guy. And, you know, if you [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1732.6s)]
*  know anything about the mob, you can't disrespect the made guy in front of other people. So I said, [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1739.8s)]
*  Hey, look, you know, I'm an orphan. I'm not from here. I travel the country. You know, well, tell [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1747.08s)]
*  us some people that you stole with. I said, no disrespect, but I'm not giving you any names [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1756.12s)]
*  of people that I stole with. I said, why would I do that? Why would I give up anybody that I, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1762.44s)]
*  that I did scores with? Right. So this goes on and on and on. After about four hours, finally, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1768.52s)]
*  Julie says, Hey, Donnie's been with us for months now. We know what he can do. It's over. It's over. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1779.8s)]
*  I said, okay, now I got a problem. The problem is they just called me out. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1791.72s)]
*  So in their world, I can't go shake their hand because it's wise and Donnie pissed off. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1799.4s)]
*  All right. My only recourse here is some kind of physical recourse, but I can't do, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1806.12s)]
*  I can't do anything to Patsy because he's the made guy. I can't touch him. And that's, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1816.6000000000001s)]
*  that's one of the rules of the mafia. You don't lay your hands on the made guy. It'll get you [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1823.96s)]
*  killed. It'll get you killed. So the only guy can hit is Frankie. He's not a made guy. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1828.8400000000001s)]
*  So we get up, start to walk out and I call cock Frankie. Oh Jesus. But that's the only thing [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1839.48s)]
*  that that's going to save me because otherwise it's wise and Donnie pissed off. Right. So now [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1851.88s)]
*  I'm in a Frankie questioning you too. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. But he's not a made guy. Right. So [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1859.64s)]
*  he's fair game. Boy. So I hit him. He goes down. Now Patsy's jumping on me and he's, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1864.68s)]
*  he's punching the hell out of me, but I can't, you can't hit him back. I can't hit him back. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1872.1200000000001s)]
*  I can just protect myself. But I figured, well, you hit me once. I hit Frankie twice. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1876.8400000000001s)]
*  So it went on. So then finally they broke it up. But now I know I can't stay around here. I can't [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1887.3200000000002s)]
*  stay with these guys because you know, you can't get into an altercation with made guys and, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1894.36s)]
*  yeah, and have it come out. So after, after we're, everything settled down, I'd say to [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1901.3999999999999s)]
*  Julie, Julie, let's take a walk and talk. So we do. We get outside. I said, Julie, look, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1908.6s)]
*  no disrespect to you. You know, I said, but I can't, I can't come around here anymore. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1915.4799999999998s)]
*  I said, because you know how it's going to end. He says, yeah, Donnie, I realize that. He said, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1921.24s)]
*  but you know, no real feelings between you and me. I said, okay. So at the, at the card game, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1927.9599999999998s)]
*  I was introduced to a Bonanno guy by the name of Tony Mira. I had never done anything with him, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1939.08s)]
*  never done anything with him, but I was introduced to him. So I go back, I go back with Charlie, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1945.64s)]
*  you know, to the card games and I start signing up to this mirror who was a complete psycho case, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1952.8400000000001s)]
*  a complete fucking psycho case, which I find out later on. He's a big broly guy. And [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1960.76s)]
*  he says, you know, why don't you come downtown? I said, yeah, okay. So he was from Little Italy [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1969.08s)]
*  and that's where he hung out. He had a bus stop luncheonette down in Little Italy, but he was [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1982.4399999999998s)]
*  psycho. So I started hanging out with him at my first Bonanno guy that brings me around. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=1991.96s)]
*  So we're out one night and he was shaking down nightclubs and I was helping him. When I say [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2003.4s)]
*  helping, I was with him, you know, shake down owners and at nightclubs and stuff. So [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2012.28s)]
*  it's about three or four in the morning, one morning and we go to a diner for breakfast and [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2022.2s)]
*  the eggs come out cold. So he starts berating the waitress and there's, you know, we were with [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2031.56s)]
*  other wise guys and stuff. So I said, Tony, I said, you know, I said, she's only doing her job. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2040.28s)]
*  I said, why are you taking it out on her? You know, she's here four o'clock in the morning [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2047.24s)]
*  waitressing. So he tore the shit out of me. He tore into me in front of everybody, but I really [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2053.08s)]
*  can't go back at him. But I have to let him know that, you know, I'm not a pushover. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2059.96s)]
*  So the next day, now this guy, as I had gotten to know him, I had seen him in action. So the next [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2072.84s)]
*  day I told him, I said, Tony, nobody else is around. So it's my word on his. I said, don't ever talk [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2082.04s)]
*  to me like that again in front of people. I said, cause I'll fucking stab you. I said, you won't [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2088.84s)]
*  even know what's coming. I said, don't ever embarrass me like that and call me those names [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2094.6000000000004s)]
*  in front of other people. And he was like, so, but he introduced me to, kept introducing me to [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2100.04s)]
*  other bananas. And then he introduced me. So even after that, yeah, after that, so after that, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2112.28s)]
*  did you get his respect by saying stab him? I don't think people realize how disgusting the data [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2116.84s)]
*  collection industry really is. Experts say the data brokers already have an estimated 1,000 data [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2121.8s)]
*  points on every person with an online presence. That includes your name, credit history, medical [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2128.92s)]
*  history, who your friends and family are and your current location. Imagine if we're just some guy [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2135.0s)]
*  in his mom's basement collecting all of this info about you. It's fucking gross and scary, right? [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2141.96s)]
*  But there's a way to stop these creepy data brokers from invading your privacy. And that's [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2147.88s)]

*  you know, he knew that I, I was in both Shennam. I mean, you know, he just beat me down in front [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2210.76s)]
*  of other people. I mean, not physically, but you know, just calling me, you know, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2217.08s)]
*  and cause I was standing up for this waitress, but that was, that was him. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2223.88s)]
*  So he introduces me to a guy by name of Lefty Rogerio, another made guy in the Bonanos [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2229.88s)]
*  from downtown Knickerbocker village. They all lived in Knickerbocker village. And [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2236.84s)]
*  he introduces me to Lefty. So Mirror had just gotten out of the can. Now they send him back. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2243.16s)]
*  All right. So he goes back to the can. He's a big, he was a big moneymaker for the Bonanos [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2250.8399999999997s)]
*  in dope. He was a big narcotics guy for the Bonanos, but he had violated his parole. So [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2257.16s)]
*  they send him back. So I started hanging out with Rogerio. And he sent me back. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2264.44s)]
*  What Mirror never did and what Rogerio did is his captain was a guy by name of Mike Sibela. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2274.12s)]
*  And once I got, once Rogerio got to know me a little better, he brings me to Mike Sibela, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2286.44s)]
*  who's the captain of the crew. And he said to Mike, I'm going on record that Donnie's with me. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2294.68s)]
*  And that's what you do. When you're a made guy, you have an associate, you go to your captain and [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2304.12s)]
*  you go on the record. So now nobody else could fuck with you. Nobody else could take you. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2310.44s)]
*  Mirror never did that. Even though I spent a lot of time with Mirror, he never went to his captain [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2316.44s)]
*  and said, I'm going on record that Donnie's with me. So I get to know, I get to know Rogerio [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2323.56s)]
*  pretty good. Start doing stuff with- So all told, how much time are you undercover now? [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2330.68s)]
*  Now this is probably going over a year. Wow. Yeah, over a year now. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2337.48s)]
*  Now you reporting to anybody during this time? Do you have to go back to the FBI? [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2351.24s)]
*  Never. Once I stepped out of the office, I never went back to the office. I had, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2355.3199999999997s)]
*  what you have is a contact agent, Joe, and that's somebody that you, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2360.04s)]
*  if you have a problem, you call them and he helps you solve it. So you're totally on your own. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2364.2799999999997s)]
*  You're on your own. Wow. I had no surveillance because you're in New York City. Right. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2369.3199999999997s)]
*  You're working seven days a week. My day would go from maybe 11 o'clock in the morning to maybe [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2375.72s)]
*  three, four o'clock the next morning. Seven days a week. So your only lifeline is the phone to your [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2385.72s)]
*  contact agent. Yeah. Wow. And so I'm doing a lot of stuff like that. And I'm gaining all kind of [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2395.48s)]
*  intelligence though, you know, identifying made guys, identifying guys in other families that are [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2406.68s)]
*  made. Are you writing this stuff down or do you just keep it all in your head? No, in your head. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2413.0s)]
*  And what I do is I would regurgitate it over the telephone to my contact guy. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2417.72s)]
*  And he would reduce it to paper. Yeah. Because like, you know, these guys would come to my [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2425.48s)]
*  apartment. I couldn't take the shot of, you know, and I didn't wear a wire with these guys, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2432.6s)]
*  you know, very seldom did I have a wire on. Most of my recordings are on the telephone. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2439.96s)]
*  I wore a wire a couple of times when I knew I was going to get a contract to kill people. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2449.08s)]
*  And when I had the feeling that I was going to be told about hits. And what I did was I had a mini [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2455.72s)]
*  mini cassette recorder that I bought at what's that radio? Radio shack. Radio shack. Oh, wow. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2465.0s)]
*  You know, and I just put it in my, I just put it in my sport compagny. You had to be really [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2472.36s)]
*  worried about getting caught with that. Yeah, but at least, you know, nobody's tapping, you know, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2478.44s)]
*  because once you get in with these guys, when you meet them for the day, they all hug each other [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2484.76s)]
*  and they kiss each other on both cheeks, you know. If they kiss you on the lips, then you're done. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2492.2000000000003s)]
*  You know that that's the last fucking day you're going to be there. So, yeah, so I did make many [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2497.8s)]
*  body recordings because you're always and they're very touchy-feely guys, you know. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2505.96s)]
*  I mean, when I was, I was with Mirror one time and we, he said, hey, pull over, Donnie. I pull over. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2515.08s)]
*  And he tears my, he tears my, my car, the dashboard apart. Now, if you saw the movie, that was, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2525.08s)]
*  they had Lefty do that, but that was in the real life, that was Tony Mirror. I mean, you know, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2536.68s)]
*  so I couldn't have my car wires. Right. Does he suspect in you or suspect in somebody else [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2542.92s)]
*  when he's tearing your dash apart? Well, it's, it's, well, I'm new, you know. Nobody could go [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2550.04s)]
*  to anybody and say that they knew somebody, that they knew Donnie, you know. So that's how they, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2556.28s)]
*  that's how they check you out, you know, because they had no other way of checking me out, really. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2562.44s)]
*  So, you know, hanging with Rogerio, doing stuff with him. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2569.16s)]
*  And now we come to a point where I'm really in with, with the Bonanos. I mean, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2576.2799999999997s)]
*  they're starting to talk, they would talk business with me there, you know, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2585.56s)]
*  and they felt comfortable with me because, again, reverting back to my, my early years growing up, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2592.04s)]
*  you know, hanging out at the, at the social clubs in the neighborhood, you know, I knew that if you [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2601.48s)]
*  don't have any interest in the conversation, walk away from it. And that's what I did with these guys, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2611.0s)]
*  is if they started to talk about something, I would get up and walk away because it puts in their [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2617.72s)]
*  mind, you know, Donnie's not really interested in, you know what I'm saying? It's not, he doesn't [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2625.24s)]
*  want to get into our real business. So that made them trust me more. That made them trust me. You [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2632.6s)]
*  knew the protocol. Yeah, I knew, you're right. I knew the protocol. Exactly. So now what happens [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2642.44s)]
*  is that the FBI had an operation going in Milwaukee, undercover operation [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2654.6800000000003s)]
*  against the Milwaukee family, right? The Balestrari family who's connected to Chicago. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2662.36s)]
*  Now this gives you, this will give you a little hint how the mob works. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2669.72s)]
*  So they're not really good, not really going anywhere, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2677.0s)]
*  right? They had a vending machine company set up. And the undercover was a undercover, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2681.08s)]
*  actually, that I knew, which is because I had a, I ever, I had a rule. If I didn't know you, [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2689.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't care if you're an FBI agent or not, I'm not introducing you. I'm not vouching for you [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2696.04s)]
*  because I don't know if you're any good or not. So they reach out to me and they say, hey, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2702.68s)]
*  we got an operation going in Milwaukee. Yeah. And this is what it is. We've got a vending [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2711.56s)]
*  machine company. We got trucks. We got a warehouse. We got machines, but we're not [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2718.04s)]
*  getting anywhere. You know, the undercover, who's the undercover? Ty Cobb. That was his, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2727.08s)]
*  yeah, that was the agent's real name. I said, Ty's the undercover. They said, yeah. I said, okay, [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2737.24s)]
*  now you can, now I'll listen to you. Cause I know Ty and I had done undercover work in Chicago [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2746.12s)]
*  together. I said, okay. So I'm talking, you know, I said, well, tell Ty to call me. I want to talk [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2754.52s)]
*  to Ty. So he said, he tells me what's going on. He said, you know, I'm going to all these bars [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2765.16s)]
*  and restaurants and they won't take my machines because the mob, it's all the mob's machines. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2772.84s)]
*  I said, all right. So I said, well, what's the plan? Well, maybe you can bring the bananas out here [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2780.52s)]
*  and we can get a sit down with the balustraries. I said, well, let me, let me see. So [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2787.08s)]
*  I went with Jerry one day and I just, I dropped a, he left, you know, I got a call the other day [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2796.36s)]
*  from a guy that I, that I used to steal artwork with down in Baltimore and he's out in Milwaukee. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2807.08s)]
*  He said, what the fuck's he doing in Milwaukee? I says, he's got a vending machine company [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2816.28s)]
*  and he wants me to come out and help him. He says, is he crazy? He said, they'll blow him up out there. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2821.72s)]
*  He says, he can't do a vending machine business out there. That's the mob. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2828.8399999999997s)]
*  I said, well, he doesn't know. He doesn't know anything about the mob. And we drop it. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2833.8799999999997s)]
*  A couple of days later, I says, they left this guy, call me again. He needs help. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2841.08s)]
*  He said, Donnie, what do you, what do you think? He said, you can't just go out there. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2846.44s)]
*  And then he looks at me and says, this guy got any money? [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2854.04s)]
*  I said, I don't know. Let me ask him. I said, I'll call him tonight and find out if he's got any money. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2858.76s)]
*  So I called Ty. He was going by, he was going by name of Tony. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2867.0s)]
*  And I said, hey, Tony, he said, I said, lefty wants to know if you got any money. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2873.24s)]
*  He said, all right, he said, tell him I got 200,000 in the bank. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2882.04s)]
*  And, you know, I got, I got a warehouse full of machines. I got everything set up. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2886.44s)]
*  That's okay. So I go back to lefty. I said, left, he's got, he's told me he's got 200,000 in the bank. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2893.08s)]
*  And he's got this big warehouse set up. He says, all right, he said, let me talk to Mike. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2900.12s)]
*  Now Mike Sabella is the captain, right? So Mike said, all right, he said, you and lefty go out there. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2907.4s)]
*  Just sit down with him and make sure that he has what he says he has. Don't tell anybody you're going. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2915.08s)]
*  I said, okay. So the first thing I said, I said, I said, I'm going to tell you something. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2921.56s)]
*  The first thing is call Tony and tell him to send us airplane tickets because, you know, wise guys, [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2930.28s)]
*  they're not spending their own money. So the bureau, you know, Tony puts, gets us two plane tickets, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2936.68s)]
*  me and lefty fly out there and he takes us to the warehouse and he's, you know, they got, [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2944.12s)]
*  they got the whole operation going on. And lefty said, okay, so we go back and report back to Mike. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2950.04s)]
*  And he said, okay, he says, now here's the story. Tony's been with the Bonanos for 10 years. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2960.28s)]
*  He's been one, he's been an associate of ours for 10 years because that's what he has to tell [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2968.92s)]
*  Chicago and Milwaukee. Because if they just say, Donnie just met this guy, they're going to say, [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2976.44s)]
*  well, he's not with you. You didn't claim them. So we'll take the whole business. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2983.4s)]
*  So here's the way it works. Now we go to our consigliere, the consigliere, the Bonanos, [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=2991.2400000000002s)]
*  right? Got my name of Bobby Badheart. You know why they call them Bobby Badheart? [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3000.2000000000003s)]
*  Because he had a bad heart. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3006.44s)]
*  Bad heart. Easy, right? So he goes and Bobby Badheart now has to call Chicago, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3007.88s)]
*  right? And tell Chicago that, hey, we got a guy that's been with us for 10 years. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3021.08s)]
*  He settled now in Milwaukee. He's been in Milwaukee for a couple of years and [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3028.36s)]
*  he wants to go into the business and he has machines and everything. And we'd like to have [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3034.2s)]
*  a sit down with Ballastrere, the boss of Milwaukee. Okay. Chicago now calls [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3041.16s)]
*  Ballastrere's consigliere and relates the whole story to him. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3051.48s)]
*  So now we got to wait and see if he wants to have the sit down. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3059.08s)]
*  A week or so goes by, Chicago calls back and says, okay, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3064.68s)]
*  he'll have a meet with you guys. Who's coming out? Well, it'll be Lefty Rogerio and Donnie Brasco. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3072.9199999999996s)]
*  Now Lefty's a made guy, so, you know. So they say, okay, come on out, check into this hotel [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3081.7999999999997s)]
*  and wait for a phone call. So Me and Lefty fly out, check into this hotel and [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3092.28s)]
*  we wait about three or four days. Just hanging around the hotel. We can't go anywhere because [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3103.6400000000003s)]
*  we can't miss the phone call. So we get the phone call. He says, okay, come to Snuggs Restaurant. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3108.36s)]
*  So that's a day, such as a time. It's Ballastrere's restaurant. He owns a hotel [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3119.8s)]
*  and it's a restaurant in his hotel. So me, Lefty and Tony, the other undercover, we go there. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3127.88s)]
*  And now if you know the mob, Joe, you don't get to sit down with a boss [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3138.12s)]
*  unless you're another boss. You know what I mean? Guys, made guys that are just made guys in other [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3142.92s)]
*  families don't get to sit down with a boss. So now who's there is Ballastrere the boss, [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3153.2400000000002s)]
*  his under boss, his consigliere and his two sons who are both lawyers. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3162.12s)]
*  Right? So we have a big spread. Why do you want to be here? Well, Tony's been with us. Now Lefty's [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3169.1600000000003s)]
*  doing all the talking because he's the main guy. Tony's been with us for 10 years. Him and Donnie, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3181.7200000000003s)]
*  they did a lot of art theft together and stuff and they've both been with us. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3191.7200000000003s)]
*  And Tony thought he could get the business going with the machines and stuff. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3199.32s)]
*  So after this whole dinner, probably about five or six hours, he said, OK, we'll get back to you. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3216.04s)]
*  All right. So a couple of days later, [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3223.32s)]
*  they called, why don't you have dinner at my house? I thought the boss is inviting us to dinner at his [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3229.64s)]
*  house. It doesn't happen. If you know the world of the mafia gives us the address. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3236.68s)]
*  So lefty and Tony and lefties like you got to know wise guys. Lefty's like, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3247.16s)]
*  we're going to the dinner at a mob boss's house at his house. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3254.68s)]
*  He's like, you know, I mean, we know it's a big deal, but to a wise guy, it's a big fucking deal, [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3261.72s)]
*  too. So we go to his house and he's right on the lake. He has a big, big table, you know, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3269.0s)]
*  like you see in the movies and got the maids serving us. And he said, OK, we'll go in partners. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3280.76s)]
*  We'll be 50-50 partners. Tony does all the work. You know, we'll tell you where to go to [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3291.64s)]
*  put your machines in. They'll take your machines. So now what do we just do? We just marry two mafia [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3302.84s)]
*  families together, Bonanos and the Balestraris through Chicago. First, marrying two mafia families [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3311.08s)]
*  to do business together. Right. Being left to go back to New York, everything's going good. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3320.28s)]
*  Tony's meeting with the sons because that's who you meet with my sons. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3330.44s)]
*  After a few months, nothing. They stopped meeting with him. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3338.52s)]
*  I don't know why they won't take his calls. Nothing. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3342.76s)]
*  So I tell them I should left it. They don't. They're not responding. What do you mean? [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3355.0800000000004s)]
*  They're not responding. I said, they're not taking his calls anymore. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3362.0400000000004s)]
*  He said, well, what do you do? Try to, you know, I said, Tony, I said, left the disguise. Not like [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3366.2s)]
*  that. Make a long story short. Tony had been a cop in the city outside of Milwaukee. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3375.48s)]
*  After he got out of the Marine Corps, before he went into the bureau, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3388.12s)]
*  and somehow they found out there was a leak somewhere. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3392.52s)]
*  But they don't, they don't tell. We find this out later that this is how they, [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3398.2s)]
*  they don't tell this to lefty, which saved my ass because I, I vouch for Tony. Right. Right. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3404.6s)]
*  So we're trying to get in touch with Chicago. Chicago's not, you know, Chicago say we don't know why [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3414.28s)]
*  they, why they stopped, you know, we don't have any idea. So that goes now. That's, I got that hanging [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3424.76s)]
*  on me. Right. Yeah. So lefty sends me to Milwaukee, go, you know, go find out, [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3435.64s)]
*  go search for this guy and blah, blah, blah, blah. And, you know, I come up with a story left. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3448.3599999999997s)]
*  I found this car. It's in the parking lot. I mean, he's in the parking lot of the [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3457.08s)]
*  airport. Then when I went back, it was gone. So I go and they said, though, the cops told it, [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3462.84s)]
*  you know, it's all bullshit, of course, but I got to cover, you know, what happened to this guy. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3474.12s)]
*  So now we've got to go tell Mike Sebel, our captain, because, you know, our money source dried up. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3482.84s)]
*  So we go sit down with Mike. This is hard to believe, but, and he's ripping, right? [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3489.64s)]
*  You know, my punishment was, I couldn't go to the Christmas party. That's it. That's it. I mean, [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3500.04s)]
*  he was, he was ripped, but he banned me from the Christmas party. Because you introduced him to [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3510.2799999999997s)]
*  the cop. Well, he didn't know he was a cop because, because, you know, the operation just shut down [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3518.52s)]
*  and sort of the money stopped. Wasn't coming in anymore. And they don't tell you why. No. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3526.2799999999997s)]
*  So I said, well, if that's the best that could happen, I don't go to the Christmas party, [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3533.7999999999997s)]
*  you know, because each crew has, you know, they have their own party. I'm saying to myself, my god, [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3538.3599999999997s)]
*  this is what I'm doing. So they don't suspect you at all? No. How do they not suspect you? How do [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3545.64s)]
*  they not question you? Well, I had been with them so many, I had been with them now, you know, [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3553.4s)]
*  Joe, over two years now. Right. And, you know, so, but I'm always on edge because I don't know, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3557.8799999999997s)]
*  why aren't the balustraries telling Rogerio? Right. Unless they're too embarrassed. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3566.2799999999997s)]
*  You know what I mean? Right. I don't know. To this day? Well, I mean, after we found out that, yeah, [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3575.72s)]
*  yeah, to this day, I have no idea why they didn't tell him. And what ever happened to Tony? [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3583.8799999999997s)]
*  Oh, we just shut the operation down. They just shut it down. You know, so I'm going on again, [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3589.0s)]
*  we're going on. Nice cup. Want it? You can have it. No, thank you. I got some swag coming for you. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3599.0s)]
*  All right. Yeah. Well, I got swag too. You can have one of them JRE cups. But I mean, [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3607.88s)]
*  I got a lot of Donnie Brasco swag that I'm going to mail to you. All right, cool. It was supposed [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3612.12s)]
*  to be at the hotel. It never made it. So. But this has to be hair-raising. It is, because now I'm [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3616.44s)]
*  like, and Lefty said, you know, now he's grilling me again about my relationship with Tony. Right. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3623.72s)]
*  But I got to stick to the story, you know. So I kind of squared things around with him, [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3633.0s)]
*  and because, you know, and Mike. So now what happens is that [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3647.64s)]
*  at the time, Carmen Galenti was the boss of the Bonanos. All right. And they killed Galenti. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3657.8799999999997s)]
*  They whack him. All right. Because there's kind of a beef within the family. And [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3667.96s)]
*  one side didn't like Galenti. So they whack him. Mike Sibelius now was associated with Galenti. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3675.96s)]
*  So they tell Mike, Mike, either step down or we're going to we're going to whack you too. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3685.24s)]
*  So he gives up his captain ship and just becomes a regular soldier again. Right. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3693.48s)]
*  Right. So one of the originators, when I say originators, instigators, whatever, [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3699.08s)]
*  is a guy by name of Sonny Black, not Platano. He was out in Brooklyn. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3712.12s)]
*  So they put me in. Remember, we were with Mike Sibelius. So they put me and Lefty now with [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3719.56s)]
*  under Sonny Black. They make Sonny Black becomes a captain. They put me and Lefty under Sonny Black [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3727.16s)]
*  out in Brooklyn. So that's who we report to every day. And what you know, you have to you have to [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3734.52s)]
*  check in with your captain every day. So every day, me and Lefty would report out the motion lounge [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3741.56s)]
*  at Grandman wither Street in Brooklyn. Sonny's our new captain. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3751.4s)]
*  So and again, you know, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3762.28s)]
*  the intelligence information I'm gathering is like [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3769.2400000000002s)]
*  no other than anybody else can get because, you know, informants are going to give you all this [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3774.04s)]
*  stuff. And I'm meeting different people again. I'm meeting people from different families through [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3778.04s)]
*  these guys. So I'm rocking out there in Brooklyn under Sonny Black. And I get another call. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3785.24s)]
*  And when the headquarters wants to talk to you about what? Well, we got another cover operation going in Tampa, Florida. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3799.32s)]
*  Yeah. We want to see if you can bring your bananas in. I says, Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3810.6000000000004s)]
*  I just went through to say Milwaukee. Well, supervisor wants to talk to you. I knew the supervisor. Supervisor, good guy. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3818.6s)]
*  So I call him. I said, Tony, what's up? He says, we got a nightclub. And [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3829.88s)]
*  it's pretty, you know, it's pretty good, but [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3836.44s)]
*  we can't get into Santo Tropicante. And maybe, you know, maybe you can do the same thing you did in Milwaukee. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3841.1600000000003s)]
*  I said, I don't know, man. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3850.12s)]
*  I said, if I do it, number one, who's the undercovers? [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3858.3599999999997s)]
*  Because they had two undercovers [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3862.3599999999997s)]
*  running a nightclub. And [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3865.3599999999997s)]
*  they said, well, one of them is [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3870.3599999999997s)]
*  an agent by the name of Sal Mary Steve. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3874.3599999999997s)]
*  I said, OK, I said, he's a good guy. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3878.3599999999997s)]
*  I said, I know Steve. I did undercover work with him, too. I said, I got no problem with Steve. And they gave me the other guy. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3880.6s)]
*  And the other guy I knew, but I didn't. I never worked with him. I said, but as long as Steve is involved, I'll see what I can do. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3884.6s)]
*  But [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3892.6s)]
*  I don't know how long it's going to take. So you got to just [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3896.6s)]
*  let me think about this. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3898.8399999999997s)]
*  All right. Because I don't want to come up, you know, I'm not coming up with a story. Hey, I got a call from a guy that I used to fuck a thief with. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3900.8399999999997s)]
*  Right. Right. Right. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3904.8399999999997s)]

*  after a while, I said, hey, I've got a guy. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=3910.8399999999997s)]

*  Said I'd clear all the money off the table so we get all the money off the tables and put chips back on the tables [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4430.02s)]
*  I said all right let them in [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4437.58s)]
*  Because we had that we had the certificate we had everything and [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4441.9800000000005s)]
*  What we had done was every so often we collect the money and we stash it in the furnace room [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4446.26s)]
*  All right, there's a lot of money stashed [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4454.1s)]
*  What we had was an old-time one-armed bandit [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4459.26s)]
*  Alright, the thing had to be a hundred years old [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4463.1s)]
*  Nobody ever put money in it. It was just there [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4466.780000000001s)]
*  So they come in and they stay [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4470.620000000001s)]
*  They don't see any money [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4473.900000000001s)]
*  One of the one of the deputies puts it I don't know nickel and dime [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4476.780000000001s)]
*  Pulls a handle and what do you think happens he fucking wins? [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4482.06s)]
*  You're running a gambling operation said nobody's ever played that thing right well they wrecked the joint [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4487.82s)]
*  They wrecked it. We all get arrested [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4495.18s)]
*  Why did he get arrested because it I don't understand it was a [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4497.62s)]
*  Gambling charge right they arrest us. Oh because but why because of the one-armed bandit [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4501.9400000000005s)]
*  Because they won and they said that that's that was gambling [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4508.18s)]
*  Nobody even knew there was any money in it or anything [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4514.78s)]
*  It was just there as a decoration. Oh boy. You know it was it was an antique [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4518.42s)]
*  So they just use it as an excuse. Yeah, just use an excuse because we were that we were the the mafia guineas [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4524.900000000001s)]
*  From New York right that's what we were [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4532.66s)]
*  right, so if they throw us in a can and [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4535.96s)]
*  Just for the one-armed bandit. Yeah, they never find the money [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4539.96s)]
*  We didn't put somebody did oh boy [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4543.8s)]
*  Somebody did how much money? [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4547.32s)]
*  There was over 30 grand that that I know that was stashed [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4552.5599999999995s)]
*  So they swipe that well. I don't know somebody did probably somebody did yeah [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4557.12s)]
*  So we had traffic can't these lawyer when he gave us it. I don't know who it was [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4562.52s)]
*  So we called a lawyer and he gets us out of the can the next day [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4568.92s)]
*  And now now I'm in another fucking bind because now we got busted and [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4576.400000000001s)]
*  We did you know we were paying the guy off and what happened to the guy you paid off? [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4583.64s)]
*  He committed suicide later on oh [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4588.92s)]
*  Convenient yeah, yeah, did he really commit suicide? Yeah, he did really because [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4592.36s)]
*  When he got his subpoena, oh he knew they were coming for him. Yeah [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4598.24s)]
*  So that that kind of screwed that thing up and [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4604.76s)]
*  But you know, you know Sonny knew that [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4613.08s)]
*  That we were paying the guy off and everything so, you know, it was just a [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4615.599999999999s)]
*  Hazardous of doing hazards of doing business as a mob, you know [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4621.599999999999s)]
*  But when we got back to the club, like I say to the statue was gone with the money somebody took it [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4625.96s)]
*  And so we go back to New York and [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4634.12s)]
*  again now [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4637.24s)]
*  There's another beef in them in the Bonanno family because after they whack a Lenti [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4639.24s)]
*  They make [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4643.32s)]
*  Rusty Ristelli the boss of the family, but Rusty's in a can [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4644.5199999999995s)]
*  He's in a can [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4648.16s)]
*  so Sonny Black is is running a family along with [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4649.92s)]
*  Another capo and [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4655.28s)]
*  then there's a Sicilian faction of the Bonanno family and [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4657.599999999999s)]
*  They're running their they're running their faction [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4661.679999999999s)]
*  All right [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4665.36s)]
*  Now there's a faction of three capos that [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4667.0s)]
*  Now there's a faction of three capos that are against Rusty Ristelli and they're against Sonny and the other capos [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4670.24s)]
*  So now there's more friction in the Bonanno's [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4680.92s)]
*  So [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4686.44s)]
*  In order to solve this they [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4688.76s)]
*  They call a sit-down [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4692.96s)]
*  Sonny Black [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4695.0s)]
*  The guys on his side the capos on his side [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4696.5199999999995s)]
*  To call a sit-down for the other the other three capos to straighten this out [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4701.08s)]
*  Well, the deal is when these other three capos get to the sit-down they're gonna whack them they're gonna whack them [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4707.96s)]
*  So [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4717.88s)]
*  I was supposed to be in on that but they cut they cut me out at the last minute [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4721.72s)]
*  I was supposed to be in on the head, but they cut me out the last minute [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4726.04s)]
*  And then I was supposed to be on the cleanup crew [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4730.16s)]
*  But they cut me out of the you know at the at the last minute why they cut you out [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4734.04s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know because I wasn't told until after [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4739.5599999999995s)]
*  You know, right? [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4744.92s)]
*  So they whack these three guys [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4747.0s)]
*  and [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4749.72s)]
*  The next day Sonny calls me into the club and he said [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4751.32s)]
*  I [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4755.72s)]
*  Bruno never showed up that was the fourth guy that would [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4758.2s)]
*  one of the capos in delacado his son [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4762.6s)]
*  Was supposed to come and he didn't show [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4766.84s)]
*  So he gave me the contract to kill him [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4769.68s)]
*  So he said we think he's in Florida [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4772.68s)]
*  so he sends me to Florida to look for him, but he wasn't he wasn't down there and [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4775.04s)]
*  The deal was that if I did find him I'd call the FBI [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4780.280000000001s)]
*  And they would snatch him and we'd stage a hit [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4785.72s)]
*  Or if they found them, you know, we do the reverse they'd stage a hit but we never found them [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4789.2s)]
*  So now [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4797.400000000001s)]
*  All this time I never carried a gun I [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4799.4400000000005s)]
*  Never carried a gun in this whole operation. Really? Yeah, was that unusual? [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4803.0s)]
*  No, because these guys don't carry guns on a daily basis the mob, you know mafia guys [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4807.68s)]
*  They don't know no because they're always getting rousted by the cops got it [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4813.36s)]
*  All right. The only time they carry a piece is when they're gonna go go do some work, right, you know [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4817.88s)]
*  So did you see guys get killed no, I don't believe you [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4825.0s)]
*  Those sneaky as no one ever heard of my life so we we [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4835.04s)]
*  Let's move on we let's move on we [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4840.74s)]
*  Maybe lose my train of thought [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4847.58s)]
*  No, so [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4850.82s)]
*  We're in the club so I get the contract for Bruno, but obviously I can't find them bureau can't find him [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4853.58s)]
*  Did anybody ever find him? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So what happens is we're in a club one day [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4860.3s)]
*  in the motion lounge and [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4865.94s)]
*  I [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4871.0599999999995s)]
*  Said he gets a phone call and he says ain't done. He said [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4872.26s)]
*  We think Bruno's at such-such a place and [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4878.74s)]
*  But it was it wasn't it was bad info was bad info [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4884.82s)]
*  So I was asked well, what would you do if he was there? I [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4889.74s)]
*  said I [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4893.82s)]
*  hate to say but Bruno probably was a dead man and [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4895.42s)]
*  And [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4898.46s)]
*  Well, how could you say that? [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4899.660000000001s)]
*  Well, because when you're given a contract [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4902.14s)]
*  It's your responsibility that guy gets killed and if you refuse the contract [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4905.38s)]
*  You get killed you're gonna you're gonna get whacked so would you have had to do it [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4913.700000000001s)]
*  Well, if you found them, I could give it to some took one of the other guys to do it [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4918.1s)]
*  But it's my responsibility [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4922.900000000001s)]
*  Right, you know and my whole [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4925.0599999999995s)]
*  look [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4928.299999999999s)]
*  My mindset in undercover is I'm not dying for a gangster, right? [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4929.66s)]
*  I'd die for a citizen. I'll take a beating for a citizen, but not for a gangster, you know, that's [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4936.46s)]
*  He's gonna get whacked either way. He's gonna go out either way. Right? So I'll take my shot with the government [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4944.42s)]
*  Right [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4950.4s)]

*  And try to you know, hopefully send you to jail but I'm not gonna die for you, right [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4977.200000000001s)]
*  I'm not pulling you know, so it's a situation where your back is against the wall. Exactly. So [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4984.04s)]
*  But I but you know that that didn't happen. Did they ever find him? Yeah. Yeah, they found them [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=4989.92s)]

*  so [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=5012.24s)]
*  Now, you know now with the war going on the Bureau decides that [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=5013.48s)]
*  Well, we got it. We got to shut the operation down [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=5017.679999999999s)]
*  So those hits took place on May 5th [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqm4jVfcG4&t=5022.679999999999s)]
