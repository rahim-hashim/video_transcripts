# Joe Rogan Experience #1404 - Bryan Callen
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [December 20, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyj5AfaJfVo)
*  Ba ba ba da.
*  Mm mm mm mm mm.
*  Brian Callan had his first taste of turmeric coffee.
*  Do you know there's an R in turmeric?
*  Yes.
*  A lot of people don't.
*  I've been eating turmeric since, well, the 70s, back when I was living in India.
*  I would have bet my life there was no R until about four months ago.
*  Really?
*  Turmeric?
*  Yeah, I didn't think there was an R.
*  Turmeric.
*  I thought it was turmeric.
*  Yeah.
*  I thought it was T-U-M-E-R-I-C or whatever.
*  No, the Indians have been using it forever.
*  Oh yeah, they have, but I'm just saying I didn't know how to spell it.
*  That's why as a kid I had no inflammation in my body.
*  You just ate turmeric all the time.
*  Did your pee smell weird?
*  I was the turmeric kid.
*  What else makes your pee smell weird besides asparagus?
*  I think sometimes coffee.
*  Look, I'm 52.
*  My body is betraying me, which is why I'm having my Laird Hamilton super coffee right
*  now.
*  That's good stuff, right?
*  Look at him.
*  His body's not betraying him.
*  Still jacked at 55.
*  What happens is when your body is, I feel like I'm in wet cement when I wake up.
*  Now, for the first time in my life, my feet, I've got to warm them up before I get out
*  of bed, all that bullshit.
*  Now, old Brian's going to a doc.
*  I'm telling you this right now on Joe Rogan.
*  I'm going to get jacked.
*  I told you.
*  If I look a little vain here and my skin looks a little more flushed, don't ask questions.
*  Just know that I got a good doctor.
*  You got to get on the TRT, Brian.
*  I can't wait.
*  I can't wait.
*  You should have gone a long time ago.
*  Why don't you listen to me?
*  I don't know.
*  I just, because I want to think that my body, my testosterone is a little higher than everybody
*  else's.
*  It was an ego thing.
*  But now, you know what?
*  We're all mortal.
*  Yes.
*  I have wear and tear for sure from all the years of beating up my body, like joints and
*  stuff like that.
*  I just had to get some stem cells shot into my knee.
*  I've had some shot into my shoulder, stuff like that.
*  In terms of energy and vitality and health, I feel fucking great.
*  Here's what I do.
*  Here's my, I can see it.
*  You got to, ooh, you're wiggly.
*  I do.
*  I'm 52.
*  I feel fucking great.
*  I'm in the sauna almost every day.
*  I have a sauna here.
*  I've got a sauna in my house.
*  Really?
*  You and I are going to sauna after this Russian style.
*  Let's do it.
*  Let's do it.
*  All right.
*  Dude, that's so good for you, man.
*  It means something.
*  Something's happening for sure.
*  After I get out of there, I'm just like a little looser.
*  It's a percentage.
*  I don't know what percentage it is.
*  Is it 10%?
*  Is it more?
*  But there's a feeling that you get after you do a good sauna session where everything is
*  just like, feels good.
*  Yeah, but you know, a lot of this also has to do with arriving at a point in your life
*  where you're happy with what you've done, the decisions you've made.
*  So I sleep for me, eight hours of sleep, seven and a half hours.
*  And then as long as I don't eat for 12 hours.
*  So if I finished eating at eight, I'll start eating at eight again or 10.
*  That for me, 12 to 14 hours, I guess is intermittent fasting.
*  Those two things.
*  I haven't had a cold in, I don't know, 15 months.
*  You're so trendy.
*  I know.
*  Pavel told me, Pavel Tatsulin, who's amazing.
*  The kettlebell monster.
*  Fucking such an honor to have him in here.
*  I'm a big fan of that guy.
*  He told me, eat one today.
*  Really?
*  Big giant meal at dinner.
*  That's it.
*  At dinner?
*  Yep.
*  So how does he stay?
*  He's just hard, bro, like nails.
*  Yeah, but I think I get fucking skinny.
*  Shakes your hand like this.
*  Like it looks you in the eye and shakes your hand.
*  I'm like, bro, are we fighting?
*  What's happening here?
*  This is a fucking heavy duty handshake.
*  Just a resting alpha.
*  He's an animal.
*  He's an animal.
*  And his methods are so, contrary to how you would normally think about weightlifting in
*  particular, going to failure all the time, but yet also make sense.
*  He's saying do it more often, have longer breaks.
*  It's about strength.
*  Strength is the most important thing.
*  Strength.
*  His company is called Strength First for that reason.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  He's like, if you can do something for 10 repetitions, you want to do about five and
*  then you want to wait between five and 10 minutes before you do it again.
*  He's right.
*  It makes sense.
*  Most of us do not have that kind of fucking time.
*  And for sure, you can get in tremendous shape with a crossfit workout or a high, what is
*  it, hit high intensity where you're doing box jumps.
*  You can certainly get, look, there's some people out there that are in phenomenal shape
*  working out like that.
*  But what makes sense about what he's saying is just like the amount of time required for
*  your body to recover.
*  If you give yourself your body's ability to recover in between sets, you let everything
*  sort of come back to baseline before you jack it up again like another set.
*  Like your body has more time to recover and you can perform more work.
*  And so your body adapts better.
*  The idea is that you're overwhelming your body when you're going to failure.
*  You're just beating the shit out of it.
*  You're also getting injured.
*  It'd be interesting to see how many of his guys get injured.
*  But my impression of every CrossFit athlete that I know is always like this.
*  Watch.
*  Now I'm getting back into it.
*  I just got to pull the, something's always-
*  That's Jiu Jitsu too, man.
*  Yes, same thing.
*  And I'm a big proponent of that as well.
*  But as you get older, I can't get injured.
*  I'm doing, I don't know if you know this, but I'm a thespian.
*  I'm on a show called Schooled on ABC, guys.
*  And you jump around a lot.
*  You're very physical.
*  I'm very fit.
*  By the way-
*  You're like a dancer.
*  By the way, do you want to talk about physical?
*  On the show, we had Bill Goldberg on.
*  And you know Bill.
*  I love that dude.
*  The best.
*  I love him.
*  Now he walks around at a very trim.
*  He's my age.
*  250.
*  Oh, 260.
*  When he was wrestling, he was 280.
*  And what you don't realize is he played professional football for, I think it was four or seven
*  years.
*  So he's the real deal.
*  And just a real athlete.
*  He's also a very nice guy.
*  The best.
*  I love him.
*  I did a show called Garage Mahal.
*  And they redid my garage and turned it into a whole training center.
*  Like with a cage.
*  They put a cage and hung heavy bags.
*  And put pictures of old UFC fights on the wall.
*  It's fucking amazing.
*  He's a guy who brings it 100% every time, whether it's acting and so.
*  And by the way, he comes in and I'm like, your neck looks so thick.
*  He goes, first thing I work out.
*  First thing.
*  He's one of those guys like Chuck Liddell when you're close to him.
*  He breathes differently.
*  Like, you know, with a race car.
*  Like he's like, what's going on?
*  He's like, Shelby GT 500.
*  I'm like, how much did you sleep?
*  He's like, I don't sleep.
*  I've been up and wired.
*  And anyway, so we had this thing where I was playing a quarterback and he had to.
*  Look at the size of that guy.
*  Oh, it's ridiculous.
*  That's what he looks like right now.
*  That's what he looks like right now.
*  And he insisted.
*  He had a stunt double.
*  The stunt double didn't do anything.
*  He did all the stunts himself to the point where he had to rush at me in a touch football
*  game.
*  I on the quarterback and he had to hit two dudes.
*  Bro, look at that picture.
*  I mean, smoked a little weed before this podcast.
*  I'm not going to lie to people, but that picture is kind of freaking me out.
*  He's got a great body.
*  He's so big.
*  He's so massive.
*  But here's the thing about him, man.
*  It's really interesting that the profession of professional wrestling is unbelievably
*  brutal on your body.
*  Yes.
*  I mean, guys, I don't think get respected enough for how hard that job is to do.
*  They're doing it hundreds of nights, 200 plus nights a year, and they're throwing each other
*  around and they get smashed.
*  But what I was going to say is he has come out of it better than most, for sure.
*  Because he's never stopped working out and he never stopped stretching.
*  So we'll be on set.
*  That guy's stretching.
*  He says length of strength.
*  He's always moving his body.
*  Kurt Angle told me on set of Warrior, he told me that he got injured way more.
*  He said gold medals in the Olympics as a wrestler.
*  Got injured way more doing professional wrestling.
*  Oh, for sure.
*  And Bill told me the same thing.
*  But he had to come at me and he said, look, I'm going to knock these two guys down and
*  I'm coming for your head.
*  I'm going to dive and come at you.
*  So you have to duck.
*  This is unschooled?
*  Yes.
*  Oh no.
*  Oh my God, so you have to duck.
*  But I had never seen, I'd never been that close to a former pro football player.
*  These are stuntmen, strong guys, but it's a different thing.
*  He would just come off that line and his speed and he would hit these two dudes with his,
*  he'd go like that.
*  And the thud, it sounded like maybe when two elephants hit, like just, you know that, that,
*  that, that.
*  And they would go, they went flying backwards, horizontal, and then he comes and dives and
*  would come for my head.
*  And I, I, we kept having to do the takeover because I'm a coward and I would, I would,
*  you know, I look like a potato bug, you know, where you, anyway.
*  I feel like Goldberg is a guy who could do the same kind of movies that The Rock does.
*  I do too.
*  I feel like he could be a gigantic movie star.
*  I think he's a good actor.
*  That's the other thing.
*  I think he's really good on the show.
*  Look at him.
*  He's a gigantic dude.
*  I think he could be a big movie star.
*  I think he could do any kind of those action movies.
*  I know he's done a bunch, but I mean, I think he could be a huge mega star.
*  He's got all the personality.
*  He's a really nice guy.
*  100%.
*  Smart, funny.
*  Yeah, he's smart.
*  He's with it.
*  Like you talk to the guy, he's right there.
*  And very humble for a fucking ridiculously huge giant person.
*  Just such, but such a weird athlete, his hands, his fingers.
*  Like I was like, how do you dial a cell phone?
*  Your fingers are too fucking thick.
*  You're hitting two numbers.
*  Pedro, he was working for Fuji at the time and they installed, oh no, he was working
*  for Zebra, excuse me, at the time.
*  And then he works for Fuji now.
*  And Jimmy Pedro is a gold medalist in the Olympics for Judo.
*  And Jimmy Pedro set everything up and he put the, they put these mats down on like a raised
*  platform so it had like a little bounce to it.
*  Like if you fell, you got slammed or something like that.
*  And so they tested it out.
*  So by testing it out, Jimmy Pedro, who probably weighs 175 maybe?
*  Let me see him.
*  You know, lean, thin, very strong guy.
*  He's throwing around Goldberg.
*  Oh, he was?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, Goldberg was letting him.
*  He was executing throws on him.
*  And Goldberg will throw himself.
*  But you see Pedro's technique is such that it's so good that he can do this.
*  Oh shit.
*  Like look how easy.
*  That's my garage, son.
*  So watch how he does this.
*  I mean, this is also, this is Jimmy Pedro way after he's done competing.
*  He teaches now.
*  Look at that.
*  Boom son.
*  Look at that technique.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Look at those hip tosses.
*  Fucking perfect.
*  Just perfect technique.
*  Look how much bigger Goldberg is than him.
*  But he can throw him around.
*  And now he's showing Goldberg how to do it.
*  Yeah.
*  Goldberg knows all this shit already.
*  You ever see him kick and punch?
*  Yeah man.
*  I have.
*  I've seen him work out.
*  He's fucking legit as fuck.
*  Very much so.
*  That's an uneducated statement.
*  He's fucking legit as fuck.
*  He's legit as fuck.
*  Oh look at this.
*  No, I said he's fucking legit as fuck.
*  I added an extra fuck and it ruined the whole sentence.
*  It's all about harmony.
*  Yeah, but he's, like I said, he's with it.
*  It's there.
*  He's also remarkably uninjured for someone who did what he did for so long.
*  He knows a lot about exercise physiology.
*  I know he's got some bumps.
*  I know he's got some shit going on.
*  But he still looks like him.
*  A lot of these guys are fucked up, man, where the back injuries have forced them to be very
*  tight and rigid and they can't move so good anymore.
*  I swear Diamond Dallas Page has done an amazing job, is getting these guys into yoga and getting
*  these guys specifically into his style of yoga, which is a lot of dynamic tension stuff
*  too.
*  He's helped so many of those guys get over serious back injuries.
*  He has?
*  Yes.
*  Because Dallas' back was fucked up, man.
*  All those years of getting body slammed, all those years of picking up giant guys, all
*  that shit.
*  His back was fucked up.
*  And he still has a fucked up back.
*  He does yoga every day and his back is so strong that it keeps everything in place.
*  So all those yoga techniques, what's really done better than anything for these wrestlers
*  is stabilize their back through a dynamic range.
*  You're doing standing bow, you're leaning forward and doing that T thing when you stand
*  on one leg.
*  All that kind of shit is tremendous for your spine and your cord.
*  And so that protects a lot of guys with back injuries.
*  Yes, look at that.
*  Bro, he's in his 60s.
*  He did that without even warming up out here in the garage.
*  I could never do that.
*  He just picks up his foot and stands up like that.
*  Bam!
*  I think Dallas is like 66 or something like that.
*  He's in tremendous shape.
*  He's a great guy too.
*  That's crazy.
*  Super infectious personality.
*  He's so friendly and happy.
*  And he does so much for other people that are sick and injured.
*  He's got a bunch of videos of these guys, like that guy right there, who was so fucked
*  up that he was walking with crutches.
*  He could barely get along.
*  And by the end of it, Dallas had him running.
*  He had him doing yoga.
*  Look at there.
*  He's standing on his head.
*  Like, he made the guy lost a shitload of weight.
*  You got to do you.
*  Keeping flexible is more important than anything else.
*  Dallas helps these guys.
*  He even had a separate house, right?
*  Where he's keeping like Jake the snake and a couple of these guys in.
*  He had a separate house for them.
*  Or he was like helping rehabilitate them and bring them back to health.
*  The other thing about getting older is you get sore faster.
*  I had to have a...
*  That's such a stupid thing.
*  I had to have a wrestling match with my jeans.
*  Don't ask.
*  I couldn't get them off in the show.
*  Why don't you get stretchy jeans?
*  No, but it was part of the comedy.
*  Oh, that you couldn't move good in your jeans?
*  So they give you extra tight jeans?
*  Guys, I don't want to give away the episode of school.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  You're going to have to wait.
*  Can you see your hog?
*  Can you see your hog in your pants?
*  I tied it to my leg.
*  As you know, because he's unruly and he's always wanting to get in the feed bucket.
*  You know what I mean?
*  That wasn't part of the joke though.
*  Sorry.
*  No, but I had to do that like 50 takes.
*  And well, I was sore the next day.
*  Oh yeah, for sure.
*  I was sore the next day.
*  Did you have mats?
*  From comedy.
*  I was sore from physical comedy yesterday.
*  That's some serious physical comedy.
*  That is a point that I've heard before and I don't know if this is true, but many people
*  have told me, and this is like this long standing thing that, you know, Chevy Chase is kind
*  of known as a grumpy guy.
*  They said that Chevy Chase did so many prat falls that he's in pain all the time.
*  That's interesting.
*  Just stop and think about all the times you saw Chevy Chase fall down in movies and in
*  TV shows.
*  And one of the things that happens obviously to older athletes that play football or combat
*  sports or boxing is getting beat up like that, getting slammed around like that.
*  They get bad backs.
*  They get headaches.
*  They get a little bit of PTSD.
*  You still feel good.
*  You're always in pain.
*  Yeah.
*  Especially the athletes get the PTSD.
*  But what you're seeing with him, it very well could be that that guy hurt his body real
*  bad doing prat falls.
*  Buster Keaton, who was like the very first ever stunt man, who did crazy shit, man.
*  Have you ever watched like some old Buster Keaton films?
*  The stunts that that guy did back when they couldn't fake anything.
*  Like nuts, but he was always getting beat up.
*  His body was fucked up, man.
*  Yeah, here's Chevy Chase falling down.
*  Bro, I got news for you.
*  This is all legit.
*  And he fell a lot, man, constantly.
*  He was like almost like a Tom Green type character, but also a brilliant actor and comedian.
*  So he fell all the fucking time.
*  So I'm guessing as a person who's fallen a bunch of times, that guy's probably in
*  pain a lot.
*  Like all the time.
*  Like people always say Chevy Chase is so grumpy.
*  Maybe he's just fucking in pain all the time.
*  Yeah, maybe he just doesn't feel good.
*  No, dude, you can't feel, there's no way.
*  Dude, that's just a few.
*  He fell on Saturday Night Live all the time.
*  Didn't he fall on Fletch?
*  Remember that cop movie?
*  Do you think Ashland Pooner think he fell through the ceiling?
*  Fell on everything.
*  Bro, he fell through everything.
*  So for me, some of it might have been stunt men.
*  I was boxing so much and what I would do is I would just get in the ring and I would
*  just start hitting the mitts kind of light.
*  And by light I mean, you know, I don't know, 30%.
*  And then in about a minute I'm going full because I'm warmed up.
*  I feel great.
*  And a guy who is a trainer walked by.
*  He used to be a pro football player and now he trains a lot of pro athletes and he knows
*  his shit.
*  And he walked by and he goes, he looks at me and he goes, Chris Camacho.
*  Chris looked at me and goes, he's not warming up again, huh?
*  Guy in his 50s?
*  Cool, just going at it, huh?
*  And he just looked at me and kind of went, yeah, that's all he said.
*  He knew, he knew.
*  And sure enough, sure enough, I'm still now I haven't been able to box in, I don't know,
*  three months.
*  Dude.
*  Because I fucked myself up because I didn't warm up.
*  You're talking to a moron who had stem cells shot in his knee the other day because I tore
*  my meniscus in a kicking contest with Joe Schilling when I had my pants on.
*  I'm a moron.
*  You're kicking a wall.
*  I was like, there's no...
*  Full blast.
*  Of course.
*  No, it's got to, it gives a little bit.
*  Sure.
*  Because it's a padded thing that's a block that sits on the board that measures the amount
*  of power.
*  Whatever.
*  I was watching you kick it going, that's not good.
*  That's not good.
*  That wall's not given.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Done it.
*  It's not, I'll tell you one thing though.
*  I'm not confident enough to side kick it, like turning back kick it.
*  Like really, really do the hardest kick that I could do into it.
*  I don't want, it doesn't give enough.
*  You know, like a spinning back kick or a turning side kick.
*  The amount of torque that's involved when you have that knee up and you turn in the
*  corner and then you shove that fucking thing through.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh my God, the amount of torque that's involved.
*  If that thing doesn't move, that's going to all be in your knee.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm not interested in doing that.
*  So I won't do that.
*  But I'll kick it roundhouse kick.
*  Roundhouse kick, you can kick a fucking bag that's not even going to give it all.
*  They have those Fairtex bags that are like 300 pounds.
*  You ever seen those big giant fat ones?
*  You could dig into that motherfucker and your leg's okay.
*  Your leg kind of gives too.
*  There's like a little bit of flex to a roundhouse kick.
*  But a straight kick, it's like so much of it is on the joint of the knee.
*  So much of it, like a side kick in particular.
*  So much of it when you extend, like there's a lot of pressure on that knee and a lot of
*  pressure on the foot too if you hit it wrong.
*  Like if you hit it with the ball of the foot instead of the heel, oh my God, you could
*  break your ankle.
*  But you know, I feel like guys like Henry Cejudo, those guys coming out of the Olympic
*  training centers, like the national coach for the USA Gymnastics team, he was like,
*  my athletes don't get injured.
*  I mean, for the most part.
*  He said because the way we build them structurally and the boring as shit exercises we have our
*  athletes do before they start kind of putting that kind of pressure on their joints is pedantic.
*  It's piecemeal.
*  But I was wondering, like I'll see someone like Cejudo who is a fucking, obviously a
*  maniac with the way he trains.
*  But he, there's a science.
*  When you live at the Olympic training center, there's a science with all those guys.
*  They're working out.
*  There's no meathead shit.
*  Oh, no question.
*  They're working out very specifically.
*  He had those neuro-force guys in here.
*  That's the name of the company, right?
*  Neuro-force that helped train him.
*  They have all these like really like high tech cutting edge training methods.
*  Yeah.
*  But you know, he did get injured.
*  Oh, he did?
*  He fucked his shoulder up in his last fight.
*  He's actually had surgery since then.
*  In a fight, yeah.
*  Because that's not natural.
*  Yeah.
*  The TJ Dillishaw fight, which happened, you know, it was a very quick.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, no, no, no.
*  Marlon Marais.
*  That's right.
*  It was the Marlon Marais fight.
*  It was post TJ Dillishaw.
*  That Marlon Marais fight was fucking incredible.
*  The fact that that guy was able to weather that storm of that first round and look, Marlon
*  Marais in that first round looked like an assassin.
*  He looked like one of the best fighters ever.
*  And then Cejudo.
*  And he is.
*  But Cejudo just changed everything in the second round.
*  He got in his face.
*  He put it to him.
*  He pressured him.
*  And Marlon was, he felt too big, too big when he was cutting the weight.
*  Like he came in too heavy and it was too much of a drain on him.
*  And Cejudo just overwhelmed him.
*  How would Aldo do against Cejudo?
*  I've heard from other MMA fighters that they'd like to see that match up.
*  You really would never know until they fought.
*  You'd never, never know.
*  But I like Aldo at 135 pounds.
*  He looks so good against Marais.
*  It's interesting though, like the UFC, it seems like is saying that Aldo could get a
*  title shot even though he lost the decision to Marais.
*  So I haven't talked to anybody.
*  I don't know what their position is on that decision.
*  I didn't think the decision was right.
*  I felt like Aldo controlled so much more of the fight.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't like the, I've said it a hundred times.
*  I'll say it a hundred and one.
*  I don't like the way these fights are scored.
*  I don't think we should be using this really blunt tool for fine work.
*  I think there's a lot that goes on in a fight and we should probably have a conference where
*  martial arts experts and you know, whether it's from different disciplines, wrestling,
*  kickboxing, whatever.
*  Everybody get together and just let's try to come up with a better solution.
*  Someone should be able to come up with a better scoring system.
*  It doesn't have to be one to 10.
*  This one to 10 is so arbitrary.
*  Did you see Aldo landing more shots?
*  Yes.
*  I felt like he was pressuring way more.
*  He felt like he was hitting him harder, particularly after the first round.
*  The first round Marais has one of the very best switch kicks in the game, man.
*  His left high switch kick, he fucks everybody up with that man.
*  Aldo just blocks it, pop.
*  Well, he got hit with it.
*  Like the first shot that Marais threw was that fucking switch kick, man.
*  His left switch kick is a thing of beauty.
*  It's so fast, but it's also so loose.
*  He throws it like a whip, man.
*  It surprises you.
*  It surprises me.
*  And I've seen him do it to Jimmy Rivera.
*  I've seen him do it to, who else did he do it to?
*  He's done it to a bunch of guys.
*  He just comes out of nowhere.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Who the fuck else did he catch with that left switch kick?
*  I can't.
*  Aljamine Sterling.
*  That's right.
*  He caught him with it too.
*  Dude, he knocked Aljamine out cold.
*  Jesus.
*  It's a beauty.
*  Check this out.
*  See if you can find, watch this.
*  Watch this shit.
*  So Marais' switch kick is like, if you wanted to model yourself after a switch kick, it
*  would be his to the head and Barbosa's to the body.
*  They're very different.
*  They're very different switch kicks.
*  Yeah.
*  Because his is like faster.
*  It's weird, man.
*  It's like he throws it and you don't see it coming.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Throw it right there.
*  Let's see it.
*  I want to see the actual one that he landed on Aldo.
*  See that?
*  That was perfect right there.
*  But go to the one that he did on Aldo if you can find that.
*  The switch kick he landed on Aldo early in the first round.
*  He does it so, it's like a whip.
*  It's so loose.
*  It seems like he just does it effortlessly.
*  Barbosa's though to the body and to the leg.
*  I've been stabbing cage shots of that against Paul Felder.
*  It's so crazy.
*  Holy shit.
*  The switch kick is so crazy.
*  You just go, what?
*  Is there frames missing from that video?
*  Horrifying.
*  It's like there's frames missing.
*  Right?
*  Yeah.
*  Who edited it?
*  Well, the guy I think the 35, the guy who just fought our boy Uriah Faber.
*  Oh my God.
*  Uriah looks great.
*  40 years old.
*  He looks phenomenal.
*  But Jesus.
*  He's a monster.
*  He's a monster.
*  He's so strong.
*  It's a stacked division, man.
*  He's strong, man.
*  Like not, I mean, he's one of those dudes that looks normal, but I think he's way stronger
*  than he looks.
*  Yeah.
*  There's guys that exist like that.
*  Yes.
*  And a lot of them are-
*  Like chimp strength.
*  A lot of them are Russian.
*  That's right.
*  A lot of them are Russian.
*  There's something about some of those Russian dudes.
*  You grab them and you're like, hey, what are you made out of?
*  And Russian, by the way, you can also say most of the great wrestlers and stuff are
*  from places like Azerbaijan, Dagestan, the Turkmen people, where fighting is a way of
*  life.
*  Morize hits all different things.
*  Okay.
*  Watch how he does this.
*  Watch how loose this is.
*  Come on, man.
*  That's amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  But Aldo looks great.
*  It's so sweet.
*  Oh shit.
*  See how it whips?
*  Like I'm telling you, man, he might be the best in the world that left high switch hits
*  my head.
*  See, Aldo still had his hand up there.
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I mean, look, Aldo's fine, but he did rock him.
*  He definitely caught him.
*  And I don't care who the fuck you are, that right there is going to hurt.
*  Ouch.
*  Yeah, see, it didn't really block.
*  It just glanced off the top of his head.
*  Dude, Aldo looks amazing at 135.
*  He looks amazing.
*  I think he could be a world champion at 135.
*  No bullshit.
*  I can't believe he can suck that away.
*  He's only 33.
*  I was going to say, and I have no problem with him fighting for the title.
*  You know why?
*  Because for nine years he was untouchable.
*  Yeah.
*  Nine years.
*  He's either 32 or 33.
*  He is not old.
*  He's in his athletic prime.
*  Yeah.
*  Dude.
*  A lot of miles on him though.
*  Oh yeah, for sure.
*  You see a lot of scar tissue on him and you know, but still he's got a zest for fighting.
*  He fought really hard this past fight.
*  Yes he did.
*  I mean, whether or not you'd agree with the decision or not, it's a conversation really.
*  I mean, I'm not right.
*  I have my own opinion.
*  I felt like Aldo did enough to win.
*  I felt like, I think people, I think there was a moment in the first round where you
*  could say Marais took control early, landed some good shots and then he did get the taketown
*  later in the fight, in the first round.
*  Yeah, that was significant.
*  The first round is like a tricky one.
*  The first round is a tricky one.
*  Like I could see you giving that to Marais.
*  It was still a close fight.
*  It doesn't matter.
*  I mean, I was fine with either one.
*  I wanted Aldo because I love Aldo, but you know.
*  I just don't buy the way they're scoring things.
*  It just doesn't make any sense to me.
*  I just don't, I don't know how you're going to get a 10-9 and then another 10-9 is a totally
*  different thing.
*  Like you could have a 10-9 where a guy beats the shit out of a guy and you could have a
*  10-9 where who knows who won the round.
*  You could have a 10-9 where almost nothing happens or you have a 10-9 that's crazy.
*  That doesn't make sense to me.
*  Right.
*  It doesn't make sense.
*  Boxing is definitely more clear.
*  Did you like the, two weapons.
*  Two weapons.
*  True.
*  Two weapons.
*  No takedowns.
*  What's better?
*  A takedown or punches?
*  What's better?
*  A jab or a body kick?
*  What's better?
*  What's better?
*  I don't know.
*  We've got to figure this out.
*  You can't just have guys lose decisions and there's decisions being made by people who
*  shouldn't even be in this conversation as far as like what's more or less valuable in
*  terms of like technique.
*  I would score it like this.
*  I think, so if you're a boxer, landing a jab is always easier than landing a right hand
*  against somebody who's equally as good as you are.
*  So landing a right hand is a motherfucker.
*  So for me, I would always count, so I think that a push kick with your front foot is not
*  the same as a switch kick that blasts somebody in their fucking head or their ribs.
*  I would count those kinds of, I don't know how you would categorize it, but maybe like
*  the equivalent of what a right hand is, which is somebody trying to actually close the deal,
*  knock you out versus set you up with a jab.
*  Setting you up with a jab, setting you up with a front kick, setting you up with those
*  things is different than blasting somebody with a double leg, blasting somebody with
*  a back foot roundhouse kick, a wheel kick.
*  Exactly.
*  There's so many weapons.
*  Yeah.
*  There's so many.
*  I don't know how you do that though.
*  How would you, because that's a strike regardless and sometimes that strike doesn't, you know,
*  it doesn't do anything to you.
*  Well, you can, yeah, you can have a guy who's like super durable, right?
*  And you catch him with a couple of really good shots, but then he takes you down and
*  lands a couple of good elbows.
*  Who won the exchange?
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, maybe if the end of the round is the guy's on top, I have no evidence that you're
*  going to get up.
*  You know, you might get up eventually, but so far you're on the ground and he's holding
*  you down.
*  He's punching you.
*  That means a lot.
*  Then again, somebody can take your back, right?
*  And they're controlling you, but you're doing great defense.
*  Yeah, but it means a lot that the guy took your back.
*  We got it.
*  We got it.
*  I mean, we have to look at it in terms of like your, your percentage of being successful
*  once you get to a position increases with the complexity, the position, the control
*  that you get in that position.
*  So if you get a person in half guard, that is not as good as you having someone's back
*  with the body triangle on and one arm around the neck and one arm controlling the hand.
*  Right.
*  Even if the guy has not tapped, that guy's in significant danger.
*  Well, wrestling and wrestling, you get a point for an escape.
*  You get a point.
*  You, when you take somebody down, you get a point for that.
*  But when you take their back, that's two points.
*  Right.
*  That's fine.
*  But you're close to finishing his life and you have his back.
*  Yeah.
*  This point shit.
*  I don't want to hear this.
*  When you get a guy's back, you got a body triangle in, you got an arm around the neck
*  and you control the other arm, somehow or another, you're really close to taking his
*  life.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the difference.
*  So this point stuff, that's great.
*  Like what's more important and escape is when a guy has your fucking back and he has an
*  arm under your chin and you're just fighting hands.
*  You don't want to be there, man.
*  And if he has enough squeeze and enough energy to just fuck like Damien, Maya can make people
*  tap across their face.
*  He can, he gets you across your face and he cranks your fucking neck.
*  He knows how to manipulate necks.
*  So it's not just like him squeezing and hoping that it works.
*  He's going to get his shoulder into it and he's going to get all this torque in your
*  neck.
*  He doesn't have to go into your neck.
*  You ever see his fight with Rick Storey?
*  Yeah.
*  He's choking him and blood is squirting out of Storey's nose as he's squeezing his neck.
*  I mean, it's all, that's Damien, Maya.
*  Do you know who I train with now?
*  Who's nice enough to teach me?
*  It's Higgin Machado.
*  I love Higgin.
*  I love him.
*  By the way, where's his school?
*  I want to give him a shout out.
*  His school's on...
*  It's on the beach somewhere, right?
*  No, it's on Wilshire, 8126 Wilshire Boulevard.
*  Bro, he just gave Ashton Kutcher a brown belt.
*  I know he did.
*  Ashton Kutcher is legit.
*  He must be legit.
*  I got Shob so riled up on the podcast because I said to Shob, Shob goes, it just bothered
*  me that Higgin said that Ashton could beat Conor McGregor in Jiu Jitsu.
*  And I went, I knew I'd get to him.
*  And I went, well, he's 6'4, he's got very long arms.
*  He goes, he would destroy Ashton Kutcher in under a minute.
*  I got him so riled up.
*  I was like, I don't know, bro.
*  I just kept going, I don't know.
*  He lost his mind.
*  It's not impossible for someone who's really dedicated to Jiu Jitsu to get to a point where
*  they could tap an MMA fighter because most elite MMA fighters have many, many skills
*  and many, many different things that they're working on constantly.
*  If you're just concentrating on Jiu Jitsu, particularly with the leg lock guys, yeah,
*  they're going to be better at it.
*  Just like if you just go to box, you know, if someone invites you, you know, like Terrence
*  Crawford invites someone to go to his camp and box.
*  In fact, TJ Dillashaw said that about Lomachenko, that he boxed with Lomachenko and it felt
*  like he was just being kind to him.
*  Of course.
*  It felt like once the guy opened up, he was like, oh shit.
*  Yeah.
*  That's his sport now.
*  But Lomachenko was nice to him.
*  Of course he was.
*  Didn't fuck him up.
*  Speaking of warming up, there's a great video of him warming up and I watched it.
*  I was like, oh, that's how a pro does it.
*  Lomachenko?
*  Yeah.
*  And he's like one arm, one arm, one arm, one arm, one arm, one arm, switch stance, switch
*  stance, switch stance, one arm, one arm, one arm, everything is slow and methodical.
*  He's not doing anything stupid.
*  He has like a whole system that he does to warm his body up before he starts moving really
*  fast and throwing punches.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's 26 or whatever.
*  Yeah.
*  Here it is right here.
*  And he goes, yeah, this is what you're supposed to do when you're a fucking professional.
*  I've had a chance to see it live once with Manny Pacquiao.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Manny Pacquiao was doing this thing at Wild Card Boxing and I got to watch him train
*  a little bit and I got to watch him warm up with these bands.
*  He has these little bands and he does these warm up things.
*  He warms everything.
*  I mean, his body is a race car.
*  He's not doing that dumb shit that you and I would do.
*  Just go in there and see how much can you bench.
*  You mean just getting in there and going?
*  Yeah.
*  Ari and Bert and Tom were in the back fucking around with my weights and none of them could
*  do 225.
*  And so I went back there and I was like, can you do 225?
*  And I was drunk.
*  I was like, fuck yeah, I could do 225.
*  God damn it.
*  So I did 225 for 12.
*  I would have stopped you immediately.
*  No warm up, 51 years old.
*  Terrible idea.
*  It's so stupid.
*  It's pretty damn good though.
*  I'm glad it didn't hurt anything.
*  That's exactly how you hurt something.
*  I'm easily going to pop.
*  Of course, the weights come down, boom, pin me to the chest.
*  I don't have to roll out from under them.
*  But you got competitive.
*  And then my arm swells up with blood because it's you ever see a guy when they blow their
*  bicep or their chest, their peck out?
*  Yes.
*  Oh, it's so nasty.
*  I feel like you and I should do a dance competition and show Bert and Tom up.
*  But Tom and Bert are both athletic dudes.
*  They're actually both athletic guys.
*  Here's my prediction.
*  Yeah, Tom can dance his ass off.
*  Yeah.
*  He can legit dance his ass off.
*  You ever see him swing a golf club?
*  He's an athletic dude.
*  Yeah, he's a big dude too.
*  They're both big guys.
*  They're both big guys.
*  Here's my prediction.
*  They keep ramping it up.
*  Really?
*  I don't think we're done.
*  I think you're about to see some epic shit.
*  Really?
*  I think they're going to keep ramping it up.
*  I feel like I want in.
*  I mean, I know I'm being derivative and I'm copying, but I want to fucking dance.
*  Why don't you have your own?
*  I think they both already have scripts written for their retorts and I don't know who's going
*  to go first.
*  Well, it's got to be Bert.
*  Bert's got to be next because Tom just murdered him.
*  You can't double down.
*  This shit was ruthless.
*  Come here.
*  I mean, come on, man.
*  This shit was ruthless.
*  What happened?
*  Did you spill all over yourself?
*  What happened to you?
*  I spilled, man.
*  I got excited and I spilled.
*  You're spilling your hug?
*  I spilled my fucking turmeric on myself.
*  This video, you've seen this video, right?
*  Come on.
*  Oh, it's the best.
*  Bro, it's amazing.
*  I know it is.
*  But here's what's amazing.
*  He's hilarious.
*  It's actually good.
*  I know.
*  Like this part, like watch this.
*  I mean, come on, look at him moving around.
*  Dude, he can dance great.
*  And that's why he was offended by Burt's.
*  He's like, this dude's pretending he knows how to dance just because he takes his pants
*  off.
*  I'll show you.
*  You get more mad when people give him credit for it too.
*  They're like, oh, look at Burt dancing.
*  He did get mad.
*  Yeah, I didn't understand that.
*  I was a little confused.
*  I felt like he was laying back like if we were going to do a hip hop dance contest.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like he's the guy at the bar that pretends he can't play pool.
*  I mean, I played a couple of times.
*  Oh, by the way, selling those machine shirts.
*  Machine.
*  You can buy those at your mom's house.com.
*  I'm going to buy one of those.
*  I said that I said that I say to Rogan, I put them on a thread.
*  This I think was before they were doing the dance thing.
*  I remember I said to I go, I had Shobb, Eddie, you and me.
*  And I said, let's do a fucking dance off.
*  And then and then and then Rogan comes back with a if we do a dance off, you're going
*  to want to win.
*  And I don't know if I have the time to dedicate to that shit.
*  I was like, he you got serious right away.
*  You get competitive.
*  I'm a moron.
*  Yeah.
*  And you would.
*  You would do whatever you had to do to win.
*  I have kept my most ridiculous moron tendencies at bay for most of my adult life.
*  But when we did sober October last year and I was making the fire alarm go off from my
*  sweat like I was telling them, I'm like, you're going to die.
*  I'm like, if you're going to try to do what I'm willing to do, you're going to die.
*  You don't understand.
*  I work out eight, 10 hours a day.
*  You'll kill yourself.
*  We're going to die.
*  It was like I remember when you were a young man, you said to me, you're like, I think
*  I might fight Wesley Snipes.
*  And I was like, what?
*  And you were because you looked you were like pulsing.
*  You look like a fucking the top like one of those guys who gets caught nuclear waste.
*  Your veins and everything.
*  You're just like and you were breathing like chocolate.
*  I go, hey, what's up?
*  That's not really my I'm just training.
*  I'm training all the time.
*  I was training all the time.
*  I was training twice a day.
*  Yeah, it was really hard.
*  It was great.
*  But I thought it was really going to happen.
*  Like we had lawyers involved.
*  Wesley Snipes is an athlete.
*  He owed a lot of money to the IRS.
*  That's what it was.
*  He he got in a real bad situation, apparently, where someone was advising him that he didn't
*  have to pay taxes.
*  You know, man, man, man, you ever check the Constitution?
*  You're you're you're you're on your own island, your own country.
*  That horse shit doesn't work.
*  My friend did that.
*  My friend did that.
*  This is what he did.
*  He he said he declared himself a sovereign state and then he decided he was going to run
*  illegal substances across state lines.
*  He gets caught and he goes, I'm my own sovereign state.
*  I can do whatever I want.
*  Cop goes, that's awesome.
*  You're going to jail now.
*  They put him in court.
*  He had a whole defense.
*  I'm a sovereign state.
*  I refuse to give you my name.
*  They were like the judge was like, very cool.
*  You're going to jail now for eight months.
*  We'll see you later.
*  Can't can't.
*  And I had a record.
*  I'm going to work out for you.
*  Not well at all.
*  Some people read the Constitution.
*  They somehow or another decided they're experts.
*  Yeah.
*  But what is it?
*  What is it going?
*  There's a lot of that going on these days where people like have this idea that fuck
*  all these legal scholars.
*  Yeah.
*  Like I see the loophole.
*  Yeah.
*  And I'm going to point this out in front of the judge and it will be undeniable.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Bro, pay your taxes.
*  Right.
*  Who's going to who's going to fix the streets?
*  Because they listen to they listen to but usually people just want to be part of a larger
*  thing.
*  Right.
*  So actually, most people are are saying what was given to them.
*  And it feels good emotionally.
*  And one of the things as you get older, that's really important to do is to always be willing
*  not only to change your mind and admit that you probably you could be hopelessly wrong,
*  could be completely wrong, but also to always be able to justify with reason and with measured
*  argument your most cherished beliefs.
*  Okay.
*  Because so much of who we are is what we believe.
*  Right.
*  So much of where I stand politically was all those things I've worked hard to kind of come
*  up with a comprehensive political and philosophical, you know, mooring to stand on.
*  Well, if I am if I if I then relax, and I listen and accept what's given to me without,
*  you know, putting it through the grinder and really sitting down and testing it, then I'm
*  I'm guilty of being philosophically complacent and, you know, and basically, it's just you're
*  a slave to your ego, right?
*  You don't you don't want to admit that you're wrong about things.
*  Yes.
*  But I think you can't be married to ideas.
*  No.
*  And as far as how you go through this life.
*  Yes.
*  And it's how you go through this life now.
*  This is what's very important for people.
*  You know, I try to talk about this as much as possible.
*  You can't get you can't get stuck in your past.
*  Because like mistakes that you made when you were a child can haunt you deep into adulthood.
*  Yes.
*  Because you decide that you're the person who got bullied after seventh grade and you're
*  a loser and everybody hates you.
*  Those feelings you can cling on to those fuckers and they'll weigh you down.
*  You can cling on to them and you can take them into your later life.
*  And I know people that are like, man, they're in their 60s.
*  There was this this maybe you told me this.
*  But did you tell me the story about this dude who was like an older guy that was afraid
*  to walk down a certain road because this other older guy who used to bully him in high school
*  lived there?
*  No, he didn't tell me this.
*  Somebody told me this and this guy was in his 60s and he was scared to go down this
*  road because this guy lived there who used to bully him in high school and the guy still
*  fucked with them.
*  Still fucked with them.
*  No way.
*  Bro, there's some people that get stuck like that.
*  You have to get close to both of those guys.
*  That's why I think for a lot of guys, you know, walking into an MMA gym is terrifying.
*  But it's okay.
*  Everything start with, you know, one tiny step.
*  And I like doing anything that makes me feel uncomfortable and takes me off my pins.
*  It's huge.
*  Because it opens up new pathways of understanding somehow.
*  Or it certainly forces me to.
*  So what I do now with people who I disagree with philosophically, you know, like say I'm
*  talking to somebody who's a hardcore socialist or something like that.
*  It's okay.
*  But what I try to do is I just try to listen to them really.
*  I try to kind of zero in instead of like immediately throwing my hands up.
*  Did you see what Brittany Cummings said the other day?
*  Brittany Cummings?
*  Whitney Cummings?
*  No.
*  Did I say Brittany?
*  Did I?
*  I think I was slobbering.
*  It's okay.
*  Too much of that turmeric coffee.
*  That does.
*  And people say, why are you coughing so much?
*  I don't want to tell the truth.
*  It's turmeric coffee.
*  You got a full mouth, bro.
*  You got a full mouth.
*  You got a...
*  Um, shit.
*  What was I just saying?
*  You said Whitney Cummings.
*  Oh.
*  Got reported to HR on a show she was on because as she was leaving, she said, Merry Christmas.
*  Some intern.
*  No.
*  Yes.
*  Intern was offended.
*  It's called Human Resources because she said Merry Christmas.
*  And her response was, she goes, hey, I really don't give a fuck if you have a good Christmas.
*  It's just a nice thing to say.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't give a fuck about your Christmas.
*  I don't even know you.
*  Like something that's...
*  We reported her.
*  That, that, something that's very fucking important for people to realize about the
*  West, something that's really unique about the West and Western civilization, is that
*  imperialism, racism, sexism, all these isms that we are guilty of.
*  The West didn't invent these things, but we did, you know, we were a Greece's violators
*  in some cases of that, you know, slavery was a real thing in this country.
*  But what's, what's unique about the West, and I'm getting this thing, is that we were
*  the first to label it and condemn it.
*  And the West has always been a country that seems always to be in the process of repenting
*  for its past, repenting for its sins.
*  That is not common.
*  That is unique to, and self-criticism is part of it.
*  As a society, we are, so people like that silly girl who, that's been going on actually
*  in one way or another for a long time.
*  Now it's...
*  The intern?
*  Yes.
*  I don't know if it was a girl or a boy.
*  Now it's a little bit more, it's way more, but that's actually to the character of this
*  country.
*  We have always had people who kind of went, you know, that's wrong, I don't want to do
*  that, this isn't fair, all that kind of stuff.
*  And it was a fucking, it would always cause all kinds of problems.
*  But that's extreme.
*  That's a silly goose, whoever's doing that is dumb enough.
*  Well, it's Hollywood.
*  There's a Hollywood thing where these people can't be liberal enough.
*  They're trying so hard to be progressive that they're just becoming ridiculous.
*  They get so reactionary and everyone's scared that they're going to be out of the woke loop.
*  Like maybe they're behind.
*  They're letting something slide that they should have stepped up for.
*  Because now you can get in trouble if you don't come out against someone saying Merry
*  Christmas.
*  Like, hey man, you know, where were you when that fucking pig said Merry Christmas?
*  Do you know what Christmas means?
*  Yeah.
*  They want to take away the word supremacy and quantum supremacy, which is quantum computing.
*  It's next level, next step computing.
*  And there was an article about Google achieving quantum supremacy.
*  And they were like, well, we don't like the term supremacy because it reminds people of
*  white supremacy.
*  But do you know what I think about those people?
*  Do you know what I think about a lot of those people?
*  They're ready.
*  They're young, they're not experienced, and they're not that bright.
*  I'm sorry.
*  Well, this is the thing is they are bright.
*  They just aren't wise.
*  They're very smart and they know they are, which is one of the reasons why they want
*  to make an argument to push something like that through and think that it makes sense.
*  It's because they're so smart.
*  But what they're not is, is you get seasoned by your interactions with human beings.
*  You're naive when you're younger.
*  And then as you get older, you get seasoned.
*  Your mind changes.
*  But you also get seasoned, meaning you experience so many different human beings that exhibit
*  these sort of stereotypes and these patterns of behavior.
*  And you got to know when people are being knuckleheads, and you got to know when people
*  are being wise and objective, and you got to know when people are being kind and loving,
*  and you got to know when people are being assholes.
*  You can see all the different things.
*  As you get older, you get more data.
*  And a lot of these kids are like 20.
*  No, I know.
*  They're 22 and they're yelling about the world.
*  That Greta Thornburg chick, they keep breaking every...
*  She's 16.
*  She's a kid.
*  Listen, you've got some good points.
*  They're using you now.
*  Well, what happens is, as you get older and you try to solve problems at the level of
*  detail.
*  So if you and I had to really solve some problems, let's say healthcare, you and I, I'm sitting
*  here with Jamie.
*  I'm not solving shit.
*  Yeah, if we had to try, right?
*  What would happen is we might come with more of a Republican or a Democratic or a liberal
*  or a conservative sensibility initially.
*  I think once you get down to the level of detail and you try to solve these problems,
*  all that ideology kind of goes out the window because now you're dealing with hard numbers
*  in math and you're trying to deal in percentages and you're trying to deal with what's the
*  best policy for the most number of people.
*  And so it becomes way, way grayer and way less teamy if you are somebody that has to
*  solve problems.
*  If you are somebody who has to turn a profit, if you're somebody who has to figure out what
*  your clientele actually will buy.
*  And I think sometimes that's why people who own businesses and people who have to make
*  the transfer on time have a different philosophical and political point of view than do people
*  who essentially spend a lot of time reading, thinking and writing in an academic institution.
*  Because you don't need to get down to the level of detail.
*  You can stay in that wonderful world of theory.
*  And that's an important world.
*  It's not to say that you shouldn't have that, but a lot of journalists come from that world.
*  They come straight from that world of theory, that world of that intellectual pursuit.
*  And they come right into, then they see the world.
*  And I think that might be why a lot of times people in the media tend to be a little bit
*  more ideological, maybe a little bit more liberal, depending because you could say Fox
*  News is just as fucking ideological on the other side.
*  But I do think your perspective changes when you have to get down to business.
*  When you're out there in the real world.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  It's like fighting.
*  It's like fighting.
*  You need both though.
*  And this is what I think we need to make this distinction.
*  You need these quantum theorists.
*  You need these historians.
*  You need these people that are just completely engaged in whatever the subject is at hand.
*  And they're just lifelong academics.
*  You need both.
*  But the real problem is when people come out of these universities and they have these
*  hardline ideas of how the world needs to change.
*  They're revolutionaries.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  And it's very exciting.
*  It's very exciting.
*  And they want to burn down the whole building.
*  And then you start looking for witches.
*  Okay.
*  And then you start going, that bitch said Merry Christmas.
*  And that's what that is.
*  That's what's nuts.
*  Google's calling it quantum supremacy.
*  Can you fucking believe this shit?
*  Like, yeah, we got to burn it down.
*  Burn it down.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a lot of it is being young.
*  But young people can do some, when they get together, the communist revolution was, you
*  This is also why discourse is so important, right?
*  Like young people need to talk to other people.
*  Like a lot of these people with these ideas are one day going to laugh at those ideas.
*  They're one day going to look back and go, oh my God, when I was 20, I was so stupid.
*  Just like you have done, just like I have done, just like basically everybody does as
*  they get older.
*  You start thinking, oh my God, when I was 18, what a fucking moron I was.
*  Oh my God, when I was 24, you want to hear the stupid shit I thought I should do?
*  I mean, that's part of life.
*  You also have to realize that historically, that thing I sent you, people ask me what
*  I read and stuff.
*  If you go to audible.com and go to the great courses, I listened to these courses.
*  I just listened to 48 lectures by a guy named Robert Buchholz, who's this fucking amazing
*  professor on the foundations of Western civilization.
*  One of the things he says in it is he said, Europeans, I mean, the history of Europe,
*  I mean, culminating with World War I and World War II, as bloody and as violent, it's beyond
*  what we can imagine.
*  How many millions were killed in World War II?
*  It's beyond what we can imagine.
*  But Europeans figured out, and it's a huge accomplishment and really the first time in
*  history for anybody, they figured out how to solve their differences without killing
*  each other.
*  And that happened after World War II.
*  And it took that long.
*  They actually figured out a way to solve their differences by disagreeing, by fighting about
*  it, by fighting dirty, but by winning elections.
*  Hey, here's a question.
*  The war in Europe, all the countries involved.
*  What was the size of the landscape we're looking at in relationship to the United States?
*  When you look at France and Germany and England, what is that?
*  Well, it wasn't just France and Germany.
*  Oh yeah, but I'm talking about all of those.
*  Russia, I think it's five time zones, right?
*  Russia's giant.
*  Russia's a different animal, right?
*  Because Russia is, that's Asia.
*  Yeah, and Russia would just rely on old general winter.
*  But the European aspect of it, the European part of World War I and II.
*  What I was thinking is, it's almost like having a war inside America, right?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's really close.
*  I think if you look at, if you take France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Poland, all those areas.
*  They fit in Rhode Island.
*  Hungary, Austria, Bulgaria, Romania, Yugoslavia.
*  Put those in Florida.
*  Tough those in Florida.
*  How big is that area?
*  I'm on now.
*  Give me one minute.
*  He's got too many Googling.
*  That's a lot of Googling.
*  I found a thing that like World War I maps, 40 maps that explain World War I.
*  World War I's a different thing too.
*  Oh yeah.
*  That's what you're talking about, right?
*  World War II.
*  World War II is the whole world.
*  Yeah, II is everything, right?
*  II is Japan.
*  But so was World War I.
*  Remember, World War I, the Ottoman Empire was crumbling, right?
*  So Turkey's empire was crumbling.
*  So Turkey got the Middle East involved.
*  The British were involved in the Middle East.
*  They were fighting the Turks.
*  That whole area became a theater for war.
*  Dude, I'm on my third Wild West book in the last couple weeks.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  About the history of the Wild West.
*  Let me tell you this one.
*  It's a Blood and Thunder.
*  Blood and Thunder, an epic tale of the American West.
*  It's about Kit Carson and the mountain men.
*  Bro.
*  Rough dudes.
*  Bro.
*  Men.
*  The wars with all the various tribes and the chaos and the way they would kill people.
*  Oh my god, it's so crazy.
*  The Native Americans?
*  Oh yeah.
*  Dude, one of the stories that I was reading, I don't think it was this one.
*  It wasn't the Kit Carson one.
*  It was the one on General Custer.
*  General Custer was the last one, which was Son of the Morning Star.
*  That was the last one that I was reading.
*  Bro.
*  The one guy, a Native American guy, wants to fuck this other guy's wife.
*  So he tries to get him.
*  He can't get him.
*  Eventually finds him one day.
*  Kills him.
*  Eats his heart.
*  Cooks his heart.
*  Comes back and tells everybody and then marries the lady.
*  Well, you gotta eat a man's heart because you impose his will on him.
*  Imagine you're married.
*  It's one thing to choke a guy out.
*  You're married.
*  You're married to a guy.
*  And this other dude wants to fuck you.
*  He kills your husband and eats his heart.
*  And then you say, getting this TP, big boy.
*  That's pretty fucking gangster.
*  That's pretty fucking gangster.
*  Because the guy loved you and I'm gonna eat his heart.
*  I'm gonna eat his love for you.
*  He cut two fingers off of his hand because he couldn't get to her and he loved her so
*  much.
*  He was angry that he couldn't kill her.
*  Did he win her over?
*  Well, he must have won her over.
*  He cut two fingers off his hand before he got to her.
*  And then found the guy after he cut two fingers off his hand.
*  Killed the guy.
*  Ate his fucking heart.
*  Cooked it.
*  Came back and told everybody.
*  Like ate most of the heart.
*  That's a stalker.
*  That's a stage five stalker.
*  Or is that going past?
*  That's past.
*  Yeah.
*  Ate his heart.
*  Ate his heart.
*  You remember like when we used to have those terrorism colors?
*  Like today is yellow.
*  No worries.
*  Remember there was a flag?
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  That's it.
*  This is it?
*  The battlefronts of Europe?
*  Yeah, this was from 1917.
*  A paper in London made this.
*  This is explaining the battle area, battle zones.
*  Oh, so all of it fit in the center of the country.
*  Right.
*  And they compared it even.
*  God damn dude.
*  Just imagine if that shit was going on in the center of the country.
*  If Montana was at war with Wyoming and Colorado.
*  It was all trench warfare too.
*  Oh my god.
*  World War, it's really interesting because there are some parallels now.
*  World War I, if you look at World War I, it was a time when first of all the world hadn't
*  been, Europe hadn't been to war for a hundred years.
*  So when people went into war in World War I, they were, I mean they went in, every young
*  man volunteered and even women volunteered to be nurses and to cook.
*  So it was this, they were singing songs and they were going to be gone for two weeks and
*  it was going to be really exciting and it was romantic.
*  And no one, including the soldiers, really understood the technology like machine guns
*  and that kind of technology and mustard gas.
*  They didn't know.
*  They were still fighting the way they had been fighting for millennia, which was on
*  horseback, feathers in their helmets and charging with great bravery.
*  And so what happened was they would charge and the other side would open up with machine
*  guns and artillery and then ultimately poison gas.
*  And so the numbers are too staggering to even imagine, but like for 800 yards to try to
*  capture that much land or whatever, they would lose, they lost something like 300,000 men
*  in a day.
*  And that's what was going on.
*  They were just getting mowed down.
*  That many?
*  Oh dude, the numbers are crazy.
*  The Battle of the Somme, I can't remember what it was.
*  It was beyond like the number of men that were lost per foot.
*  I remember I had to ask three times because I couldn't believe it.
*  And because they were just so your arrogant commanders would blow a whistle.
*  Sometimes they would kick a soccer ball and you would follow the soccer ball over the
*  ditch and run as they were shooting at you.
*  And if you didn't, you'd be tried for cowardice.
*  Sometimes you'd be shot by your commanding officer in the back of your head.
*  Because remember, a lot of these armies were conscripted.
*  They were brought in against their will from, you know, this was the time of imperialism
*  when the country that was bigger and stronger, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Austria itself,
*  would come in and say, you belong to us now.
*  There were these secret alliances that would happen.
*  And so that battle was so insane and it was just, it was a true meat grinder.
*  It was a true meat grinder.
*  And then you'd have no man's land, right?
*  So you'd have no man's land.
*  And that was the area where they would come in, you know, they had to cross the kill and
*  men you'd hear them dying and groaning, but nobody could get to them.
*  It was the fucking, it was the worst, man.
*  It was the worst.
*  And in those trenches, the body parts and everything, and then people would have to
*  go to the bathroom there and then the rain would come.
*  You were living in a gutter.
*  It was beyond what people can imagine.
*  It was beyond.
*  It was the most horrific thing.
*  And the only thing that was worse was something called World War II, which is essentially
*  a continuation of that first European civil war.
*  And I don't know, man, it's beyond what we can, we're so fucking lucky we don't live
*  in a time like that.
*  Yes, sir.
*  Less than 100 years ago.
*  Yes, sir.
*  70 years ago.
*  So inside of one person's lifetime.
*  Yeah.
*  1945 is when.
*  Ari Shaffir's dad is a Holocaust survivor.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Ari Shaffir's dad is a fucking Holocaust survivor.
*  You know, I mean, that's how close it is.
*  And that all came from this idea back then that you could perfect society and perfect
*  human beings.
*  Six inch howitzer.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a mountain howitzer.
*  Human beings, you know, this is where the idea of, where ideas can be so dangerous.
*  This idea that human beings are a blank slate and they'll, that you can make them anything
*  you want.
*  You can re-educate them in a camp and they'll be what you want.
*  This is the history of Europe.
*  And those ideas lost ground.
*  That's why the individual, it's so fucking important for the individual to take precedence
*  over the state.
*  This is also why it's so important for people to be able to express themselves.
*  That's what I mean.
*  And for people to, you know.
*  But fidelity to the state in a fascist society, in communist Russia, fidelity to the state,
*  the collective must be superior to the individual.
*  The individual, you're a tiny leaf on a tree.
*  If you have a society like that, somebody's going to run that.
*  Somebody's going to set that doctrine and they will justify killing 20, 30 million people
*  the way Stalin did.
*  Right.
*  And they'll say that they're doing it for the country.
*  Sure.
*  Yeah.
*  You know.
*  There's so many patterns like that that just repeat themselves over and over again with
*  human beings in power.
*  You get a lot.
*  I think that Hitler, by many accounts, seemed to genuinely enjoy World War I.
*  He enjoyed it.
*  And then he got blinded by mustard glass and he couldn't believe Germany surrendered.
*  He couldn't believe it.
*  And a German physician, there's one record of the German physician saying, characterizing
*  Hitler as follows.
*  Again, this is from Buchholz lectures.
*  It said, he goes, this person is not fit to command humans and is dangerously psychotic.
*  And because of a lot of crazy reasons, he was able to start the, or join the Nazi, he's
*  worked in, he actually started as a minder for the German army.
*  What's a minder?
*  He was a guy who spied on subversive groups.
*  Oh, like a rat.
*  Yeah, revolutionary groups.
*  That's how he came across the National Socialist Party.
*  He was a narc.
*  Yeah, the Nazis.
*  But kind of went, you know what?
*  I like what these guys are saying.
*  Yeah.
*  So he joined.
*  Yes.
*  I want fucking war.
*  So that's like if you had an undercover FBI agent and he became one of the Hell's Angels
*  and took over the organization.
*  Because he took over.
*  World War II, the crazy thing about right before World War II, everything like today,
*  so you ever notice how today we can't agree on really even source material.
*  If you have an argument, where'd you get your information?
*  CNN?
*  What?
*  Or Fox News?
*  You fucking, and the conversation that you can't even start.
*  Because we don't have, now we're talking about a simulation, maybe this whole thing, maybe
*  we and I are just self-replicating machines.
*  So nobody really knows at this point.
*  It's really hard to arrive at a fixed point of truth.
*  Back in the day, the Bible was your fixed point of truth, maybe Aristotle.
*  But at the turn of the century, like right before World War I, man, like you had Darwin
*  comes along, you had, he'd come along, but you had Freud who said something to the effect
*  of hey, we're animals and we're basically, we will kill and use each other as sexual
*  tools if we don't have a strong society.
*  And there were all these like, there were all these sort of new Nietzsche, Marx who said
*  God is dead, Nietzsche said God is dead, but Marx basically said religion is the opium
*  of the masses, human beings are the masters of their own fate, and all of these guys who
*  basically took God out of the equation, and all of them were basically saying that we
*  are animals and God is no longer here.
*  And if you don't create a society to control our animalistic impulses, we're going to
*  fucking slaughter and rape each other.
*  And World War I proved all of those guys right, basically.
*  But it was a time when there was, everything was up in the air.
*  Einstein comes along and says time and space, not so fast, it's actually relative.
*  And everybody went what?
*  Huh?
*  He goes, yeah, time doesn't exist like a stopwatch.
*  God didn't start a stopwatch.
*  And that's what Newton said, but actually-
*  Good luck trying to work your way through that.
*  You can't.
*  It confused everybody.
*  The one way if you go fast enough into space and then come back, everybody here will be
*  old and you'll be the same age.
*  Do you know how that works?
*  Yeah, I do, but it's still, like, what?
*  It's really weird.
*  Do you know, I think this is true, this is what I read, he was walking, he was like in,
*  where was he, CERN, Switzerland, whatever the fuck it is, he gets off the, he's trying
*  to come up with these, he's thinking about the theory of relativity or whatever, and
*  he gets off the train and he's walking away from the train station.
*  He turns and looks at the clock and the clock says, let's say, six o'clock.
*  He turns and looks at the clock and he turns back around and he stops and he goes, wait,
*  hold on, I was walking away from the clock.
*  So when I saw the clock it said six, but that's how long it took the light to get to my eye.
*  By the time the light hit my eye it was actually later, because the light has to hit my eye
*  for me, do you understand?
*  Right, a fraction of a second later.
*  So he said, what if I was moving at the speed of light?
*  Time would stand still, because the light would never hit my eye.
*  It's a weird thing to say, but I was like, that's a fucking...
*  Yeah, but I wonder if that works with biological aging.
*  I wonder if biological aging is on a constant, right?
*  Oh, that's interesting, yeah, entropy, right?
*  Well, I know that time would be different, right?
*  But I wonder, when you say time stands still, but it's got to exist if you're alive.
*  It's got to exist somehow biologically.
*  Your body's not going to stop heart beating and breathing, right?
*  So how many heartbeats do you have in you?
*  That's part of what life is.
*  Life is like you got a limited number of heartbeats if you wanted to really break it down.
*  How many of them are you going to use while you're going through light speed?
*  Those don't count?
*  I know.
*  Your heart's going to beat, right?
*  So how long is it actually going to take in real time down on earth while you're up there?
*  I don't know.
*  I think it's going to be like, well, you're moving so fast that it feels like 10 minutes
*  because it is 10 minutes to you.
*  And then you come back, you've only aged 10 minutes, but it might be 10 years down here.
*  Well, didn't you have somebody on your podcast, I think it was, they were talking about how
*  you don't...
*  What ages you, the reason we look older than we did 25 years ago is because of entropy.
*  So things mix, things mix and you can't unmix them.
*  What's the matter, John?
*  I just listened to this book about time and these concepts just came up that you're talking
*  about.
*  After the whole book, I was more confused about time.
*  Fuck, dude.
*  It's called The Order of Time by Carlo Rovelli.
*  By the way, that's a great name.
*  Carlo Rovelli.
*  It's like if you were a chick and your friend was going to introduce you to a guy and his
*  name was Carlo Rovelli.
*  My name is Carlo.
*  Carlo Rovelli.
*  He's a New York Times selling author, best seller.
*  And he plays jazz at night.
*  Carlo Rovelli.
*  He goes to see jazz.
*  Yeah, he'll smoke one clove cigarette a month.
*  According to this book, time works different, like up higher than it does lower.
*  For instance, if you had two synchronized clocks, even on the top of this table in the
*  ground, they would not be synced up over a certain amount of time.
*  Why?
*  Because this is what Carlo Rovelli...
*  Time moves slower at sea level.
*  So if you live at sea level, you will live longer than people that live higher.
*  Okay.
*  That's because the oxygen is much...
*  I want to be fucking Italian so badly, dude.
*  Or Spanish.
*  You have a lot of Italian in you.
*  What percentage do you have in you?
*  I'm 51%.
*  51.
*  But I want to speak this way.
*  I want to be romantic and I want to whisper.
*  There's something about being born in a country that has a long, rich tradition.
*  If you're born somewhere, like if you're born in Spain, you know, your grandfather was a
*  bullfighter, you're born in Spain.
*  I love a flair for the dramatic.
*  Barcelona.
*  Barcelona.
*  Yeah, you got to...
*  I was a young man, I was like 19, I was at a fucking Club Med with my family.
*  And just the girls and everything.
*  And there was this hot as shit like CrossFit.
*  She wasn't doing CrossFit, but she looked like it.
*  She wasn't such an athlete.
*  And I've always liked muscular, you know.
*  And I'm looking at this guy, he was from Italy.
*  I remember he was...
*  I remember, I never forgot, he just goes like this.
*  He goes, I go, she's beautiful.
*  And he goes, she is still beautiful, you know.
*  I'd die for her.
*  I'd die.
*  I'd die for her.
*  And I was like, I want to be you, man.
*  I want to say that once in my fucking life.
*  I'd die for her.
*  Well, have you ever watched like that show Vikings?
*  You ever see that show Vikings?
*  No.
*  It's a fun show.
*  It's actually a very good show.
*  Very underrated show.
*  Yeah.
*  A lot of people get fucked up and killed.
*  One of the things that I was thinking, and a lot of it happens in Rome, a lot of it happens
*  in Europe, is a lot of crazy shit with the Vikings.
*  But while I was watching, I was thinking, those people had kids and their people had
*  kids and their people had kids and their people had kids and their kids have iPhones.
*  Like it's not that long ago.
*  Those people that live in that part of the world, those people that live in Ireland and
*  those people that live in Great Britain and a lot of that area, like a lot of the folks
*  who lived there are the ancestors of these people that lived this insane history.
*  Right.
*  Insane history of warfare with swords and shields and shit.
*  These motherfuckers.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the movie.
*  Or that's the show rather.
*  It's a good show, man.
*  Hey, what ever happened to one of my favorite UFC fighters who's a Valhalla Viking motherfucker?
*  The guy, he's from Sweden, shredded out of his mind.
*  Which guy?
*  Me?
*  Emil Miek?
*  He fought at 170?
*  Yeah.
*  That's Emil Miek.
*  He's a beast.
*  He's a rock and roller too?
*  I think he's supposed to say Mek.
*  He plays the guitar too?
*  I think pronounce his name Mek.
*  Do you get more shredded than that?
*  He's a fucking gorilla and he's super strong too.
*  Very good fighter.
*  I don't know what's going on with him.
*  I haven't seen him in a while.
*  Classic Viking.
*  He was at the event last weekend.
*  What is, when was his last fight?
*  When did he have a fight last?
*  Wow, I feel.
*  Yeah, it's been a, well, you know, sometimes these dudes they'll hurt something and you
*  know, they're out for like, Cubs wants and just tore his ACL.
*  And yeah, he's going to be out for almost a year.
*  That sucks.
*  He's scheduled to fight in February.
*  Oh, he is?
*  Okay.
*  Who's he fighting?
*  Jake Matthews.
*  Oh, that's a good fight.
*  Yeah, Cub was in a grappling match against Jake Shields, who's a fucking huge guy.
*  He's quite a bit bigger than Cub.
*  Yeah, Jake's huge.
*  And Jake had a sick grappler.
*  And Jake had his legs laced up and Cub was trying to work his way out of it and just
*  a freak thing.
*  It just popped.
*  And his knee and his meniscus, his ACL blew out and he just got surgery on it.
*  Jake used me as a dummy once.
*  I would say I rolled with him, but he used me as a dummy.
*  I said, why'd you beat me up so bad?
*  He didn't know me.
*  He goes, I didn't know if you were good.
*  I don't want you to get a position and you talk about it on your podcast.
*  I was like, hey dude, I'm a fucking, I'm an actor and I have a vagina.
*  So he was trying to hurt you?
*  No, he just had to make sure that I was one with the mat though.
*  Make sure that I was, get in the mat.
*  Let's go ahead and get your fucking face against.
*  Let me go.
*  Well, I got to clean the mat.
*  A little dirty, so let me just, you know.
*  Well, he's a competitor professionally.
*  He doesn't have no time to be fake rolling with people.
*  Every roll he has, he's a pro.
*  I had no business being on the mat with him.
*  He's still doing really competitive grappling too.
*  Like he's a...
*  Have you ever hung with him?
*  He's really smart.
*  He's a very good guy.
*  But he's also intellectually curious.
*  Jake does a lot of reading.
*  I have very good conversations with Jake.
*  Really smart guy.
*  Super good grappler.
*  He submitted Mark Munoz at that event too.
*  Yeah, Jake's legit.
*  And I've seen him in grappling competitions like long before he ever fought in the UFC.
*  I feel like Mark was 318 pounds in his last...
*  He hasn't been missing any meals.
*  Mark looks big.
*  Yeah, I don't know how much you weigh.
*  He definitely is not in tip-toe shape.
*  I'm sorry Mark, if somebody was joking.
*  Maybe you're not that heavy.
*  Yeah, that's Cubs.
*  See, they're laced up like this.
*  And as he's moving there, his knee just copped.
*  Oh, that's not good.
*  That's awful.
*  It can happen man in weird ways when you have legs tangled up like that.
*  Sometimes someone will just lean one way and it puts a lot of pressure on your knee and
*  it just explodes.
*  Jake might be the toughest vegan on the planet.
*  He's not a vegan.
*  He's a vegetarian.
*  He eats eggs.
*  I enjoyed that Game Changers with Chris Kresser.
*  And Wilkes.
*  Listening to a Protestant and a Catholic argue over the minutiae of how to worship God, like
*  they both believe in God, or like a Sunni and a Shia, it was very interesting in that
*  sense how human beings get steeped in too much information and then will start parsing
*  out stuff that's not that helpful to the listener.
*  It's a long conversation.
*  The conversation about health is very long.
*  Unfortunately, when Chris was talking about the Game Changers, he got several things wrong,
*  particularly the big ones were the amount of protein that you can get in peanut butter,
*  the amount of protein that's in bread, and whether or not that is equal to three ounces
*  of ground meat.
*  And what Wilkes was showing is that it is.
*  And he made his point very well.
*  And that made Chris, his argument, not look very good.
*  And then there was the other problem, whereas Chris Kresser sort of personally defined what
*  he defines as low carb versus medium carb versus high carb, and wasn't making a distinction
*  that this is not the consensus amongst nutritionists, what they consider low carb, medium carb.
*  James accused him of that, Chris denied it, and then James pulled out all of these different
*  articles that show that he has a different version of what he calls low carb, medium
*  carb, or high carb.
*  The problem with all this is he's just making Chris look bad, and he's not necessarily proving
*  that a vegetarian or vegan diet is better for you.
*  But he is, rightly, pointing out that he was wrongly criticized.
*  So I get his position.
*  I was very impressed with James' ability to come prepared.
*  I do believe he spent 3,000 hours, I mean an hour, a thousand hours, I believe that.
*  Yeah, I believe that now.
*  He knows his shit.
*  Yes, after talking to him about this and the way he handled it.
*  But I kept going back to what Chris was saying, which was, hey, hey, hey, I believe in plants.
*  I eat mostly plants.
*  A little animal product, some animal products, is an easier way to get B1, and it's not going to kill you.
*  That's the problem with doing a documentary, and then that's a problem with someone criticizing
*  the documentary.
*  He's got enough stuff that he can say you were inaccurate with with the criticism.
*  So then we get lost in the argument.
*  Is meat bad for you?
*  That's the main question.
*  It's not.
*  No, neither is dairy.
*  That's the problem.
*  But the way they're conflating it with people who were advertising for cigarettes and doctors
*  advertising for cigarettes back in the day and saying that cigarettes are fine, that
*  these are the same people that are doing this.
*  No, the problem is everyone was aware for a long time that cigarettes are not healthy.
*  This is not the case with meat.
*  These studies where you connect people with all these diseases with meat, they connect
*  their diet as a whole.
*  They could be eating cheeseburgers and bread and soda and lifestyle and drinking and smoking,
*  but they also eat meat versus people who don't eat meat.
*  Well, if someone is going to be conscientious and think about even if they're incorrect
*  and they just assume that the science says that eating meat is bad for you, you start
*  eating more fish or more chicken or more vegetables.
*  You clean up your diet.
*  I bet just statistically, those people have less drinking.
*  I bet statistically they have less cigarette smoking.
*  They're probably healthier on the whole because they're making choices that even if it's
*  incorrect, they think are good for you like not eating meat or as much meat.
*  But as a non-nutritionist who doesn't know shit, when I watched Game Changers, I have
*  to say that it did seem like the narrative, the story of the movie was that being a vegan
*  for all these reasons, all these scientific reasons than eating any meat.
*  That's what, for me, it was a vegan film.
*  Even though James would probably disagree with that, for me, just as a viewer, the argument
*  was being made that being a vegan, from just what I got, regardless of what was meant,
*  I got that being a vegan is better for you.
*  It keeps your dick hard.
*  You won't die of cancer and you'll have less inflammation and all those things.
*  More endurance.
*  All of which seemed, I talked to Layne Norton about this for a while and he had written
*  this thing.
*  I don't know if he said it.
*  Well, he had a video.
*  You could watch his video on Game Changers debunked where he broke down basically every
*  single claim that they made that was incorrect, scientifically as a PhD.
*  He's a legit scientist.
*  He absolutely understands what's really going on when it comes to nutritional science.
*  I would have stuck to that though.
*  I would have just said at the end of the day, this is a debate about can you eat some meat
*  But here's the problem.
*  Because of Kresser's criticism of the film, he was in every right.
*  He had every right to defend the criticism.
*  He did it right.
*  The problem was we didn't get any closer at the end.
*  There was some confusion that was about whether or not it is healthy or not healthy to eat
*  meat.
*  He was citing some studies and Kresser was saying those studies aren't valid because
*  of this and that.
*  That's where we would have been if we had a guy like Lane Norton in here, it would have
*  helped a lot.
*  We would have someone actually explain it.
*  But you could also have a guy who comes in and goes, hey guys, here's the thing, man.
*  Let's just look at cultures that live a long time and have vibrant lives and good lives.
*  Some of it is like I'd like to look at the Blue Zones who eat meat and a lot of times
*  they eat some form of dairy and they drink and they have good communities.
*  They don't retire.
*  to longevity and health and living a good life than being a purist.
*  Whether or not it's in this direction or that direction.
*  It's the result of a real conversation that we really need to have because overpopulation
*  is real.
*  The conversation is really ultimately what is sustainable.
*  It's not what is sustainable right now for your lifespan.
*  It's like what is sustainable for the future and should we engineer for a better tomorrow?
*  We already are though, aren't we?
*  We sort of are.
*  We're not though.
*  People are acting as individuals.
*  There's not really a whole lot of engineering in terms of slowing down the rate of childbirth
*  or trying to prevent people from having too many kids, trying to prevent overpopulation.
*  A lot of cultures, I mean a lot of countries and societies are at zero population growth.
*  Some, yes.
*  But the thing is there's plenty of people that live below the poverty line in terms
*  of what our perception of the poverty line is.
*  And what you're seeing in a lot of these more industrialized nations is as people start
*  developing careers and men and women get careers, you have less childbirth.
*  Like you've seen that in Japan.
*  Japan has apparently an issue with a lack of childbirth.
*  Not as many as they should have.
*  It's not sustainable.
*  That's right.
*  They worry about that with some countries and I've even heard that about the United
*  States that one day it's going to even out and then everyone will have careers and then
*  we'll have less children and then it's a statistical thing.
*  China is having trouble with having enough, they have more elderly so they're having
*  trouble getting, this is crazy, but China is having trouble getting enough people to
*  handle their economy.
*  That makes sense.
*  I mean skilled workers, which was shocking to me.
*  Yeah, but there's so many people, right?
*  Yeah, so they're importing labor.
*  Which is like what?
*  Because they were kept at one child per family and China can do that.
*  I went to Beijing and I had to do a retinal scan and they were very specific about, they
*  give you a phone and they were like, I was shooting a movie.
*  They give you a phone.
*  You have to use their phone.
*  There are firewalls.
*  You can't just surf the web and they very clearly have signs that say any criticism
*  of the government and when you're an actor, they say this, will not be tolerated.
*  You will be.
*  And then you talk to people that live there and they say things like, dude, you disappear.
*  You can just disappear on the street if you're a, you know.
*  So I don't know, man.
*  What the fuck, man?
*  There's a billion of them.
*  Yeah, I got problems with that.
*  A billion of them and they're being controlled by this crazy oppressive government.
*  Oh, it's been, that ain't nothing but your regular.
*  I know, but it's weird to see that in 2019, right?
*  It's weird to see that online.
*  It's become more authoritarian in some ways.
*  Well, it's, I guess their grip is looser so they're clawing more.
*  They're trying to squeeze harder.
*  If you think about all of human history, this is the way that empires were run, but they
*  weren't run with technology and they weren't run while the people had access to technology.
*  So the fact they're clamping down on web searches and what sites you can visit and you know,
*  there's a lot of companies that felt like they had to do business with them too.
*  Like I was talking to this lady who worked at Google and she was saying, look, they're
*  going to copy Google or we work with them.
*  So like this idea of like you shouldn't work with them because they're going to censor
*  the people like, listen, they're censoring no matter what.
*  But if we don't go over there, they're just going to copy our shit.
*  It's a massive market.
*  Well, the copying thing, the intellectual property thing, they don't give a fuck.
*  Industrial espionage is huge.
*  It's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  The whole Huawei, the Huawei thing, the fucking head of Huawei, his daughter is being held
*  captive in Vancouver.
*  Do you know about that?
*  Yeah.
*  Google that.
*  The head of Huawei.
*  Huawei has been accused of some crazy backdoor shit they put into routers and they're really
*  worried about their technology getting to this country in the United States has stopped
*  the production of their cell phones in the United States.
*  Like you have to buy them from somewhere else and bring them in sort of, you know, what's
*  it called?
*  What's it called when it's not connected to someone like we buy a cell phone, it's not
*  connected to somebody.
*  You know what I'm talking about?
*  No, it's not untethered.
*  It's like that though.
*  Whatever.
*  I'll remember it.
*  But you could buy one of those on like Amazon or one of those tech websites, but you can't
*  get it at Verizon.
*  You can't get it at AT&T.
*  They blocked all that and they're like terrified that this company that has become their number
*  two now, they're right behind Apple.
*  Like Apple's number one is Apple, no Samsung.
*  Samsung's number one, their number two and Apple's number three.
*  So they've passed Apple in cell phone production.
*  Britain has always had, I think they were humiliated in their past, you know, by the
*  British, by a lot of different, you know, by the Japanese who behaved atrociously.
*  But you know what the opium wars were?
*  Where the British were, traders were bringing in opium from India to China.
*  China developed a major opium problem.
*  So the emperor and the government said, this is a major problem.
*  Guess what, Britain?
*  You can't sell your opium on our docks.
*  You're unloading huge boxes of opium from India and I know you're making a lot of money,
*  but no, because we have a major addiction problem.
*  And Britain said you're interfering with free trade and we should be allowed to.
*  And China said you're not allowed to.
*  And so they went to war and Britain won that war and forced China to continue buying opium.
*  What year was this?
*  It's called the opium wars.
*  Pull up that article.
*  And that's why Hong Kong became, well, that's why the British took Hong Kong and leased
*  it for a hundred years.
*  Look at this.
*  Under house arrest in Vancouver, Huawei CFO lives in luxury and spends her days out shopping.
*  There you go.
*  She's got to wear a GPS monitor.
*  I'll take that fucking life.
*  They make her wear a GPS monitor.
*  She has to stick to her 11 p.m. curfew.
*  So by the way, she's tired by 11 anyway.
*  So her dad owns Huawei.
*  Is that what it is?
*  Well, she's the CFO also.
*  So I don't know.
*  Bring her up.
*  Is she cute?
*  Doesn't her dad own Huawei?
*  Isn't that what it is?
*  It didn't say that necessarily.
*  She might be a daughter of billionaire founder.
*  So she can't.
*  Okay.
*  Why is she under house arrest though?
*  Because they think Huawei is doing a bunch of really shifty things.
*  Well, they are.
*  The U.S. wants to extradite her on the grounds that she tricked banks into potentially violating
*  Iran sanctions has sparked an unprecedented diplomatic row.
*  Yeah, they don't give a fuck.
*  They're doing business with everybody.
*  They're showing up with a briefcase full of cash and some nuclear weapons.
*  Fuck you.
*  And this is what the United States government is worried about.
*  These people becoming the number one technology provider in the world.
*  If they provided all the cell phones that everyone in America uses.
*  They were close.
*  If they came out and they got onto the Verizon network or the AT&T network with some of these
*  These phones, when you look at the tech people, the tech people, like the people like Unbox
*  Therapy and MKBHD, those guys who develop these YouTube videos breaking down the components
*  of cell phones.
*  They're always super favorable about these Huawei phones.
*  They have crazy cameras.
*  Some of them have this fucking insane ability to zoom in.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, they use computer learning and they have...
*  So they're better than the iPhone?
*  The new iPhone is pretty fucking good.
*  But when the latest Huawei Mate Pro, whatever the fuck it was, one of them, their most high
*  end phone, there's a video of them doing a zoom and you can't believe how much bigger
*  they can make something that's in the distance and make it look really clear.
*  And they have image stabilization and crazy...
*  They're about to come out with 150 megapixel sensor on a camera that's on the phone.
*  And they're going hog wild with technology and providing the state of the art shit.
*  And just a few years ago, they were a non-heard of brand.
*  I mean, five, six, seven years ago, you never heard about people talking about Huawei.
*  Now Huawei has a direct competitor to the MacBook Pro where a lot of people think it's
*  the best laptop that you can buy.
*  But it is encrypted.
*  It has a bezel to bezel display.
*  It works on fingerprints.
*  The web camera pops out of a key.
*  You press a key and it pops up so people can't see you while you're jerking off.
*  If you're one of those guys that worries, you have them, it's watching you, man.
*  I sure am.
*  Well, these Huawei computers, they figured it out.
*  And they basically copied the design of an Apple MacBook, just made it way better.
*  Yeah, but don't they have, of course, but don't they have encrypted, don't they have
*  built in spyware stuff?
*  We don't know.
*  Some things, some things.
*  I don't know.
*  This is what's funny.
*  This is what I like about my argument for the marketplace.
*  You don't want unchecked capitalism, but what's great about the marketplace is that you have
*  to allow for creative destruction.
*  The fact that, remember that flip camera, all the stuff that we had, a GPS, you had
*  to have a GPS, you had to have a little camera, then you had your phone.
*  And you had to allow certain businesses to go out of business to get all that technology
*  into one fucking place, which is your phone that we all use.
*  And that requires people to, it requires creative destruction.
*  It requires like, you know, people lose, entire businesses fall under, but a new one's born.
*  Imagine if people bailed out all those portable phone businesses.
*  And that's what would happen in a government controlled economy.
*  In a socialist economy, I promise you, you would have boards or committees that would
*  decide whether or not it was fair.
*  They would never, a government organization would never allow for that kind of creative
*  destruction.
*  Fucking never.
*  Because you'd have to protect jobs.
*  Hold on a second.
*  No, no, no.
*  But you would not, in the situation like, if China with technology, they're not like
*  trying to save those stupid phones.
*  Like when those phones became irrelevant, because the cameras on the phones were better.
*  That's because they had to compete.
*  When the cameras became irrelevant.
*  That's because they had to compete.
*  But that technology didn't come out of China, it came out of the West.
*  And technology did?
*  Yes.
*  Initially.
*  The innovation and all the, all the innovation.
*  Everything you see that comes out of Apple, where you can swipe, all that stuff.
*  Don't forget, that's all, that's all that came out of the free market.
*  That came out of the cutthroat competition.
*  Oh yeah, no argument.
*  But it's fascinating to me that they just take that and do it better.
*  Of course.
*  I mean, the Japanese used to do that too.
*  They would mimic.
*  Still have.
*  They still do it.
*  Look, that's what Lexus is.
*  Lexus is them looking at BMW and Mercedes and going, hmm, I see some holes in your game,
*  son.
*  They've got to do their own version of it, you know.
*  And here's the thing about those cars versus any other car.
*  They don't break.
*  That is the number one thing, man.
*  I've had a Lexus truck.
*  I've had like over the past 15 years, I've had three of them.
*  That's cool.
*  I've had zero problems with any of them ever.
*  Zero.
*  Zero.
*  They always start.
*  They always drive perfect.
*  I've had three Lexus trucks.
*  They're so, they're so well engineered.
*  They're so well designed.
*  There's something about Japanese vehicles, man.
*  I like my Tesla, though.
*  I had no problems with that either.
*  Yeah.
*  I haven't had really anything major.
*  I had like one little glitch once where the windshield wiper wasn't working correctly,
*  but they fixed that quick.
*  But that's it.
*  Other than that.
*  You're still driving your Tesla?
*  It's here, bitch.
*  Drive it here, bitch.
*  Is that your number one car?
*  Yeah.
*  I drive it more than anything.
*  It's so easy, right?
*  It's so easy and it allows, and one of the things I really enjoy is that I have a lot
*  of loud cars.
*  I like loud shit.
*  But the Tesla's silent.
*  I know.
*  I can think.
*  So when I drive that, I really like driving that with no music on.
*  I just like driving it because it's silent.
*  I make my way to the comedy store and I can hear all the sounds around me in a way that
*  I could never hear before.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I never noticed that, but that's how I admit that.
*  I guess that's what I-
*  Yeah, because the car is not, you're interfacing with the world differently.
*  Like if I'm driving my Porsche is probably my loudest car, the GT3.
*  That thing's loud.
*  When I'm driving that, I'm being obnoxious.
*  Not as loud as the GT2, motherfucker.
*  That's pretty loud, dude.
*  That's pretty loud, too.
*  I don't know.
*  That's stupid.
*  Brennan revved it and I jumped like a bitch.
*  I went, like that.
*  Because I didn't know.
*  I went, like my hands went up.
*  I sent him a video that is so ridiculous.
*  It's the GT2 RS, his car, racing against all these exotics, like all these McLarens and
*  Ferraris.
*  He's just burying them over and over again.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Jesus.
*  That car is like one of the fastest cars that you can buy.
*  He drives it.
*  What do you love about Brennan?
*  He drives it like it's his number one car.
*  It's his only car.
*  Daily driver.
*  It's his daily driver.
*  Yeah, it's ridiculous.
*  Fucking hilarious.
*  A giant man in that ridiculous Porsche.
*  It's his daily driver.
*  You gotta love it.
*  You gotta love him for it.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Well listen, he needs a reason to work so hard.
*  He's one of those guys.
*  He likes to be rewarded.
*  But those, and I do too, those vehicles, like that style of vehicle, it's like you're not
*  doing what everybody else is doing.
*  Everybody else is driving to work.
*  You're on a ride.
*  Yeah.
*  Is that his car?
*  I wish I liked cars that much.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Why don't you drive that for a day?
*  You'll like cars that much.
*  Nah.
*  Especially after you get to the doctor.
*  Too much work, bro.
*  Gets you some of that man juice inside your body.
*  Fucking testosterone.
*  Then you get one of those.
*  What do you mean too much work?
*  What work are you anticipating?
*  I don't know, man.
*  I need to fucking get a car like that and I'm gonna get jacked.
*  I'm gonna get sick and I'm gonna shave my fucking body.
*  What about your balls?
*  With a straight razor.
*  I'm manscaping the fuck.
*  I think we're sponsored by Manscaped.
*  By the way, if you want to see me in person, this Saturday at the Celebrity Theater, I'm
*  in Arizona and then where am I?
*  Where am I?
*  Hey Joe, where the fuck am I New Year's Eve?
*  Where are you New Year's Eve?
*  I'm at the Wilbur Theater in Boston, bro.
*  Oh shit.
*  At the Wilbur Theater in Boston.
*  Get tickets or fucking die.
*  And I got a whole new hour.
*  So if you see me in the past three months, I got all new material.
*  Look at that shit.
*  One of my favorite theaters on earth.
*  I'm standing like a fucking matador.
*  Shout out to Bill Blumenreit.
*  Yeah man, that's a great theater.
*  I love it.
*  I think we got 400 tickets left.
*  So beautiful.
*  Get them.
*  The guy who owns it, Bill Blumenreit, I've been friends with that guy for 28, 29 years.
*  Really?
*  Oh yeah, I've known him forever.
*  Yeah, he booked me back when I was really just getting going.
*  He booked me at his clubs.
*  Great dude.
*  Yeah, I've known that guy forever.
*  I love that guy.
*  I've been friends with him from the beginning of time.
*  You're now selling out to, how many tickets have you sold at one time?
*  The most?
*  Yeah.
*  Let me get my hand out of my pants.
*  The biggest place was with Chappelle, but that was me and him.
*  That didn't count.
*  That was 25,000.
*  That was Tacoma.
*  Fucking God.
*  Yeah.
*  He broke the record for the Tacoma Dome.
*  So ridiculous.
*  It was fun.
*  That was really fun.
*  But by myself, probably San Diego.
*  That's like 14.
*  That's fucking crazy.
*  I've done some other ones in the neighborhood of that.
*  It's weird.
*  It's real weird.
*  The laps just rolling.
*  It's so weird.
*  It just seems weird getting out there.
*  You're like, what in the fuck is going on?
*  Yeah.
*  I always come out to ACDC, Long Way to the Top, if you want to rock and roll.
*  Great song, baby.
*  You know why?
*  This is why, man.
*  I was at the improv.
*  It's a funny story.
*  I was doing a guest spot.
*  The guy in the background is the DJ.
*  He and I were standing there.
*  I was going up a little bit later, and there was a girl who was going on.
*  I was doing a guest spot who was very new.
*  It wasn't working so well.
*  It was rough.
*  She was bombing a little bit.
*  I turned to the DJ.
*  I go, it's a long way to the top.
*  She want to rock and roll.
*  We high-fived, and I left the room.
*  When I went on stage, he played it.
*  Very smart.
*  We looked at each other.
*  It's a long way to the top, if you want to rock and roll.
*  It's a great fucking song.
*  It's a great song.
*  It's one of the best road songs ever.
*  God damn.
*  I come up to Cashmere by Zeppelin.
*  It just gets me pumped.
*  They had so many fucking amazing songs.
*  Have you heard Greta Van Fleet?
*  Yes.
*  They're so good.
*  They sound so much like Zeppelin, but I don't mind.
*  They get away with it because they're so good.
*  They're the best tribute band ever.
*  They are, man.
*  I listen to them.
*  I rock out.
*  They're fucking really young.
*  I feel like 21 and shit.
*  They're babies.
*  Listen, man, I'm down for any 21-year-old kids that appreciate Zeppelin.
*  Fuck yes, man.
*  Zeppelin's still astonishing.
*  To me, they might be the greatest.
*  You got Pink Floyd, you got the Beatles, you got the Stones, you got the Who, but rock
*  and roll in terms of a group that we still listen to and everything stops, I think it's
*  a great song.
*  They're certainly one of the all-time greats, but it's like almost every different style
*  of music has its appropriate moment where it hits you perfectly.
*  There's a moment where you want to hear Voodoo Child and it comes on and you're like, ah,
*  but then there's a moment where sitting on the dock of the bay is the perfect song to
*  hear.
*  They're very different.
*  I like Thank You by Zeppelin sometimes.
*  I was at a shitty bowling alley and Kickstart, my heart came on.
*  I couldn't have been more happy.
*  It depends on your mood.
*  That's a fucking great workout song, but that's the song.
*  If you're at a bowling alley and Motley Crue Kickstart, my heart comes on, you're like,
*  yeah.
*  It's the right song for the moment.
*  Sarah McLaughlin there, you'd be like, what are you doing to me?
*  What are you doing to me?
*  But other times Sarah McLaughlin's the perfect song.
*  It's the perfect song.
*  It's all different, man.
*  They all have their own little spot in the wave of time.
*  They do.
*  They really do.
*  You never know what you need to hear sometimes until you hear it.
*  Sometimes a song will come on the radio and at the perfect time, you're listening to Spotify
*  or something like that and a song comes on just when you needed to hear it.
*  There's Kickstart, my heart.
*  Is that Sam Kinnison?
*  Yes it is.
*  He was the driver.
*  Wow.
*  That's the downhill moments for Sam Kinnison, hanging out with these motherfuckers, doing
*  coke until fucking seven o'clock in the morning and then trying to do a show at the comedy
*  store and being half out of it.
*  That's what ruined him, man.
*  Yeah it is.
*  Is success and partying.
*  I still to this day maintain that the Kinnison between 86 and 88 was probably the best comic
*  that ever lived.
*  He was a monster.
*  Phenomenal.
*  He was a monster.
*  He was making fun of shit that no one had the balls to touch.
*  He was crushing things.
*  I'm going to go watch him again.
*  Oh my God.
*  That year, this is him from the Ronnie Dangerfield comedy special.
*  Bro, he was a monster.
*  Another head injury victim.
*  Did you know that?
*  Yes siree Bob.
*  Him like Roseanne Barr.
*  Well no, I know he.
*  One thing they both have in common.
*  That's how he died.
*  No, no, no, no, no.
*  He was hit by a car when he was a kid.
*  Oh.
*  Yeah.
*  His brother Bill wrote a book called Brother Sam and it's like a story of Sam's life.
*  It's a really good book.
*  If you're a Sam Kinnison fan, I recommend it highly.
*  I mean he's brother Bill.
*  He was a strange looking guy.
*  I think it's called Brother Sam.
*  I think I'm right.
*  Anyway, in the book he talks about how Sam was hit by a car and like really bad when
*  he was a little kid.
*  And then after that his personality changed.
*  He became very impulsive, very wild.
*  He couldn't control him.
*  It's a head injury thing.
*  Of course it is.
*  It's the same as Roseanne Barr.
*  The exact same story.
*  She had the same thing.
*  She was 15.
*  This is one of the main reasons why I wanted to have her on my podcast after her controversy
*  and have her air this out to people.
*  Like you guys have to under, I love that lady.
*  I've known her forever.
*  She's a wonderful person and she is a person with like legitimate mental illness.
*  She was hit by a car when she was 15 years old.
*  A lady couldn't see because the sun was coming in.
*  It was hitting her windshield and it hit her in the middle of the fucking intersection
*  and sent her flying.
*  She was in a mental institute for nine months after that.
*  She couldn't count anymore.
*  Okay.
*  They put her in a fucking insane asylum.
*  She's losing her mind.
*  She's on a host of different pills.
*  It's one of the reasons why she's such a great comic because she doesn't give a fuck.
*  She's brash and she just says things like when they, and when she first came out, man,
*  people don't remember.
*  But when I remember when I was a kid and Roseanne Barr first came out, I think it was HBO or
*  one of those comedy specials, we got to see her do stand up.
*  You're like, what is this?
*  This is like a new type of lady comedian.
*  Like how Kinnison was a new type of male comedian.
*  But it's the same thing.
*  They didn't give a fuck.
*  They had head injuries.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's one of the reasons why I wanted to have her on to tell her, but hey, you're
*  dealing with someone who's on a host of different medications.
*  They fluctuate.
*  They go back and forth.
*  They're always changing her meds and moving her meds around.
*  Plus she takes Ambien.
*  Plus she smokes weed.
*  Plus she drinks.
*  Like listen, a little compassion.
*  She's a nice lady.
*  It's what Sapolsky talks about.
*  Like you don't know what's going on in her brain.
*  If you did, you'd be a lot more sympathetic to somebody who's, you know.
*  She's a huge proponent in the idea of free will being a farce.
*  It's not real.
*  I know.
*  Sam Harris says that too.
*  Yes.
*  Well, the scientists who can look at things from a completely non-emotional level.
*  I see where they're coming from with that.
*  Well I do think, sometimes I wonder if we're programmed.
*  I don't know what my motivations are, what drives me.
*  I know, like I think about, for me, I think about stand up and how much I love it.
*  And so I'm very guarded of my body, right?
*  Because I just don't want anything to fuck up so I can keep doing it.
*  Like the worst thing that would happen to me is I couldn't do stand up.
*  You know?
*  But is that me?
*  Is that, I just remember loving making people laugh.
*  There are a whole host of personality characteristics that have been there from the start if I think
*  back.
*  Well it certainly is you.
*  It certainly is you and you certainly are responsible for your choices.
*  But also, you are the victim of your circumstances.
*  You are the product or the benefactor of all these years of things happening.
*  All these different events.
*  All the people you know, which is one of the big ones.
*  This is what I concentrate on, I think, more than anything in my life.
*  The quality of the people around you dictates the quality of your life.
*  And this is an equation that people, for whatever reason, don't put down as significant or primary.
*  But the quality of the people that you have in your life is everything.
*  You could be camping, like you and I were in Montana, nine degrees out with a bunch
*  of great guys, and we had a good fucking time.
*  We didn't have a house.
*  Stay warm by fire.
*  But the quality of our life was significant.
*  It was great.
*  Because the quality of the people that you're around, that's everything, man.
*  People that are worried about money or fame or credibility or whatever accolades you think
*  you deserve that you're not getting, the quality of the people that are around you is everything.
*  They drive you, they change your opinions, they challenge you, they show compassion,
*  they show warmth and camaraderie that allows you to be more comfortable with who you are.
*  You open up to each other.
*  This is everything in this life, is community.
*  And one of the things that's most lost when we're dealing with urbanization and large
*  groups of people, one of the things that's most lost is our sense of community.
*  The more people we have, the less value those people have, and they're more of a nuisance
*  they become.
*  They're just some fucks ahead of you on the highway.
*  They're not human beings with lives and hopes and wishes.
*  They've become a burden.
*  They've become locusts.
*  They're not just a pretty grasshopper.
*  They're fucking everywhere.
*  It's just an overabundance.
*  That's what our problem is.
*  An overabundance and no quality.
*  No quality in your job choice.
*  No quality in the education that's thrust upon you.
*  No quality in the people that you're running into and your relationships that are on pills
*  and are wacky.
*  Distort the truth.
*  They're always a victim.
*  They're never wrong.
*  Like, ugh.
*  Or you could be around a bunch of cool people and your life's amazing.
*  That's what's cool about podcasting, because at least you can listen to people who, you
*  know, positive people.
*  You should start a podcast called Brian Callan is Your Friend.
*  Yes.
*  Hey, kids.
*  Here's my tip for today.
*  Wasn't that Brody's Twitter handle?
*  Wasn't Brody as me friend?
*  Yeah.
*  I want to start.
*  I might start a podcast with me, Sasso, and Delia.
*  Why give it ten minutes?
*  Why don't you guys, you guys are just getting warmed up for ten minutes.
*  I know.
*  Just make it ours.
*  Sasso and I might do one where we start funny.
*  I don't want to go through the concept.
*  Two top secret guys.
*  Why don't you just bring back the one with the three of you guys?
*  Why is that so hard?
*  Maybe that's in the works, bro.
*  Just go for ours.
*  Maybe that's a big secret.
*  Maybe we're going to unveil it.
*  I don't know yet.
*  I got an idea.
*  Why don't you do a podcast with Chris Delia and Will Sasso?
*  What?
*  You can't take credit for that idea, dude.
*  That's a good idea.
*  You can have it.
*  You don't know if it's in the works or not yet, man.
*  No, no, no.
*  You can have that idea.
*  All right.
*  I'll think about it.
*  Now that you mention it, maybe we will.
*  But put me in the credits.
*  Inspired by Joe Roe.
*  100%.
*  100%.
*  We'll bring you in.
*  We'll bring you in.
*  Imagine being the kind of person.
*  There are people out there that actually want credit for coming up with an idea that they
*  didn't come up with.
*  There are people out there that want like show runners, right, that step in after someone's
*  created a pilot and they say, I want created by credit.
*  Seen it.
*  And then I'll run the show.
*  That is one of the most bonkers things you ever see in Hollywood.
*  You can have a conversation in a goddamn room.
*  And then a year later you got this show and that person will show up and sue you.
*  Oh yeah.
*  And it's happened.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I knew a dude who submitted a script to a major Hollywood production company.
*  They turned him down and then they went ahead and made the movie.
*  Yeah.
*  And they made the movie.
*  It was a blockbuster with big time stars.
*  He sued them.
*  He won.
*  He should win.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's fair because people do that all the time.
*  A lot of times if you're not a writer and you're an executive, you're under so much
*  pressure to come up with an idea.
*  Somebody comes up with an idea and you're like, that's a good idea.
*  But I got a better, we can add some shit to it.
*  Right.
*  But you're supposed to have a deal.
*  You're supposed to make a deal.
*  It's supposed to be called don't take what doesn't belong to you.
*  Don't be a fucking thieving cunt.
*  Don't be a thieving cunt.
*  The movie was The Expendables.
*  Yeah.
*  It's very easy.
*  The guy was a writer for, he was a student of Eddie Bravo's.
*  Yeah.
*  So I was around when the whole thing was going down.
*  We're all like, whoa, they just stole your idea.
*  They just jacked it.
*  Well, speaking of The Expendables, you know my new favorite person.
*  Allegedly.
*  I should say allegedly to all the things I've just said.
*  I don't know if this is true.
*  It could have been a big giant lie.
*  Someone was on Adderall and they just started lying to me.
*  My favorite one, my new favorite person is a guy named Sly Stallone.
*  Oh, you told me he went to his house for the fights.
*  Yeah.
*  But like I learned some shit about him.
*  David Blaine showed up and you got to have him on the podcast.
*  David Blaine showed up and did Magic.
*  Actually, I don't.
*  How about that?
*  I don't.
*  I could live the rest of my life and not have David Blaine on the podcast.
*  I'll be fine.
*  I'm just saying.
*  I think he'd be a great guest.
*  Don't get me wrong.
*  I think you'd like it.
*  I don't like you telling him what to do.
*  All right.
*  I'm just saying, bro.
*  You have to have him on?
*  The fuck is that?
*  Look at that picture.
*  I told his daughter to take that picture and I just got, because I wanted to jump in while
*  they were all doing that and it was just me and behind him.
*  How thick is Stallone's hair?
*  That is preposterous.
*  It looks fantastic.
*  Why is his hair so good?
*  Because he's fucking sly.
*  Do you think he has someone who does him up before the picture?
*  He knows you guys are coming over so he has his hairdresser pluff it all up and make it
*  look sexy?
*  He shows up like that and just looks, you know.
*  I like how he's got the Jay Leno shirt on too.
*  Great fucking sense of humor.
*  Oh, he does.
*  I interviewed him once for Spike TV.
*  So funny.
*  He was hilarious.
*  Someone heckled and he goes, hey, ma.
*  He's got it.
*  On top of that.
*  Look at you.
*  I know.
*  I'm all excited.
*  You think I'm not cool in that group.
*  Why does Arnold look so solemn?
*  Because he was watching the fight.
*  He didn't give a fuck about anybody.
*  His fight is very important.
*  But he's also really cool when you talk to him.
*  I'm sure.
*  But me and Deleah, Deleah goes like this to me.
*  We're sitting there with all those legends and Deleah goes like this.
*  He goes, I got weird shit going on in my chest, man.
*  I feel weird.
*  He didn't know what to do with all his.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Fucking Frank Gorilla was so funny.
*  How about that bartender?
*  Like, what about me, man?
*  Oh my God.
*  He's trying to poke his head over his shoulder.
*  I mean, do you get any more famous?
*  Imagine being a fly on that wall.
*  You know what Stallone's really good at?
*  Besides horseback riding, world class horseback rider.
*  Sucking cock?
*  No, man.
*  I just made that up.
*  No, painting.
*  Oh, I believe that.
*  Me, Deleah, ask Deleah about it.
*  Me, Deleah, David Blaine and Frank Gorilla are following him around his house like a
*  cup, like beta, like little puppies as he's pointing to his insane paintings.
*  That he's made himself.
*  Oh, dude.
*  That's amazing.
*  Fails him for, I won't even go to how much they, I went, how much are you selling for?
*  And the number he gave me, I went, of course.
*  And I looked at Frank and I went, Frank, I'm a piece of shit.
*  Wait, first of all, why are you asking him numbers?
*  Because I asked personal fucking questions.
*  That's so weird.
*  Because I asked personal questions.
*  Isn't that weird of you?
*  No, because I wanted one.
*  Okay.
*  But don't you feel weird saying, hey man, how much money do you make?
*  No, I said, well, I said, I said, if I wanted to buy, like, would you sell these?
*  He goes, yeah.
*  I go, can you give me a ballpark figure?
*  And the ballpark figure, I went, oh, that's, I'll never be able to buy that.
*  But they were so cool.
*  I'll be self-short.
*  You should live your life and your goal should be having enough money so it seems reasonable
*  to buy us a lone painting.
*  That's what I want to do.
*  That should be your, your, like, magic feature.
*  That's why I want to sell out the Wilbur, everybody.
*  Look at those paintings.
*  He's a great painter.
*  That's actually kind of cool.
*  What is that?
*  What's going on back there?
*  I'm telling you.
*  Is that an elephant in a clock?
*  That's a dude's back?
*  What is that?
*  I don't know, but he's a great painter.
*  This is when I was younger.
*  Ooh.
*  It's so good.
*  Is that supposed to be him?
*  I looked at, I looked at Grillo and I got mad.
*  I went, hey, I'm a fucking loser.
*  I got to get myself together.
*  I got to do something else.
*  Listen, man, the guy does a lot of shit.
*  Is that, did he take a, did he paint himself?
*  No, I think it's getting mixed in with pictures of him.
*  Oh, pictures of him, paintings of him.
*  Yeah.
*  No, he's a, look, man, the guy wrote Rocky and then would not accept them having anybody
*  else play the character when he was nobody.
*  He's got balls of steel.
*  Blaine took a video of me listening to him as he read the first page of the Rocky script
*  in his, in his office.
*  I wish I wasn't there.
*  I would have ran through that wall like the fucking Kool-Aid man.
*  Like, I can't.
*  Boom.
*  I can't.
*  I got to get out of here.
*  He told us a story about how Joe Frazier came into audition for it, for the Apollo Queen
*  thing.
*  And, and he said, he said, you know, I want, you know, we decided to do some boxing just,
*  just to have him, you know, cause they were going to be fight scenes.
*  And he said, he said, I tried to, he goes, Frazier started tapping me.
*  Tapping me in different places.
*  And I, he literally was just like, what the fuck is going on?
*  It was like getting caught in a buzz saw.
*  He's like, wait, this is not going to work in a movie.
*  What the fuck are you doing?
*  And then, and it's same thing with Roberta Duran.
*  He, you know, he's like, I box a little bit.
*  He said, I started getting hit like in so many different places that it's, I, I felt
*  like I was in a washing machine.
*  The way he tells the story is fucking hilarious.
*  Yeah, those guys, they know what, look at this.
*  This is when I was younger, when I was Rambo.
*  Oh, the best.
*  Look at my fucking hair.
*  Italian fucking horn.
*  With the Italian horn.
*  Look at that fucking hair.
*  And Peyton.
*  Yeah.
*  Interesting.
*  His daughters are fucking great too.
*  He's a, yeah, he's a, he's a really fascinating guy.
*  Very, very unusual guy.
*  And the thing about him is like, he's done so many of these big blockbuster hits that
*  I think people forget that he can actually act.
*  If you go back and watch Rocky one, you go, oh, this guy's a really good actor.
*  Yeah, dude.
*  He was in Rocky one, man.
*  You get to see like who he was, you know, a young guy.
*  Well, in first blood, when he got that script, he's the one who said, cause he was a homicidal
*  maniac, the character.
*  And he said, he said, this isn't going to work.
*  He's got to be a killer, but specifically you can't just kill everybody.
*  He's got to have a philosophy behind why he fucking does this.
*  He's got to have a purpose.
*  I love that movie.
*  How great was this movie?
*  Yeah.
*  That's, that's young, angry, skinny faced alone.
*  Look at them cheeks, son.
*  He was 165, I think when he made that movie.
*  I believe it.
*  Yeah.
*  Fascinating character in Hollywood.
*  I mean, you never had a guy with the longevity that Sylvester Storm was at.
*  45 years.
*  45 fucking years.
*  He is still making action movies.
*  He's 150,000 years old.
*  He's still making action movies.
*  And he'll buy it.
*  Bill Burr was there.
*  He's been there the two times I've been there.
*  And Bill, you know, Bill.
*  Bill Burr went to the house?
*  Yeah.
*  He's there every time.
*  So Bill goes, I'm listening.
*  I'm standing like a fucking loser.
*  It's Stallone.
*  It's Schwarzenegger.
*  And I think Pacino and they're talking.
*  It's my childhood.
*  And I'm, I kind of in, I'm standing in that group sort of.
*  And I'm like this.
*  And I don't want to say anything.
*  I want to say anything just about something.
*  Do you want to impress him with some of your esoteric knowledge?
*  So badly.
*  So badly.
*  I was, I wasn't even listening.
*  I was like, well, can I say, Hey, you guys ever read?
*  Chomsky?
*  Yeah.
*  Chomsky.
*  Whatever.
*  Anyway, look, a fucking loser.
*  And Bill Burr walks up behind me.
*  Bill walks up behind me.
*  The new Rambajas playing at the most recent work.
*  Him riding.
*  Joey Diaz said that this is Roadhouse on steroids.
*  He goes, Joe Rogan, listen to me.
*  This fucking movie is amazing.
*  I want to see it.
*  It's Roadhouse on steroids.
*  It's fucking incredible.
*  You love it.
*  He goes, get high to the fucking gills.
*  Look at this.
*  Oh, what the fuck?
*  Rambajas got a dick ass.
*  He beats all those guys?
*  Of course he does.
*  Dude, that's a lot of guns to have to dodge.
*  Shut your fucking mouth.
*  All right.
*  I don't know, bro.
*  Shut your mouth.
*  I'm a fan, but still.
*  He's drawing a bow back.
*  How realistic is this?
*  Oh, it's a hundred percent realistic.
*  Fuck you, man.
*  All I want to do.
*  Do you even ask?
*  What do you hate, America?
*  All I want to do is shoot an explosive arrow.
*  Since you love those communists that you were talking about.
*  No, dude, I swear I don't, man.
*  He booby traps this house and fucks everybody up.
*  Chopping them up.
*  Dude, you drove me crazy.
*  Dude, you draw first blood of that fucking dude and he'll draw last blood.
*  He got real lean a few years back, like crazy lean.
*  He was playing this, I think he was playing a hit man.
*  And it was actually a pretty fucking good movie, an interesting movie.
*  Like, it didn't get enough credit.
*  Like, what was the...
*  Bullet to the Head?
*  That's it.
*  Bullet to the Head.
*  Let me see that.
*  Bullet to the Head was a pretty fucking good action movie.
*  But...
*  Oh, shit.
*  But look how lean he got.
*  He got like triathlete lean.
*  Not, well, more crossfitter.
*  More crossfitter lean.
*  I asked him if he had any injuries from all the things.
*  He goes to his phone and showed me his spine and all the operations.
*  I mean, he's been through...
*  I got fucking bolts on my neck like Frankenstein.
*  Is that Jason Momoa?
*  I think it is.
*  I hope it is.
*  Hey, I'm watching this fucking movie as soon as I get home.
*  Of course.
*  Who else is allowed to be that big and handsome?
*  Dude.
*  Only Jason Momoa.
*  Jason Momoa was the best looking man on the planet.
*  Yeah, I think he is in this movie.
*  I want to look like that.
*  But, yeah, this was not that long ago, but it was a good movie.
*  Like a good, solid, you know, action movie.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, I enjoyed it.
*  I enjoyed it.
*  Like, I'm a Stallone fan.
*  I've been watching that guy's movies forever.
*  But what I liked about this...
*  It's a Walter Hill film, too.
*  What I liked about this movie was...
*  I mean, not just liked about it, but that Stallone got like super crazy lean.
*  Like, he was...
*  He looked like he was only 170 pounds.
*  Oh, Christian Slater.
*  Slater.
*  There you go, buddy.
*  Full star cast.
*  Bill Burr walks up to me right behind me as I'm listening to these guys trying to get
*  into the car.
*  And he goes like this.
*  He goes, hey, you've been here for an hour already.
*  Get over it.
*  He just keeps walking.
*  Bill's the best, right?
*  Bill told me that he's fucking...
*  He's going to start working out.
*  He called me up.
*  He goes, hey, dude, you fell out a medium sweater.
*  You look good.
*  I'm coming for that title, you piece of shit.
*  He can never say anything nice.
*  He goes, we came off stage one time at the comics tour.
*  I mean, the laugh factor.
*  He was so funny and so good.
*  And I go, I think you're the best right now, period.
*  I love you.
*  I think you're the best.
*  And I have to say it.
*  And I'm a professional comic and I'm pretty funny myself.
*  And I'm saying it from you.
*  And if I'm saying it, I'm right.
*  So that's how it is.
*  And I walked away from him.
*  Got a message.
*  He goes, hey, Bri, I got to tell you, the shit you were doing was killing me.
*  I loved it.
*  Coming from you, that meant a lot to me.
*  I just want to thank you because I had this fucking gig.
*  It didn't go well.
*  It was just tough for me.
*  But just hearing that from you was fucking because you're hilarious.
*  I love you.
*  Thank you.
*  And go fuck yourself, though, because I can't be nice for too long.
*  I saved the message for a long time.
*  He's a fucking character, man.
*  There's so many good comics right now.
*  It's such a good time.
*  Hell yeah.
*  We're lucky as fuck.
*  And we're all friends.
*  Yeah, that's what's interesting, right?
*  Yeah, man.
*  You know, in those Kinnison days we were talking about, like Dyson, Kinnison fucking hated each other, man.
*  Yeah, there's none of that shit.
*  There's a bullet hole in the sign in the back parking lot because Kinnison pulled out a gun, shot the fucking sign, scared Dyson off.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  That's impulsive.
*  That fucking sign had a hole in it forever.
*  I remember.
*  And they fixed the glass part.
*  I'm like, why would you fix it?
*  It's crazy.
*  Don't fix it.
*  I know.
*  That crack is magical, man.
*  That's where Kinnison shot through.
*  That's part of the fun.
*  I agree.
*  I think the bullet hole is still in the back, though.
*  You still feel the bullet hole.
*  The podcasting and probably yours for the most part has changed.
*  There it is.
*  There's the hole.
*  Look at that.
*  I remember it so well.
*  The fucking Kinnison bullet hole sign.
*  Damn.
*  That's head injuries, kid.
*  Yeah.
*  I know all about that stuff.
*  Carrying a gun.
*  That's what made him a great...
*  It's almost like you have to be sick in the head to be that funny.
*  I know.
*  I'm going to get into shooting, by the way.
*  I saw you were...
*  Come.
*  I saw you.
*  I want to do that for real.
*  Okay, let's go next week.
*  I'm going to go to the gym.
*  I'm going to go to the gym.
*  I'm going to go to the gym.
*  I'm going to go to the gym.
*  I'm going to go to the gym.
*  I'm going to go to the gym.
*  I'm going to go to the gym.
*  I'm going to go to the gym.
*  I'm going to go to the gym.
*  I'm going to go to the gym.
*  I'm going to go to the gym.
*  I'm going to go to the gym.
*  I'm going to go to the gym.
*  I'm going to go to the gym.
*  I'm going to go to the gym.
*  I'm going to go to the gym.
*  I'm going to go to the gym.
*  I'm going to go to the gym.
*  I'm going to go to the gym.
*  I'm going to go to the gym.
*  I'm going to say, because I don't practice it, I'm going to say no more than a minute,
*  but I'm going to try.
*  Really?
*  A minute?
*  I don't know.
*  Are you skeptical?
*  Remember, I can do a lot of pull-ups.
*  No, I can do more than a minute.
*  I do two minutes and 15 seconds.
*  That's a long fucking time.
*  You've been practicing it.
*  Don't tell me otherwise.
*  I've been dedicated to it over the last two months.
*  All right, so now I'm going to do it.
*  I usually was doing a couple minutes a day, but I was breaking it up into 30-second chunks,
*  or maybe I'd go a minute.
*  about two months ago to see how long I could hold on for.
*  It's good for your shoulders, I'd say.
*  What helps me is if I hold on for like 15, 20 seconds and I rest for a long time, and
*  then I go back and do it, I could do it a lot longer.
*  So I should warm up for it?
*  Yeah.
*  Okay, let me ask you this.
*  That's how I got it.
*  I powder my hands too.
*  I chalk my hands up.
*  That's big too.
*  I'm doing that too.
*  Because your hands get sweaty and then it fucks with your grip.
*  Let me ask you this.
*  When you hang, do you have tension or are you totally loose?
*  Totally loose.
*  Yes, but one trick that I do when I start getting really tired is I tense up.
*  So I squeeze the bar harder and I start doing these.
*  We go that and then let down.
*  I go up and then let down.
*  It's almost like it's distracting me from the fact that my hands are burning out.
*  And I feel like it also engages maybe almost like a different way of holding it that gives
*  you a little bit of a break.
*  Not much of a break.
*  You're still hanging on.
*  There goes the podcast because all I'm thinking about now is doing that.
*  Yeah.
*  I worked out today with it.
*  Here's the thing.
*  It's made my hands thicker.
*  It's harder for me to get my wedding ring off because my fingers are actually getting
*  thicker.
*  I worked out with my friend Rudy Reyes.
*  Do you know who that is?
*  No, I don't.
*  Bring up Rudy Reyes.
*  What did he do to you, Brian?
*  Don't worry about it.
*  Let's take a look at his body for a second.
*  He's 48 years old.
*  Please understand what he's about.
*  Do you make you get pumped?
*  We worked kettlebells, bro.
*  And we did some body weight.
*  Oh, you told me that this is like the first time you've ever really worked kettlebells,
*  right?
*  Yes, sir.
*  It's amazing, isn't it?
*  It's what's up.
*  Fuck.
*  It's what I love.
*  Well, this is the second time.
*  It's the best thing that translates into jujitsu.
*  There's something about like if you have like a 50 or 70 pound kettlebell and you're cleaning
*  and pressing it and do windmills and all that, that to me is like that really works for jujitsu.
*  That's not a good.
*  You got to see him now.
*  What are you talking about?
*  I don't want him to look better than that.
*  No, he couldn't be better looking.
*  I don't like it.
*  Look at him there.
*  You got to have him with his beard.
*  That's my boy right there.
*  Recon Marine.
*  Jesus.
*  Yeah.
*  He's not fat.
*  No, his body's so stupid.
*  You got to see the chest.
*  Get him naked.
*  Look at his shoulder.
*  Stop right there.
*  Pause.
*  Like back up a little bit.
*  Look at the striations in his shoulder.
*  That dude is like 4% body fat.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  It's stupid.
*  Let's go ahead and get him naked, bro.
*  Well, he can't get down to two.
*  I've never seen a body like this.
*  It's me and Stevie Blue eyes.
*  Everybody else was always like, well, that's who I want to look like.
*  You want to see it naked?
*  No, I didn't say it out loud.
*  Is it on his Instagram?
*  Does he take thirst pics?
*  Yeah.
*  Is that Cheeto Santino in him at the top?
*  No.
*  Look at you guys together.
*  Go over.
*  I don't like how he's hugging you.
*  I'm getting jealous.
*  I don't like that picture.
*  Go to that picture again with him and you together.
*  Look at that.
*  I don't like how he's hugging you.
*  Look at me.
*  I look like a fucking old nurse.
*  I don't like how he's hugging you.
*  He's hugging you like he's going to take you down.
*  But fuck you.
*  He will.
*  Seems like he's going to.
*  If I guessed, I would think this kept going.
*  You'd have a look on your face of shock.
*  And then his wrist would be cinched tighter in your waist.
*  And then next thing you see, one of your legs is up in the air.
*  Oh!
*  Do the Kung Fu thing.
*  The one on the right of that?
*  Yeah, for no reason.
*  Oh!
*  Let's see.
*  Oh, Jim!
*  He's doing Kung Fu with bands.
*  Just for the fuck of it.
*  If he started a cult, you know how many chicks he could bang?
*  Oh, dude.
*  That's what he looks like.
*  That's what he looks like.
*  Look at that.
*  That guy was like with wooden beads on, teaching people how to meditate, just slinging dick
*  in a jungle somewhere.
*  Yes.
*  Right?
*  He pulls up to the class in a canoe and all the girls are waiting for him with beads on.
*  Like, class, let's begin.
*  He wears scarves.
*  The only guy, he's more muscular than Frank Grillo.
*  He's sexier than Frank Grillo, which is impossible to pull off.
*  The tights are suspect.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm not liking the tights.
*  I'll wear them.
*  It just seems weird.
*  Like, why do you have tights on?
*  I don't know, dude, but it doesn't matter because he's Rudy Reyes and I'm doing that.
*  It's a not choice.
*  It's a not choice for a grown man who's not in a yoga class.
*  Well, what are you doing?
*  Are you a gymnast?
*  Huh?
*  Yeah, maybe.
*  He does all that shit.
*  He does rings.
*  He does all that shit.
*  Jesus.
*  We gotta get serious, bro.
*  About what?
*  About our dance off.
*  You know what's fucking pathetic at 52?
*  Still talking about working out, still trying to get better and stronger.
*  I disagree.
*  I can't wait to go on testosterone.
*  I disagree.
*  Listen, I enjoy everything that I do.
*  I enjoy every part of being a man.
*  I do too.
*  It's fun.
*  I know.
*  It's fun.
*  So if it keeps going, why is that weird?
*  I like it.
*  I liked it when I was 30.
*  I like it now.
*  But I want the David Sinclair drugs.
*  I want to be fucking...
*  Yes, you gotta get some.
*  I want to figure out how to have the wind of a 30-year-old.
*  My body's betraying me.
*  Whitney told me she started taking NAD.
*  She's been taking NAD injections.
*  Jim, you know there's a place that hooks that up, right?
*  What is NAD?
*  That's a good question.
*  I'd butcher it.
*  But you can take it in pill form too, which I've been doing.
*  Oh, you have?
*  Yes.
*  Oh, is that what he was talking about, Sinclair?
*  Mm-hmm.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  There's a lot of other stuff that people are taking though that actually, it supposedly
*  maybe increases your lifespan but decreases performance.
*  That's that metformance stuff.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  That shit, yeah.
*  There's a lot of controversy with that.
*  As soon as we did that podcast, people that I know that are more into the performance
*  side of athletics and nutrition and well-being, they were like, eh, eh, eh.
*  That stuff is not really...
*  I talked to my doctor about it.
*  He said your blood work doesn't look like you would need it.
*  Nicotinamide adenine...
*  Dianucleotide.
*  Wow.
*  Say the first word.
*  Nicotinamide.
*  Nicotinamide.
*  Nicotinamide.
*  Nicotinamide.
*  Adenine.
*  Dianucleotide.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a problem with being a doctor in science is you have to remember all that fucking Latin.
*  Why is that?
*  May slow or even reverse the aging process?
*  What does this say, Jamie?
*  Put it back up?
*  Reverse the aspects of aging.
*  Also delay the progression of age-related diseases.
*  Holla at your boy.
*  If Whitney goes back in time, starts looking like she's 20, you know it works.
*  She looks pretty damn good.
*  She looks pretty good.
*  Yeah.
*  She's doing it every day too.
*  I love Whitney.
*  She's awesome.
*  I fucking love her.
*  She's one of the smartest people I know.
*  She's well-read.
*  She's always bringing up some books she read.
*  She's awesome.
*  Yeah.
*  She's always curious about shit.
*  That's so important in this life is just to constantly ... When you stop being curious
*  about things, just kind of go, boo.
*  I know.
*  She fucking shoots me when I don't realize I'm being shot.
*  She's videotaping me when I'm doing my usual silly shit in the green room.
*  I'm just like ... The other day I was coming in and I was ... I was like, the thing is
*  I shoot guns down and then ... And I'm doing this fucking weird ... Acting like a complete
*  idiot and she's videotaping the whole fucking thing and then puts it on her story.
*  I'm like, Whitney.
*  Of course.
*  Whitney.
*  Of course.
*  When are we going hunting?
*  Why don't you take me hunting?
*  Well, because you're not really fully committed.
*  Bullshit.
*  I'm there.
*  Number one, I'm dead eye.
*  Number two, I make you laugh.
*  Number three, I'm game eye.
*  I'm 100% down to go hunting with you.
*  You don't have to convince me.
*  But the difference is I do it for all my meat now and I bow hunt.
*  I need meat too, bro.
*  We started out together, Brian, in 2012.
*  We hunted together for the first time.
*  You went one way and I went another way.
*  You went the bow and arrow way and you bought me a bow.
*  I do it all the time.
*  How about this?
*  I didn't buy you a bow.
*  Hoyt paid for that bow.
*  Hoyt got you that bow.
*  I organized it.
*  I had it sent to you.
*  I've never shot it.
*  You should have shot it.
*  It's old now.
*  I've got to get a new one.
*  My dad was like, you and Joe Rogan look very similar, like brothers.
*  We were in Wikipedia for most of our lives until somebody figured it out.
*  Fuckers.
*  It said half brother to Brian Cowan on my Wikipedia bio forever.
*  People always say your brother's a good guy.
*  Thanks.
*  We always talk about this, but the moment we met, we were like, oh, fellow idiot.
*  How are you, traveler?
*  The greatest.
*  It's the greatest.
*  I got to do it all.
*  I got to do jujitsu boxing.
*  I don't know.
*  I'll end up in jail.
*  I was like, well, that sounds like my kind of guy.
*  Dummy's.
*  We both had pit bulls.
*  We were both dummies.
*  Oh my God.
*  Super duper dummies.
*  You picked me up so early in the morning.
*  I was like, I want to buy a dog just out of the box.
*  Dude, I look good with a beard.
*  Look at that.
*  And a shot.
*  That's turkey hunting.
*  Turkey hunting is fun because it's like, I swear to God, there's a feeling that you get
*  when you kill an animal that's not a happy feeling.
*  I agree.
*  There's a remorse that is like engulfing the happiness.
*  There's happiness, but there's also like a remorse.
*  I get serious.
*  I get sad.
*  There's no remorse when you blast a turkey.
*  I'm here to tell you.
*  I shot a turkey in the head.
*  I felt nothing.
*  Not only that, I put it on Instagram.
*  Nobody gave a fuck.
*  I was holding that turkey up by its feet.
*  I'm like, shot a turkey.
*  No one cared.
*  I know.
*  No vegans care about turkeys.
*  They should die.
*  And if you're around them, you care about them even less.
*  Well, everything wants to kill a turkey to the point where you have to cover your face
*  because otherwise they're like, ah, and they run away.
*  Look at the size of the one Steve got.
*  That's a big turkey.
*  That's what I call a big fucking tom.
*  Yeah, that's a big ass turkey, man.
*  I love using hunting terminology around hunters so they think I'm a more seasoned hunter than
*  I really am.
*  They're a cool animal.
*  Turkeys are a cool animal, man.
*  It really is.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, it's interesting.
*  It's a bird that kind of flies but doesn't.
*  It'd be the last bird I would choose to be.
*  They go up in a tree.
*  Yeah, forest hollies.
*  But that's about it.
*  They can just barely make it to a tree.
*  You gotta worry about coyotes, foxes.
*  Everything.
*  You gotta worry about everything.
*  Everything wants to eat you.
*  Everything.
*  Even probably other birds.
*  Oh, hell yeah.
*  Oh, dude, my kids found a, in my neighborhood, they found a, fucking, my son goes, daddy,
*  there's a bird that's dead.
*  And I go there and it was a dove with no head and its chest had been eaten out clearly
*  by a bird of prey.
*  Yeah, or an owl.
*  We have a big owl in the neighborhood.
*  Owls don't fuck around.
*  I had an owl that was killing hawks in my neighborhood.
*  What?
*  Yeah, these hawks were all beheaded.
*  And this owl just decided to start fucking up these hawks.
*  There is one of the best videos that I've ever seen online of animal interactions where
*  an owl swoops down and snatches a hawk out of its nest.
*  Have you ever seen that?
*  No.
*  Yeah, they got a camera on this nest of hawks.
*  So they kill hawks.
*  And they kill whatever the fuck they want.
*  Give a hoot, don't pollute.
*  Listen, that thing's a ruthless fucking killer.
*  Kill cats too.
*  They kill everything.
*  Cats, rabbits.
*  One of them, I was driving down the street to my house and I was driving, this owl was
*  like flying over the street holding a rabbit and just decided I was getting too close to
*  him.
*  So he just let the rabbit go and splat.
*  So I got out of the car to look at the rabbit, just disemboweled rabbit.
*  Just tore this fucking thing apart.
*  But this video, it was on my Instagram.
*  It's night vision and you see these hawks just hanging out in the nest like, oh well,
*  look at this.
*  Guess we'll just be here for the night.
*  No, look at the eyes.
*  Look at the eyes.
*  Look at the eyes.
*  I didn't know these were hawks.
*  Bitch!
*  Oh!
*  And the other one's like, hey, what the fuck happened?
*  Oh no.
*  What the fuck happened?
*  What the fuck happened?
*  One more time.
*  Look at the eyes.
*  Look at the eyes in the distance.
*  Look how quick.
*  See the eyes?
*  Look at that.
*  Here it comes.
*  Bitch!
*  I love that video.
*  I love that video.
*  It says Owl Attacks Hawk.
*  You can find the video online on YouTube.
*  Enjoy.
*  Owl Attacks Hawk.
*  You can find me at the Wilbur Theater.
*  Oh, are you doing comedy on New Year's Eve at the Wilbur Theater in Boston?
*  No, I don't want to talk about that.
*  But I mean, I'll be, if you're in...
*  Do you have a whole new hour?
*  I do have a whole new hour.
*  Wait a minute.
*  So you're going to do comedy on New Year's Eve in Boston?
*  At the Wilbur.
*  Oh my goodness, Peter.
*  And I'll be there.
*  I'll be in Arizona this Saturday at the Celebrity Theater if you want to come by.
*  I love the Celebrity Theater.
*  It's in the round.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a great place.
*  I'm excited.
*  That spins too a little bit, right?
*  I didn't know that.
*  I think it does a slow spin.
*  I gotta be ready.
*  I think you can turn it on or off.
*  I think it's up to you.
*  Alright.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm pretty sure the Celebrity Theater spins.
*  Alright.
*  Find out if that's true.
*  George Lopez did a special...
*  I'll be there tomorrow.
*  No, no.
*  Louis C.K. did a special there.
*  I think Lopez might have done something there too, but that's a great, great theater.
*  It's cool.
*  It's intimate.
*  Even though it's like a couple thousand people.
*  There it is.
*  Bang.
*  See, I think that thing rotates.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that thing rotates.
*  John Tolgum, he's that radio guy, he's a great guy.
*  It's his happy endings thing.
*  That's the first place I ever met Segura.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  I worked with Segura on the...
*  There was a tour I did with Charlie Murphy and John Heffron, and we had a different local
*  guy open up in every place, and Segura opened up there.
*  That's how I became buddies with him.
*  Yeah.
*  Funny man.
*  He's the best.
*  There it is.
*  Brian Cowan's in Phoenix.
*  Look at that right there, kids.
*  Frank Kellyindo and Adam Ray.
*  That's right.
*  That's a crazy lineup.
*  Uh-huh.
*  Are you going to spin it, if they let you spin it?
*  Find out if that thing spins.
*  Look at this.
*  Look at this.
*  Look at this.
*  Chris D'Alea goes, hey everyone, don't go to this.
*  He's such a dick.
*  He said the first fucking thing on my thing, hey everyone, don't go to this.
*  Your fake feud with him is very strange.
*  So much fun.
*  You guys make videos about each other.
*  He did the podcast yesterday.
*  It was the funniest thing in the world, the most insulting.
*  One time we were doing the podcast and he was just lying there and I go, be respectful
*  and sit the fuck up.
*  And I started talking and he just got up and he slapped me in the mouth.
*  I was like, I'll fucking kill you.
*  And I came at him and he started going, and tried to kiss me.
*  It was like kryptonite.
*  Yeah, he's a weirdo.
*  Yeah.
*  Weirdo.
*  He's from outer space.
*  Me and Will Sass always say he's from outer space.
*  There it is.
*  Look.
*  Look.
*  Funny motherfucker, man.
*  Hilarious.
*  And a great guy too.
*  Just a good dude.
*  I like being around him.
*  He's fun.
*  Yeah.
*  These are my inner circle.
*  Well, we're all weirdos, right?
*  He's a weirdo weirdo.
*  You reminded me of what Misfits we are because I wanted to do this idea where I was going
*  to do this thing for Onnit where we're going to come up with funny ways to sell product.
*  Thought it'd be a good way to recruit some comics and get them a job.
*  Get around a table and create a marketing thing.
*  None of them.
*  Two of them got back to me.
*  Everybody else like, sorry, I didn't tell you.
*  They're just fucking Misfits.
*  You can make real money, you fucking idiot.
*  Nah.
*  Too tired.
*  Too tired.
*  Too high.
*  Got to get up.
*  Too high.
*  Got to show at the Laugh Factory in two hours.
*  Fuck off.
*  Can't make it.
*  Sorry.
*  That's why you're funny.
*  Yeah, that's a lot of them.
*  A lot of people are funny because of the fact that they're impulsive.
*  They don't have discipline and they just, yeah.
*  That's part of what makes them funny is that they're also wild.
*  They're wild people.
*  They're not good at being disciplined and rigid and on a schedule that they create themselves.
*  I can't like yourself.
*  I would tell you that my acting, I was in Jeffrey Tambor's class and doing an acting
*  thing and Jeffrey Tambor looked at me and goes, you got a little self-esteem problem,
*  huh?
*  Feel like your second banana in general in life?
*  And some guy goes, thank God.
*  And everybody looks up at him and he goes, well, he wouldn't be funny if he didn't hate
*  himself, so I'll take him this way.
*  I never forgot it.
*  I was like, yeah.
*  All right.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know if you have to like yourself that much.
*  I think you should always be a little dissatisfied with yourself.
*  It works for me.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't think you should be satisfied very often if you want to be good at anything.
*  I'm fulfilled.
*  Because I think you're on a path, right?
*  You're on an improvement and growth path.
*  You're trying to get better.
*  Whatever it is, it's tennis, right?
*  You're trying to get better at it all the time.
*  If you want to get better at it all the time, you got to be scrutinizing.
*  You can't be happy about certain moments where you were really good and think that's you.
*  You got to be thinking about the things that didn't go good and go, I got to fix that part.
*  There's that famous story, whether it's true or not, but I think it is.
*  Rafael Nadal had just won Wimbledon, one of the greatest of all time.
*  Have you ever seen him play like his athleticism, his power?
*  He hits the ball so hard that the ball, I can't remember if this is, the ball revolves
*  twice as fast.
*  It makes 20s many revolutions as the average high level tennis player.
*  That's how hard, that's how much spin it is.
*  It's like it's 80 versus 40 or something.
*  He got up and he just won Wimbledon.
*  It was amazing.
*  He's back in the locker room going, I don't know if my grip should have been a little
*  bit, I feel like it should, I think I'm going to change.
*  It's still adjusting after a one.
*  You have to be.
*  That's how you get to be that guy.
*  Yes.
*  As soon as you get to be that guy and you go, oh, I got it, then you're going to fall
*  off.
*  You're done.
*  That happens to everybody.
*  Don't you feel standups that way too though?
*  100%.
*  You know, it's the same thing with Kinnison, right?
*  Yeah.
*  You know, Kinnison, when he was on fire, he was longing for acceptance and longing for
*  respect and attention and he was going to take it.
*  Yeah.
*  He just went out there fucking guns blazing like an animal.
*  But then once he got it, he's partying with Bon Jovi and Motley Crue and they're doing
*  blow fucking on tour bus and drinking vodka till five in the morning.
*  All that chaos, it's just, it stops being the same thing.
*  Life is now, you're celebrating the fact that you're the shit instead of you're desperate
*  to make the best work you can make.
*  Desperate to work.
*  I talked to this, I won't say his name, but a famous rock and roller who made a, what's
*  his name?
*  Elton John?
*  May as well be.
*  But the guy, he made a seminal album, like an album that's a classic album.
*  And I said, what do you think it was?
*  He goes, I was just so desperate to be heard.
*  I was desperate to be heard.
*  And then you get older and you get rich and you kind of prove that you can do it and you
*  lose.
*  Bob Dylan talks about that.
*  He goes, I don't know who wrote those songs.
*  I don't remember.
*  Like they said, they read his lyrics back and he said, isn't that something?
*  Like who did that?
*  Not me.
*  I don't know.
*  I can't do that anymore.
*  That's a fear of mine.
*  I want to be, I want to stay hungry.
*  Well with standup, the difference is you can't just go back and redo your old songs.
*  You have to constantly be relevant.
*  You have to have stuff that works right now.
*  And the people can't have heard it too many times.
*  It's not like songs.
*  Like I still want to hear, like if you went to see the Rolling Stones, you'd want to hear
*  Brown Sugar.
*  Yeah.
*  You'd want to hear it.
*  Yeah.
*  And there's like, there's songs that are just iconic and they give you a good feeling when
*  you hear them.
*  Yep.
*  Not jokes.
*  No man, jokes.
*  I appreciate old comedy.
*  Like I go back and watch it with like an, like I'm watching art or something like that.
*  I'm watching someone's work and I can appreciate it, but I don't appreciate it from like the
*  feeling that you get when you see it the first time and you laugh and you're surprised and
*  you know, the punch lines come out and you're like, ah, I was, I was surprised that Bill
*  Cosby had only done one album.
*  What?
*  Yeah.
*  One or two albums.
*  I was really shocked at that.
*  I was like, I thought he'd done like 14 or something.
*  Is that true?
*  Yeah.
*  Did mostly what he did was videos.
*  I guess.
*  I don't know.
*  He was just, didn't he have like albums of his videos?
*  I don't know.
*  Really?
*  Is that what it was like?
*  I thought he'd done like 14 or 15 albums.
*  He found a lot.
*  How many?
*  I mean, there's, I mean, I just typed in Bill Cosby albums.
*  He's got three separate vinyls.
*  So three albums, three vinyls, three, seven, 2004, 70, 71, 67, 68.
*  All right.
*  So much for that.
*  Oh, he had a lot.
*  Whoops.
*  Me and shop looked it up and we're like, we only find you guys are morons and you know,
*  Jamie's a wizard.
*  Jamie, you're good.
*  Hey, fucking chin.
*  It's called the type Cosby.
*  Get it the fucking get it.
*  You guys even type Cosby right.
*  God damn it.
*  He built Bill Burr and I were supposed to go see him before the scandal hit.
*  We were supposed to go see him.
*  We're going to make a trip to go see him in Vegas.
*  I think Bill, Bill wound up seeing him another, another time.
*  Hold on.
*  Come on.
*  Hey man.
*  That's what I thought.
*  That's what I said.
*  20 albums.
*  I said, and then I got.
*  He's got music albums to he's got one, two, stop, stop, stop, stop.
*  He's got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, what?
*  I think 17 music albums.
*  No, this is crazy.
*  Look at all these music albums.
*  20 ish.
*  We had marching band, bro, concerts.
*  He had music albums.
*  So 12 albums.
*  More than that.
*  Wait, no, we have way more.
*  Way more.
*  16, 17, 17, 17, 19.
*  You couldn't have been more wrong.
*  And yet you stated it so confidently.
*  21.
*  Chin, you're fired.
*  God damn it.
*  Cause I said this and then we'd only find one and I was so embarrassed.
*  I rarely can.
*  Well, now you're embarrassed again.
*  That's what's really a shame.
*  No, I was right.
*  No, cause I was right the first time.
*  So fuck off.
*  Edit that out.
*  Edit all that out.
*  I see what you did.
*  I see what you did.
*  He's got a bunch of Grammys too.
*  Yeah.
*  You get to keep those.
*  Even after you're in jail for rape.
*  Sure.
*  Only person, like OJ was supposed to lose his Heisman and they can't find it, I think.
*  Oh, that's right.
*  He's like, hmm, can't find it.
*  I don't know where it went.
*  Hey Twitter world, can't find my Heisman.
*  Yeah.
*  His, his Twitter feed is so bizarre watching it because he does it different than anybody.
*  Everything is, Hey Twitter world.
*  And everything is about football.
*  It's like, it's all about like what this guy needs to do.
*  And obviously he knows a lot about football.
*  He's a fucking world-class player.
*  One of the best of all time.
*  But in the, in the comments or where the real show is, the comments is all knife emojis
*  and you really killed that one, OJ.
*  And it's like everyone takes their own crack at him in the comments.
*  God damn.
*  What's he doing now?
*  I wonder if he's, he's playing golf and.
*  Selling merch.
*  Oh my God.
*  Selling merch.
*  There should be like a hidden knife in there somewhere.
*  You know, like the angle where like, like, you know, Sierra's legs are crossed.
*  There should be like something at the bottom.
*  If you look at the silhouette, it looks like a knife.
*  Hey Twitter world.
*  Look at this.
*  Holiday juice or something.
*  Yeah.
*  That is crazy.
*  I wonder if he makes money.
*  He's going to sell out.
*  Well, I don't think he can spend it.
*  What do you mean?
*  He owes the Goldman's a large sum of money from a civil case.
*  They can't get the money out of his pension, you know, because he's got an NFL pension.
*  That's one of the reasons I think why he moved to Florida.
*  Like Florida has certain laws that protect you.
*  Now he's in Nevada, I think.
*  You know, there's places that have like different laws to protect you from lawsuits where your
*  pension is protected.
*  You never have to worry about being broke because of a lawsuit.
*  He's paid a serious price for all that.
*  Two people are dead, Brian.
*  I don't think it's that serious.
*  He's out there playing golf and going, hey Twitter world.
*  And he wasn't really even charged with that.
*  He was charged with kidnapping.
*  It's funny is that he's allowed to be on Twitter.
*  Whereas like think about some of the people that have been banned for Twitter for saying
*  things like a woman is never a man or a man is never a woman.
*  Like you get banned to that.
*  That's amazing to me.
*  Dead naming.
*  If you call Caitlyn Jenner, Bruce Jenner, that's dead naming Caitlyn and then you are
*  banned for life from Twitter.
*  Is that really true?
*  100%.
*  100%.
*  Where did this all come from?
*  Where was that hyper?
*  It's what we were talking about earlier with people getting mad at someone for saying
*  Merry Christmas.
*  Exactly the same thing.
*  Jack Dorsey does not want this.
*  Jack Dorsey is calling for some sort of a decentralized version of Twitter.
*  He was talking about it when he was here, like having a wild west Twitter where everything
*  goes.
*  And I think he's right.
*  Jack is a very internet minded guy.
*  Here's the thing you have to understand when you're talking about being the CEO of something
*  that is literally responsible for billions of pieces of information every single day.
*  He's managing its scale.
*  He's the CEO of a company that he's under pressure to make more profit.
*  It's not as simple as anybody would like to think.
*  It's not like he can say, hey, I think no one should ever be banned and he can just
*  go ahead and do that.
*  He doesn't have the power to do that.
*  He has the power to suggest it.
*  He has the power to give his opinion.
*  There's a lot of moving pieces.
*  A lot of moving pieces.
*  How does he make money?
*  How does Twitter make money?
*  It's a good question.
*  I don't know.
*  How do you scale that?
*  I worry very little.
*  I don't think about it.
*  I kind of like it.
*  I want it to stay around.
*  I think it's kind of interesting.
*  But I'm 100% convinced that with the implementation of AR, augmented reality, whether it's through
*  Apple or someone's going to have glasses, I think anything we're doing now is literally
*  like the MySpace of the future in terms of technological interaction.
*  I think the stuff we're doing right now is all like MySpace.
*  It's not going to be here.
*  So what do you think we're going to be doing?
*  I think we're going to be doing something with AR.
*  We're going to be interacting with each other in some sort of a weird way.
*  AR, augmented reality.
*  Glasses, like minority report type shit.
*  Yeah.
*  We're going to have glasses where you have things in front of you can access menus and
*  pull downs with you can make gestures and you could say things.
*  It'll Google things in front of your eyes.
*  You're going to be able to, you know, here's a real thing.
*  People are going to, this is something that I think was in a movie, but it's probably
*  would work that people would have a social score that you would see when you're coming
*  near them.
*  Yeah.
*  Like a cursor.
*  That's very scary.
*  Right.
*  Like, and there's like a bunch of restaurants and you could put the cursor over it and a
*  little Yelp box pops up and it says it has four stars and 400 reviews and you can get
*  like that pops up.
*  That could be you.
*  It could pop up like the kid 52 years old still fucks like a teenager and it'll say
*  thank you.
*  And people could walk by and go, Hmm, interesting.
*  On TRT.
*  He's a bit of a Peter Pan.
*  Is he?
*  Hi.
*  Well, you already had that with Uber.
*  Uber can see how you're rated by the drivers.
*  So you have a rating.
*  Oh, that's interesting.
*  In a way, it's interesting because it's making us, you can't hide behind like assholes are
*  getting exposed.
*  Like you it's making us more nicer to each other, but it's very, it's also a form of,
*  it's kind of a prison.
*  Yeah.
*  You've got to always behave.
*  Everybody's watching everything you do now.
*  Well, this is the new world and we have to adjust to this new world because in the future
*  there will be no barriers between people and information.
*  Those barriers are dissolving in front of our eyes and people are scrambling to try
*  to accept it or not accept it or fight against it or keep up.
*  But it is, but it is, it's not, you can't deny what it is.
*  It is, it is real.
*  It's happening and it's going to keep happening.
*  It's going to keep getting weirder.
*  Like we didn't see Twitter coming.
*  We didn't see the internet coming.
*  We didn't see cell phone implementation on a global scale coming.
*  Nobody ever thought you're going to carry a phone with you everywhere you go 30 years
*  ago.
*  That was never even the concept.
*  So you got 30 years, which is a blink of an eye in human history.
*  30 years later, everyone's got a goddamn phone.
*  They are literally everywhere.
*  30 years from now, it's probably going to be some next level shit.
*  Well, it'll be part of our body, which we're not going to carry a phone around.
*  But also I think it's interesting because it'll almost be like if everybody was naked
*  all the time, nudity would be no big deal.
*  Unless you have a little tiny dick.
*  Until you have a little tiny dick and that would be, and even then you'd find your niche.
*  Would you really?
*  I always say, like, even if you have a little tiny dick, a lot of lesbians get hot girls.
*  Yeah, man.
*  You just find out.
*  There are girls that don't care.
*  There are girls that don't want to deal with my nine inch piece.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Nine?
*  I know and my personality and my money.
*  If you're into that, I'm your guy.
*  Is he picked like a snake?
*  That's what the media says.
*  I'm not going to describe my piece.
*  Attack?
*  I mean, he's got lungs.
*  You can see him breathe.
*  And he's got a crook so I can fuck around corners.
*  You should get it painted like an anaconda.
*  I'd love to, man.
*  Imagine if you got your dick tattooed like an anaconda.
*  Oh, Joe Rogan experience.
*  Has anybody had their dick tattooed?
*  Of course.
*  I know people have, but has anybody had a really good one done?
*  What would I do though?
*  The American flag?
*  I don't know what I'd fucking.
*  Whenever anyone gets their dick tattooed, it's always like a fucking dragon or something
*  like that.
*  What was that joke?
*  The ears are here where my balls are, but the dragon, the tip of the nose is red.
*  You want something that says, like, that joke where it's like, when it's soft it says tiny
*  and when it's hard it says Ticonderoga in New York.
*  Yeah.
*  Yes.
*  Exactly.
*  I like that idea.
*  That's the future.
*  You know, tattoos on your face weren't around back in the day.
*  Nobody had like fucking Post Malone.
*  Post Malone in the 1970s, they'd just lock him in jail.
*  There's something wrong with this kid.
*  Fuck.
*  Why are you drawing on your face?
*  Still the dumbest, craziest shit I've ever seen in my life.
*  Yeah.
*  Always tired on his face.
*  I know.
*  Great musician though.
*  Really talented guy.
*  I don't understand that idea.
*  Hey, cut that out.
*  My point is that didn't exist in the 1960s, right?
*  What about dick tattoos?
*  Like, what if that becomes a norm?
*  What if a girl takes your pants down in the future and she's like, you don't even have
*  your dick tattooed up.
*  Well, I thought for a while.
*  First of all, I'll tell you what, it has changed.
*  I think young men manscape.
*  They shave all the hair off their...
*  Is that guy real?
*  I typed in face tattoos in 1960s.
*  I just saw it come up and this comes up.
*  Wow.
*  Well, that's crazy.
*  He's got like birds on his forehead and a Jesus on his forehead.
*  Is that real though?
*  Probably.
*  I mean, for sure somebody did it.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's never been as common as it is now, particularly for show business.
*  Imagine if like Fred Astaire had face tattoos.
*  That girl's...
*  What's she got on her cheek there, man?
*  Harry Styles.
*  No.
*  That's not real though.
*  She doesn't.
*  It's not real.
*  How do you know?
*  It's a viral story a couple months ago.
*  Oh, it is fake?
*  Oh, it's a drawing?
*  Even though if it's a drawing, who cares?
*  It's still crazy.
*  She let a guy draw on her face.
*  Honey, that's your cheek.
*  Don't tolerate that kind of shit in your life.
*  Well, there's a lot of people getting face tattooed.
*  Well, when the game was posting pictures of this huge dick in underwear, you ever see
*  that?
*  We talked about another dude, giant dick in underwear.
*  They had to like take it out of cats apparently in some way.
*  His hog?
*  Yeah.
*  Because it's that big?
*  I guess.
*  Congratulations.
*  Oh bro, he's got it.
*  We'll take a look at this.
*  It's not the game.
*  We're talking about somebody else.
*  Oh.
*  The guy in cats that was on Instagram.
*  He had a piece on him.
*  He put it down because they're like, this is too sensitive.
*  Because he's just got a giant hog in his underwear and black underwear by the, there it is right
*  there.
*  Look at that piece.
*  That's a dick.
*  Hold on.
*  Here's the thing.
*  Congratulations.
*  That dude was playing with himself before that.
*  Probably.
*  100%.
*  Come on, man.
*  I'm not hating it.
*  Listen, man, put in work.
*  Put in work.
*  But the game has a giant dick as well.
*  Have you seen the video?
*  Have you seen the picture you posted?
*  No, I try to avoid pictures of dudes, dicks.
*  I know that's your favorite thing to look at.
*  No, that's not.
*  That's fake news.
*  It's like what you go to all the time.
*  Fake fucking news, dude.
*  I thought that's your go to thing.
*  All right.
*  That's your opinion.
*  There you go.
*  Whoa.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  That's outrageous.
*  He does it a lot.
*  I thought men are going to start doing this now.
*  Jesus.
*  How many pictures of his hog does he have?
*  I don't know, but it said something hilarious.
*  He goes, Jesus Christ.
*  Is that real?
*  Yeah.
*  That would be real.
*  Well, listen, if I had a dick that big, I'd let everybody know too.
*  He's grabbing his dick.
*  Well, that dick is pretty preposterous.
*  Yeah.
*  That's preposterous.
*  Yeah.
*  So there you go.
*  That's his dick.
*  What in the hell?
*  Hashtags for it and shit too.
*  Yeah.
*  Crazy.
*  It was really funny though.
*  He said something about Halloween.
*  Don't just be afraid of this dick.
*  Don't worry about ghosts.
*  Some shit, be afraid of this dick.
*  Is that what it says?
*  Yes.
*  I feel like we might have read it.
*  Yes.
*  We have.
*  Get dick and chill.
*  Now I remember.
*  That's right.
*  I remember.
*  Either way, congratulations to him.
*  That was true, but that one almost doesn't even look real.
*  Oh, that would be real.
*  But that's like a 15 inch dick.
*  He's 6'4 too, yeah.
*  Right.
*  But how big is that dick?
*  Big enough.
*  But that's about 15 inches, right?
*  And thick around like a baby's arm.
*  That's like a-
*  Time to break the internet again.
*  That's a two year old's arm.
*  Does he pay your bills?
*  Hashtag it ain't tricking.
*  Hashtag real ninja shit.
*  Does he take care of your kids?
*  Does he lick it from the front to the back?
*  Does he slit under that pussy like Mecca Nick and tuned it up with his tongue?
*  Run her baths until the water is warm as a Miami morning in the spring?
*  Okay.
*  Four women.
*  He's high.
*  Now handling your business.
*  He's high with a giant dick.
*  He's hilarious.
*  Fucking funny to me.
*  I got to get his phone number and hang out with him.
*  Hey, let me buy you a drink, dicks.
*  He'll probably show you his dick too.
*  No.
*  Just to make you feel bad.
*  Hey, Brian.
*  Before you go.
*  That's okay.
*  These guys there are dudes like the problem with giant dudes do Jitsu and stuff or it's
*  like they could fuck you.
*  That's a good job.
*  Could Brendan beat me up?
*  And then what if they're fucking you with a dick that's tattooed like an Anaconda?
*  That's what I'm getting at.
*  Does anybody have that?
*  Let's take a look.
*  Surely there's got to be a guy who's tattooed his dick like Anaconda.
*  Of course.
*  100%.
*  But I'm shocked that I haven't seen this.
*  I'm outraged.
*  This seems like something that I would have heard long time.
*  If I can think of it in 2019, surely it's been done hundreds and hundreds of times.
*  Yes.
*  There's no way, right?
*  There's a Vice article about everything you want to know about penis tattoos and it talks
*  about a guy's 14 stripes to make it look like a snake.
*  That's cool.
*  Let me see.
*  It doesn't have a picture on the article.
*  This is how it goes to see dicks.
*  Let me see it.
*  Let me just see it.
*  I don't care really about dicks, but I just want to make sure this is true and you're
*  not lying.
*  I will bring up this and hit images.
*  Hit it.
*  Bam.
*  Those are just tattoos of dicks.
*  Here's the problem.
*  Oh, that's the dragon, the far right.
*  Look at that one.
*  Here's the problem.
*  See that far right dragon?
*  Yes.
*  That I've seen before.
*  This is people negotiating the problem of individuality with accoutrement.
*  Is that what it is?
*  Yes.
*  Or they just like dragons.
*  It's just like...
*  And they wish their dick was a dragon.
*  That's possible too.
*  That's a girl, bro.
*  You don't even know the difference between a boy and a girl.
*  What the fuck?
*  What's that one in the middle?
*  What's that one in the middle there?
*  On the right hand side in the middle?
*  That, right there.
*  Bang.
*  That's an issue, huh?
*  Plus, he's got a bolt.
*  That's the same guy, man.
*  God damn.
*  He just got more work done on the thighs.
*  Right in the fucking head, huh?
*  You just nailed your dick down.
*  Why does he have a bolt through the head of his dick?
*  What the fuck is going on?
*  What is that guy doing there?
*  He's rolling his dick like dough.
*  Yeah, he's got his dick in a rolling pin.
*  That's how they tattoo it?
*  Oh, just stop.
*  I'm done.
*  Oh, that's how they do it.
*  They have to flatten it out with a rolling pin.
*  What the fuck, man?
*  I'll do it for attention.
*  What should I get on my dick?
*  If you had to get a tattoo on your dick, you have 10 seconds.
*  10, 9, 10.
*  That's very good.
*  How about girls that go down there and go, what the fuck?
*  Hello, Kitty.
*  Imagine, hey, honey, I got a new thing.
*  Yep.
*  Pull your dick out.
*  Your wife sees Hello Kitty on your cock.
*  Like, what?
*  What?
*  That's funny.
*  Would you get like a little star under your cheek?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I would.
*  I would.
*  I would.
*  I would.
*  I would.
*  I would.
*  I would.
*  I would.
*  I would.
*  Uh, yeah.
*  A little tiny one?
*  A little tiny star?
*  I want a teardrop.
*  I got to kill somebody.
*  You got to kill somebody to get a teardrop, though.
*  A star, you just have to be cool.
*  A little star?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Just like, you know, you think different.
*  A 52?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Why not?
*  God damn.
*  Just to change things up?
*  Well, Stallone, I think, got sleeved.
*  He got half-sleeved when he was in his 60s.
*  Sure did.
*  Sure did.
*  Yeah.
*  Just decided to fuck it.
*  He's Mike Canary in the coal mine.
*  Like it?
*  That's Mike Canary in the coal mine.
*  You just can't steal him.
*  No.
*  You can't steal him.
*  Yeah, he got a full shoulders, chest, all that shit done.
*  Look at that.
*  All the way down my back.
*  That's impressive.
*  Jacked.
*  See, get a picture of him.
*  That's it.
*  That's from that movie.
*  That picture, go back, go back.
*  The one you just had.
*  Oh, did it do that to you?
*  That one.
*  That's when he was doing that movie.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Bullet in the head.
*  Yeah, he got super lean, man.
*  Yeah, man.
*  He got down to like 100.
*  It looks like he's like 170 pounds or something like that.
*  Yeah, he's a disciplined dude.
*  Yeah, ridiculously disciplined.
*  That takes crazy.
*  And 150 years old and still doing action movies.
*  Still fucking people up.
*  And you're like, oh, I'm buying it.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm buying it.
*  And the Expendables is throwing people against the walls like, I'm buying it.
*  Yep.
*  He's got big hands, big balls.
*  He's a big guy.
*  He's got Joe Rogan hands.
*  You have thick.
*  He's Italian.
*  Just like me.
*  Why is your last name Rogan though?
*  You have just a little Irish name.
*  Because my grandfather on my father's side is half Irish.
*  Well, he was Irish.
*  My father's half Irish.
*  So his, my father's mom was a full Italian and his dad was full Irish.
*  So you're a quarter Irish.
*  I'm half Irish, half Italian.
*  Exactly.
*  He's getting his back done here.
*  Look at this.
*  Look at his shape that motherfucker's in.
*  He's in great shape.
*  Plus, he might be holding his stomach in right there for the picture.
*  But the guy behind him that's tattooing him, does he got some?
*  That's Mickey Rourke.
*  Oh, that's that movie.
*  Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man.
*  Is that what that is?
*  No, that's an old movie.
*  What movie is this from?
*  This is some new movie.
*  Oh, is it another movie?
*  Could be Expendables scene or something.
*  Mickey Rourke is an eccentric character.
*  I think it is.
*  He's the kind of guy that would come over your house with like a full Indian jacket on
*  with like the tassels.
*  He's my favorite actor of all time.
*  Like buckskin.
*  And like he would have buckskin pants on and like legit cowboy boots and he couldn't say
*  nothing.
*  Nothing.
*  And a big turquoise belt buckle and no shirt.
*  Yeah.
*  No shirt.
*  When he was younger, my favorite actor of all time.
*  I fucking loved him.
*  What are those ties called?
*  Is this just a string?
*  Yeah, the Western tie.
*  Yeah, you know, I'm talking about what is that fucking thing?
*  Yeah.
*  That's a fake tie.
*  That's what that is.
*  That's whatever he wants.
*  And a tie and carry around two small dogs in his hands.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And maybe a gun.
*  Maybe a gun.
*  Maybe a bow around his neck.
*  Whatever the fuck he wants.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe walks through your house with a knife in his teeth.
*  Yeah.
*  You're like, what's going on with Mickey?
*  Just Mickey.
*  Leave him.
*  It's just Mickey.
*  Leave him alone.
*  Just leave him.
*  As regular Mickey.
*  Yeah.
*  The world of actors, my friend, they are out there.
*  He was abused by his stepdad really badly.
*  Yeah.
*  He did a great interview with Alec Baldwin on Baldwin's podcast called Here's the Thing.
*  It was very heartbreaking.
*  Very heartbreaking.
*  He was abused by his, his stepfather was a cop and a brutal son of a bitch and really
*  abused those two boys.
*  His brother, Mickey's brother died in his arms.
*  Oh.
*  A drug addict because of his father.
*  He blamed his father, his stepfather.
*  Then he saw his father he'd never seen.
*  He's so heartbreaking until the story and he saw his father in New York.
*  Father's coming out of a bar.
*  His father goes and then Mickey was standing there and he goes, I'm your son.
*  His father goes, I thought I'd run into you one day.
*  And then his father died a week later of alcoholism.
*  See, we don't pick.
*  So you ran into him as a grown man.
*  Yeah.
*  He tells you everything about someone, you know, your heart's broken at a young age.
*  Well, almost everyone that's fucked up in this life is fucked up because of something
*  someone did to them, whether it's a relative or abuse that they suffered or, you know,
*  things throughout their life that have gone horribly wrong, especially for children.
*  The big one, I mean, that's the most formative time of your life, right?
*  When you meet people that were abused as children, everyone like universally feels for them.
*  You're like, Oh no.
*  When you have children, especially, oh, for sure.
*  You realize what a catastrophe and an impossible thing to deal with.
*  That's so terrible.
*  To me, it's the special evil, you know, it is abusing children.
*  I mean, you're ruining not just a moment, but the full potential of a child's life.
*  They're never going to escape the fact that that was done to them, that someone used them.
*  This child psychologist, she was talking to her and I said, give me some advice with my
*  children.
*  You know, she said to me, she goes, just don't leave.
*  Just be in their life.
*  That's big.
*  And I was like, that's true, right?
*  Because when your dad's not there, your mom's not there, someone's not there, this is like
*  the feeling of like displacement.
*  Everything's wrong.
*  The world's and then on top of that, these kids get abused.
*  It's like, Oh my God, you've you've compounded horror on top of of sadness and loneliness.
*  Horror on top of it.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's also, this is the really fucked up things.
*  It repeats itself.
*  They say that people that are molested when they're children are much more likely to molest
*  children, which is like insane.
*  It's like the thing that happened to you, the abuse that happened to you.
*  It's almost like you want to put it on someone else.
*  The fact that so many kids grew up in single parent households in this country is the problem.
*  That's the problem.
*  That's a giant problem.
*  You can talk about racism, you talk about everything else.
*  You grew up without a father, you grew up in a single parent household.
*  That's abuse.
*  That is one problem.
*  Men who have children and walk out on those kids, those are the people I have no time
*  for.
*  I hate them.
*  I don't give a fuck what your excuse is.
*  If you have to, I would make it a law.
*  Like you'd be, I would make it very uncomfortable for you.
*  But that's just one kind of abuse.
*  There's also abuse by your actual biological parents.
*  There's abuse by other biological relatives.
*  There's people that have abuse by stepfathers.
*  That's a very dangerous situation.
*  Yeah, abuse by brothers and sisters.
*  There's abuse by neighbors.
*  There's abuse, man.
*  But it all boils down to the same thing.
*  It's like what happens during your developmental period when you're a really young person to
*  becoming an adult.
*  If someone's abusing you and fucking you over, that just ruins most people's lives.
*  Most people don't bounce back from that.
*  Then you get caught up in this spiral of this cycle of crime and violence and prison and
*  abuse and you're done.
*  You're done.
*  I wonder how long it's going to take before the human race eradicates that.
*  Because I think if you look at like Pinker's work and some other people that just studied
*  violence and abuse and all of the various things that we love least about civilization,
*  those markers are going down sort of across the board, whether it's violent crime or rape.
*  Those markers are slowly going down.
*  Like how long does it take before there's none of that?
*  Part of it's, they say what crippled the mafia was just the fact there are cameras everywhere.
*  You can't just drop bodies all the time because you don't know.
*  Everybody's got a fucking ring.
*  The cops just go, can we take a look at your ring footage?
*  You got to make a getaway somewhere.
*  You're always on camera.
*  You're always on camera.
*  They can do this.
*  They can just follow the dots.
*  Well Snowden just posted something that I retweeted it.
*  See if you can find that Jamie, about China and the citizens are sort of revolting against
*  this constant surveillance state that's overtaken China.
*  And you're saying over the next 10 years is what's going to be America.
*  Absent sweeping reform.
*  This is the whole world in 10 years.
*  Remember both parties in the US defend mass surveillance programs.
*  China's advantage here is not technological, but that there's no strong civil opposition
*  to slow the descent into nightmare.
*  So China is not, I'm sorry, I read it wrong.
*  China is not able to slow it.
*  They're just slowly descending into the surveillance state.
*  This is the biggest one of the biggest.
*  Click on that.
*  That's why not trusting your fucking leaders is very important.
*  We were lied to in Afghanistan for 18 years by senior US officials.
*  The authorities can scan your phone, track your face and find out when you leave your home.
*  One of the world's biggest spying networks is aimed at regular people and no one can stop it.
*  And this is in China.
*  Yeah, all in the name of security.
*  There's never been a regime, a government that didn't use that as an excuse.
*  You take, so the Nazis take, Hitler when he became chancellor took away all civil liberties
*  because in the name of protecting the fatherland from essentially terrorism because a communist
*  lit the Reichstag on fire.
*  Well, what's interesting is how long is it going to take before some version of this
*  makes it over here?
*  Because it seems inevitable.
*  It's coming, but you have to fight it tooth and fucking nail.
*  Americans should always be distrustful of their authority figures.
*  I don't give a fuck how much you like Trump or anybody else.
*  You should hold your leaders accountable and you should not.
*  You should always have a healthy distrust.
*  Well, we were lied to for 18 years about how the war was going in Afghanistan.
*  We spent over a trillion dollars on that fucking war over the past.
*  How long has it been since 2003?
*  Good.
*  And we were trying to turn into a modern nation.
*  Senior US officials, whether intelligence, military, and everybody else, they knew this
*  was an unwinnable war.
*  I know too many people who spent 10 years over there.
*  They all knew it too.
*  And somehow that just never made it out.
*  And every general kept saying, we're at a turning point in the war where we're going
*  to defeat the Taliban.
*  No, you weren't.
*  And you know the difference.
*  And you knew that at the time.
*  And I understand that there's a lot of pressure and everything else, but we spent all that
*  money for fucking what?
*  And a lot of Americans got injured and fucking killed for it.
*  And we were lied to.
*  What's interesting about what you're saying, this is the argument for something like this
*  in the first place.
*  If you had this, if you had mass surveillance everywhere, people wouldn't be able to plan
*  terrorist attacks.
*  Oh, fuck that.
*  We always use that as an excuse.
*  I know, but that's how they would implement something like that.
*  And if they could get something like that implemented in Afghanistan and put a giant
*  kibosh on the amount of terrorist activities.
*  Yeah, right.
*  Good luck.
*  I know.
*  I would say good luck too.
*  Study history to see how that turns out.
*  That's why I study history.
*  See, the thing is this kind of tools never existed.
*  Like you could study history all day long.
*  But governments use it.
*  But it's only going to prepare you sort of peripherally.
*  It's not really going to prepare you for what technology can do today.
*  There's nothing in history that can really tell you where this goes.
*  I agree with you, but politicians use the same exact language they've been using forever,
*  which is we have to protect the public from these insurgents, this danger.
*  Here's the solution to that.
*  Get the fuck out of here.
*  Here's the solution to that.
*  Eventually, there's no more government.
*  Here's the solution to that.
*  What this is doing, it's making it almost impossible to have a traditional government.
*  Because if this stuff starts making it into their, then we can find out what they're doing all the
*  time.
*  So what if it turns out, well, we'll let you mass surveillance on them.
*  We want 24-7 access to anyone who is any sort of representative, anyone who's a congressman,
*  anyone who's a senator, anyone who's a president.
*  We want 24-7 access to everything you say and do.
*  We want to know.
*  We want to know who you are.
*  No more backs.
*  My problem with that is that then you wouldn't have the best people getting in the government.
*  You don't have the best people now.
*  That's true.
*  But it's gone.
*  It's over.
*  You're already dealing with that as a politician and stuff.
*  I don't know if that's the answer.
*  I'm not saying it's the answer, Brian Cowen.
*  I'm just saying, imagine.
*  Oh, I see what you're saying.
*  I'm not saying it's a good idea.
*  It's a terrible idea.
*  But imagine if this is what the world becomes.
*  Everyone has access to everyone's life.
*  See, the way I believe it is, if you want to learn about somebody as a government agency,
*  you got major firewalls and you need warrants and make it fucking difficult.
*  Right.
*  But the reason why a country like the United States goes to war with a country like Afghanistan
*  or ISIS is because you have leaders and groups.
*  Once there's no leaders and once there's no groups and everybody can see everything that
*  everybody's doing, then you have no more need for government.
*  But all societies are predicated.
*  You have medicated resources.
*  No, but you also have to have somebody in a society has to have the monopoly on violence.
*  Well, or all the resources get distributed evenly.
*  All natural resources on earth are owned by the human beings that inhabit the earth,
*  not the human beings that live on that one particular spot.
*  So all the Saudi trillionaires and all those dudes are making fracking money.
*  That's our money, bitch.
*  It's our earth.
*  You're stealing the fucking essence of the earth and selling it back to the people.
*  How dare you?
*  Karl Marx right here, man.
*  No, I'm just saying.
*  This is the problem, Jamie.
*  Imagine.
*  Bring me to this podcast.
*  But all the other things you could sell, you could sell cars, you could sell this,
*  you could sell that, make buildings.
*  I'm not stopping capitalism, but I'm saying there's all natural resources.
*  All of them belong to the conquerors of the earth, which is us, the human beings.
*  Dude, you just solved a lot of problems right now.
*  All of it.
*  So no trillionaire oil barons, no dependence on fossil fuels because, yeah, fossil fuels
*  are great, but if no one in particular is profiting entirely off fossil fuels because
*  the money has to be distributed evenly to everyone.
*  The same with solar, same with anything, anything that's a resource, any natural resources.
*  Yeah.
*  But you need-
*  Minerals?
*  You need the technology to harness that stuff.
*  You can sell that.
*  Yeah.
*  You can sell that, but what you can't sell is oil.
*  Well, we-
*  Fuck you.
*  Oil sold on the open market.
*  Not anymore.
*  Not when I'm president.
*  What the fuck, dude?
*  Yes.
*  So oil's everybody's.
*  Are you going to run?
*  We're stealing it.
*  We're stealing it.
*  We're going to, we'll nuke the world.
*  If they don't give us the oil, just listen, let's start fresh with amoebas.
*  This is not going well.
*  Let me be your vice president.
*  You run.
*  I like it.
*  You run.
*  Okay.
*  And then what's our platform?
*  What's our slogan?
*  How do we fix the tuna in the sea?
*  What's our slogan?
*  How do we grow more tuna?
*  Lead-free tuna, you fucks.
*  Yeah.
*  No more, no more dinner theater.
*  Everybody that works in dinner theater now makes tuna.
*  You work in a tuna plant where you make tunas fuck each other.
*  So we have more tuna because we're running out of tuna.
*  You force a breeding program?
*  Yes, yes, yes.
*  And you're going to have to filter the ocean.
*  You're a terrible president.
*  No, a great president.
*  We fucked up the ocean.
*  There's all this heavy metals and poison in there.
*  We need a filter for the ocean, sort of like the filter that you have at your house.
*  Yeah.
*  The filters of tap water.
*  Yeah.
*  Right?
*  Yeah.
*  We need one of those for the ocean.
*  Jesus.
*  Problem solved.
*  It's going to be expensive as shit, dude.
*  Not really.
*  All right.
*  Not when you get rid of music, dinner theater, all musicals.
*  Oh, you use the money.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I got you.
*  And make those people go to work in a real job.
*  Damn.
*  Yeah.
*  All those people that think that musicals are what people want to see.
*  Fuck you.
*  Really?
*  Fuck you.
*  Go, go make tuna.
*  But I like music.
*  Oh, you son of a bitch.
*  Remember that time we got really, really, really, really, really high and we went to
*  see one of your professors, one of your acting professors.
*  The greatest.
*  Sing musicals.
*  Yes, I do.
*  That was a wonderful night.
*  It was a, I love that kind of stuff.
*  We were so high I couldn't walk fast.
*  No, me neither.
*  I had to be real, I knew I knew how to walk, but I wasn't totally sure I could keep doing it.
*  I never smoke weed, but when I do with you, it's like I got high one time.
*  I was with Patty Jenkins.
*  We were in fucking Atlantic City and we'd been swimming and I smoked weed and I was
*  not a weed smoker.
*  You swam in the water?
*  The ocean of Atlantic City?
*  Yeah, fuck yeah, at night.
*  Dude, you're dangerous.
*  Huge waves.
*  I lost my, we lost the car keys and we're looking everywhere, dude, everywhere.
*  And two hours later I sit down on the curb, I'm just tired, it's just too much.
*  Patty looks at me and she goes, Brian?
*  Yeah, she goes, open your hand please.
*  Really?
*  It's in your hand?
*  Of course it was.
*  I've had my sunglasses on top of my hat and looked for them for 10 minutes before.
*  I was looking for my phone the other day.
*  I'm like, I'm with my son and I'm looking for my phone and I'm like, where the fuck is my
*  phone?
*  Where the fuck is it?
*  He's next to me on my phone playing a game.
*  Right next to me.
*  And it didn't dawn.
*  Snatch your phone up.
*  Yeah.
*  Those kids love those goddamn phone games.
*  No, I'm the one who downloaded the game for him.
*  Oh, you forgot?
*  Yeah.
*  You're getting old.
*  Yeah.
*  You need that TRT to read.
*  He was playing a sniper game and I said, you're not allowed to play that shit at all.
*  And then I saw how cool it was and I ended up playing it.
*  Whoa.
*  Do you try to keep him from violent games?
*  I do, but it's like telling a tree not to blow in the wind.
*  It's interesting, Dakota Meyer, who's a decorated veteran and-
*  Oh, Medal of Honor winner, right?
*  Yes.
*  One of the very few to ever win it while alive.
*  Yeah.
*  He thinks that violent video games desensitize people.
*  Now when someone like that, who's open with the struggles with PTSD, he killed a man with a rock.
*  Tell me the story about he was in a fist fight with a guy in war with the enemy and
*  picked up a rock and beat his brains in.
*  Jesus.
*  If this guy is telling you that video games can desensitize you, I'm going to listen.
*  Yeah, I am too.
*  I'm going to listen to him.
*  I am too.
*  He understands.
*  I can believe that.
*  Yeah.
*  You certainly get very good at these kids who have the guns.
*  But it also, for some people that don't have any tendency towards violence like you or me
*  or Jamie or anybody else that we know that's fine and healthy, they're not going to make
*  you more likely to go shoot people.
*  And that's a fact.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the thing.
*  It's like, are you saying that you playing Red Dead Redemption is going to make you want
*  to go out and fucking shoot people?
*  No, it's not going to.
*  It's not going to have any effect on you at all.
*  But will it have an effect on minors?
*  I think there are a couple of things going on.
*  One is I think they're addictive.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I've seen that with my own eyes with my children.
*  They're addictive.
*  And when you take the game away, they exhibit withdrawal.
*  They freak the fuck out.
*  You're mad.
*  Come on, dad.
*  Yeah.
*  One more game.
*  Yeah.
*  Jesus, dad.
*  They get crazy.
*  They stomp the ground.
*  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
*  I know.
*  And then also, I think when you play video games, you can get so addicted that you will
*  isolate and you'll play those games all day.
*  Oh, there's a lot of kids doing that.
*  Yeah.
*  What's that do to your social interaction?
*  What's that do to your body?
*  Should you be doing a sport?
*  What's that do to you later on?
*  Can you get a girl when you've been sitting in front of it?
*  There are lots of things that we don't know.
*  I mean, do they lend?
*  Do video games, when you play them on that level, do they retard your social skills and
*  your, you know, I mean, there's a lot of considerations.
*  I don't think-
*  Well, I'm also in favor of you doing anything you want.
*  If there's certain people that would make the same argument about someone
*  who's addicted to reading.
*  Sure.
*  There's a lot of people that are in their head just reading novels.
*  And they were.
*  Yeah.
*  But those arguments were used against before video games.
*  You just don't hear it anymore because you just hear the more accelerated version.
*  What it is, is basically an engaging human creation.
*  An engaging human creation that's designed to captivate your attention,
*  whether it's a novel or a film or anything.
*  Things are designed, that's what art is in a lot of ways.
*  You go to an art gallery and you stare at someone's work, it's like some human creation
*  that captivates your attention and gets you locked in.
*  And we see a really beautiful piece, like we were in Italy and we were in Florence and we
*  went to this ancient church and they had these beautiful works of art on the wall.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's fascinating, fascinating stuff.
*  And you try to picture like the people that painted this a thousand years ago and what
*  life was like and you're looking at the intricacies of these dresses.
*  That's an engaging human creation that captivates your attention.
*  We have merit in that kind of engaging, captivated piece of art.
*  We have put merit in that, but we don't put merit in video games for some reason.
*  It's almost like it's too engaging.
*  It's too much.
*  It's too captivating.
*  That's an interesting question.
*  Why not?
*  Because we know it's detrimental.
*  We inherently know that you're going to waste giant chunks of your life.
*  Unless you're someone who got a trust fund, you never have to work again.
*  You got fucking $10 million in the bank and you can just chill forever and you want to
*  play video games all day.
*  I'm like, all right, like if you, I mean, I don't know what to tell you.
*  You don't have to work.
*  Yeah, but what is it something like Picasso's Warenka or you know that painting of when
*  Spain was bombed by the Luftwaffe before World War II and to bring that up because it's kind
*  of a haunting painting, but why is that still something that's considered a masterpiece?
*  And then, like you said, there's like these incredible images, there's incredible imagery
*  and what we can do with an iPad.
*  Well, it's all the same thing in some way.
*  It's a human creation.
*  But the thing about these digital human creations is they have this alien, like cold feel to them.
*  Like there's something about digital things, even if they're spectacular, like there's no
*  emotion in this thing.
*  This thing is a creation.
*  It's a one and a zero.
*  It's computer-
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Whereas like if you're just reading novels all day, like if you're that person that just,
*  fuck the world, I'm going to go in my house, I'm going to shut the door, I'm going to light
*  a candle, I'm going to sit there and I'm going to read novels all day.
*  I have $10 million in the bank that I got from my trust fund.
*  I just like reading.
*  No one would say you're a loser.
*  Like what does Brian do?
*  He's amazing.
*  You know, he got his trust fund and then said, I want to educate myself.
*  I just want to read.
*  And he just reads all the great works.
*  And he sits at home all day and just reads.
*  It's amazing.
*  But that is somehow more intriguing because what you're doing is developing and expanding
*  your understanding.
*  And I think when you do that, what that means is you're someone who is worth speaking to.
*  You might have some secrets and some understanding that I can use.
*  So when you talk to somebody who's really gone down that rabbit hole, like Joseph Campbell,
*  who read all the philosophers and everybody who influenced them, you want to hear what
*  he has to say because he's organized his brain and his thoughts in a way that might shed some
*  light on the things that are confusing to you that are depressing or that are scaring you or
*  whatever.
*  And you do need leaders like that, leaders of thought that can put things into perspective,
*  that can kind of tell you why there's a difference between, say, Picasso and this other
*  shitty artist.
*  I don't know.
*  No, yeah, for sure.
*  For sure.
*  But you also need people that know how to play the fuck out of a video game.
*  The thing is those people don't get any credit.
*  When you see these kids today that are winning these video game tournaments and winning a
*  million dollars and their parents are told them to not play games.
*  Meanwhile, the dad works at fucking IHOP like, hey, asshole, these guys are making real money
*  playing this stupid game that you told them to never play.
*  And they're filling arenas.
*  Arenas.
*  It's fucking crazy.
*  This is where the world goes.
*  The world goes to the most engaging creation that human beings have that locks in other
*  people's attention.
*  And the most engaging creations for young people are these goddamn video games.
*  They're just group efforts.
*  They're giant group corporate efforts, whether it's Grand Theft Auto
*  or the new Doom.
*  When's that new Doom coming out?
*  Like three months?
*  But I feel like Doom.
*  I do think there's a difference.
*  I do think that when you're really good at a video game, there is an addictive quality to it.
*  Yes, you're really good at doing this thing, right?
*  But at the end of the day, it's a game.
*  And that game is somewhat masturbatory.
*  That game, I don't know that when you really get good at Fortnite or Doom, I don't know if
*  that game in any way expands your understanding or your ability to contribute to the larger
*  conversation.
*  Okay, but I'm just saying.
*  Does snooker?
*  So is that the strategy game?
*  No.
*  How dare you?
*  What is it?
*  What?
*  Not chess.
*  Chess is a good one.
*  But well, there's a reason why I said snooker.
*  The reason why I said snooker is because you're executing.
*  You're actually doing, you have to do, you have to keep it together
*  and you have to physically execute a move.
*  It's a giant pool table that they play in England and they play with red balls and blue balls and
*  pink balls and black balls.
*  And I don't understand the game.
*  I've watched it a bunch.
*  But there's these people that play it and it's less popular now.
*  One of the guys, one of the big time guys got busted.
*  He got busted doing a fixed game.
*  Like someone paid him off to lose and he agreed to do it for a certain amount of money.
*  But the thing is that a game like that is well respected because someone has to execute.
*  It's not just thinking.
*  You have to actually pull off the shot.
*  Yes.
*  It's a skill.
*  And also people love to watch it who play snooker.
*  Probably not me, but people know the difference, right?
*  A video game you have to execute as well, but it doesn't seem like you're doing it because
*  you're not physically, you're just moving your hands around and moving a keyboard.
*  It doesn't seem like it's as skillful, but it is.
*  Yeah, that's a really interesting question.
*  I don't know.
*  You're asking a really interesting question, right?
*  Because what they are doing is they're providing entertainment for people,
*  just like a great pool player, right?
*  So when you watch pool, you're doing it for stakes, you're doing it for money,
*  but you're also watching these people who have mastered this insane geometry.
*  Well, we respect some versions of that, like golf.
*  Yeah.
*  We respect golf.
*  Yeah.
*  Because we play it.
*  And also the money that's available.
*  That's why we don't respect bowling.
*  Someone's a good bowler, you're like, congratulations, you pat him on the head.
*  Good for you.
*  Good for you.
*  Nobody cares, but if you're fucking one of the best golf players of all time,
*  that golfer is going to make millions and millions of dollars a year.
*  That guy is a baller.
*  He's a golfer and he's at the top of the food chain when it comes to...
*  Any of those skills require you to master yourself in many ways.
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Sure.
*  But the thing is that the video games, it seems like it's happening in a digital realm.
*  And because of that, it's not taken as seriously.
*  Even if you found out they made more money.
*  Like when you find out someone's a successful video game player,
*  there's a certain part of you that's like, oh, why are you wasting your time with that?
*  Even if you go, he makes $5 million a year, you're like, oh, well, huh, good for him.
*  Yeah.
*  Huh, seems weird.
*  Yes.
*  Right?
*  There's like a weird...
*  Yes.
*  You don't...
*  It's still not good.
*  Even though the...
*  You know what it is for us who are older?
*  It's subversive.
*  Yes.
*  For guys that are our age, it's subversive.
*  It's...
*  We don't trust it.
*  We don't like it.
*  We don't understand it.
*  And it scares us a little bit because it also reminds us of our own mortality.
*  We're also brainwashed to think the video games are for losers.
*  All of that.
*  So we have a stereotypical idea of what a video game player is.
*  All that stuff.
*  So for older people, I feel left out.
*  I don't understand it.
*  And I feel like they're being bad and they should listen to me.
*  Whereas chess is noble.
*  Well, chess is...
*  Someone playing chess that's noble.
*  Special, special.
*  Yeah, you find out someone who's really good at chess, you're like, fuck, that guy's impressive.
*  They can think deeply and strategically.
*  If a girl could beat your ass at chess, I dated a girl once, she was really good at chess.
*  It was humiliating.
*  Shut me down.
*  Well, jiu-jitsu is a form of kinetic chess, probably.
*  Sort of.
*  You can make that argument.
*  Force, there's mass.
*  There's all that, but there's also leverage, there's also understanding when to use your energy,
*  when not to, when to be relaxed, when to be strong.
*  It's more complicated than chess.
*  Probably.
*  I don't know.
*  I think it's more complicated.
*  I'm not good at either one.
*  But there is an understanding of the moves and then when someone's countering,
*  and the understanding of the counter and then the counter to the counter,
*  and this constant thing.
*  That's like Hicks and Gracie, one of the things he always used to say about people is they can't
*  keep the rhythm.
*  He'd be like, he would put a rhythm on people.
*  Attack and you counter, attack and you counter, attack and you counter,
*  but I know what your counter is, so I'm prepared for your counter.
*  He's been there before.
*  And he does it so often that he keeps this rhythm up until you don't know what,
*  you can't just explode all the time.
*  You don't know the moves.
*  It was that boxer who was fighting Duran, you hear him in the corner,
*  I can't remember what the fight was.
*  He goes, he's reading my mind.
*  He's reading my fucking mind.
*  Well, Duran knew the pattern so well that he was like, I know what he's doing here.
*  I know what he's going to do.
*  So he would cut him off and he'd be like, the guy's fucking catching me every time
*  I try to work on our game plan.
*  That's what boxing is, right?
*  Boxing is like understanding the patterns of someone throwing a left or a right,
*  moving their head side to side, moving forward, moving back, moving side to side.
*  You get these patterns.
*  These are the only things you can do.
*  You can only move back and forth side to side, or you can move left to right,
*  or you can throw with your left hand, or you can throw with your right hand,
*  all the variables with different kinds of punches you can throw.
*  But you get a guy like Terrence Crawford in front of you.
*  He's seen all those.
*  And so he starts setting you up to see like, what are you doing?
*  Where are you doing?
*  Where am I going to?
*  There's a beautiful combination to use to knock out that cat the other night.
*  He fought some very rugged dude.
*  Who's the guy Crawford fought this weekend?
*  I want to see him fight Earl Spence.
*  I always saw the highlights of it because it was, I guess it was on ESPN.
*  Here it is.
*  I want to see him fight Earl Spence so badly.
*  Oh yeah, it'd be phenomenal.
*  That's the fight.
*  But the end of the fight, man, he just did some beautiful creative shit.
*  He's amazing, man.
*  He really is amazing.
*  Took some shots.
*  Oh dude, for real, the guy's very good, man.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Now watch that he dropped him there.
*  Now watch the final combination.
*  Look at this.
*  Watch this step back.
*  Look at this step back.
*  Bing.
*  How beautiful is that?
*  That step back and then that uppercut.
*  That's like recognizing patterns.
*  Yeah.
*  Then he stepped in and hooked him in the head.
*  He changes shit up too all the time.
*  He's brilliant.
*  Brilliant.
*  There's guys that hit this level, right?
*  When you watch boxing or any combat sport, really,
*  there's this guy that hit this level and you're like,
*  oh, they're in that fucking super champion zone.
*  Yes.
*  And that's where Crawford is.
*  That's why he needs to fight Earl Spence.
*  Yes.
*  That's where Lomachenko is.
*  How is Earl Spence alive and not injured?
*  I don't know, because he's Superman.
*  That video of him flipping that Ferrari and watching it fly over him and he doesn't get crushed.
*  No.
*  What are the odds that he makes it out of there without a scratch?
*  Thank God, because that aficionado, that work of art needs to be preserved.
*  You sound gay as fuck right there.
*  I don't care.
*  It's fine.
*  A little gay for him.
*  I'm all about people that are gay as fuck.
*  A little gay, man.
*  But you did sound...
*  Yeah, he's a beast, man.
*  The way he shut down Mikey Garcia, I was like, woo.
*  God.
*  He hits too hard.
*  But hey, I'll tell you what, Sean Porter gave him the what for.
*  Sean Porter was...
*  That's when you realize Sean Porter, a seven-time world champion.
*  I love the way you talk.
*  Gave him the what for.
*  Gave him the what for.
*  I love that flavor that you put when you describe things.
*  I say things like this.
*  I go, I'm going to keep him busy.
*  I'll give him the what for.
*  Give him the what for.
*  Ask me what would happen if Jamie came at me right now.
*  You sound like an actor.
*  God, ask me.
*  What would happen if Jamie came at you?
*  Meet him halfway.
*  Whoa.
*  That's scary.
*  Ask me what would happen if Jamie...
*  I don't like it.
*  And Jamie's a big athletic guy.
*  That makes me uncomfortable for Jamie.
*  Well, he's an athletic kid.
*  What would happen if Joe came at you?
*  Come back with what I got.
*  Oh, really?
*  See that?
*  Now watch this.
*  Jamie broke his butt bone out here on one of them scooters.
*  Oh, no.
*  Yeah.
*  He was trying to figure out what his injury was forever until Zach Bitter explained how
*  he broke his butt bone.
*  And Jamie's like, that's the exact same problem I've been having.
*  And it happened from him on those fucking...
*  The hoverboard thing.
*  Whoop.
*  Oh, no.
*  Fell on the concrete right out here.
*  Broke his butt.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, maybe.
*  For sure.
*  Undiagnosed broken butt.
*  Most likely.
*  Most likely.
*  You broke your butt.
*  Most likely.
*  It's exactly the same spot.
*  And it's where he landed.
*  He landed on his butt.
*  Hey, Jamie.
*  Jamie.
*  Yes.
*  Ask me if I ever killed a man.
*  Did you ever kill a man?
*  Never stopped to look, brother.
*  Yeah.
*  Are you in the new Mickey Rourke movie?
*  Dude, man.
*  How about me as a fucking action hero?
*  What's my name?
*  Anaconda.
*  Blade?
*  No, Anaconda.
*  Huh?
*  Anaconda's girl.
*  You're like a bag of ropes.
*  No, fucking Anna.
*  Anna.
*  And I hate...
*  No, no, no.
*  Anna's a girl.
*  No, because they go, his name is Anna.
*  And they go, pff.
*  Conda, you ever roll with him?
*  Oh, it's like a boy named Sue.
*  Like people start fighting with you.
*  One of my favorite songs.
*  It's a great song.
*  The meanest thing that he ever did was he went ahead and named me Sue.
*  That's a great fucking...
*  One of the greatest songs.
*  That's my favorite Johnny Cash song.
*  Johnny Cash is on the list.
*  My daddy left home when I was three.
*  Didn't leave much for mom.
*  Me and his sister, old guitar and an empty bottle of booze.
*  That's beautiful.
*  Brian Cowen, it's almost 4 p.m.
*  I love you, buddy.
*  Three hours.
*  Time goes by, bro.
*  It does.
*  We gotta do this more often.
*  We always say this, but we did it.
*  Come see me at the Wilbur.
*  We made it happen.
*  New Year's Eve.
*  Wait, wait.
*  You hit the Wilbur Theater in Boston on New Year's Eve?
*  Yeah, man.
*  For do stand-up comedy?
*  Fuck yeah.
*  Don't you have a new hour?
*  I got a whole new hour.
*  Wait a minute.
*  You have a whole new hour that'll be at the Wilbur Theater in New Year's Eve.

*  The Celebrity Theater?
*  I'm in Arizona tomorrow at the Celebrity Theater.
*  Oh my God.
*  Tomorrow?
*  Tomorrow with Frank Kelly Endo and Adam Ray.
*  Tomorrow you're at the Celebrity Theater in Phoenix, Arizona.
*  Yeah.

*  That's tomorrow on Saturday.

*  Is that when New Year's Eve is?
*  It's cold as fuck on New Year's Eve in Boston, son.
*  I panicked.
*  It was so cold my face hurt.
*  I had to run into a store.
*  It gets cold.
*  I tried to run...
*  I tried to walk a half mile to coffee.
*  All right.
*  God bless you.
*  God bless you.
*  Brian Callan, ladies and gentlemen.
