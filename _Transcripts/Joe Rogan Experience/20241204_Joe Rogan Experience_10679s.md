# Joe Rogan Experience #2238 - John McPhee
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [December 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E1hrK77GLI)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by Dave, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day.
*  Good to see you brother.
*  Yeah, how are you man?
*  Great, great.
*  It was nice to meet you at F1 and I really loved your episode of Sean Ryan.
*  I fucking love that dude.
*  Thanks man.
*  Yeah, Sean is...
*  He's the man.
*  He's awesome.
*  I love Sean.
*  I'm so glad there's guys like him doing this.
*  There's more people like him that are finding new ways to...
*  Media is so wide open now.
*  You don't have to get hired by a television station anymore.
*  You can just start your own shit and Sean's show is fucking great.
*  Yeah, he's great.
*  Sean's...
*  I love him as a person.
*  Yeah, I love him too.
*  He's great.
*  He's an awesome dude.
*  I loved you on that show but god damn man, that show was crazy.
*  Your childhood was so nuts dude.
*  I was hearing about you living in a brothel when you were 12 years old.
*  Yeah, me and my brother.
*  Fuck dude, your whole story was so nuts man.
*  I was listening to it in the sauna this morning and I was like, oh my god.
*  So I'm there cooking at 195 degrees listening to you struggling.
*  I was in there for half an hour.
*  I usually do 20 minutes but I kept going.
*  I'm like, this life was so fucked up.
*  I feel like I shouldn't bail right now.
*  I should keep listening.
*  I feel like...
*  But I'm not the only one.
*  You know what I mean?
*  No.
*  The whole time I was in the army is full of guys just like that.
*  100%.
*  Yeah.
*  100%.
*  Yeah and I think in some, well fighters as well.
*  A lot of fighters I know like Sean Strickland, a lot of guys I know had fucked up childhoods.
*  I think it gives you an extra gear.
*  I think when you can get through a childhood like that, you got an extra place that you
*  can go to that other dudes can't go to.
*  And in your line of work, that comes in very handy.
*  Yeah.
*  Well I think it works like this.
*  I never heard it as an extra gear but here's the way I always equated it.
*  You know you're going to get a beating and it's coming at five o'clock.
*  You know after dinner they're going to be hammered and this is another argument and
*  fight and it's a pattern, right?
*  And you know this as a kid, right?
*  And what happens is you got to take that beating and then like put your church clothes on,
*  we're going to church.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Yeah.
*  I think my brother more than me but I think my mom actually had him convinced that we
*  were super bad kids and like you know we were, I don't know, a couple years ago I was like
*  you know like you ever met an actual bad like four or six or eight year old?
*  No.
*  It's how they were raised.
*  Right?
*  It's all now they're raised.
*  And then it was kind of like I think it was an eye opener for him but like it was always
*  our fault.
*  Well that's the thing.
*  You can convince kids of almost anything.
*  You can convince them it's their fault.
*  You can convince them that they're bad kids and then they feel bad for the rest of their
*  fucking life.
*  They feel like a piece of shit.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a lot of people out there that didn't do anything wrong.
*  They're just raised by shitheads and for their whole life they feel like garbage.
*  Yeah.
*  And they don't know why.
*  Yeah, I agree.
*  It's so hard to snap out of that too and it takes something for you to do that makes you
*  feel valuable and worthwhile.
*  Like you have to kind of like relearn who you are as a person.
*  Yeah.
*  And some people never do.
*  Yeah.
*  They can find meth or heroin or something that takes the edge away.
*  Yeah.
*  They can just exist.
*  Yeah.
*  Well I'll tell you that was the army for me.
*  Like the first time I ever felt like I fit in or I was with people like me was when I
*  was in Ranger Battalion.
*  Yeah.
*  I think fighting is the same way.
*  A lot of those guys the only time they ever feel normal is when they're in a gym with
*  a bunch of other savages.
*  Yeah.
*  Like guys who want to do that for a living, you know, generally something fucking terribly
*  wrong happened when you were young that put this anger, this monster inside of you.
*  Well I tell you, I tell people all the time, Jiu-Jitsu is my sanity.
*  Yeah.
*  Jiu-Jitsu is meditation, man.
*  Because if you are doing Jiu-Jitsu you can't be thinking about anything else.
*  Right.
*  So it cleans your mind up.
*  You know we were talking about bow hunting.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that's the same thing.
*  I think in a different way.
*  When you're doing that it's so difficult.
*  You can't think about anything else.
*  Right.
*  I love when I'm, I don't even care if I get or see an elk today.
*  The places I go to get these elk, I could just sit there all day anyway.
*  I know.
*  You know what I mean?
*  The fact that like one of these majestic beasts is going to walk 20 yards from me, fucking
*  bonus.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like I just, you know what I'm saying?
*  And I feel the same about Jiu-Jitsu.
*  You know, like I always like in Jiu-Jitsu when someone does like what you call high level
*  Jiu-Jitsu to me as it's happening, like couldn't, I don't care if you're smashing my fucking
*  face that was amazing.
*  Are you kidding me?
*  Like let's take a moment here.
*  It's amazing that someone can do that.
*  Yeah.
*  You know I remember when I was first starting Jiu-Jitsu I was like 30 years old and I thought
*  I was a badass.
*  I had kickbox.
*  I had won a bunch of Taekwondo tournaments.
*  I thought I knew how to fight.
*  And I remember one day when I was a white belt this purple belt just raped me.
*  I mean he was my size.
*  This was what drove me crazy.
*  He wasn't bigger than me.
*  And he just destroyed me.
*  Just destroyed, just did whatever he wanted.
*  Triangled me, arm barred me, choked me.
*  And I remember walking out of there going, I can't, first of all, what a like shift of
*  like who you are in the world knowing that someone can just do that to you.
*  Not a bigger guy.
*  Like someone your size can just, you're helpless.
*  And then I remember thinking, I gotta get good at this.
*  Like that, having that as a skill, that's like one of the greatest things you could
*  ever have.
*  Like cause that's what martial arts was supposed to be when we were kids.
*  Like that the smaller person could beat the larger person just with technique.
*  Correct.
*  Until Horace Gracie came along you never really saw that.
*  The bigger guys always won.
*  And then Horace Gracie all of a sudden he's killing people from his back.
*  And we're like what is going on?
*  This is crazy.
*  He's losing.
*  He's not losing.
*  All of a sudden he's like, he's strangling some guy with his legs.
*  We're like what the fuck is this?
*  Yeah I agree.
*  I agree.
*  I'll tell you, I met Hoice like we, you know, in the early days we'd bring Hoice and Horian
*  was actually the first Gracie I met before Hoice, right?
*  But we'd bring Hoice in and like watching these guys like, you know, we'd get like 60
*  guys up on the mat.
*  And this is hard to do.
*  This is a lot of guys because it's Hoice, you know, and he would run through every dude.
*  Yeah.
*  Every dude.
*  And it was like not like, not like it was a close match.
*  It was like whatever dude from the Defoe stepped in front of him was the 12 year old child
*  against the fucking an adult.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like he just fucking handled everybody.
*  And I remember one of those times he just fucking, I did something and he cinched down
*  on me like a spider and I couldn't fucking move.
*  And he goes, yes, I did not think of this.
*  This is good move.
*  And I was like, I don't even know what the fuck I'm doing.
*  Like, you know what I mean?
*  I wasn't even a white belt yet.
*  I was just, he was just fucking me up, you know?
*  But I knew like right then and there I was fucking helpless.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a weird feeling.
*  And like, yo, unacceptable.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Unacceptable.
*  Yeah, right.
*  Unacceptable.
*  That's the right word.
*  Yeah.
*  You gotta learn this.
*  You gotta know some of it.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Even back then, like we would all tell hoists, you know, because we were more Muay Thai.
*  We would train a lot of Muay Thai, boxing, right?
*  Wrestling, a lot of wrestling, you know, before the Jits.
*  And like we would tell hoists back then, as soon as you learn the punch, you are super
*  dangerous, which is I think where it is now.

*  Yeah.
*  Well, I think wrestling is kind of, there's like so many elite wrestlers now that have
*  learned submissions.
*  And that extra skill of being able to throw bodies around is another level.
*  I agree.
*  Because wrestlers can learn Jiu Jitsu pretty easy.
*  An elite wrestler, you take a guy like a Bo Nickel or a Daniel Correa, teach him Jiu
*  Jitsu.
*  They're going to, Hamzat Chamayev is the best example of that.
*  You teach a guy like that submissions, he already knows how to ragdoll people.
*  So he has this ability to take everybody down and then on top of that, he's going to break
*  your neck.
*  Like it's like that extra skill.
*  I think wrestling is like the foundation.
*  That's the one thing.
*  Because then you can dictate whether the fight goes to the ground or stays up.
*  You know, and then once you learn submissions, which is pretty easy for a wrestler to learn,
*  it's pretty similar.
*  It's the same sport.
*  I used to wrestle and it's like the cradle for the pin versus an arm bar.
*  Right?
*  In my opinion.
*  Different things come from similar positions.
*  But then stand up.
*  You know, you have to have stand up today because I think, you know, I've been talking
*  about this a lot.
*  I don't think, I think when you have a fight and there's five rounds, say, of a fight,
*  if a guy's mounted on top of a guy at the end of the first round, I think the second
*  round should start with that guy mounted on top of you.
*  I don't think they should start standing up because it doesn't make any sense.
*  Like you didn't earn that stand up.
*  That guy took you down.
*  He got on top of you.
*  He's mounted on you.
*  You're about to get fucked up.
*  And then all of a sudden you have a reprieve from the governor.
*  Reset.
*  Because the round is over and now you're standing up again.
*  And if you're a striker, that's your world.
*  But you didn't earn that position.
*  It's one fight.
*  It's not five fights.
*  It's one fight.
*  So why should you have a beginning of every round where you're standing up?
*  Yeah, I agree.
*  I agree with that.
*  If I could change the rules, that's the first rule that I would change.
*  I would say whatever position you were in at the end of the round, that's where you
*  start.
*  I completely agree with that.
*  And I always feel like that it just fucks shit up.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And then you know this doing jiu jitsu is like seconds matter.
*  And this fight could turn around in seconds.
*  But those seconds can't happen if we stop this early.
*  A hundred percent.
*  Yeah, I agree with that.
*  Well, the early days were wild, right?
*  Because there was no time limit.
*  That's what I watched.
*  The early days is my heyday.
*  Like I could not get enough.
*  I was a fight dummy for Hoyce, for Sakuraba.
*  Who else?
*  Oh, Hoyce.
*  So okay, I'll tell you a quick story about Hoyce.
*  He comes out.
*  We're doing jiu jitsu with him.
*  And I'm a new guy.
*  So I'm like, hey, you could share my wall locker, right?
*  And you got a wall locker and you got like your towel because the shower's down the hallway.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like I have my clothes, right?
*  And then so Hoyce put his family pictures.
*  And I didn't notice this, but they slowly did this.
*  Him and my team re-tagged everything with like my last name and team numbers with Hoyce.
*  Right?
*  So they re-tagged all my gear as Hoyce, right?
*  They, Hoyce put his kids' pictures up over mine, right?
*  And one day I'm in my locker like, is this my locker?
*  Like what the fuck?
*  What the fuck is going on?
*  And I'm like, whose kids are these?
*  Like and then Hoyce is like, you know, yes, you like my kids?
*  And I'm like, oh, those are your kids?
*  Like, no, that's cool.
*  Right?
*  Like years later, I'm in Iraq and I'm like, I got to go for like one of these surges into
*  Fallujah with another squadron and like their ops are major calling me by name.
*  And it's like, I've been in Iraq like 30 seconds.
*  These guys are calling me by name.
*  Like what the fuck?
*  You know?
*  And then he was like, we're getting your stuff.
*  It's on a helicopter.
*  You need to get on this little bird.
*  We're leaving like 20 minutes.
*  And literally I got on a little bird.
*  They bring my kid over.
*  I get my shit on.
*  Right.
*  And they're like, yo, whose shit is a Royce?
*  Is there a Royce?
*  Royce?
*  You know what I mean?
*  And then like my bag is one is fucking still tagged with Hoyce's name.
*  That's hilarious.
*  That's hilarious.
*  So you started training martial arts in when you were in the military?
*  In the unit.
*  Yeah.
*  In the unit.
*  So did they have like, was it like technical training?
*  Did they teach you?
*  Did they have like real instructors?
*  How does it work?
*  Yeah.
*  So in training, when you kind of make it to the unit, there's a hand to hand program.
*  A lot of the hand to hand program is like traditionally like you got to cuff people.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like, which is all Japanese wrist locks, which is the foundation for a lot of shit.
*  Right.
*  But you know, you learn that stuff.
*  Like how, if you have a weapon, how to like approach somebody, if they grab your weapon,
*  what to do.
*  It's all like a weapon focused, like more like self defense.
*  But I think back then in my day, right in the nineties, it was still bro, come at me
*  like this.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And you're like, why the fuck would I stand like this ever?
*  Like what the fuck was I doing that got me here?
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like, so it was always some back then there was a lot of hocus pocus.
*  So we kind of had our own training program.
*  And then as my years, the training program got better because we started getting hoist.
*  We started ground fighting, you know, I think the premise for everything they taught in
*  my day when I was a student was like, you know, weapons retention, Japanese wrist lock
*  to get someone cuffed, you know, two man cuffing procedures, searching, and then like how to
*  defend yourself if someone grabbed your weapon or if you went to the ground, right?
*  Right.
*  Which is all stuff you have to know.
*  Right.
*  So it wasn't a lot of like just one on one.
*  No, no, it's like, you know, you're in the gym, they roll out the wrestling mat and it's
*  like, okay, come at the guy like with your rifle.
*  You know, a bunch of fucking white belts basically like out there fucking around.
*  Was it like, there was a system like a training system?
*  Yeah, there was a system back then and the system was really, I think, kind of four things
*  without really knowing what they did back then.
*  I went through the training, but I don't really know what the hand to hand was back then until
*  later when I was like in the hand to hand program or fighting with guys.
*  You know what I mean?
*  But I would say this back then, I'd say it was wrestling.
*  It was Muay Thai, right?
*  It was a little bit of Japanese wrist locks and some Filipino martial arts.
*  Oh, like Kali.
*  Kali.
*  We had guys that would do the sticks.
*  I know a little bit of the sticks.
*  You know, like first time I got smacked 37 fucking times around the head was another
*  guy with his sticks.
*  It was like, what the fuck was that?
*  Like how do these sticks move so fucking fast?
*  Dude's are good with that are very impressive.
*  Yeah, super impressed.
*  So I think that was really the foundation like and you know, maybe like some, I don't
*  know, like dirty boxing, I would kind of imagine.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Clenching, punching, punching, stuff like that.
*  How did the Filipinos develop that stick fighting?
*  Like where'd that come from?
*  I don't know, man.
*  Weird to like one culture is known for their stick fighting.
*  Yeah.
*  Kind of odd.
*  Yeah.
*  But I love all that, that the stick fighting, what do they call it?
*  Pontukin or whatever, the dirty boxing they do, like all very make your opponent off balance
*  at the same time you can strike.
*  Or if they are trying to strike you, knock them off balance.
*  I'm just, I've always been so fascinated how different cultures have a completely different
*  approach to fighting.
*  Like the Thais figured out the best way to fight stand up.
*  Kick the shit out of the legs.
*  Yeah, fucking kick his leg.
*  Elbow the fuck out of people in the clinch.
*  Plung, knees, knees to the body, knees to the face.
*  They figured out striking in a way that nobody else had.
*  It's weird that they did it.
*  And I think it's just because of the competition all the time and the betting.
*  They were fighting so often and they had so much money on the line for fighting that they
*  developed a very pragmatic way of fighting.
*  Because they were fighting all the time as opposed to like karate or any of these other
*  things.
*  I don't think they were really fighting as much.
*  Well, we don't, I mean, think about America, like prior to Mike Tyson, boxing was kind
*  of like Americans, if they would have seen like Hickson Gracie, you know, Hickson Gracie
*  would have been popular in like the seventies or sixties.
*  People have been like, well, that's not civilized fighting.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Right, right.
*  Get your dukes up.
*  This has got to be fair.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Americans have a very fair sense of what fighting should be.
*  Like Americans hate like dirty fighting.
*  But you know, all the Muay Thai and Kali and all that, that was all seen.
*  You know, those guys would come from Asia, fight around the states here, fucking kick
*  everyone's ass and people still weren't attracted to it.
*  Did you ever see, there's one fight that's like one of the most important fights in kickboxing
*  where Rick Rufus, who is like the king of American style kickboxing, like above the
*  waist kickboxing, fought this Thai guy.
*  I forget how, I can't pronounce the guy's name correctly, so I don't want to butcher
*  it.
*  But this, and Rick Rufus was fucking him up in the beginning.
*  He dropped him.
*  He had him in real trouble.
*  Rick Rufus was really good, but this dude just kept chopping at the legs, chopping at
*  the legs.
*  And by the end of the fight, Rick's in a heap on the ground and his own brother, Duke Rufus
*  who became a world Muay Thai champion himself later and became one of the best trainers
*  in MMA.
*  This is the fight.
*  What happened?
*  Oh, that's his name?
*  Good luck saying that one.
*  But oh, this is not, this is a different, this is like a compilation of a bunch of different
*  people fighting.
*  That's not, this is it, the fight that changed kickboxing.
*  So this, this fight, well, this isn't it.
*  This is a bunch of other shit.
*  Go into the fight itself.
*  That's fucking Chuck Norris.
*  I've seen Chuck in there.
*  Chuck was legit.
*  So this is the fight.
*  So in the beginning, Rick Rufus, who's like this above the weight kick, so he drops him
*  with the left hand.
*  Rick was really fucking good, man.
*  He was really good.
*  But they just didn't know anything about the leg kicks.
*  And after the fight, like his brother Duke was like, well, I don't think there's any
*  skill involved in kicking the legs.
*  And he was saying that, look, he drops him again.
*  So he dropped him two times.
*  Looked like Rick is fucking him up.
*  But this Thai guy just, he's probably had 200 fights and he just keeps kicking at the
*  legs.
*  And after a while Rick's legs are just dead.
*  I mean, the Thai guy is getting lit up.
*  But Rick became an unbelievable leg kicker himself after this, but no one knew.
*  They just didn't know.
*  So as the fight goes on, and this is like a huge like challenge match, you see, like
*  he drops him with this leg kick.
*  After a while, Rick just can't move anymore.
*  And this dude, he ain't even running away well.
*  No, his legs are dead right now.
*  And he's just getting, every time this Thai is kicking him, he can barely walk.
*  And at the end of the fight, he winds up in a heap.
*  Because he just doesn't know.
*  You know, he doesn't know yet.
*  And he's getting dumped too.
*  Like look at these fucking low kicks, devastating low kicks.
*  And at the end of the fight, he's just in a heap on the ground.
*  Yeah, his kick had no power there.
*  But the thing is like, Rick was really fucking good back in the day.
*  So when you, that didn't show the end of the fight, but at the end of the fight, he just,
*  he brutalized him with just low kicks.
*  The Thais had figured something out that nobody had figured out.
*  And it's kind of shocking that this one area of the world, like this one small island,
*  they figured it out.
*  Yeah.
*  Kind of crazy.
*  Love it.
*  Yeah, I love it too.
*  It's just, and then Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Until, you know, Maeda comes to Brazil in like the 1930s or some shit.
*  Whatever that was.
*  Whenever that was.
*  And then they go, the Brazilians are like, huh, I think we can fix this.
*  Yeah.
*  And they start like, you know, because Elio was a small guy and Helio is like going, well,
*  what about if we just did it this way?
*  We fought with leverage and just instead of using strength, we used technique and changed
*  martial arts forever.
*  Yeah.
*  I love it.
*  I love all of it.
*  Yeah.
*  I'll tell you, that leg kick is my go-to in Iraq and Afghanistan.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like I get about this far from you.
*  This is good distance for me.
*  You can't grab my weapons, but what I would do is I'd throw the Thai leg kick, but I wouldn't
*  aim for the middle of the thigh.
*  I don't care about your pain.
*  I'd hit your knee and either it's going to break your knee or it's going to knock you
*  out of your little fucking slippers.
*  And then I just stand on your neck.
*  Yeah.
*  It's, it's one of the most effective things you could do.
*  You take away someone's base.
*  Yeah.
*  And you know, that's the crazy thing about MMA is now we're learning that kicking in
*  the calf is actually even more effective than kicking in the thigh.
*  Yeah.
*  Because there's no meat there.
*  Yeah.
*  It fucking hurts.
*  And you slam a shin into that and then all of a sudden your foot goes floppy.
*  It doesn't work anymore.
*  Your leg's useless.
*  It's crazy.
*  And we've figured that out over the last five or six years, which is really nuts.
*  Like Michael Bisping, who was a world champion, told me he went his whole career without ever
*  getting kicked in the calf.
*  Wow.
*  And that was like, you know, four or five years ago, he was a world champion and went
*  his entire career without getting kicked in the calf.
*  Nuts.
*  It's nuts.
*  It's like it's constantly changing and evolving.
*  Yeah.
*  Like people find something that works and they're like, oh, what about this?
*  I love that it's always evolving too.
*  Well, martial arts have evolved more in the last 30 years than they have in the last 30,000
*  years.
*  I agree.
*  That's a fact.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a fact.
*  And that's kind of shocking.
*  You think about how long people have been fighting.
*  I don't know.
*  You know, I see this, you know, I shoot every day.
*  I teach people to shoot all over the country all the time, right?
*  And it's kind of interesting to me that I don't think it works like that.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like you would think people would have been doing this right the whole time, but there's
*  like a lot of myth involved and it gets watered down over time, I think a lot of times.
*  Even in shooting.
*  Yeah.
*  Like what are the myths in shooting?
*  Oh, so fucking many, man.
*  Do we got the time?
*  We got time.
*  I'll fucking shred this shit.
*  The NRA, I go to, I speak at the NRA shows.
*  Like the NRA hires me.
*  I speak at the NRA show this year.
*  I actually got roofied in fucking Dallas at the NRA show.
*  Yeah.
*  No shit.
*  Do you know who did it?
*  So this is fucking, this is crazy, right?
*  But okay, I have an assistant, right?
*  I don't know.
*  She's like 30, blonde girl, pretty girl.
*  Her and her husband are with me and I'm with like the surefire representative, like, yo,
*  sorry we got you roofied, by the way.
*  And then like some other guys, right?
*  And we get done with the show and we just go have a drink or two and we're going into
*  like the hotel restaurant to eat a nice steak dinner.
*  You know what I mean?
*  So we get around to drinks and it was like well old fashions is what it was.
*  Well old fashions.
*  And my assistant's like, I sit next to her.
*  She's like, I just can't drink anymore.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like these are horrible old fashions.
*  I just can't, I just can't drink these anymore.
*  And it was like, hey, we'll be at dinner in a minute.
*  They got good booze at the good restaurant.
*  We'll get anything you want, right?
*  So she's like, okay.
*  So I was like, here, I'll take it.
*  So I held my cup up and then I kind of held my cup up.
*  The surefire guy, her husband, and she kind of fills us all up equally.
*  And so.
*  So somebody was trying to, Rufy, her.
*  Her, right?
*  So yeah, this is in Dallas, right?
*  So okay.
*  So we go to dinner.
*  I don't know, I get this Wagyu burger.
*  It's fucking delicious.
*  I'm kind of buzzed.
*  I'm drinking good whiskey.
*  You know what I mean?
*  We're having a good time, right?
*  I love good food, right?
*  So I'm having a great time.
*  Her husband's at the end of the table and all of a sudden, and this is like within 45
*  minutes of that drink, which I also didn't know, right?
*  So his head hits the table, boom.
*  And I look at him and I'm like, is he okay?
*  And then like, you know how like, you know, them blow up pools where you pull down the
*  side and the water just kind of glides over the top.
*  And his mouth opens and it was just like, whoa, across the table.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And I was like, I pushed away from the table, like so it didn't leak on me.
*  And I was like, we got to go.
*  You know what I mean?
*  It's time to leave.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I'll get the check by the front door or something.
*  You know what I mean?
*  But it's, we definitely, it's time for us to leave.
*  And you weren't feeling it yet?
*  No, I wasn't.
*  I didn't, I didn't feel anything yet.
*  Right?
*  So, okay.
*  So it was like, I've never seen this happen to this guy ever.
*  Right?
*  This isn't him.
*  Like, so it's kind of weird.
*  Right?
*  So my assistant's like, hey, I'll take him up to the room.
*  I was like, okay, well, we're going to go have a few more drinks at the bar.
*  Right?
*  So me and the other guy go to the bar.
*  She goes up to her room.
*  Right?
*  I don't know any of this is happening, but as soon as they get to the room, head of security's
*  knocking on the door.
*  So my assistant answers and then I guess the guy was like, is there a guy that threw up
*  in the restaurant here?
*  And she's like, he's in the bathtub naked right now.
*  Like.
*  And then the head of security like, hey, we watched the tapes.
*  Ton of info comes out.
*  Right?
*  So I don't know who did it.
*  I think so.
*  But like, and then did it tell you?
*  No, no, no.
*  They talked to my assistant and then her husband.
*  Right?
*  Like, so I go down to the bar.
*  Right?
*  I put my credit card on the bar and like, I fucking party till all hours of the night.
*  Yo, what did I learn?
*  If you roofie me, like you're going to wait six hours to get that booty.
*  Because once you give me drugs, I want to party, baby.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like, so I'm out.
*  Like, I don't know what the fuck that the surefire guy fucking Peters out on me.
*  And I'm probably just in the lobby alone.
*  Like, it's fucked up.
*  I don't know.
*  Do you know what was in it?
*  No, it was just something.
*  It wasn't necessarily roofie.
*  Roof and all.
*  Yeah.
*  Probably something.
*  I don't know what it was.
*  So the next day we check out.
*  Right.
*  Show's over.
*  So my assistant's knocking on my door.
*  Right.
*  And I'm a get up early guy.
*  I do my cardio.
*  You know, so I'm normally up early and she's knocking on my door.
*  Right.
*  So I answer my door and I'm like thinking the fuck is she doing here so early?
*  Right.
*  Both of her and her husband.
*  And she's like, you know, I'm glad you're okay.
*  And I'm like, what?
*  You know what I mean?
*  And she's like, what?
*  What?
*  She looks, she's looking at me.
*  She's like, not you too.
*  And I'm like, me too.
*  What?
*  You know what I mean?
*  I'm kind of foggy.
*  Right.
*  It was like fucking, it was checkout is after checkout time.
*  I slept till like fucking one in the afternoon.
*  The next day I had the worst fucking hangover ever.
*  Like if that was roofies do the hangover, I understand why people don't do them recreationally.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like the worst fucking hangover.
*  So she's like, let's anybody get tested to find out what it is.
*  Now they had to fly home that afternoon.
*  They got me in my Sprinter van.
*  I had to go do a class like somewhere else.
*  I was on the fucking road.
*  So like she got me, they drove me to breakfast, got me something to eat, kind of sober me
*  up a little bit.
*  Right.
*  And then they went to the airport, dropped me off and I drove somewhere else in Texas.
*  I was working there.
*  And then, you know, the head of security talked to her and her husband, called them a couple
*  days later, check on them, make sure they were okay.
*  But long story short is we had a round of drinks that none of us ordered come to our
*  table and they came to our table from the same waitress that we had.
*  You know what I mean?
*  So somehow we got around to drinks and we even paid for them.
*  And when I got the bill, like, I don't know, we had two drinks and we were getting ready
*  to go.
*  And then a third one came and I just figured someone one of these someone ordered it.
*  You know what I mean?
*  It'll be fine.
*  And then I just paid for it all.
*  Didn't not even think of it.
*  And so did the security know who roofied you?
*  I think so.
*  I think so.
*  I think they told my assistant.
*  I think they and you didn't ask her?
*  No, I don't care.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, I think it was like a targeted thing where they just fucking rob you.
*  Oh, you know what I'm saying?
*  I like I don't think I mean, all right, first and foremost, I think everyone's trying to
*  burgle booty holes this day and age and you got to keep your safe.
*  So there's that right.
*  But I also think like, I think it was like, they know all these people are in for these
*  conventions.
*  So they try to drug somebody and just rob him.
*  You could have just took my hand in my wallet.
*  I mean, there's not a crime.
*  They happened to a buddy of mine recently.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  He met this girl and they go back to his place and then he wakes up the next day and he's
*  robbed, stole his Rolex stole twenty five thousand dollars in cash from him.
*  But he got tested and he had I think it was Xanax.
*  He piled a bunch of Xanax into his drink and he was just out.
*  He didn't know what the fuck happened.
*  Came to the club afterwards.
*  He was like all fucked up.
*  Came to the comedy club.
*  He's a comedian.
*  Hans Kim.
*  Shout out to Hans.
*  Hilarious guy.
*  So he's like something happened.
*  I don't know what happened.
*  We're like, hey, man, go to fucking go get tested right now while it's still in your
*  system.
*  So he goes and gets his hair tested and they found that there's roofies in him.
*  Damn.
*  I didn't even know you could be tested.
*  Yeah, you can be tested.
*  Oh shit.
*  But you there's like a time period.
*  If you test hair, it'll like last a little longer.
*  And I think he waited a day so they had to test hair.
*  But within a certain time period, they can test you and find out what it is.
*  And they said, did you take any Xanax?
*  He's like, no, like you have a lot of Xanax in your system.
*  And apparently that's one of the things that they give people to rob them.
*  Dang.
*  Does it cause a hangover?
*  I'm sure.
*  Fuck.
*  It's got to.
*  If you're going to drug me.
*  Anything that's going to whack you out.
*  Drug me.
*  If you're going to rob me.
*  I just want to say this to the world.
*  If you're going to fucking rob me, like give me the non hangover shit.
*  You're getting my shit anyway.
*  But what is the non hangover shit?
*  Fuck.
*  I don't know.
*  Whatever that shit is.
*  You know more about drugs than me.
*  I was in the army my whole life.
*  I don't think it exists.
*  Damn it, Joe.
*  I think it's prescription stuff or GHB.
*  I know a lot of people give people GHB.
*  I've heard of that.
*  That just gets you like, you don't know what the fuck's going on.
*  I've heard of that.
*  I've heard of people getting roofied.
*  If I was a woman, I'd be fucking terrified to accept a drink from anybody.
*  Fuck.
*  I've talked to so many ladies that have had their alcohol drugged by someone.
*  When we go to bars, they keep their fucking hand over their drink all the time.
*  Even when they're turning around and looking away.
*  Because they just never know.
*  Some guy just drops something in there real quick.
*  Next thing you know, you're going home with them.
*  You don't even know where you are.
*  I had a buddy, he doesn't even drink.
*  Someone convinced him to have a glass of wine, small town North Carolina.
*  The cops pulled him over not far down the road.
*  He was like, I don't know what's going on, but I can't feel my hands.
*  He's just a regular guy.
*  They brought him back to the station and someone had put, I think it was a little bit of fentanyl
*  or some shit in the wine.
*  He left and he said he felt fine.
*  He was driving.
*  He said, I don't feel right.
*  Even though he had one glass of wine.
*  He doesn't even drink.
*  I don't even know why he had a glass of wine.
*  Someone probably talked him into it.
*  He probably didn't even finish it.
*  He said he was lucky.
*  He felt lucky.
*  There's fucking non-human people out there.
*  I'm telling you, that's one of the things I wanted to talk about today is there's fucking
*  real evil in the world and in Iraq, where in Afghanistan you go into these fucked up
*  places where they've been like, I don't know, fucking raping, beheading people, fucking
*  tribal shit forever.
*  There was buildings I didn't even want to fucking go in.
*  You'd go and you'd be like, every fucking hair on my body just be standing up.
*  I'm at the doorway and be like, I don't even want to clear this fucking building.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I don't know fucking why, but I know there's fucking old evil in this world.
*  Evil's real.
*  It's fucking real.
*  If you've never experienced it, you could walk around delusional and think, oh, come
*  on.
*  It's real.
*  You can feel it.
*  When I'm around real evil shit, only two places I felt real evil shit in my life is Gettysburg
*  and fucking in Iraq and Afghanistan.
*  Yeah, I felt that.
*  Because I felt evil before and it makes me want to throw up, it hurts my stomach.
*  In the area of Gettysburg, my stepfather felt the same thing.
*  He's not woo woo at all.
*  He's like a real straight edge guy.
*  He said it felt so creepy.
*  I was almost going to ... Me and my son were out there ghost hunting, right?
*  We were both going to throw up and I didn't tell him, but I had felt that feeling before.
*  It's crazy that you said that about Gettysburg because my stepdad's never said anything like
*  that before.
*  He said just the feeling, it was so sad and creepy and you just wanted to get out of there
*  immediately.
*  Makes me want to throw up that feeling.
*  I think places have memory.
*  I really believe that.
*  I think it's energy and I don't think it can be created or fucking ... You've talked to
*  science guys, right?
*  Energy don't go away, right?
*  I think you just don't see it and you can't measure it, so you assume it's not there.
*  I think that's one of the reasons why when someone gets murdered in a house, they have
*  to tell you about it.
*  Right?
*  They have to because people, they know.
*  There was John Benet Ramsey's house.
*  When I lived in Boulder, I lived in Boulder for a while.
*  We were looking at houses to buy and there was this one house.
*  It was really cheap for the house.
*  I was like, this is a nice fucking house.
*  They had changed the name of the street so they could try to sell this house because
*  everybody knew that it was the house that John Benet Ramsey had been killed in.
*  They couldn't fucking sell the house.
*  We were looking at the house on Zillow.
*  We were like, oh, this is a beautiful house.
*  Maybe we should go check out this house.
*  Then we found out.
*  We're like, oh, that's why they can't sell it.
*  Oh man.
*  They changed the name of the street to try to sell this house.
*  It's fucked up.
*  They should have just bulldozed it.
*  They should have bulldozed it and then what do you do about the ground?
*  It's still there.
*  Fuck.
*  Bring it.
*  Bulldoze the house where a little girl was getting killed?
*  Fuck that.
*  Not even joking about it.
*  I don't want to live there.
*  No, no one wants to live there.
*  I don't even know what it is now.
*  I don't know if anybody ever bought it.
*  I grew up in old houses in the Chicago area.
*  Some of them houses were creepy for no reason and some weren't.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  There's something to that.
*  I was in Iraq and I was in one of them like, you know, Uday and Kousse like fucking raped
*  people.
*  Them guys were evil.
*  You went to like their palace?
*  All of them.
*  Those guys were evil.
*  I carried their bodies off an airplane and had to guard them until they got cleaned up
*  by the Morgan DNA tested.
*  But them fucking guys, them palaces, they would pick up fucking 12 year olds off the
*  street.
*  They didn't give a fuck.
*  The lions.
*  We found them fucking.
*  So Uday had lions and the lions were, it's not funny but I mean it's kind of humorous
*  but I think it's funny.
*  The lions were like on the army side, the big army side and they were inside this fence.
*  The lions were like just lazy as fuck.
*  They didn't care about no army guys.
*  One day I seen a lady and kids walk by and they're just behind chain link.
*  Them fucking lions went nuts and I knew like only that.
*  Fuck yeah.
*  Fuck yeah.
*  They were fucking evil.
*  I have read so many horrible stories about those guys.
*  They would find a woman who was getting married and they would rape her and then feed her
*  to their dogs.
*  Yeah.
*  They would find a fucking carp outside the palaces, you know them big lakes full of these
*  giant carps that just were going to eat bodies like you read about.
*  Yeah.
*  So I was down in one of those one night just because I could be and I had my flashlight.
*  Always been fascinated by ghost hunting by the way.
*  So I'm down there by myself just exploring, you know what I mean?
*  And like this fucking door slammed on me, you know what I mean?
*  I was freaked the fuck out.
*  I'm the only one down there, you know what I mean?
*  I was like freaked me the fuck out man.
*  And the energy down in those fucking like rape rooms or whatever.
*  I don't know what the fuck you call it.
*  Like they did fucking bad shit there.
*  It's just like I don't know.
*  Like it like you ever ride like a roller coaster and it like turns your stomach?
*  Yeah.
*  That's how it feels to me in them rooms.
*  I don't know what that is but it makes me almost want to throw up.
*  And the stronger it is the more I feel like I'm going to throw up.
*  Those guys were such fucking monsters.
*  It's just so crazy that that story repeats itself over and over again.
*  Like the sons of kings that grow up that way are always just super fucking evil because
*  they have unchecked power from the time they're a child.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I got to be honest.
*  If I could clone myself and I'd had like a mini me right now, I would abuse him just to
*  make sure he grows up right.
*  I would raise him right.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Yeah.
*  I don't and when I say abuse him, I mean like...
*  Force him to work hard.
*  Yeah.
*  Fucking earn his shit his whole fucking life.
*  I mean like yeah I had a guy like I had a I don't know what he was.
*  I was in the Middle East somewhere and one of the guys asked me like are American babies
*  stupid?
*  And I'm like what?
*  And he's like are American babies stupid?
*  And I'm like why?
*  And he's like well in America like there would be a fence at the edge of the cliff so the
*  baby can't go over.
*  In my country like the baby knows don't go by the cliff and I'm like I don't know like
*  fuck off.
*  What the fuck?
*  I bet they don't.
*  I bet the babies that don't know go off the cliff and those genes never propagate.
*  Again.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the most harsh form of natural selection.
*  Darwinism right there.
*  The most harsh form of it.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  No fucking I mean kids that grow up outside.
*  Lock-key kids like when I was a kid.
*  Yeah.
*  You just left out of the house.
*  Bye.
*  And you figure out who's the child molester.
*  Yeah.
*  You figure out who's a creep.
*  What's dangerous.
*  Don't go near the train tracks.
*  You can't hear the train till it's too late.
*  Stay away from the trunks.
*  Because you hear about the kids that get hit.
*  Yeah.
*  At the liquor store.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  I did the same thing.
*  You learned about danger.
*  Yeah.
*  I tell you I got my first key I was six.
*  I fucking lost it like the same day.
*  My mom's yelling at me and she's like you know what do you got to say for yourself?
*  I was like I still remember.
*  It's like one of my oldest memories.
*  It's like I'm six.
*  And she was just kind of like yeah.
*  I'm six.
*  Like I had it one fucking day.
*  Like I never carried a key in my life.
*  Of course I'm going to fuck this up.
*  She was like we can't afford all these keys.
*  You know what I mean?
*  But at the same time like I'm fucking six.
*  So we ended up having to hide it somewhere.
*  And then you know because my brother wasn't good at fucking keys either.
*  You know it's fucked up that I don't want that to happen to my kids.
*  I don't want Mike.
*  I mean my life was nothing like your life.
*  But I was definitely like let loose in the world.
*  You know and not really given any guidance.
*  Tuna.
*  Tuna let loose with no guidance.
*  But that's how you make a person like you.
*  Like a person like you doesn't come from a home that has like you know you're coddled.
*  You're taken care of.
*  You're always protected.
*  Yeah.
*  Like the only way you make like a legit beast of a man is that that man has to go through
*  a lot of shit through their life and then they come out on the other end hard.
*  Right.
*  It's the only way.
*  Right.
*  You don't you know I've never met like a world champion fighter that came from like the happiest
*  of childhoods.
*  It just doesn't exist.
*  Yeah.
*  But I don't think a lot of a lot of unit or special forces or ranger guys like I used
*  to call it the fatherless.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And it works kind of two ways.
*  Either you had a dad but he worked and he came home and he passed out and he woke up
*  and he was gone before you got up and when you got home he was asleep on the couch or
*  already out for the night because he fucking works fucking a lot of hours.
*  Or you kind of just didn't have a dad.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Right.
*  Those people make special forces soldiers just like you know dad issues for a chick
*  or put her on a pole.
*  Those same issues and a dude puts them in special forces I think.
*  And I'll take the fatherless all day long.
*  Yeah.
*  For sure.
*  Well those are the world champions.
*  I mean that's Mike Tyson right?
*  He was 13 years old, no family.
*  Gets adopted by a guy who's a psychologist who's a hypnotist and is a great boxing coach
*  and teaches him to become this elite fighter.
*  And I kind of think that you don't become that guy unless you're dealing with all sorts
*  of unspeakable tragedy and horrors when you're a child.
*  Well you wouldn't have that kind of focus without that.
*  You wouldn't have that monster inside of you.
*  That monster has to grow because it needs to be there.
*  Right.
*  I would say like, and I don't know what the ratio is, but I would say like one out of
*  every fucking hundred or 300 is like the fucking high school quarterback who married the fucking
*  prom king.
*  Very rare.
*  Very rare.
*  I think I only knew one of those guys.
*  Yeah and those guys I bet if you dig into their childhood that dad was probably a little
*  abusive.
*  Yeah or their mom or a brother.
*  Yeah something.
*  There's another thing, older brothers.
*  It's like you want to find the young brother.
*  The young brother's the beast.
*  I'm the little brother.
*  Yeah that's it.
*  The young brother gets beat up by the older brother and just constantly in battle his
*  whole life.
*  Like so many fighters, the best fighters have like Chris Weidman's got a great story like
*  that.
*  Well I mean think about this, if you had to fight your bigger brother off your whole life
*  you would be good at jitsu.
*  Why?
*  Because you understand leverage, you understand patience, wait for the move, take some punishment,
*  move later, you know the deal.
*  You're also accustomed to being in battle all the time with your brother.
*  Hickson was a little brother to Holes.
*  Yeah.
*  Same thing.
*  Yeah and Horian.
*  Yeah Hickson is, he's such a unique guy because he was like the first guy that figured out
*  like that physical strength, yoga, all the gymnastic natural stuff that he did, flexibility.
*  Breathing.
*  Like yeah he was like a physical specimen on top of being super technical.
*  So he had like both things.
*  He had it all I think way before people knew.
*  Way before.
*  Like he knew the winning mindset and how to keep that mental edge with all the other things
*  and the fighting was just something that he grew up to do I think in my opinion, you know
*  what I mean?
*  Yeah he had that samurai mindset.
*  Yeah I'm telling you I think he like, I talk to a lot of people, I know some legendary
*  guys from the army right?
*  When he talks it's like this weird time vortex.
*  You ever talk to him like seriously?
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah I've had a couple podcasts with him.
*  Wow like it's incredible you know.
*  I went over his house once in like 2000 and him and his son and we were watching Colosseum.
*  So Colosseum was like the last time he fought when he fought Funaki and we were watching
*  all the different fights.
*  He had a tape of it and we were watching it.
*  He was breaking down all the things that all these guys were doing wrong.
*  It was such a fascinating education.
*  He was like there's too much space.
*  This right here, there's too much space.
*  And he goes, he had this philosophy.
*  Good accent by the way.
*  He goes we started at a neutral point.
*  We started at a neutral point.
*  If I get to one, I'm not going back to zero.
*  I'm going one to two to three to checkmate.
*  He goes I'm not going backwards.
*  He goes these guys, they lose position.
*  They go for here, go for there.
*  All this extra space.
*  And he was like breaking it down while we were watching the fights.
*  It was such an education.
*  Love that.
*  It was fucking amazing.
*  It was amazing.
*  Yeah, he's a legend.
*  Oh man, like one of the great legends of martial arts.
*  You know if you like go into the history of martial arts, Hickson Gracie will go down
*  as you know there's a Mount Rushmore of martial arts legends.
*  Him and Hoyce are right up there.
*  Yeah, I agree with that.
*  And Hoyce will tell you like Hickson, he goes my brother was a hundred times better than
*  me.
*  Well when Hoyce used to come to us, he would tell us straight up I'm not the family fighter.
*  I think what he told us back then was like I don't know Hickson was pride contracts.
*  UFC was different.
*  Couldn't figure it out.
*  That's why Hoyce even fought.
*  I thought that was kind of the deal back then.
*  Well I think, there was a bunch of different thoughts on it.
*  Hoyce jokes around.
*  He goes look how beautiful I am.
*  That's why they wanted me.
*  It was also because Hickson was very physically dominant.
*  And the idea was like let's have this guy that doesn't look physically impressive to
*  show Jiu Jitsu.
*  To show the power of Jiu Jitsu.
*  But if that doesn't work, then we bring in Hickson.
*  But obviously Hoyce beat everybody.
*  And then Hickson went over to do Japan Valley Tuto in like 94 I think it was.
*  I used to love all those.
*  The Valley Tuto's pride.
*  I thought that was the best.
*  The golden era of martial arts.
*  Because it's when everybody was learning.
*  Like holy shit there's so much out there.
*  Yeah I agree.
*  I loved every minute of that.
*  And then Fedor Emelianenko comes on the scene.
*  He's just like.
*  Fedor is my favorite.
*  One of the all time greats.
*  He's another one.
*  If there's the greatest heavyweight of all time, he's got to be in the conversation.
*  I feel like back in the day we'd be talking about fighting and it'd be like man I wonder
*  if anyone's ever done this from the mount.
*  Fedor won like six fights like that.
*  I wonder if anyone's ever done something like this and like well Fedor won his last fight
*  just like that.
*  And you're just like fucking this guy.
*  In his prime he was a monster.
*  And so stoic.
*  His expression never changed.
*  He gets head kicked.
*  He gets suplexed.
*  Nothing.
*  It's like no one's home in there.
*  He just didn't register.
*  He was just a machine.
*  I loved him.
*  I like when he, I seen an interview one time.
*  Remember his brother Alexander?
*  He was like Alexander is better than me if he just wouldn't party so much.
*  Yeah he was an animal.
*  And I was just thinking fucking Fedor saying his brother's better than him.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Well his brother was bigger and taller and was a nasty striker.
*  His brother was a vicious striker.
*  Had good kicks too.
*  Oh my god.
*  He was fucking good man.
*  But that was the days where everyone was just kind of figuring out what worked and what
*  didn't work.
*  Yeah you had Vanderlei the Axel.
*  Oh man.
*  It was also the time where everybody was juicy.
*  The whole organization was like, I had a friend who was going to fight over there and he was
*  170 pounds and they said no we want you to fight at 185.
*  Go do steroids.
*  Like go do steroids.
*  He was like what the fuck.
*  He was like they're telling us to do steroids.
*  When Ensign was on the podcast he told me in the contract it said like in capital letters
*  we do not test for steroids.
*  Go have fun.
*  Come back yoked up.
*  Come back juicy.
*  Everybody was juicy back then.
*  Because it was the wild days.
*  It was like the wild west.
*  They just wanted the best most exciting fights possible.
*  I think that's what people want now.
*  Oh yeah.
*  You know what I mean?
*  There's a real argument for that.
*  I don't think the fans give a fuck about drug testing.
*  You know I don't think, look, and I think this is for all, like the Olympics.
*  I get it.
*  But the NFL, like seriously why are you even fucking, why?
*  What do you test?
*  What do you want the sport to suck?
*  Like baseball.
*  That was the thing when they were doing like Mark McGuire and all that shit.
*  Yeah.
*  Sammy Sosa.
*  Why are you testing these guys?
*  It's the most exciting thing is to hit a home run.
*  These guys are doing something that makes them better at hitting home runs.
*  Everybody should do that thing.
*  Whatever the fuck that is.
*  Think about how much more money that bring those organizations.
*  Yeah.
*  But there was this thing back then that it was cheating.
*  But what it really is is science.
*  Like they figure out there's a way where you recover more, you get stronger, you get faster.
*  Like hey do that guys.
*  And by the way, everybody else is doing it too.
*  They're just like hiding it in some sort of a weird way.
*  You know, they're just masking it and taking weird stuff.
*  And there was, you know, that Balco scandal where they're all just taking his stuff called
*  the clear.
*  You never even heard of that?
*  You never heard of that?
*  No, I don't even know.
*  I had that guy, Victor Conte on the podcast who created the clear.
*  And what he, he's a scientist.
*  And what he did is he, Balco Labs, they figured out that when they're testing, they're testing
*  for very specific metabolites.
*  So they took steroids and then they changed it slightly so that it didn't show up in the
*  test and they're giving them the stuff and they would all pass clear.
*  And they were all fucking just monsters like Barry Bonds.
*  He was a monster.
*  I met Barry Bonds in 1994.
*  I was on this television show called Hardball and Barry Bonds was, you know, he was still
*  a major league player, a big time player.
*  Famous.
*  He's a regular guy.
*  Like you look like a regular athlete.
*  And then he started getting juicy.
*  And then years later he gained like 60 pounds and was just fucking smashing home runs.
*  That would be good.
*  Like you should keep doing that, whatever you're doing.
*  I think that's all sports.
*  Jump as high as you can.
*  Take your fucking gear, jump high, run far, smash each other.
*  Let's go.
*  Well, that's the enhanced games.
*  You know, the enhanced games doing that.
*  They're developing this whole protocol right now and the enhanced game is going to let
*  people do whatever the fuck they want that works.
*  And their idea is we are going to develop the best athletes in every discipline and
*  then we're going to give them a lot of money.
*  And we're going to like fuck the Olympics.
*  The Olympics is a giant scam because the Olympics, the athletes don't make any money.
*  And NBC and all these broadcast networks and the IOC, they're making billions of dollars
*  off the backs of these athletes hard work.
*  And no one is going to see them.
*  They're going to see the athletes.
*  The athletes aren't even compensated.
*  It's a crazy scam.
*  It really is because it's not like if no one made any money, including the networks, including
*  the IOC, great, great.
*  That's not the case.
*  Someone's making a fucking shit ton of money, but it's not the people that are putting in
*  the hard work.
*  It's the people that are pointing cameras at them.
*  It's the dumbest fucking thing of all time.
*  So the enhanced games is like, let's throw out the drug testing.
*  Let's encourage people to do whatever the fuck that works.
*  And let's give them a lot of money.
*  So whoever wins whatever they give them a million dollars.
*  And then you'll get like the elite athletes will be like, well, why am I wasting my time
*  competing for free?
*  Maybe I blow out an ACL or herniated disc and my career's over and I don't have shit
*  to show for it.
*  Or I can do steroids and then win and have money for the rest of my life.
*  I want to watch the steroids.
*  Of course.
*  You know what I mean?
*  The enhanced league or whatever it's called.
*  That sounds to me like the NFL is going away.
*  I want to see the mountain hit another mountain.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Let's go.
*  Can you imagine if they told the NFL, let's just say everybody get juicy?
*  Fuck.
*  Those guys are already freaks.
*  They're already doing it.
*  Probably.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I only imagine.
*  I don't know.
*  Have to be.
*  But my two cents is like, you're doing it anyway.
*  Just fucking go with it.
*  The way I understand it is they let them know when testing is happening.
*  Why even waste the fucking money?
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like phone it in.
*  Let's just phone that in.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like, yo, I took that drug test.
*  Okay, click.
*  Save some money for everybody.
*  The drug test should be multiple choice.
*  That's it.
*  You have to fill it out.
*  No, nothing.
*  Yeah.
*  The drug test should be, we're just kind of curious if you've had any success and we
*  want to know what works so we can recommend better stuff to people.
*  Right.
*  Weird thing about, you know, protecting the athletes health.
*  Like, hey, fuck face, they're playing football.
*  If you really cared about their health, you would tell them don't play football.
*  There's no way you care about their health.
*  There's no fucking way.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, it just doesn't make any sense.
*  I mean, there's inherent nature is a danger there.
*  Concussions, knees, shoulders, right?
*  Everything gets blown out.
*  How about vaccines?
*  How about you making them get vaccinated and they're having fucking heart attacks on the
*  field?
*  Does that make any sense?
*  No.
*  Those guys didn't have to worry for a second about COVID.
*  They're elite athletes of the highest order.
*  Do you really think that something that is literally only kills like 0.03% of the people
*  who get it and those people or most of them have comorbidities?
*  You really think elite athletes of the highest order had to worry about that?
*  Of course they didn't.
*  It's all bullshit.
*  You don't care about them.
*  Yeah.
*  Let them get juicy.
*  Yeah, fucking juice it up.
*  Let's go.
*  Get that gear.
*  I mean, hey, let's take those piss cups and turn them into fucking drink cups and serve
*  them some whiskey in the locker room.
*  Let's get this shit going.
*  And I want more fighting in my sports.
*  You know what I mean?
*  That's why I like hockey.
*  Yeah, I love hockey.
*  Hockey is the last sport that allows fistfights normally in the middle of a sport.
*  It's the only sport that allows the occasional fistfight.
*  Yeah.
*  Which is kind of crazy.
*  I live in North Carolina and there's like a little local hockey team at BRAC and like
*  I go to a lot of hockey games because it's like it was like seven bucks for like a long
*  time.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And they'll fucking blood on the ice on the Thanksgiving Day.
*  You know, they'll throw like they'll they'll have like a non league team come in and it's
*  fucking blood on the ice, man.
*  These like the Southern Provisional Hockey League.
*  I love this.
*  It's just wild that that's the only sport where fistfighting is allowed.
*  Yeah.
*  It's kind of crazy because it's grandfathered in.
*  Yeah.
*  It's basically bare knuckle boxing in the middle of a sport.
*  Yeah.
*  Which is real weird.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, then you got soccer where like, you know, you rubbed elbows with the guy and he
*  falls over.
*  Yeah.
*  And you're like, what the fuck?
*  You're faking it.
*  Like, yeah, I have children.
*  I know the faker.
*  What the fuck?
*  Like, I'm a parent.
*  You can't fool me.
*  Well, anybody could see it's the dumbest thing.
*  Like a hand.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, they fall on the ground and they're fucking holding their side.
*  They're holding their chest.
*  It's so dumb.
*  But it's also one of the reasons why it's not really accepted in America.
*  You watch that flopping.
*  We're like, come on, get up.
*  This is so crazy.
*  Yeah, I totally agree.
*  Especially when people watch football.
*  Yeah.
*  Watching guys get fucking waylaid.
*  Yeah.
*  300 pounds super athlete.
*  Yeah.
*  They get up and shake it off.
*  Yeah.
*  And then they're back on the field.
*  Yeah.
*  The guy's like adjust his helmet a little bit.
*  You know what I mean?
*  He takes his mouthpiece out.
*  You go, all right.
*  Good fucking move on.
*  I just started watching football literally this last year.
*  When I see guys collide, I've had so many injuries, knee surgeries and shit and jujitsu
*  injuries.
*  I see guys get hit.
*  I just like fucking hold my knees.
*  I hold my back.
*  It's the most brutal shit of all time.
*  A guy who's 290 pounds is running full blast and colliding with you with 100% of his strength.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's fucking crazy, man.
*  I used to, when I was 38, I was a SAR major in the army.
*  And I don't know, hand to hand, jujitsu kind of got boring for me.
*  So I was looking for other hobbies.
*  I was at the PX and I seen the Fort Bragg rugby team practices Tuesday at six or something.
*  So I just went out there for something to do, man.
*  And I'm going to tell you, you think fucking jujitsu fucks people up?
*  Fucking go play fucking rugby.
*  Matter of fact, stay the fuck away from rugby.
*  It's fucking brutal.
*  No helmets.
*  No nothing, man.
*  When I was a kid, I don't know if I can say this, but we played smear the queer all the
*  time.
*  I don't know what you call that, but that's what it was just called when we were kids.
*  I'd come home, my shirt would be ripped.
*  I'd get another beating because you ripped another shirt.
*  These are expensive.
*  You know what I mean?
*  But it's my brother's anyway, right?
*  Not like he bought me a shirt.
*  But man, it was crazy.
*  My first practice, the ball sitting there and one of the coaches is like, grab the ball
*  and run.
*  So I just fucking grabbed the ball and just ran every one of these little motherfuckers
*  And then like guys are like, man, what college you play in?
*  I was like, none.
*  I never played rugby a day in my life.
*  My first game was like fucking my third practice.
*  You know what I mean?
*  But in doing jujitsu and fighting people in Iraq every night, like I thought rugby was
*  kind of easy.
*  The guys running at me and I just got to take them down fucking double legs.
*  And then I started getting more tackles than any one of my coach.
*  They keep stats and be like, you had like 80 tackles a game.
*  How do you do that?
*  And it's like double, double, double leg take down, single leg, maybe a trip.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And then like one of the times, you know, one of the coaches was like, hey, will you
*  teach us how, you know, how would you, how do you normally tackle?
*  You get the most tackles and like double single legs.
*  So you basically teach them wrestling.
*  I just taught wrestling.
*  Why don't they teach them that?
*  That would seem to be like a good skill.
*  I bet the pro level fuckers are doing that.
*  They have to.
*  Like have to.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, cause thing about this, like, um, I know a lot of linemen, um, do like Cali
*  for hand speed and stuff like that.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Right.
*  Cause they got to win the hand fight.
*  So I know there's a lot of sports that use a lot of disciplines.
*  So I would imagine they would have to be fucking having, you know, wrestling practice or take
*  down tackle practice.
*  Right.
*  And they're doing the same shit as everyone else for just understanding leverage and how
*  to manipulate a body.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  Well, there's no pads.
*  So, you know, you can't come 30 miles an hour into this tackle.
*  You might have to come in at 10 miles an hour.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Cause you got no pads.
*  Right.
*  You know?
*  Well, that's the argument against pads in football is that these guys, the only reason
*  why they can play the way they are and collide with each other full blasts because they have
*  helmets and pads on.
*  Yeah.
*  I want thicker helmets and more collisions.
*  Let's go.
*  Come on.
*  It would be a wild game if you had American football and no pads.
*  I mean, that's what they used to do.
*  Way back.
*  They had those little leather.
*  Yeah.
*  They couldn't pay me to wear one of those.
*  Let's get the fuck out of here with that.
*  I wonder how many guys died playing that.
*  Oh, imagine how many concussions, how many head to head collisions, running full blasts.
*  And then, you know, if you're Samoan, you're like some big giant dude.
*  You're going to go head to head with guys because you know you're going to win it.
*  Yeah.
*  Fuck every time.
*  So you're just fucking headbutting everybody.
*  Yeah.
*  The army team has a lot of Tongans.
*  There's a Fort Bragg.
*  Tongans are paratroopers as people.
*  I don't know how that works, but they are, man.
*  They all play rugby.
*  A buddy of mine was like, I was like, you know, when you start playing rugby, he was
*  like, I was like three, you know, huge guy.
*  Like, I knew I was doing pretty good at rugby when the Tongans were like, we'd pick, they'd
*  pick teams and all the Tongans would be like, we want big John.
*  You can have the rest.
*  And I'd be like, yeah, me and the Tongans, I guess I'm right.
*  We'll fucking crush the people.
*  But like they start playing with like a coconut.
*  Jesus.
*  Imagine holding a coconut and just going down ribs on a coconut.
*  And I'm like, why would you play with a coconut?
*  And he was like, well, there was only one rugby ball on the island and the bigger boys
*  had it.
*  Jesus.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  But yeah, I played rugby for a while and I stopped doing MMA to play rugby.
*  But what I realized is rugby is way more injury prone and dangerous.
*  So I kind of went back to Jiu Jitsu.
*  Oh yeah.
*  One on one is definitely you can control a lot more of what's going on than a bunch of
*  dudes.
*  Yeah.
*  Colliding into each other.
*  Yeah, I agree, man.
*  So hard fucking sport.
*  I know rugby is awesome.
*  It is awesome.
*  It's weird how it never took off in America.
*  It's kind of strange, you know, because we love violence.
*  You would imagine that rugby would be something that we would have adopted.
*  I think the only reason it's not popular is because of the time.
*  Like it's like soccer.
*  Once it starts, it doesn't stop.
*  Americans want to go take a piss and get another beer and come back and then they want you
*  to have commercials.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the big thing about soccer.
*  And the game never stops.
*  Tough to sell commercials.
*  Right.
*  You can't stop the game.
*  Right.
*  Whereas football, you have a fucking, you have half time, bro.
*  You got a whole half hour.
*  Well, you ever see the apps that just show you the plays of football?
*  The whole game is like 12 minutes of actual work.
*  You know what I mean?
*  10 minutes.
*  Whereas soccer, those motherfuckers are running the entire time.
*  80 minutes, let's go.
*  And it doesn't stop.
*  You have to be in insane shape to play soccer.
*  The cardio is just nuts.
*  You're basically sprinting for the entire game.
*  I never played soccer, but I don't think I would enjoy it.
*  Well, we went to watch.
*  They have a professional league here in Austin and these dudes have these fucking quarter
*  horse legs.
*  They're like thin upper bodies and these fucking gigantized legs because they're just
*  constantly doing plyometrics.
*  They're just constantly sprinting and going side to side and left and right and fucking
*  crazy cardio.
*  But it's never going to sell in America if you can't have commercials.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that's why rugby's not popular.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, that makes sense.
*  Maybe they just changed the rules a little bit.
*  Right?
*  You know?
*  Give us a little break every seven minutes.
*  Well, it's kind of crazy.
*  The thing is rugby starts and stops without a time.
*  That's the same thing we want for you just said for MMA.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Right?
*  Well, that's the problem with MMA too, right?
*  You can't have a no time limit fight because...
*  How are you going to get the next fight at midnight or 10 o'clock?
*  Also, dudes would kind of fight to the death.
*  Like if you get the best of the best today where they're so evenly matched and they're
*  brawling for an hour.
*  It could go four hours, five hours.
*  And then it would probably end your career.
*  At the end of it, you might not ever be the same again.
*  You'd be spent.
*  You'd be spent.
*  You got one of those in you.
*  Right.
*  Because there's a lot of guys.
*  There's a fight and you could point to that fight and say, he was never the same.
*  Tony Ferguson, Justin Gaethje.
*  A lot of people point to that fight.
*  Justin Gaethje better Tony Ferguson so bad.
*  He was undefeated up until that point.
*  Or maybe he lost a couple of times.
*  But he was the boogeyman.
*  Tony Ferguson was the scariest dude in the sport.
*  And then one bad beating and he was kind of never the same again.
*  Because one bad beating just changes everything.
*  He just never really recovered.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, once you lose the mental edge, right?
*  There's a little bit of that, but there's also like a bad beating to the brain.
*  Like he got hit so many times in his head.
*  A bad beating to the brain after a certain, I mean, no matter who you are, if you're sparring
*  and if you're fighting, you're getting hit in the head.
*  Period.
*  So over the course of your career, you're already accumulating a certain amount of abuse
*  and there's one fight that could break the camel's back.
*  Yeah.
*  Like in boxing, I always point to Meldrick Taylor, Julio Cesar Chavez.
*  Like Meldrick Taylor was the fucking man, won the gold medal in the Olympics and Chavez
*  just methodically broke him down and then stopped him in the last round of their fight.
*  Like literally two seconds to go, Richard Steele stops the fight.
*  And from then on, he was never the same.
*  He took so much of a beating in that fight that he was never the same again.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that happens with soldiers too.
*  I've seen a lot of guys who are like, we got mortared or rocketed and then next deployment
*  guy doesn't want to, you know what I mean?
*  So it's a mental thing.
*  Yeah.
*  I think there's a time where everybody says enough's enough, right?
*  Like whether you want to or not.
*  And then once you reach that point, like coming back from that point to become that mental
*  champion again, it's a fucking long road.
*  Is there anything like you as a leader, when you see a guy who's maybe crossed over in
*  that way, is there anything that you would do to try to bring them back or is there nothing
*  that can be done?
*  That's a great question.
*  Define bring them back.
*  Define what's wrong with them.
*  Right.
*  I guess a confidence thing or just being terrified.
*  So like new fear being introduced.
*  You know, a lot of guys think they're indestructible until they're not.
*  And then all of a sudden now this is a new factor.
*  Yeah.
*  I used to teach tandem jumping and bundle jumping in the military.
*  And I don't know if you ever see my social media, but like I'm in the sky flying and
*  there's that huge barrel under me.
*  I used to teach that.
*  And what would happen is if you had a bad jump, a bundle jump, you would have to cut
*  away.
*  We called it the nightmare.
*  And you got to end the nightmare.
*  And this thing starts spinning you out of control.
*  It'll be so many G's that like you'll pass out.
*  The parachute will open later.
*  You'll be fine.
*  But we used to tell guys, like fucking end that nightmare.
*  Make sense?
*  Now you're the captain of the ship.
*  So a guy would have to end this nightmare, however he ended the nightmare.
*  And then what would happen is afterwards we'd review the video and I'd have to show a guy.
*  And then we'd leave him in the classroom for a minute and we'd tell him, hey, gather your
*  emotions, whatever you need to do, and then get on the next plane.
*  Get right back on the horse.
*  Get fucking back on that next plane.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And guys would do that.
*  You know what I mean?
*  A lot more SEALs needed that time than like unit guys.
*  Because unit guys are like, yo, I'll fly this motherfucker up your ass.
*  We ain't going to have no problems today, son.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I don't know.
*  I think the difference is that the unit is always more mature than SEALs.
*  It's an older culture.
*  It's older guys, more experienced guys, more methodical guys, more planned out.
*  So like in a lot of times, like, you know, younger guys, normally the SEALs, they'll
*  have their jump numbers, but they're like their core.
*  What makes you you?
*  Confidence, dexterity, strength, fucking health.
*  It ain't there yet.
*  And they kind of freak out once in a while.
*  Younger guys.
*  It's a maturity thing, I think.
*  Normally happens at the SEALs.
*  Most unit guys are pretty mature and have been through so much shit by the time they
*  get to the unit that like you're probably unshakable by then.
*  But you see that in fights too, like young, undefeated guys who fight like a world champion
*  who's like in their 30s and that guy breaks them down.
*  And then you see like they don't know what to do when things are going sideways and mentally
*  they fall apart.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.
*  That's when the bad decisions will start.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And the reality is, is you got to snap your fucking self out of that.
*  You got to fucking put your parachute back on and get the fuck back on that airplane.
*  I had plenty of those jumps.
*  I've cut away more.
*  Fuck, I had a cutaway training for D-Day last year.
*  I fucking put my cutaway.
*  You can see how fucking low I am and everything.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And I have procedures.
*  I have another parachute.
*  Like we're all going to die.
*  Am I going to let it ruin my day kind of thing?
*  Like let's fucking move on.
*  You know what I mean?
*  But how did you develop that mentality just over time?
*  I think that comes with what I just said is the core of a person.
*  And I think this is what the Army is really good at is developing this core, right?
*  In this core.
*  In this core, right?
*  How do I develop your confidence?
*  Well, I don't fucking know.
*  I couldn't even define fucking confidence because I went to Chicago Public fucking school
*  system but I could tell you this.
*  If I taught you to rally race car drive and you got pretty fucking good at it.
*  If I taught you jiu jitsu, eventually you're pretty fucking good at it.
*  I show you skydiving.
*  Eventually you're pretty fucking good at it.
*  Right?
*  Why?
*  Because every one of these things I showed you world class level.
*  And we brought world champions in to show you, right?
*  Eventually you're going to gain confidence.
*  It's the taking your daughter to karate or little kids to jiu jitsu.
*  They have confidence that other kids don't have.
*  Right?
*  That's what you got to build.
*  So it takes a lot of different skills and getting guys good at a lot of different skills
*  to build that fucking unshakable core.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Yeah.
*  It's a matter of when do you introduce them to extreme adversity?
*  Do you build them up slowly?
*  Right.
*  And it has to be built slowly.
*  And then we used to say this like aircraft training.
*  Let's say you got a breaching airplane.
*  And you got to climb a fucking 20 foot ladder because these motherfuckers ain't low to the
*  ground.
*  And you're hanging on a ladder and you weigh fucking 280 pounds and you're shit.
*  But you're on these fucking ladders with fucking six other guys who all weigh the same as you
*  or more.
*  You got to crack the door, get the fuck in this airplane.
*  Right?
*  Now, let's just say this is your first time and you crack that door the first time.
*  And as an instructor, I know you're cracking the door.
*  And as soon as you crack that door, I fucking shoot you in the face.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Yeah.
*  How fucking embarrassing.
*  And then the reality is, yo, you just move ruin this motherfucker forever.
*  How do you breach an airplane?
*  What's the successful protocol for breaching an airplane?
*  Mechanical or explosive?
*  What do you mean?
*  Sometimes we open doors, sometimes we blow doors.
*  It depends.
*  So which one you want to know about?
*  Okay, let's go with mechanical.
*  Yeah.
*  Most doors have a lever on the outside that can be activated.
*  And most doors, there's a certain way they open.
*  Right?
*  My team, I was always kind of like a primary door guy.
*  And then there's a certain way doors open, there's latches.
*  So all airplane doors open from the outside.
*  So but once you breach it though, you're in a tube.
*  You're in a tube.
*  And everybody knows where the door is.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a very vulnerable position.
*  Yes.
*  So what's the protocol for breaching a door when you're in a tube like that?
*  So what you have to do is breach as many doors as possible and get as many people in as possible,
*  as quick as possible.
*  And everyone goes to positions, right?
*  You got cover guys, you got runners, you got searchers.
*  There's a lot of shit that needs to go on on these fucking aircraft.
*  Same with a fucking big cruise liner, right?
*  So everybody's gonna, once the door is open, everyone's gonna flood in and kind of like
*  go to their places.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Right.
*  So you plan it out, you know where you're gonna be.
*  And then you're still dealing with the chaos of you're in a tube and there's only one way
*  in and things are coming at you no matter what.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So there's no clean way to do that.
*  Not even once.
*  Not even once.
*  Not even once.
*  Fuck no man.
*  You know what I mean?
*  What a crazy fucking task.
*  I know.
*  But the back to the point is if a guy cracks that door, any door, let's say it's your first
*  time I'm showing you like, all right Joe, I'm gonna show you some close quarter battle.
*  I'm gonna show you how to clear a door and then just joking around like you're about
*  to go through a door and I shot you in the fucking forehead.
*  You would mentally never want to go through that door again, right?
*  So I have to build you up.
*  I have to build you up to where well the first time you come through the door, why don't
*  I just let you come through the door?
*  Right.
*  And then it builds from there.
*  Got it.
*  And then there's a point where it's like, oh this motherfucker shooting through the crack
*  of the airplane.
*  Wait till I'm in this fucking bitch.
*  I got two pistols on me.
*  This motherfucker's going down.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Yeah.
*  So as your confidence, your core, that core of a human being, like that core of an operator,
*  right, as that like becomes fucking concrete, a guy's just unshakable.
*  Like let's go.
*  I don't give a fuck what this position.
*  I don't care.
*  Like I don't care if I fucking die.
*  Let's do this, you know?
*  And it's consistent training over and over and over and over and over.
*  Do you think that this is what's missing in the police force?
*  Oh man, are you kidding me?
*  First off, I work in a lot of police departments.
*  I love police.
*  I support police all the time.
*  It's a fucking thankless job.
*  I'll say that.
*  Yeah.
*  But I would say like, think about this, Joe, if you trained police better, right?
*  I work at a lot of police academies.
*  I've helped a lot of police academies.
*  They don't fail people anymore.
*  I show them what I do.
*  I train them to do what I do.
*  They have great success with it.
*  I would say this in a police academy.
*  Let's say it's six months long, whatever they do.
*  I don't fucking know.
*  Probably about four months of that is fucking paperwork.
*  And then, you know, you get a little hand to hand.
*  You get a little driving.
*  You get a little shooting.
*  And then you learn what?
*  Yeah.
*  But I'm going to tell you this.
*  As a cop, you got the rest of your life to do that paperwork.
*  And when you're in training, right, as soon as you like get your first arrest,
*  your training officer is going to be like, don't write it that way.
*  Hold on. Let me see your paperwork like this.
*  The paperwork could be OJT and they could spend them time, right, training these guys.
*  And if no, I'd also say this is if police were trained better and truly uniform
*  officers are probably the only guys like stopping crime as it happens,
*  if we train those guys better, why would we need SWAT teams?
*  Right. You would have SWAT teams through the whole thing.
*  Everyone could be SWAT.
*  And if we got 10 and 10 of us come together, we're our own SWAT team.
*  And then we could operate independently.
*  We could operate one or two.
*  And I think police don't do the force multiplier thing.
*  Each guy is his own fucking bastion of the law.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I just think they kind of share injuries.
*  They don't do hand-to-hand, right?
*  Shooting could be dangerous, right?
*  And then most shooting is the instructor is God and you are fucking stupid.
*  That's how most training is.
*  It's like basic training.
*  And no one learns well like that either.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Right.
*  Yeah, I'm always shocked when I see fat cops.
*  Like really fat cops.
*  And I'm just like how?
*  Your whole life is your body.
*  Like your whole life is you have to be able to physically defend yourself.
*  You have weapons.
*  You have the law and the uniform and bulletproof vest and all that.
*  But your physical body is almost useless.
*  Yeah.
*  I was at a football game the other day and there's this like obese cop, like enormous belly.
*  I was like this is disgusting.
*  It's ridiculous.
*  Yeah.
*  You've let yourself get to this point where I know you can't even run.
*  You can't last 30 seconds.
*  All someone has to do is grab ahold of your arm that you would use to take your gun and control that arm, get you to the ground, and you're fucked.
*  Shit, I just baseball collar the back of their fucking collar, their shirt.
*  Where the fuck are you going?
*  It's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Look.
*  Okay.
*  First off, I think also police should have different jobs like the Army.
*  So, okay, if you were 400 pounds, maybe you're the computer guy at the police force or a desk guy or you know what I mean?
*  Right.
*  I don't think everyone needs to be the fittest human being ever.
*  However, if you're on patrol, get the young six foot kids in there, man.
*  You know what I mean?
*  They can handle themselves.
*  They're young.
*  They're bigger than normal, right?
*  This is why a lot of troopers, state troopers used to have like a six foot, six one, six two height requirement because a six foot two man can generally handle most people.
*  Right.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Especially a fit one who's trained.
*  Yeah.
*  So I think the fit guys need to be on the force.
*  I think there's room for everybody.
*  But I think with police is your police officer or your detective and then that's it.
*  But really, you're always a cop versus like, well, the Army, right?
*  Okay.
*  There's drone pilots.
*  There's all these Army jobs that kick the infantry kids out the door.
*  Right.
*  Why don't police kind of organize like that?
*  And that way, like the guys are going to run people down can run.
*  That's what drives me crazy about this whole defund the police horse shit.
*  Like, are you fucking crazy?
*  You should be funding them more fucking crime is real.
*  Yeah, it's real.
*  Evil is real.
*  Evil is fucking real.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  To pretend it's not.
*  Well, that just means you haven't experienced it.
*  Yeah.
*  You're living with blinders on.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I say I agree.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just bizarre that we expect these people to encounter danger and evil all day long, their whole lives, like 25, 30 years.
*  And, you know, you don't you don't train them properly.
*  You don't fund them properly.
*  And then they get disrespected by the public.
*  Oh, that's the worst.
*  The worst.
*  I think the worst is when like the mayor or the police fucking chief is like not supportive of all of the fucking guys.
*  And it's like you think the guys have bad intent.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I get it.
*  There might be bad apples or whatever.
*  Everyone's got 10 percent say what you want.
*  But like Kamala Harris, when she was running for president, she was all about defund the police.
*  I don't know how that sells with anybody.
*  I mean, it's fucking crazy.
*  It's a crazy thing to say.
*  It really is a crazy thing to say.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  I mean, if we defunded the police, we'd be Mexico quicker than we thought.
*  Yeah. Right. Right.
*  Because the cartels would just drive over the border.
*  Yeah. That's real.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  What do you think about this idea of using special forces guys to fight the cartels?
*  First and foremost, like if you were like, yo, we're going to wipe out a cartel tonight.
*  I'd have been like, I'll load my frags extra careful.
*  Like, let's go. Right.
*  But the reality is, is like, I know all my buddies are like, yeah, we'll fuck them up in a night.
*  We'll fucking, you know, you know, fucking let's back up a fucking second here.
*  The cartels have fucking men.
*  They own the ground.
*  They have fucking technicals.
*  They have machine guns.
*  They have fucking everything an army has.
*  Right.
*  And they've had decades to train waiting for this.
*  Number two and number three, our government's fucking compromised.
*  So if you think they ain't going to know you're coming, you know what I mean?
*  I think you're fucking high.
*  Jesus Christ. That's a terrible, terrifying thought.
*  So government so compromised, the cartels going to get the word out before.
*  Well, how are we going to look?
*  We're not going to be in fucking sneaky.
*  We're not the Israelis doing that fucking pager shit.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  That pager shit was wild.
*  Yo, that needs to be the model for every fucking thing we do in the future.
*  No matter what you think about the Israelis, what's going on in Gaza, that pager shit was wild.
*  Which tells me America should go back to making its own fucking cell phones and its own.
*  We shouldn't have our fucking comms made overseas at all in any way, shape or form, in my opinion.
*  No, I've been saying that forever.
*  We should have our own cell phones.
*  Fuck.
*  And the fact that we're buying so much shit from China.
*  Fuck.
*  Especially after they banned Huawei because they know that Huawei stuff was compromised
*  and they're having third party input and be able to spy on people.
*  It's fucking crazy.
*  Well, this is why we got to go back to making America like it used to be.
*  We made our own shit. We use our own shit.
*  We wouldn't have to worry about none of this.
*  Yeah. It's a very strange thing what's happening in this country where China is allowed to buy land that's near military bases.
*  They supply cell phone towers.
*  They put all these different, they sell us all this different shit.
*  And we don't really know.
*  I mean, I don't know how many experts are investigating these fucking cell phone towers.
*  Fucking zero. I bet fucking zero.
*  Mike Baker was on here and he was telling me about how around military bases like China has installed their equipment and all these military bases.
*  Like at Formula One, where we were, my buddy owns the track.
*  And they found these Chinese boxes that they had attached to the Wi-Fi.
*  So they were just scooping up everybody's data.
*  They called in Homeland Security to have them remove it and investigate it.
*  A fucking racetrack.
*  A racetrack. But they knew everybody was going to be using this public Wi-Fi.
*  Probably no VPNs, probably no security.
*  And these people are getting all their shit siphoned up.
*  Fuck.
*  They're so sophisticated in how they've infiltrated. It's fucking crazy.
*  And we just allow it to happen.
*  It's very strange because you can't buy shit in China.
*  If you think you're an American company going to go over to China and operate with autonomy, you're out of your fucking mind.
*  You can't buy shit.
*  They'll never let an American.
*  Never.
*  No, they don't want a Chinese would never buy communication devices from America.
*  No. And they certainly never let America buy farmland right next to their military bases.
*  They'd be like, fuck you.
*  We're like, sure, we'll sell it to you. Are you going to pay more?
*  Oh boy. We'll take your money.
*  It's weird. It's weird how goofy we are.
*  I know. And then like, well, I think it's this, Joe.
*  I think people don't realize how fucking dangerous the rest of the world is and how like people are like plotting against us.
*  And it's fucking real out there. The world is a crazy place.
*  I say this like you don't know how fucking safe you got it here and how fucking great we got it here.
*  You know what I mean?
*  People don't know that because they don't never leave here.
*  So they're stuck in their own fucking bad attitude of like their own grind or whatever the fuck they do.
*  And like, look, I'm telling you, the world is fucking evil.
*  People will fucking rape you, kill you.
*  No one gives a fuck.
*  Like, protect yourself all the time.
*  When you've been to parts of the world where you've seen this firsthand.
*  And I think it's one of those things where if you don't see it, you don't believe it.
*  Yeah, I'll tell you one of the I think the biggest thing I saw in Iraq, I think in maybe 2009 ish,
*  there was like the most fucking U.S. soldiers ever been in Iraq.
*  Right. Like whatever the numbers are, I don't fucking know.
*  Right. But when Iraq had the most fucking soldiers that has ever had in Iraq is when Iraq was the safest.
*  Think about it.
*  You know what I mean?
*  All we had to do was flood, put a fucking tank under every fucking overpass in every fucking neighborhood.
*  There's a machine gun and fucking 50 cal Humvee.
*  Right. Like who's fucking around?
*  They're everywhere.
*  And that's the safest Iraq ever was.
*  I'm telling you, we have that here and people don't understand that in general.
*  So if you wanted to fund the police, fuck man, we're fucked.
*  You know what I mean? Yeah.
*  Like it's a crazy but you know, do you know Evan, Evan Hafer? Yes.
*  Yeah. Evan was we were in elk camp and he was explaining some of the shit that he saw when he went from Iraq to Afghanistan.
*  Yeah. Just how he's like Afghanistan is so fucked that you can't even comprehend it until you're there.
*  Yeah. He goes once you're there and you see it and you understand it, you become so cynical.
*  You're almost like this culture is like unfixable.
*  And he's like most people just don't know that a place like that exists.
*  That's so just down to its core.
*  So fucked.
*  We was talking about how these guys have these boys that they have as their harem.
*  The number nine boy.
*  What's that?
*  So the Egyptian Special Forces called him the number nine boy.
*  He's the boy that gets fucked.
*  Why number nine?
*  I don't know.
*  That's what the Egyptian Special Forces call.
*  But every Afghanistan village had a fucking what do they call it?
*  The chogi boy or fucking something like that.
*  But basically the 12 year old gets raped.
*  He was saying these guys have harems and they would parade them down the street to show they have the most boys.
*  Yeah. This was this happened to me on my.
*  So I did a solo mission in Afghanistan.
*  The book Kill Bin Laden.
*  You ever hear of it?
*  Yeah.
*  I brought a hardback for you.
*  I'll sign it for you if you want.
*  But it's hard to get a hardback.
*  It's like it's like it's got library shit in it.
*  I had to buy it because like people always ask me to sign it.
*  I didn't write the book.
*  I'm just in it.
*  And people always ask me for a signature on it.
*  Right.
*  So I bought like I don't know family or friends.
*  I bought like a lot from a library.
*  They didn't use them no more because they don't sell the hardbacks no more.
*  But I went out on a mission alone in Afghanistan.
*  I was gone 10 days first.
*  I think for a successful mission of the war.
*  My opinion.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know if there's other missions were more successful than mine.
*  But so I went out alone and then I went out and I bought a hardback.
*  I went out alone and then I do the recon.
*  I have the footage I need.
*  I have every fucking thing I need to launch a raid.
*  We I'm alone.
*  We stop.
*  I'm in a fucking jingly truck.
*  Right.
*  Like I fucking just I'm in this truck hitchhiked basically from Jalalabad into the Toribor mountains.
*  I'm in a jingly truck with this fucking driver.
*  What's a jingly truck?
*  You know where they like it's like a fucking like a six wheel like dump truck.
*  They hang the chains and bells and they paint it like 17 different bright colors and they you never seen a jing.
*  Yeah.
*  Fucking jingly truck because it fucking jingles man.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  The fuck is that.
*  Yeah.
*  So I'm in one of these motherfuckers with this motherfucker right.
*  He's like a logger.
*  He runs the valley.
*  He's always in the area.
*  But like I don't know any of this fucking.
*  I can't even talk to the guy.
*  I don't fucking speak shit.
*  You know what I mean.
*  And then like it's fucking dangerous.
*  I had to go through checkpoints.
*  I had to act like a retard to get through a fucking checkpoint.
*  What did you do?
*  I was at a fucking checkpoint and the dude was like there's this fucking the checkpoints in Afghanistan.
*  They're fucking sketch.
*  You know they got like one piece of yarn across the road.
*  You better fucking stop or you will be shot.
*  They don't give a fuck about you.
*  And like so the car in front of us I think the fucking like this dude like stole bread from a little kid.
*  You know what I mean.
*  Little kid was eating a piece of bread.
*  He just snatched it out of the fucking car yelled at the people.
*  I thought he was going to shwack him because I didn't have anything to give him that he wanted.
*  So I'm in this jingly truck comes next fucking AK in the chest.
*  I don't know what the fuck he's saying right.
*  But I know if I speak English I'm dead.
*  So not an option.
*  So he's like yelling at me right.
*  And then finally I just figured I'm going to do like volume level 12 and just fucking yell in his face right.
*  So I just get super close to his face which he didn't like.
*  And I'm like no no no no no.
*  And the guy's like what the fuck.
*  And then like backed up and then motion like motion like get the fuck through here with AK.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  So what you just on the spot.
*  Yeah.
*  Another one I had I picked up like a dirty towel or blanket off the floor and they took that right.
*  But what I learned being out alone one of the things I learned is you know you like you watch the movies and like they pull out a wad of cash and they're like I wink.
*  Get me across the border there friend.
*  These motherfuckers just shoot you in the face and take everything you got.
*  Don't whip that shit out.
*  You're going to get murdered.
*  They're going to take it all.
*  I mean they'll steal bread from a fucking kid you think they give a fuck about your life.
*  You know what I mean.
*  And they just fucking throw you on the side of the road and let you rot like they don't even care about the smell like.
*  So like yeah I had to act like a retard through this one man.
*  They don't give a fuck man.
*  I don't even think you just figured that on the spot on the spot.
*  Yeah.
*  So we get I get in the truck.
*  We do the recon.
*  I like had a literally I had a cigarette bag.
*  I think it's like Kent or some shit.
*  I don't fucking smoke but like Kent cigarettes.
*  I had a plastic bag with my fucking sat phone.
*  And anyway I had to get a camera out get it under my arm and I kind of film the house right.
*  U.S. eyes on and then I had to get the footage back.
*  So we get to the end of the valley.
*  It's fucking dark.
*  You know there's no way we can get out of the valley before light.
*  So we stop at this house and the drivers like you know motion us in right.
*  It's the Muslim right of they can't turn you away right.
*  So we go to this house.
*  We're in the room bunch of old fucking grumpy men.
*  They don't fucking like me at all.
*  And the driver and the driver I guess goes there and crashes all the time when he's in the valley right.
*  So this is normal for him to be here.
*  And then so in that room they had like this boy and they fucking drug him into another room and you could hear yelling and shit.
*  And I was just like what the fuck do you do.
*  I have everything I need to pull off the first successful mission in Afghanistan for the American government.
*  OK.
*  Do I save this kid and compromise my mission or do I just get the fuck out of here and pull this motherfucker off.
*  And the reality is I had to look the other way and I like it.
*  So I took my speed you know they give you speed.
*  I took my speed stayed up everyone went to bed.
*  They fed me dark opium tea.
*  They tried to put me down.
*  That's why I drank the tea anyway knowing it was spiked.
*  And then I took my speed to kind of counteract it.
*  And then everyone went to bed.
*  I laid there just wide awake.
*  I laid there wide awake like I fucking shut an eye.
*  These motherfuckers are going to cut my dick off and stick it in my mouth because it seems like what they like to do.
*  And then finally the middle of the night I fucking fucking got my AK.
*  I stuck it in the driver's face.
*  I drug him out to the truck like right before sunup and we fucking left the valley.
*  But like you know compromise the mission or save the kid.
*  What do you want.
*  What's it going to be man.
*  And then like you just see this all over the place.
*  So you you were like one of the first guys to do these Singleton missions.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So when when they set you off to do something like that like what's the protocol like how do they how do they even.
*  Good luck.
*  You know what I mean.
*  I don't know.
*  Like what do you think.
*  What do they say well back then it was that guy Dalton fury right.
*  The guy who wrote Kill Me Lodden was my commander and OK it's a long story.
*  I wrote I'm writing a book.
*  It's finished.
*  Maybe someone would want to publish it but it's called The Singleton and it's about my going out alone.
*  and it's about my going out alone. But I was like, they see I was, I was at my base, I was in a
*  sodabad and we were just getting rocketed and mortared every day. It's kind of like mortar,
*  bait, whatever. And then we had like fucking zero lickies and chewies, no fucking candy,
*  no beef jerky, no fucking pop tarts, no fucking nothing, right? And we're just sucking it up and
*  I got to eat fucking these Afghan motherfuckers cook us food and I'm eating vegetables. I don't
*  even know what the fuck that vegetable was. I don't even recognize it as a vegetable.
*  You know what I mean? Yeah, I know that's fucking goat because it tastes horrible,
*  but I don't even know what the fuck they cook me. You know what I mean? It's like,
*  anyway. So I go to my boss and I'm like, yo, hey, I want to fucking go to the main base,
*  right? And steal Pogi from the fucking chow hall. What's Pogi? Pogi bait is a term for
*  beef jerky, snacks, candy, cookies, any kind of snack food, right? And my boss is like,
*  yeah, if you schedule the airplanes, you make all the coordinations, you can go. And I was like,
*  fucking bet, man. I fucking scheduled the helicopter. Like motherfuckers, you don't know
*  how resourceful I can be. You know what I mean? So I scheduled everything for the next night and
*  then I drove my, I had a red Toyota truck. I drove my Toyota truck in the back of the Chinook,
*  right? So tight in there. You can't even get out. You got to just sit there, hope you ain't got to
*  piss. They fly me to the main base, fucking land, driving the main base. By this time, the army's
*  taking over where you got to fucking salute on fucking the army base in Afghanistan. Two weeks
*  ago, like a fucking SAS guy lost a leg in a landmine, you know? But so I go to the base and
*  then the commander sees me and he's with his sergeant major, another guy, and they're like,
*  this is our fucking guy right here. So like, Hey, what are you doing? And I'm like,
*  about to raid the chow hall. Like, what the fuck does it look like I'm doing? You know what I mean?
*  Like, if it's one thing, I'm honest, right? So I was like, yeah, I'm getting Pogi for the fucking
*  for our base. Like, what's up? And they're like, Hey, we got a mission for you. And I told them,
*  Hey, I'll do it. Right. But you just got to tell my ask my boss if it's all right,
*  because I didn't work for these guys. And they're like, Okay, cool. They're in my squadron, but like
*  not my direct boss, right. So they call my boss, my boss says fine. And like, they sit me in this
*  room. And they're like, Hey, we want you to go out alone. And I'm like, Okay. And they're like,
*  explain everything to me. We want you to go out alone. Like, do you have any questions? And I was
*  like, Mike, my only question was, and it wasn't a question. I looked the commander in the eye,
*  and I said, Tell me you're going to cover my ass if something goes wrong. And he was like,
*  Oh, yeah, we'll cover you like, yo, you could have gave a fucking better and man up with that
*  answer. You know what I mean? Like, you know what I mean? He gives us like weak answer. And I'm just
*  thinking, well, fuck man, you know what I mean? Now, so what were they telling you they wanted you
*  to do? Go out alone, us eyes on, get footage of this guy at his house, so we could launch right,
*  because the generals back then weren't in line with bushes, dead or alive. And they were,
*  I believe the Pentagon was a bigger hindrance in the beginning of war than they were fucking
*  than they were worth. But how so? Well, the general at the time that was in charge of us,
*  our task force, right, and we're talking about tier one, like, the guy in charge then had like
*  two rules. Number one, you can leave the wire if you get us eyes on a target. Okay. Okay. And number
*  two, no one leaves the wire. Well, how the fuck are we going to do number one without if we can't
*  leave? Figure it out. So the commander, I was because I was when you say leave the wire,
*  what do you mean exactly? Like go out hunting for bad guys, leave your base, you know what I'm saying,
*  go out and you can't leave your base, but you can leave the base. But you got to get these eyes on
*  to launch a target. So you got to get your recon guys out there doing reconnaissance because we
*  need these reconnaissance and us eyes on to hit these targets. Okay, we want to launch reconnaissance.
*  Yeah, no one leaves the wire. That's kind of how it worked, man. Right. So the reason they use me is
*  according to the army, the army at every level is great at accountability. 100%. We need to know
*  where everyone is at all times. Right. So when I flew to the other base, I was in transit. Right.
*  So they left me in transit for a week. So instead of saying I left the wire, I was just in transit
*  because I was in transit anyway to go get pop tarts. Wow. So they lied to everybody left me
*  my stat and I didn't know this at the time. I like, like this could have mattered less to me. I
*  learned later, you know, but they paperwork nutshelled the general and sent out reconnaissance and
*  that was me. Wow. And then they came back with the eyes on and the general agreed to launch the
*  mission. And it was a success. And no one asked how the fuck did someone leave the wire because
*  no one cared because we were successful. You know what I mean? Wow. So what are you thinking when
*  you're out there doing this? Like what is going through your head when you agree to do this?
*  Fuck, figure it the fuck out. I don't fucking know. I'm not trying to have anything in my head.
*  Right. That's what's crazy is like, they just let you figure it out. Yeah. So you have to feel very
*  vulnerable. I don't know. I wouldn't say vulnerable, Joe, but I do think this is like, there's guys that
*  like fucking make it happen. You probably got guys like this. Any task you give a guy is just like,
*  wait, you're done with that already? Like some people can just make shit happen. And then
*  I'm one of those guys. That's like my one of my better qualities, make it happen. So like,
*  fucking go make it happen. Motherfucker. Go act like a retard when you get pulled over.
*  And do what you got to do, baby. Like fucking survival of the fittest.
*  So the problem is, once you do one of these, now you're the guy that can go do these things.
*  Yeah. And I did hundreds in Iraq and fucking loved it. Yeah. You loved it.
*  I love being alone, man. Fuck that. Yo, you, you, okay. Think about this, Joe. And you do jiu jitsu
*  when you fight, right? You want to depend on yourself or you want to depend on yourself and
*  people you don't know what the fuck they're made of. Who the fuck are you going to trust?
*  Don't trust yourself. Right. So it wasn't really a big stretch for me to be alone.
*  You know what I'm saying? Yeah, I do. But it's still a very unusual mindset.
*  Yeah, maybe. I don't know. And then my other mindset is like, no matter where I am,
*  no matter what I do, everyone in a 25 yard radius is going to fucking die.
*  Just so I can make it home. And if I had to kill everyone in the whole village, goddamn right,
*  everyone in that fucking village would be dead for me to come home. So I just figured, yo,
*  fucking be ready to fight at all times. I learned 100 to one lessons learned leadership
*  lessons, 100 to one being alone versus being a pack of 30 motherfuckers. Right. Like, yo,
*  let us come ram this down your fucking throat and we'll call it Tuesday. You know what I mean?
*  Where when I was alone, like, you got to make better decisions. You're a fucking coyote. You're
*  a ghost. You know, you got to make ghost decisions. The fucking, you know, the bravado, like we're
*  going to kill everybody the fuck we are. We're not going to fire a shot. Why? Because like,
*  you fire one shot as a singleton, you better be ready to kill everybody. Because gunshots is a
*  fucking dinner bell for psychos. You know what I mean? So are you ready? You know what I mean?
*  And the reality is, is like, I had to think of other shit, do other shit, had to act like a retard,
*  you know, and I had to get along with people. I had to, I had to do so much shit that is out of
*  like even the commando norm as a singleton, you know, I think about no one that can really teach
*  you this. Fuck. I mean, no, like, I don't fucking know. You can teach a guy how to breach an airplane.
*  Right. How the fuck are you going to teach a guy to act like a retard if you get pulled over? How
*  are you going to teach a guy to be a singleton and do a hundred of these missions? Well, we used to
*  tell guys, I used to tell my guys all the time, and this is a unit thing, but like, I could train
*  a monkey to shoot. I'm training you to think, I don't care about the shooting because if you're
*  thinking right, the shooting will be easy. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. But yeah, man,
*  I'll tell you, I thought about writing a leadership book, calling it the singleton and just kind of
*  the lessons I learned, you know, like so few guys have done that, you know, like I see all these,
*  like, you know, I don't know, I don't look at the internet. I don't watch the news. I don't do any
*  of that. I don't do social media. I have it. I don't fucking look at it. I don't have it on my
*  phone. It's not worth my sanity. So I'm like a fucking time capsule for fucking the 2000s.
*  You know what I mean? And like, I never understood some of these other like veteran stories.
*  You know, I never, I never kind of look at the lone survivor. I never understood the full story
*  because I went out alone all the time. That shit didn't happen to me. Motherfucking seven Taliban
*  on my ass. You want to see seven fucking bodies super quick. You know what I'm saying? Bring them
*  boys up here. You know, so I never really fucking understood some of these other stories
*  because I had such a different experience. I can't fathom if I was with five, you know,
*  the times I was with five guys, you know how many people I was with three guys, you know,
*  how many people we killed in the Battle of Tora Bora fucking hundreds. I just stopped counting on
*  my first day. Like, so having said that, like I don't understand some of these stories because
*  I had the experience I had, you know what I'm saying? It's a very unusual experience.
*  So like how many guys were singletons? Fuck, I don't know any. You don't know any. I mean,
*  a couple of my buddies, but like not like me. Wow. Yeah. And then once I did it, it was kind of my
*  lot in life. How many pages is this book that you wrote? I don't know, like fucking 20 chapters.
*  I wrote a big book. It seems like it'd have to be 500 fucking pages. Yeah. So I can't wait to read
*  that book. Shameless plug if you know anybody who buys books. Someone needs to buy that book. 100%.
*  Yeah, we'll get that book sold. All right. We'll get that book sold. 100%. So that leads me. I need
*  to read that book right now. I'll give it to you. I'll text it to you. I'll text it to you. For real.
*  I'll text it to you. I'm done with it. Okay. I think it's as good as I could get it.
*  And I'm just a regular, I'm in Chicago public school system. Fuck. I didn't even take a book
*  home because if the school loses the books, they can't teach. So it was like half, half my class was
*  in the book and the other half was homework and he left the books in class. So like I didn't have
*  homework. You know, it's probably better because you're going to get it like from you with no
*  gloss. Yeah. No bullshit. But which leads me to Iraq where I did hundreds of solo missions. I was
*  a taxi driver. I had like, I don't know, fucking 30, 50 vehicles in Iraq. So once they realized you
*  can do this, like, Oh, call McPhee. Yeah. Well, no, it's just kind of my thing. Like, you don't
*  have to call me and just tell me what you need. Wow. Yeah. I mean, my bosses knew how to use me
*  like that. So you started enjoying the craziness of it. I loved being alone. Why did you love it so
*  much? I don't know. I hate to say this, but like guys like me are generally fucking assholes.
*  Like you've met a few guys like me and they're like, yeah, I was afraid someone would get away.
*  Like, shut the fuck up, man. God damn it. You know what I mean? Like, so not really a fan of a lot of
*  like alpha males. They can be dicks at times. So like, uh, yeah, it kind of set me down my down my
*  path is I just stayed away from the dicks and did my own thing. You know what I mean? Right. So you
*  just had, you had your mission and you enjoyed the fact that it was all up to you. And I didn't have
*  to fuck with no one else. It's on my timeline fucking, and I will make this happen. Like I will
*  make shit happen that other people can't. I don't know how. I don't know why, but I just will.
*  That is such a wild experience. Like your experience in war must be so different than everybody else.
*  It's just because of that. Yeah. So having said that, we're talking about Iraq. I brought some
*  show and tell items. What'd you bring? I brought something I have never fucking shown before.
*  What do you got? And I believe it's fucking evil. You want to see it? Yeah, I do. What is it?
*  I got, I got to get it out of my box. Oh, you got a box. I brought a box.
*  I'm kind of scared.
*  What's that? Hey, can you Google Saddam Hussein Mauser?
*  This is his hat? Yeah. Jesus. It's the one where he shoots the Mauser in the air at the fucking
*  parade grounds. I was given that to buy his tailor.
*  Wow. Yeah, that one. The liner fell out. The liner's in here. Look,
*  you can see what kind of hat it is. The glue fell out of the liner, but look.
*  Whoa. That's fucking crazy. I rolled up his tailor
*  and all his butlers. Anybody who touched his ass fed him or touched his dick.
*  I fucking rolled them motherfuckers up. Wow. Saddam was captured nine days after I left.
*  I had to leave for Christmas. This is crazy. This was on his head. Now it's here. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Wow. Yeah. But it's a Piccadilly fox fur hat. I also have a sweater. I took a,
*  I had all his clothes. I had everything that guy had. Yeah, his tailor. Okay. So Saddam's
*  inner circle. When I was working Saddam, we were working a Saddam piece. Some fucking legendary
*  hits that no one's ever fucking talked about. We did the cleverest shit fucking during Saddam.
*  I will tell you this, as I learned on my fucking Singleton mission at Afghanistan, the first one,
*  we need to be a lot fucking smarter if we want to crush these motherfuckers. And I'm not talking
*  like we captured two bad guys. I'm talking, we go in, kill everyone needs to be killed,
*  capture everyone that needs to be captured and fucking do this right. Right. So yeah,
*  with the Saddam piece, right. His tailor and his butlers and Saddam's inner circle was all Christians.
*  Mm.
*  Fucking every one of them was a Christian. And Saddam believed that Christians, if they
*  martyr themselves, go to hell. Muslims martyr themselves, you go to heaven.
*  So he surrounded himself with fucking Christians. So his tailor, his butlers, his jawalas,
*  all those guys, they fucking washing his ass, feeding this motherfucker, we're all Christians.
*  And it's why Christians flourished in Iraq, which, you know, like, I'd like to, I'd hope
*  all these guys are still alive. But the reality is, is like, ISIS probably fucking got rid of
*  them after Saddam's gone, you know, ISIS killed so many fucking Christians, you know what I'm saying?
*  Yeah.
*  But they were all Christians. And so his, I, it started with the ex ambassador,
*  excuse me, to the US. And then I met the tailor and started talking to the tailor. And then one day,
*  he brought this hat and he brought some clothes. And I was like, what was this? And he was like,
*  you know, he told me this is the one where he shot the Mauser. And he had some clothes,
*  I grabbed a sweater. I wear this sweater on Christmas Eve. And then when I was when I was
*  fatter, it's like, it's like a fucking halter top, my bellies, my belly fats hanging out,
*  my family's like, I don't know, they think I'm nuts. But I normally wear that sweater on
*  Christmas. I forgot to bring it around, I brought it. But yeah, now that I lost weight, I think I'm
*  actually Saddam's size, you know what I'm saying? Spooky, you know what I'm saying? I end up being
*  the same size, I could have wore all those clothes, you know what I mean?
*  Wow.
*  But yeah, they were Christians, right? And we rolled up the tailor, the tailor gave up a butler,
*  like I was me and another guy were at the tailor's house. Right? And we were going to snatch this guy,
*  right? This butler and the butler is the guy who used to wash Saddam, like he bathed Saddam every
*  fucking day. So Saddam had someone bathe them. Yeah, he didn't bathe himself. No. Crazy, right?
*  Yeah, weird. But he had a lot of a lot of but they were all Christians. And they were all,
*  honestly, they were all fucking nice people, to be fair, like all the Christians were great people.
*  Anyway, yeah, so I'm in the house with another guy, and the guy's early. So we fucking shoot up on the
*  roof, the guy comes, I call my guys, they're, they're not really in place yet. So he comes,
*  he leaves, he only stays a minute, and he's gone, you know what I mean? And these, I think all these
*  inner circle Saddam folks know they were valuable to us. And, and like they realized they were going
*  to get snatched at some time. So he was like, he was out, right? I called my guys, right? And then,
*  literally, my guys were like two blocks away. As he was leaving, he ran into their Humvee.
*  He ran into my guys. And they're like, Hey, this guy just ran into us. And like this vehicle,
*  I'm like, that's the dude. He got an accident. Yeah, he ran into our guys in a Humvee. He was
*  trying to drive away and like crashed into like the guys that were going to snatch him.
*  Wow. Yeah. I'll tell you another Saddam story. This is this is my one of my favorites.
*  Saddam had like regular pieces of ass. And like his favorite piece of ass was this
*  butter face lady. I don't know what she did for him. She wasn't a looker. You know what I mean? So
*  like, look and feel are different things. Saddam knew what felt right to him, obviously.
*  And she was married. And we wanted to get to her. I mean, maybe Saddam's favorite sex
*  partner wouldn't know where he is, right? So we have the tailor, the tailor knows who he is. So
*  we have the tailor kind of invite him to the tailor shop. This tailor had a store in downtown
*  Baghdad. So he comes in the store. And I told my guys if he doesn't come out quick to I had a
*  couple I don't know what they're called now Mohawks, I think is what they call the Iraqi
*  counter terror guys. Before they were even established, like the guys were with us, you know,
*  so we had a couple of those guys. And I have them start fighting in front of the store, right? So
*  literally, everyone piles on in the street to see these guys fighting, right? Like everyone piles out
*  of all the shops, stores, and everyone's watching these two guys fight. Literally, the guy we're
*  looking for like walks up to see the fight and his back is to the van door the guys that are going to
*  snatch him. So I call them like, Yo, you see that tall guy? That's our guy fucking snatch him and no
*  shit van door, van door fucking open. Nobody even knew where the fucking guy went. The tailor later
*  was like, Where did he go? Did you take who took him? Where did this guy go? Where's this man at?
*  You know what I mean? Like, no one even seen him get snatched, right? That's such a clever idea.
*  Yeah, have two guys fight. Yeah. And then later, my boss was like, Who are those guys fighting? I was
*  like, that's our boys. And he was like, Wait, did you do that? And I was like, I didn't want to be
*  there for like six hours. Like, you know what I mean? Like, how do we speed this up? We got shit
*  to do today. Like, you know what I mean? That's my efficiency is my thing. Like, that's genius. Yeah,
*  that's one of the and we did so much. Hey, all right, I'll tell you another one. My first Saddam
*  hit. I worked a lot of Intel side for Saddam, me and a couple other guys. So we worked somewhere
*  not with our squadron. And we worked with another government agency. Make sense? So we get the call
*  the squadrons doing a hit. There's a Saddam sighting, right? So this is like the beginning,
*  like 2003 Iraq, we were fucking Ken blocking it with fucking maps, like hit the third traffic
*  circle, go out on the nine o'clock, like, literally, I get us to fucking Ken blocking fucking
*  navigating through a fucking shitty Baghdad fucking street map. I get us to the fucking target,
*  right? Humvees are already there. The rest of the guys are already there. Rangers got the blocking
*  positions all set up. So we get there, we raid the house, right? We get all these guys. And then
*  finally, there was like no fucking shit, Joe. There was like, I don't know, 15 motherfuckers.
*  It was like a Saddam look alike fucking contest. They all had the mustache. There's like short fat
*  Saddam's. There's like tall, skinny Saddam's. So it's like body doubles. Well, I don't know if
*  it was body doubles. It just all looked like. Yeah, because like the Saddam look was popular,
*  the mustache. And I mean, not that they all look the same, but they kind of all look the same,
*  you know, from my perspective at the time, right? So like, it was like, well, no wonder someone
*  called this in. It's fucking like they all look like Saddam. You know what I mean? And then
*  on the outside, like, fuck man, the Rangers shot up these vehicles at the blocking position.
*  I have my squad, my, my sergeant major was like, Hey, go fucking clean up the bodies. And I'm like,
*  why the fuck am I on brains detail? I didn't fucking shoot nobody today. And he's like,
*  you're the only one with a regular pickup truck that could haul the bodies.
*  And I'm like, fucker already thought it through. This is why this guy's the boss. You know what I
*  mean? Like, and then a lesson learned that day is, you know, like in Iraq, you just drink water out
*  of bottles and then throw them in your truck. Man, we were loading bodies in there's fucking
*  a hundred water bottles in the back of the bed. Someone just come by the bed of the truck and
*  throw an empty water bottle in like at the house or whatever. Right. And like, I'm throwing bodies
*  and fucking shit in the back of my truck. And there's like bloody water bottles squirting
*  everywhere is a fucking mess, man. So I learned that day, like my vehicles are always clean,
*  always fucking clean from that day on, but like, is a fucking mess. And then, man, they shot up
*  this fucking this old man, this old lady, like they ran the checkpoint, they were about, they're about
*  to hit the Humvee with the Rangers. So the kid shot at the driver, but like the kids didn't,
*  the Rangers back then didn't know as much as Rangers know now. You know what I'm saying?
*  And the kid like shot the warning shots at the driver, but he hit the brakes.
*  And the fucking vehicle will never stop if you shoot the brakes. I don't know if you know that,
*  but and it fucking hit the Humvee like fucking 40 miles an hour broke the transmission and I had
*  to clean up the bodies. I had to set up an HLZ, take them later to the HLZ. You know what I mean?
*  And then it was like my, it was my first Saddam raid in Iraq and it was my first
*  experience in Iraq with the Rangers. And like that day I was fucking fed up with them, you know,
*  like there's some young fucking 18 year old kid medic in the back of the truck.
*  And like, I'm like, Hey, fucking give these people morphine. He's like, I'm not supposed
*  to give the enemy morphine Sergeant. You know what I mean? I'm like, yo, does anyone look like a
*  fucking enemy to you here? Anyone fighting you in the back of the truck? Then there is no fucking
*  enemies here, bud. Fucking give these people some drugs. So like, at least we ain't got to fucking
*  hear them moan and shit. You know what I mean? And like the kid, like I had to force them to like
*  fucking be humane. You know what I mean? And cause he was just trying to follow orders later.
*  Later would they be so much better, right? But beginning of the war, like my first,
*  that was my first Saddam hit. You know what I mean? And I was just thinking,
*  fucking, this is going to be awesome. And that kid was shooting down the street with the 50 cal,
*  like imagine just the fucking city street in Austin, right? And you're parked in the middle
*  of the road and you just shoot with a 50 cal off the top of a Humvee, you know, like eight feet off
*  the ground through those tracer rounds would skip down the road. It was breaking glass, fucking going
*  through cars, fucking, you know, 500 yards down the road, like people scattered like is amazing.
*  You know, 50 cal is amazing. You know what I mean? And then I had a fucking pickup guts, but.
*  Well, this is the fucked up thing about it is like you, you went through all this chaos.
*  You're uniquely qualified for chaos for some strange reason.
*  Love chaos is my jam, man. As soon as this gets confusing, yo, I got this. You know what I mean?
*  Why is that? I don't fucking know. It seems to be what I do best. Yeah, I think so.
*  Is that something that like you accumulated this mindset over time or did you just always have it?
*  I think it was beaten to me. Really? Yeah. Like think about it. When I was a kid, the house was
*  chaotic. You know what I mean? You learn the chaos. Right. And then it just, you're designed for that
*  break glass in case of war. Yeah. Yeah. I guess so. I don't know. I think I'm a normal guy, but like
*  people tell me I'm not. Yeah. I mean, I understand you. I understand you.
*  It's not normal, but I understand you. Yeah. I mean, like, look, I just feel like,
*  OK, we're all going to die. I'm not going to let it ruin my day. I've been through bad shit. I'm
*  not the fucking victim. I've done bad shit. I'm not the fucking bad guy. You know what I'm saying?
*  And then having said that, it's like, I don't know, man, I think it affects everybody differently, but
*  I think, you know, before I retired, I was burned out. I didn't know I was burned out. I was an
*  asshole every day. Fucking I was, you know, you just fucking guys that come into my office. What
*  do you want? Yeah. Too slow. Get the fuck out. When you know what you want, come back. I'd be like,
*  OK, Sergeant Major. Well, you were operating at 10. Always. Always. Yeah. And then I learned, man,
*  like, I was having a lot. I fucking hated my life. I was miserable. I hated being a sergeant major.
*  I hated being army management is what I called it. I'm not a leader. I'm not a follower. I'm not a
*  soldier. I'm fucking army management. And that shit is fucking dry fucking toast. You know what
*  I'm saying? And I just got out of fucking Baghdad in 06 fucking killing people. Like 06 was a great
*  year, you know? And then I got to sit on the fucking staff and do this shit. Like, it's just
*  fucking killing me, Joe. And then so like, I wasn't a very good sergeant major. So I realized one day,
*  man, I think I used to be funny. Like, you know, like when I was a kid, like, I'd catch that beating.
*  If I could say that one fucking smart ass comment to you, I might get beaten more. But I fucking said
*  my piece. You know what I mean? Even as a little kid, I'll take the beating to fucking call you an
*  asshole. Right. So like, I kind of maybe had that mindset going into it or something. You know what
*  I mean? Like, but yeah, man, I just think like, I think a lot of it just goes back to my childhood
*  and being able to manage the chaos one minute, we're fighting the next minute, you know, someone's at
*  the front door, like, go answer the crazy thing about it is like, if you are, you're running,
*  you're running any branch of the military, and you're asking a lot of people to find someone
*  like you that you can find someone who doesn't just accept this, but thrives on it. That's like,
*  try recreating that in a lab. Fuck. You know what I'm saying? How do you make that? You can't.
*  I've only seen like, I don't know, in my experience of all the guys I know, and all the combat I've
*  seen, I'd say there's like, just, I mean, you know, we're not the common guy. You know what I mean?
*  Maybe a dozen in my life. You guys are on a group chat? Fuck no. Fuck no. You don't talk to nobody.
*  You know what I mean? You'll never know who they are. They ain't fucking talking to you, me,
*  fucking nobody. And some, you know, of the two, you know, I maybe know a dozen of those guys,
*  eight probably still work for the dark side of the government as old men, wherever that is.
*  And the other guys are like raising families and don't want you fucking with them.
*  Right. You know what I mean? They don't do shit like this.
*  Guys like me don't do shit like this. But the thing about it is if you didn't talk about it,
*  people wouldn't know. Right. Like I think it's great that you talk about it. I think it's
*  important. I think people need to, I mean, people need to, you know, we're trying to like fill in
*  an understanding of the world. And until you've talked to someone who's experienced a part of the
*  world in a way, in a way that no one else has, you don't know that that's a thing. Right. Like
*  the fact that you can come and talk about this is a very good thing for everybody. Thank you.
*  Because people will see like, okay, like this is super complicated. Like this, the whole thing was
*  super complicated. And to have a guy that could talk about navigating probably the most complicated
*  aspect of this super complicated thing, and to actually thrive in it is very strange.
*  Thank you. I still think I'm normal, Joe. I think I'm a regular guy.
*  Definitely not normal. But like I said, I understand you.
*  Well, thanks, man. I get it.
*  But yeah, man. And look, I got some more items. You want to see something else? I've never
*  shown off. So I talk about stories in some of my videos about being a taxi driver. I also had
*  another vehicle that was an Ude Kusei secret police vehicle. So when I drive this vehicle downtown,
*  the fucking sea would part. The road could be packed. And I'm driving my vehicle and people
*  just move. What kind of vehicle was it? It was like a Maxima, a Nissan Maxima. But it's what the
*  Ude secret police drove. You know what I'm saying? And then they carried these and I'll show you.
*  Check this out.
*  Well, so the lion is the Babylon lion. And that's the symbol of the Republican Guard. But I used to
*  carry that as a taxi driver. And when I get out of the taxi, people would see that fucking gun and
*  just fucking walk away. And that's a Republican. That's what the Republican Guard rock those silver
*  guns. I say it's a pearl handle, but it's like plastic. Nothing fancy about it. But specific to
*  them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I had a guy make it for me. Elk River Tool Handle. Yeah. There's only so
*  many guys that'll do AKs. You know, like, you know what I mean? You want to you want like a
*  silver AK. What are you the cartel? No, get the fuck out of here. You're not serious about guns.
*  You know how many fucking knows how to collect up there? Like, anyway, but that's my Republican
*  Guard. That's my taxi driver. So you had that made specifically because you knew that they carried
*  that? No, I captured that on the battlefield and carried it in Iraq. So that is one. But why does
*  it say Bozeman, Montana? Because well, because, okay, so if you bring one home, you get fired.
*  But what I did, what I did is I took the handguard in the pistol grip. And then I had a
*  guy make a copy of what I had. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So it's it's I mean, it's legal and everything.
*  So the handguard and the pistol grip from the original gun. Right. But that's exactly what the
*  original gun look like. Because I didn't look when you're in the depot, like you want to get fired
*  for bringing back an AK. Right. Fucking you know what I mean? Like, dumb. Like, you know what I
*  mean? Like, it's not worth the risk. Right. But like, it's like, hey, can I bring this handguard
*  back? Like, the fuck you want that garbage for? That's a yes. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah.
*  And then it took me a while to get but yeah, that guy built it for me. Just got it kind of matches
*  the hat. Everybody I know likes to take a picture with that. So it's kind of popular. But yeah, the
*  hat's been in Texas here for a very long time. Been stored in Texas. Got it documented about as
*  much as possible as I can. Some fucking nightmares. I don't know. Hey, you know anybody that would
*  might want it? Were you selling it? Yeah, I bet somebody want that. I don't I don't want it. Yeah.
*  And if someone had my house, no fuck no. Joe, why do you think I keep it in a black fucking box?
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I don't want it. But I know there is people out there that would treat it
*  better than me. Like, I crammed it in a box. Yeah. And then the guy that stored it for me put it in
*  glass. You know what I mean? Like he kind of knew what he was doing. Actually, I had it stuffed in
*  a bag. You know what that would be good for? Zach Bagans haunted museum. Yes. Have you ever been?
*  You know, Zach? No, I hear that place is fucking creepy. My brother said it was fucking creepy.
*  And my brother likes creepy shit. And he was freaked out. He's got everything in that place.
*  He's got a Kevorkian's van. He's got the Camaro from fucking the wake. Oh, what's Koresh?
*  Does he? And like the cereal? I don't think so. I thought he bought Camaro from Koresh.
*  You were gonna. Yeah. Wasn't the serial number like I am God or something? Wasn't it the serial
*  number? It's a 68 Camaro and it was for sale. And I came that close to pulling the trigger on it.
*  But I was like, I don't want that fucking bad juju in my life. That's it. 68 Camaro from deadly
*  siege. Zach Bagans. Oh, he does have. So he bought it. So Zach bought it. Yeah. I was the one selling
*  it, I think. Oh, he's selling it now. So he got it. It was for sale. 23. This was from a year. No,
*  it was for sale quite a while ago and I was going to buy it. I felt somebody emailed me and told me
*  that they know I love old muscle cars. And they said Koresh's Camaro is for sale. I was like,
*  oh, and I went like this, let me buy it. And I was like, no, the fuck am I going to do with this?
*  Yeah. I'd rather buy one that has no history. Yeah. I have a 69. Yeah. I love them. I love
*  old muscle cars. So I was thinking about it, but I was like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
*  you don't want that in your life. I had a 67 Camaro when I was a kid. Look at the title,
*  David Koresh, Waco, Texas. What's the serial number? Say I am God or something.
*  No, it's normal. Look at the VIN numbers. Normal. It's normal.
*  Yeah. Fucking crazy asshole. That guy, I, when you went to the mothership last night,
*  I was going to buy another building before that that was run by a cult. And they moved out here.
*  It was called, I forget what the, what was the name? The Bodhi tree? Is that what it's called?
*  Anyway, there's a documentary on it. It's called Holy Hell. So this guy, he was a yoga teacher
*  in West Hollywood and he was a gay porn star and a hypnotist. So this fucking guy,
*  he got a lot of ass. So the Bodhi field, that's it. Thank you. So Waco goes off, right? And then
*  the cult awareness network starts investigating him and he's running this cult in West Hollywood.
*  So he escapes in the middle of the night and drives out to Texas, moves to Austin,
*  tells everybody come here and they all move out to Austin. And then he has them build this place.
*  It's called the one world theater. And all the cult members ran this place for years until they
*  figured out that this guy was fucking everybody. One guy sends out a mass email, say, Hey, this
*  guy's been hypnotizing me and butt fucking me for the last 10 years. And everybody's like, me too.
*  So then they'll find out that he's fucking everybody, this guy. So they all leave,
*  the cult falls apart. The building's for sale. So I swoop in. When I move here, the building's
*  for sale. Ron White tells me about the building being for sale. He's like this building fucking
*  awesome. I performed there. You should get, you should buy it. So Ron White's my hero. So I'm like,
*  I'll buy it. Fuck it. Yeah. You know, I need a club. We're going to open up a comedy club.
*  Let's open it up in this place. All sorts of problems with the building code, this, that
*  lot of environmental, a lot of shit. So I get out of it. But I bought the building before I
*  watched the documentary. So I watched the documentary and I'm like, Oh no, same thing.
*  It's like these fucking people, all the lives lost. They lived 20 years. These poor people
*  wasted 20 years of their life following this fucking asshole. And he's got this building.
*  But the reason why he bought the building was because of Waco. So when Waco pops off,
*  they were like, Oh geez, these cults are dangerous. So the cult awareness network starts
*  going after everybody. So this guy moves here and changes his name. So it goes like back then you
*  could kind of change, you know, internet, you kind of change your name and know, Oh, it's a different
*  guy. And so he builds, he has his whole, all his followers build him this theater. So for a brief
*  period of time, I was on the contract for that theater. Do you go in there building? Oh yeah.
*  Was it creepy in there? It was a little weird. This guy would like, he had this theater,
*  beautiful theater. He had it built so he could dance in front of his followers.
*  So he could perform in front of his followers. Who's a weird cat. He was like a really handsome
*  guy when he was younger. But then as he got older, he started getting plastic surgery and got looked
*  real weird. And he would like be thinking about getting something done. So he'd forced one of
*  his followers to go get it done. And so they'd get it done. They'd come back with the fucking
*  cheeks. So they're like, Hmm, I kind of like that. And then he would go and get the surgery
*  done at the end of it, the end of the documentary. He looks really fucking weird because he's got
*  Botox and weird shit to his face. Yeah. But the feeling in the building was just like,
*  like a loss. That's what it felt like loss. Just, just, oh no. Yeah. You know, like, like you don't
*  want to buy a house from some people that they went bankrupt and they lost everything and their
*  family fell apart. Then you're in the house like, Ooh, this house feels like sadness. Yeah.
*  I felt like we could burn some sage and party in there for a few days. We'll clean it up,
*  get some good energy. I'm glad. I'm glad that that didn't happen. Yeah. Why even go through that?
*  Yeah. Well, it was kind of funny at first. I thought it was funny until I found, you know,
*  occult owned it. Oh, this is funny. And then my buddy, Adam called me up and said, Hey,
*  you watch a documentary on that cult? I was like, Oh no, there's a documentary. Yeah. They don't
*  make documentaries about the good cults. And it was a fucking, it was horrible. At the end
*  of the documentary, like you're tearing up. You're like, Oh, these poor fucking people.
*  Cause he's so many people. Some people are just gullible and they, they're not bad people. They
*  just want someone better than them to tell them how to live life. Yeah. That's all it is. They
*  need something. They need someone. They need something. If they're missing something,
*  whatever it is, something went wrong and they're willing to believe a lot of really ridiculous
*  shit. And then 20 years later, they realized they wasted their life. People do a lot of weird shit,
*  call it religion. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. And that was this place. Yeah. But that was because of
*  Waco that this, this guy built this thing. Yeah. Damn. Waco things fucked. You ever watched the,
*  the raid? I know. Yeah. I mean, the raid kind of like, we got the briefings back in the day.
*  Like, you know, the raid was a couple of years old, but yeah. Yeah. I know about the raid.
*  It was pretty fucked. I mean, they just cook those people. Yeah. They burned it down. Oh yeah.
*  I can see the tanks like shooting fire into the buildings. I don't know what happened. Caught fire.
*  Yeah. It was back in the nineties when you could kind of get away with something like that. And
*  people didn't really know. Yeah. Yeah. Like, well, we didn't know it would burn. Well, it is made of
*  wood. Yeah. But I mean, we shot fire at it. Yeah. I don't know what happened. Yeah. Yeah.
*  It's crazy. All right. You ready? I got some other stuff. What else you got? What else you got?
*  So check this out. I got, I got a swag bag for you. Okay. I got a bunch of stuff. I make that I do.
*  Right. So I just kind of want to, I like to do this, right? Look, I got you the SOB hat. This is
*  the best hat we sell right here. It's the one I wear this on the range every day. Okay. I got
*  your same t-shirt as me team SOB shirt, right? Well, welcome to the team, Joe. Thank you. We're glad
*  to have you. One of my second favorite shirt of all times is this. And I wear this every day when
*  I elk hunt. Do you really? Oh, wait. Oh no. This is the wrong one. I got a shirt. I sell these shirts.
*  They're called slaughter things. And that's all I wear in elk camp. You know what I mean? But look,
*  we got you shut up hippie shirt. I sell a ton of these. Like I wear these. What are the other knives?
*  Bullets. Got your shut up hippie shirt. When I go to California and teach California classes,
*  I wear a shut up hippie shirt all the time. And then tons of guys buy them. I had a guy,
*  he comes to my classes. He's a younger kid. He's tall, got a young family, right? They go to,
*  I think Asheville, North Carolina, and they're eating at like some destination, like you got to
*  go eat here and it's a bus. So he's a big guy, right? And he's in this like school bus and it's
*  where you got to orders in this old school bus. So he said like, my shoulders almost touching the
*  ceiling. And he had to put his head down and he had a shut up hippie shirt on behind him. And some
*  hippie behind him was like, better be careful wearing that shirt. You'll get your ass kicked
*  around here. And he says he looks back and he pulled up his shirt and he said better make it
*  a gunfight. And they shut the fuck up. Oh, that's hilarious. Yeah. Well, North Carolina,
*  you're going to get your ass kicked. That's so funny. By hippies. That's so funny. Okay.
*  That's the most gentle ass kicking of all time. Yeah. Thank you for that. You know what I mean?
*  Okay. I got you a condom holster. I make these 365. It's your EDC. You make these out of leather,
*  right? Yeah. They're made out of leather. I saw this on Sean's show. Yeah. Nice. Yeah. It's all
*  I use. It's all I wear. It is the most comfortable holster. Here. And that's all the stuff for you.
*  I'll give you the bag too also. Oh, I got a bag. Okay. So check this out. Here's another thing I
*  use all the time. The cooling schmog. So basically I saw this too. You know what the, you know,
*  the schmogs, right? Yeah. Basically I made a cooling towel the size of a schmog. Okay. So like when
*  I'm on the range, literally I just dump a bottle of water in my neck. The fucking thing absorbs it.
*  What's it made out of? It's the cooling material, you know, like the cooling towel material, right?
*  But the problem with most cooling towels is they're not big enough. So it's like one layer
*  on your neck and it dries in like two minutes. This, this you could kind of get double it up,
*  pour water on it. It'll stay cool for a long time. What is that cool? Because I've seen people,
*  they're making gear and clothes out of like this cooling material. What is it? I don't know. I
*  think it's like the way it's woven to where when the water drains out of it, it cools quicker.
*  Right. And it's materials that cool clicker or feel cool to the touch. Yeah. Kind of deal without
*  knowing what it is. I've heard like people talk about clothes that they make out of this. They're
*  like, it's really legit. Like for whatever reason, it like keeps you cooler. I would wear
*  t-shirts on the range made of that shit every fucking day. I'm outside. Yeah. Yeah. Fuck. Yeah.
*  Especially in the heat. You know what I mean? Okay. So check it out. I've got you a couple slings.
*  I don't know if you have rifles, but okay. 100% made in America. Everything on the sling is made.
*  There's a QD on there. I make traditionally QDs in the gun world. If somebody wants to buy
*  this stuff, where do they get it online? Sheriff of Baghdad, Joe. Sheriff of Baghdad.com. That's
*  right. Okay. That's right. Okay. Here's another thing I got you. Punchers, punch daggers. So it's
*  G10. I got a few of them here. Oh, okay. So this doesn't even go through a metal detector.
*  That's right. There's no metal in the sheath. It's all plastic screws. It cleans up easy. No
*  DNA. You could clean it in diesel fuel. It'll wash all the DNA off. Diesel fuel. You're washing
*  alcohol. Yeah. I think so. Just go to the gas station. Yeah. You could do fucking dish soap,
*  but you can't permeate the plastic. It'll come clean. And I sharpen them normally with like
*  400 grit sandpaper. Really? I just resharpen it with sandpaper. But the reason I made it is I
*  always wanted something where like, I was always wearing my body armor, right? And I wanted to just
*  put the punch dagger right in the center. That way if something happened, I could get it. Right.
*  Boom. And just start fucking punching. I mean, the whole problem with knives is you gotta learn how
*  to use a knife. But with a punch dagger, if you could throw a punch, you could bury that
*  thing in someone's neck. You know what I mean? Which is what I would tell anyone. Jamie's been
*  looking for one of those for a while. Haven't you, Jamie? When Carl gets out of line. Yeah. Hey,
*  it'll clean the DNA off, sand it down, a little alcohol. Okay. Another thing I made,
*  and this is super important, I call these combat bands. It's a high temperature silicone,
*  but it's a rubber band. The so what here is when like, when I carry this rifle, I put a sling on
*  it. But if I'm in and out of vehicles, the sling is always just hanging somewhere, right? So I put
*  the rubber band on the gun and then I just weave the sling underneath the rubber band. So if this
*  touches the barrel, it doesn't melt. Right, right. And then back in the day, I had to use
*  actual rubber bands for parachutes. And if I can last a day, like in the heat in Texas, a rubber
*  band will last one day in a car. Well, well, that's only one day I might, I got to go to out every
*  day in my car, right? So when I retired, it's one of the things I wanted the most. So I made them,
*  guys use them to like put suppressor covers, hold them on their, you know, on the suppressor.
*  Great videos online, like instructional videos, like how to fight out of your car. Yeah, thank
*  you. Yeah, they're really like informative. Like, like things I didn't think I was interested in
*  learning. Then I started watching this, like, this guy's fucking thought this shit through.
*  It's all I did, Joe, like, and I'm look, I'm a simple guy. Let me just show you how I did this.
*  Right? Maybe you come up with a better way. I don't know, right. And but I think this is like,
*  this is the difference between the army and the unit in the army. They're like,
*  here's a gun kid, go use it in the unit. They're like, let me show you to the nth degree,
*  how to use that rifle. So when something happens, guess what? You know what I'm saying? So
*  it's the difference between showing someone something and teaching someone something.
*  And I think those are different. And I think, I think that's what the unit was good at. Here's
*  some of my favorite things, the boot kits, Solomon boots made for the military. I've been
*  wearing Solomon boots. You'll see a set of Solomon boots in the Saddam picture.
*  I hunted with them this year. Yeah, yeah. It's all I wear Solomon's,
*  right? Well, if you got the quests, you know how the laces kind of come. So like the running shoes.
*  Yeah. Yeah. So I turn them into like the running shoes. Nice. Yeah. We sell a ton of those. Okay.
*  And what do you do with the extra lace? Cut it off. I cut it off. I, I loosen the
*  boot where I get my foot out and I cut the excess off and put the end on.
*  So I don't have like three feet of laces. I only have like eight or 10 inches. Right. I mean,
*  six inches, whatever it is. Okay. These are, these are some of my best things.
*  This is a, I would call it a scribe tool, right? In the fact that it's a carpenter pencil,
*  makes sense. You know, a carpenter pencil, but the middle is G 10. Same thing as the punch knife.
*  So it's for stabbing. A lot of guys carry them, go through metal detectors. A lot of guys carry
*  them airports, like these things. I get pictures of these things everywhere. Yeah. I made it fist
*  size so you could punch with it or kind of get a good stab with it if you want it. You know what
*  I mean? Something I always wanted. Smart. Yeah. Yeah. I have a pencil like that. Yeah. Someone
*  gave me. Yep. Yep. Okay. So check this out. You here's a bunch of stickers we make. Some of the
*  things that happen on the range, blind guys, I always tell them they can't see shit. You know
*  how like when you shoot and guys like really push their butt backwards, I call that the prison wallet,
*  you know what I mean? Showing me your prison wallet. You know what I mean? So there's a lot
*  of stickers are like funny shit. I tell guys all the time, like a guy will be shooting good all day
*  long. And the end of the day, he'll fuck something up and I'll just come up. All I gotta do is whisper
*  to a guy and be like, sucks to suck. Don't let me, and the guy be like, what the fuck up? You know
*  what I mean? So all the stickers are just funny shit that happens on the range. Right? And then
*  look, this is the premise of the NRA show we talked about earlier is I made a little card.
*  The gun world is sketchy information at best, generally speaking of where your bullets go and why.
*  Like it's fucking magic. This is about eye dominance. One side's eye dominance. The other
*  one is how to fix yourself, where the bullets go and why. Make sense? Yeah. So look at this edge.
*  Well, how you know? Yeah. So like this edge. Tension on the left hand. Yep. And then like
*  you use this edge. So if your group is generally tall, right? You got stance issues. And then as
*  you see your group, whatever angle it's on, the arrows point to it and tell you how to fix it.
*  Now, backside eye dominance. This is where the gun world fucks up. And I'll tell you this,
*  the gun world talks about two things for eyes. Primary hand, primary eye, right-handed right eye
*  dominant. They talk about being cross-eyed dominant, right-handed left eye dominant.
*  Right? Right. Okay. Here's how the vision I think really works. Okay. Being primary hand,
*  primary eye is the guy who makes all the rules in shooting. You should open your eyes. You should
*  do this, right? He makes all the rules. But the reality is his vision is his right eye on a scale
*  of one to 10. He'll tell you borderline 11, because it's that fucking good. You know what I mean?
*  Borderline 11 in the good eye. Ask him the vision in his other eye and he's going to tell you
*  heart eight. It's not really so good. This guy will always be able to keep the other eye open.
*  Makes sense? Yeah. Okay. Now these are the same thing. Whether you're primary hand,
*  primary eye or cross-eyed dominant, it's the same thing. You have a strong eye and a weak eye and
*  the strong eye takes over. Doesn't fucking matter. Strong eye takes over. Right. Fucking easy for
*  you. Okay. This is one out of 10. The other nine are what I call eye neutral, right? They don't
*  have a dominant eye and either eye could take over at any time because either eye on a pistol
*  could see the sights at any time. Right. And this is where people get fucked up. That makes sense
*  with archery too. A hundred percent. It's the same. I don't like to keep both eyes open. I've tried it.
*  Yeah. Well, that's because you're what I would call eye neutral.
*  Mm. Say what I'm saying? And then I would also say this. If you have a gray hair on your head,
*  you're closer to being eye neutral than any eye dominant, any fucking thing because of life.
*  Right. And the reason I would tell you that is because the part of the brain that works the eyes
*  is like the part of the brain that works the ears. It's the part of the brain that works the legs
*  and the arms. Right. They work all these things on your subconscious, I think work better together
*  and are stronger together. What do I mean by that? You know, when it comes to leg day, dudes are
*  like, dude, man, bro, on a squat 500 on leg day. Okay. Does that mean you can do 250 pounds with
*  one leg? No, you can't probably, right? Because the legs are stronger together than they are
*  independently. Right. And this is a function of the deep part of your brain, the fast part of your
*  brain, right? So having said that, you can't choose an ear, can you? Right. The only way you
*  can choose an eye is the eyelid, which has nothing to do with vision or dominance. See what I'm
*  saying? That makes sense. I've never heard anybody say that before, but now that you're saying it,
*  I'm like, okay. Yeah. So if you look at the card, right, if you're like right-handed,
*  right eye dominant, you should be hitting in the middle of the circle there, right? But if your
*  left eye takes over, look where the rounds will go. And it'll always be, look, it'll always be eye
*  distance apart on your target. So people that have eye issues, they don't shoot one group,
*  they shoot two groups, one for each eye, and the gun goes left eye, right eye, left eye, right eye.
*  Evan was telling me that he learned to practice left-handed a lot. Yeah. And he practices things,
*  even though he's right-hand dominant, like it helped the right side to practice with the left
*  side. Yeah. Do you subscribe to that? Yes, I do. And I'll tell you why. Before I retired from the
*  army, I tore my bicep out of my left arm. I'm left-handed. So I went and turned in all my
*  left-handed holsters and got right-handed holsters. And I was like, I'm going to train myself to be
*  right-handed from here forward. Cause the VA said I'd never use my left hand again. So I was like,
*  okay, fuck you guys. I'll be a righty. You can't slow me down. You know what I mean? And then I
*  started training as a righty. Took me about two weeks. I was fucked up. It was tough. You know
*  what I mean? I had to stick with it. Fucking a lot of frustrating days. And after about two weeks,
*  my brain just transferred all that skill to the right hand. And I just fucking rocked it from then
*  on out. It makes sense because you have this mental memory of excellence with one side.
*  Well, think about this. If you actually knew perfect practice, you could switch out to the
*  other hand. But if you never knew perfect practice, the other hand would get the same garbage.
*  Right. That makes sense. Yeah. So. That I think completely makes sense. And I've never heard
*  anybody say it before. Everybody says you should keep both eyes open. Well, you should, but the guy
*  who made that rule has a strong eye and a weak eye and he can do that. Where you, your brain,
*  when I say someone is eye neutral, your brain treats your eyes as equal. What does that mean?
*  Your vision could be shit. It could be great, but the brain says, I got two windows. I look out of
*  this one. Let me look out of that one. And you'll see the gun move. You'll see the head move and
*  there. And then most of the time it just like, it's no good. You just not seeing it good.
*  Makes sense. It does. Are you one of those guys that resists red dots or do you,
*  I don't give a shit. You know what I mean? Did you ever resist it at all? So
*  does iron sites never fail you? They're always there. No batteries. I am not a red dot guy.
*  I'm an iron site guy. However, let me explain myself. The internet knows me as a red dot hater,
*  but I'm taking that video and I'm going to draw one line through that red dot back to your face.
*  And if it don't point exactly to your eye, you're shooting and not seeing shit.
*  And every time I show this to somebody, they're like, so you're against red dots.
*  No, you're never going to catch the red dock unless you get better technique.
*  You know what I'm saying? And you get better technique with iron sites.
*  Well, no, you can have good technique with a red dot also, if you had fucking good technique and
*  someone showed it to you, but no one shows it to you. Right. The next thing with the red dot is
*  the red dot is great for guys who don't see well, because what happens is the red dot becomes in
*  between you, your eye and the target. Makes sense essentially. Right. So you'll be able to see that.
*  But what no one tells you is it's harder to learn harder to master. So you need it,
*  but you need to train with it properly or it's not doing. Why is it harder to learn?
*  A few reasons. You know, the, if you look at pro shooters, high level pro shooters,
*  guys that are like fucking insanely fast winning, you know, national Ipsic champs, Rob,
*  Rob Latham, Dave Savigny, you look at these guys, what you'll see is like,
*  they're so much more efficient than anyone else. Right. And they'll use a way bigger site. Like,
*  I think the winningest site of all time and like gun games is a, it's like the Seymour STS,
*  but it's like more of the size of a beer can than, than it is the little tactical site. Right. So
*  now when you shrink that thing down to a postage stamp, they put a coating on it so it doesn't
*  fucking reflect or whatever, but you can't see through it well. And they curve the glass,
*  which anyone who shoots rifle scopes will tell you fish eyes a fucking real thing.
*  But this red dot has all these things going on and it's supposed to be better for a guy who
*  don't see shit. That's interesting. And it just becomes harder to do. And then once you show them
*  how to get it right, like they'll never have problems again. But it's all about showing them
*  how to get it right. Right. Right. And then no one talks about that because they're stuck on,
*  you can't use the right eye or they never get past that. How important is it to teach people
*  the right way the first time so they don't have to unlearn shit? Man, everyone has a preconceived
*  notion of what they think they should do, whether you've shot before or not. And I'm going to have
*  to unfuck that no matter what, no matter what. So it's like, you know, it's like, uh, kind of like
*  in the dojo where it's like, okay, uh, I want you to do like 20 good, 20 shitty arm bars, and then
*  we'll get the hips better on the next 20. We'll tweak the hand on the next 20. We'll,
*  you know what I mean? Like get some of them bulk movements down first, and then we keep fine tuning.
*  Right. Fine tuning. Yeah. So it doesn't matter if, I mean, look, even if, even if you learned how to
*  punch from John Jones on your first day, you wouldn't go out and win a match that night.
*  Right. You know what I mean? So I think it's like, I always, I tell people this all the time,
*  one percent better a day, just one percent. That's what I'm looking for today. If I can be
*  one percent better today than I was yesterday, well, that's 365% by the end of the year. And I
*  didn't do much every day. You know what I mean? So I always tell people like shooting or a skill
*  like this is a marathon, not a sprint. Right. So it's better. That's with everything, right?
*  Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I think so too. And I tell you, you're like, you know, if you, if,
*  if you think you're going to have to pull a gun and save your family one day, you should be
*  practicing a few times a week. Yeah. You know, and it doesn't have to be much, but you should
*  be practicing a little bit. Yeah. Getting this gun out shouldn't be a shock to you when the time
*  comes because it's not going to come to you then. Right. Yeah. That's great advice. Yeah.
*  Do you enjoy teaching? I fucking love teaching. I love helping people. Now that I'm doing jits
*  again, a lot of people want me to show them like fucking cars and guns and jits and guns. And
*  I don't know if I'm ready to take my sanity past time and turn it into work. You know what I'm
*  saying? So I play with guns now and a lot of guys have told me I need to be like, you know,
*  like the car bailouts, like all this shit. Like I do. I'm afraid to ruin jiu-jitsu as work. So I've
*  been reluctant and I always tell people I'll never teach jiu-jitsu, but like I fucking teach
*  anyone everything. I mean, if we can get better today, let's talk about it. One thing about
*  teaching jiu-jitsu though, is I think it makes you better at jiu-jitsu. I think it's selfish.
*  Oh, a hundred percent. It's like a good thing for you. Well, okay. You know this, you're a black belt,
*  right? Every day you went to a dojo, you were trying to hand that black belt his ass and then
*  you get your black belt and now everyone, every day, the rest of your life is trying to hand
*  you your ass. You know what I mean? It's a fucking thankless job. Yeah. No, I love it.
*  No one's trying to hand you your ass. Yeah. Fuck yeah. Let's go. That's the beautiful thing
*  about jiu-jitsu too. Like you don't really, you don't catch any breaks. You might get one day where
*  there's like, oh, there's only blue belts here. I love it when someone forces me into like real
*  survival mode. Now I'm not talking about like, you know, you got a triangle and I'm just going
*  to ride this. I'm talking like someone like, I'm like fucking, I got to do something now. I fucking
*  love that, man. How are you avoiding injuries? Okay. So first and foremost, I started out,
*  I don't even take Motrin. I try to take no drugs after I got off the pills from the VA and started
*  getting active and you know, I try not to take any medicines at all. I went to master worlds and
*  motherfuckers are yoked up fucking, the gear is out. You know what I mean? Like these motherfuckers
*  are working out since last year, just to fucking stroke a motherfucker today. Right? So like,
*  I was a little unprepared this year for worlds in that aspect, but I'm all for the peptides. I'm
*  all for the TRT. I'm not against any of it per se. And I think that's a, I did the peptides. I just,
*  I'm not, I don't, I don't like shots like, and I won't give myself a shot. You were talking about
*  that on Sean Ryan's show. You don't like it. Yeah. So it's like piercing your skin. Yeah. Like,
*  I don't like that. I don't know why. Right? Like, I know. The guy has been through everything that
*  you've been through is like, needles, sketch me out. I mean, just give it, it doesn't hurt. Like,
*  I'm not a sissy about it, but it's like, peptides are so easy. I know. Well, I took the pills.
*  I took the, I took the pill once. Yeah. And I'll tell you like, super legit, uh,
*  was it Gary Brekka? That guy, he talks about redheaded people. I'm a redheaded people. I got
*  pale skin, you know, redheaded people have better pain tolerance. Yeah. I, well, I take drugs
*  different. I think there's a thing about that though. Cause he Google that redheaded people
*  have better pain. My whole life I've taken drugs differently. Like I don't get Percocet. I get
*  diluted. So I think like, when you got roofied, like everybody else conked out. Yeah. I'm just
*  in over party mode. Like you were also talking about on Sean's show that you take, you have the
*  thing that Jamie has where you could take a lot of edibles and you don't feel it. Oh yeah. The,
*  the gummies are working. Some studies have found that redheads have a lower pain threshold, but
*  other studies have found the opposite. Oh, okay. So it's all fucked up. Yeah. Who knows?
*  Inconclusive. Yeah. But, um, yeah, it depends on the individual. So, but I will tell you this,
*  it healed my stomach and my healing went from like a week or two to like four days.
*  BBC one five seven is very legit. Yeah. And then, um, so anyway, uh, I want to do more in the future.
*  I'd like to, uh, I'd kind of want to do it all. Like, I mean, I'm fucking, I'm 54, man. Yeah.
*  That's why I was asking you, like, what are you doing to avoid injuries? Okay. So besides that,
*  I do cardio, uh, a couple of years ago, my first elk hunt, my first elk bow hunt, you know,
*  we ride up to like 9,000 feet and then like walked up three miles from there. Like, yo,
*  I was two 80 at one time. That was a fucking hell of a walk for a big fat motherfucker up that
*  fucking mountain. And then I hunt with these old guys. And then the two guys I was with, like two
*  of the guys have hearing aids and the other, right from guns. Uh, I don't know. They're just older.
*  Yeah. Yeah. They're hunters, right? Yeah. So both of them got hearing aids and the front one looks
*  back to the second one, both good friends of mine, like, and was like, turn your hearing aids down.
*  So you ain't got to hear him breathe so fucking loud. And I'm like, I heard you,
*  motherfucker. You like, so, uh, I told myself, like, I was going to start walking 30 minutes a day.
*  And that was fucking hard. And then now I do like an hour cardio. I could run, but I don't. Um,
*  but I started again. I need to be running a little bit for cardio. Um, I, I treat strength
*  as two different things. I spent about a year, uh, with 15 pound dumbbells, just like rehabbing
*  motion, movement joints. And it was a lot of fucking pain. And then, you know, now I'm,
*  I'm getting stronger every day. I've been, you know, power athlete, big John, but I kind of look
*  at strength two different ways. I try to do strength days where it's like the traditional
*  squats, deads, like all the big ones, push pulls, all of it covered all. And then I see it as a
*  conditioning is something separate, right? And conditioning would be lighter weight, like
*  CrossFit, like round, right? Without, without knowing how to say it better. So, uh, but the steps
*  fucking, I'm going to tell you this, I'll tell anybody this, you want to fucking start losing
*  weight. It starts at 10,000 fucking steps a day. Get your ass out there. Start fucking walking.
*  And then the next thing I did is, uh, I went to a competition class, um, by Sean's in Tennessee,
*  and, uh, I got a diet. I got workouts. I got an app. I tracked my diet. I did, uh, right before
*  worlds, I was at 170 grams of protein, 1800 calories a day. And I, very strict about it.
*  Yeah. And I shredded weight. Um, I cut, I cut down, I was probably two 40. I cut down to two 22
*  as the smallest human being in the fucking two 22. Cause everyone's yoked up like fucking madman.
*  They probably all cut weight too.
*  Well, my coaches were like, you know, and I can't believe I even listened to this,
*  but they're like, man, it's the 55 bracket. Like it's guys like you, this is their pastime.
*  You know what I mean?
*  55 today is not the same.
*  Yo, these motherfuckers will cut, this is fucking killer season out of this bitch. You know what
*  I mean? Like I was unprepared for, man, I had this big Mongolian motherfucker. Uh, you know, Edwin,
*  Edwin, Jami, you know, Edwin, Edwin, uh, Gracie Barra, Tarzana, uh, California, right? Edwin's
*  like a jujitsu legend. He's at worlds. Who's your coach? I didn't fucking have a coach as me,
*  my backpack and a ghee. Let's fucking get this fight going bitch. And he's like, well, I'll
*  coach you. And I'm like, okay. You know what I mean? I don't got a coach. And then like,
*  right before we walk out on the mat, he's like, yo ref, are they the same weight class? And I'm like,
*  yo, my man, Ed, this is my coach right here. My man. Like, you know what I mean? But like,
*  this dude was fucking huge and he was one of them Mongolian jacket wrestlers. You've done this.
*  Oh, I've seen that.
*  I couldn't, I couldn't get the takedown. And then we went down on the ground. He hit me with a,
*  like a fucking paper cutter, popped my head out, tried to choke me again,
*  fucking got out of it. But as I was getting up, I knew I needed to keep this guy in the ground.
*  But guess what, man, when you get in trouble, guess what you do? You stand the fuck up and
*  this dude stand up. And I knew I wasn't getting my two points back. And then I was just fucking
*  exhausted. Like I was fucking gassed.
*  So you decided to ramp up their conditioning.
*  Yeah, fuck yeah, man. This year I'm fucking winning. I'm fucking world champion, Joe. I'm
*  the toughest old motherfucker I fucking know. You know, goddamn it. Let's fucking go. I'm going to
*  figure this shit out. But I will tell you, I think what I didn't know is you got to train to compete,
*  well, and I fucking fight and I want to fight and I want to get smashed and I want to fucking,
*  I want to almost lose this fight 10 fucking times to finally get that fucking submission on you.
*  And that's a great fight to me. And like, yo, yeah, yeah, you just lost 13 points on that.
*  And then if you don't get the submission, you just lost 13 points on that. You know what I mean? Like,
*  so it's a, it's a different animal treating it like the sport versus what you get out of it.
*  And I'll tell you, this is like, I probably could have changed the match if I would have
*  pulled guard around three minutes in. I never pulled guard in my fucking life. Like what kind
*  of fucking asshole pulls fucking guard? Well, I figured it out. I'll tell you what kind of asshole
*  when you can't take a bigger motherfucker down. Yeah, this is maybe what pulling guards for,
*  or in the real world, walk the fuck away. Yeah. Before you fucking just get fucking smashed out
*  here. You know what I mean? Thinking you're something you ain't. Do you spend a lot of time
*  practicing off your back? Cause a lot of times big guys, they don't like. Yo, I'll start there.
*  Fucking get my neck. Let's go. You can't take, I will give you my back just to fucking get out.
*  I don't give a fuck, man. I love it. That's great. I always like, honestly, when I'm like,
*  when I'm just at the dojo, like girls or smaller people, right? I try not to smash them. Right.
*  And I'll tell them like, Hey, if I get on top, just fucking sweep me,
*  stay on top of me the whole time. And I just fucking let them go at me. Yeah.
*  I would just pretend that I'm weak. When I would roll with someone who's weak, I would pretend I'm
*  weak. And like, that's, I think that's the best way to do it. Like no strength. I'm never going
*  to use strength. I think that's it. Hickson always said that defense was more important than anything.
*  He said, I am always safe. No matter where I am, I am always safe. Defense. You're fucking,
*  Hey, your Hickson is great by the way. You see the documentary? I have not seen Choke,
*  but I just finished his new book. The dark one. Dark. Dark. Hickson came out with a new book. I
*  just, I just, this is because he's got Parkinson's now. Yeah. But, uh, you know, he's got the breathe
*  book, but he just came out with a new one. I just listened to it like last week. You know what I
*  mean? Yeah. But, uh, you gotta watch Choke. I got to one of the greatest documentaries of all time.
*  For a martial artist? Fucking incredible. It's Hickson in his prime competing in Japan,
*  Valley Tudo. And just, you see him training and doing his yoga and all the crazy breathing shit
*  where his stomach sucks up inside of him. I don't even know how to do that. Yeah. He, uh,
*  when he was testing me for my purple belt, he was like, yes. Um, yes. Yeah. When,
*  when I lay on the ground, I am flat. He's like, when you lay on the ground, you are
*  not flat. You should roll more. I'm like, I know you know enough English just to call me fucking
*  fat. You know what I mean? But God damn it. Yeah. I should roll. Yeah. And he, he's, he's showing me
*  like rolls from side control, getting out of stuff because I am more round than I am flat.
*  And it's kind of like, you know, fat guy should roll more. It's hard to stop, you know? Right.
*  So he had, there's some real fucking wisdom in there. You know what I mean? But it's like,
*  I always like how like they know enough English to assault you, but they'll say it like their way.
*  You know? Yes. You are just being practical. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's just real talk and that's
*  what he does. Yeah. Yeah. That guy. It's pretty cool getting your purple belt from that guy.
*  I am the only person. So, okay. I had to do the paperwork. You know, there's other like
*  big time Hicks and black belts out there that kind of police up all everybody. So when you go
*  to worlds or you fight, you know, like these guys and they told me they would, they'd get me under
*  their paperwork, but literally I did the paperwork with IBJJF and I sent it to Hicks and he filled
*  out the paperwork, but like, I didn't know I sent them the paperwork and it's like one of them forms
*  where you just sign it with your finger on your phone, like super easy. I sent it to Hicks and I
*  was like, Hey coach, we got a form, we got a sign and he's not, he's not a member of any of these
*  organizations anymore. So like, I didn't know how this would go. And they're like, sent me a
*  fucking paper copy and then they're like, have Mr. Gracie sign this signature. Right? So I, I
*  texted the Hicks and I'm like, Hey coach, can you sign my paperwork for worlds real quick? And he
*  texted me right back and he's like, Hey champ, I'm looking for a printer now. As soon as I find one,
*  I'll sign this. And I was just thinking, fuck, I don't even know who's got a print. I don't even
*  have a printer in my fucking house. Like if Hicks is looking for a printer, I think he just told me,
*  no, you know what I mean? Like, like fuck. And then like a couple of days later, he sent it back to
*  me signed. Right. I think probably his wife was like, Oh, Hicks and yeah, look, you know what I
*  mean? Like I just, I just didn't think, I think he kind of didn't know, but he got back to me and then
*  they sent me, I had to do this a few times. And then I was the only guy, I'm the only belted guy
*  fighting under Hicks in, in a masters. Right. Yeah. That's pretty fucking cool. Yeah. And then
*  I would say this for Jiu-Jitsu for me is like, I'm so glad it is where it is these days. Cause back
*  in the day, I mean, think about this back in the day, I travel all the time. I'm in a different
*  dojo fucking weekly. You know, I might be here for four days. I try to get three days of jets. I'm in
*  fucking wake go. I'm going to fucking places. I've been in 26 different dojos this year, like doing
*  back in the day, that was fucking creante. You know what I mean? Fucking monsters in Portuguese,
*  right? Because you don't have no loyalty. You don't have no fucking, and the reality is like,
*  yeah, I'm just never home. Right. I don't want to be unloyal to anybody. I'm loyal to everybody,
*  but I just want to get rounds. And I'm so glad the Jiu-Jitsu world is so fucking welcoming these
*  days. Meaning like, like I don't have to show up and fight much more open-minded. They're happy to
*  welcome people from other schools. The only, the only, the only person that was like, why are you
*  here was a cyborg at fight sports. Oh really? Yeah. You know, Cyborg? Yeah, sure. He's great.
*  And you know, you know, Roosevelt, you know, Roosevelt, the tall guy that hangs out with him,
*  tallest black belt I ever seen, tallest Brazilian I ever seen. Right. So he's one of the black belts
*  down there with, with, with him, with Cyborg and I'm out there and then like, at the time I was blue
*  belt, you know what I mean? And I was probably, I don't know, two 50, I was kind of fat and like
*  fight sports is like old school Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu where we're going to shrimp across the mat. We do
*  fucking all this. I don't give a fuck if you lose in Jiu-Jitsu today, but you're going to be tough.
*  Right. So it's that kind of shit. And that's how Carlson Gracie's was. Yeah. Yeah. Before you even
*  got to the class, you were fucking exhausted. Yeah. The class hasn't started yet. Right. So
*  I'm out on the mat. I'm breathing hard. I'm just kind of doing my thing. And Roosevelt,
*  the big tall black belt comes over and he was like, man, he's like, you are my inspiration.
*  I'm like, I am coach. I'm your inspiration. He's like, yes. He's like, you are out here.
*  You are doing this man. He was like, you are everyone's inspiration. And I'm looking around
*  and like everyone's rolling. Like, and then, and then like everyone stops because like he's talking
*  to me. You know what I mean? And like every now everyone's looking at me and I'm like, what in the
*  fuck is going on? Right. So he was like, you are here. You are doing this. You were old. You are
*  my inspiration. And I'm like, thanks coach. I was like, and then like, I didn't need a break,
*  but I was like, fuck after that talk, maybe I do need a break. So I was like, maybe I do need a
*  break coach. And he was like, okay, fix your key. So I fixed my gear, tie my belt. He's like,
*  run laps around the practice until you're ready to practice again. It was like, man, that's fucking
*  worse. I wasn't, I didn't even need the fucking break. And he gave me the old speech. So I agreed.
*  And then like, and then I had to run. I thought that was more embarrassing running laps around
*  everybody. Right. But like, like when he said he wanted to give me a break, like the fucking breaks
*  is like screech to a halt. Everybody was like, did he just say, like, does that guy, why the fuck does
*  that guy get a break? You know what I mean? Yeah. And then, and then Cyberg came up to me and
*  um, they didn't, I didn't have a gear yet. I hadn't bought a gear and I hadn't found a
*  gear that fit me. So I had, I just bought a gear, but I only had a white belt, right? I,
*  I got the gear at Gracie Raleigh, my home dojo, right? And then they only had a white belt. So
*  I had a white belt. So I was white belt in it, but really I was a blue belt. So, and when it came to
*  Roland Cyborg is like, who are you man? I'm like, coach. And he's like, who are you man? Who are you?
*  I thought you were like a spy. Yeah. He's like, why are you here? And I'm like, I just, I just,
*  well, my brother lives here coach. And I called ahead of time and I asked if I could come do
*  jiu-jitsu. I'm just trying to get a couple days while I'm on the road. He's like, man,
*  you are no white belt. Who are you? What are you doing here? And I was like, well, I'm actually a
*  blue belt coach. And he was like, why didn't you? And then they got a wall of like old belts,
*  which is like the coolest thing I ever fucking seen. Like I'm just a hundred, just old different,
*  all kinds of belts. It's fucking cool as fuck. My opinion. But he was like, why didn't you get
*  one off the extra belt? And I was like, well, you didn't have one coach. And he looked, he thinks
*  for a second. He was like, you are right. There's not one your size on the wall. And I was like,
*  holy fuck. There's a ton of belts there for him to even know that. Like, cause I went through all of
*  them and couldn't fit one, you know? And he was like, okay. So he was just concerned that you were
*  sandbagging or trying to get information. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. And then, but they were great
*  with me. Like shout out to Cyborg and Roosevelt. Um, hard dudes. Yeah. They're fucking, they're
*  hard down there. Um, Rocha, all those guys down there. But I've been in 26, I think 26 dojos this
*  year, man. That's wild. And then, so you're all in. I'm all in, man. I'm in, I'm in all the time.
*  And then like, so one of the things is like, I can only go to Hickson and get promoted because
*  I'm never in one doll dojo long enough to like earn a stripe or earn a, so I think it's like a,
*  I don't know. I feel like I'm fortunate of where I am. Um, you know what I mean? And then honestly,
*  the reason I went to Hickson is cause I could. Yeah. And I figured if, if I need to be tested
*  for a belt, yeah, like who else should test me? You know what I mean? When you get your black belt,
*  you get a black belt from Hickson. It's like, there's very few black belts that hold that kind
*  of weight. Yeah. There's like Hanzo, Hickson, Jean-Jacques Machado. There's a few of those like
*  old school legendary belts. Yeah. Yeah. Fuck. Megaton Diaz. It's like legendary old school belts,
*  you know? Yeah. Fucking Higgin. Yeah. Higgin. Yeah. Yeah. I love Higgin. I know. I love. I actually
*  was Higgin's, um, corner guy when he was in Abu Dhabi in 2003. I was yelling his time out. Yeah.
*  Cause I was there with Eddie Bravo. Oh yeah. That's right. You know, we all trained in the
*  Machado. So I know Higgin and then he was like, my friend, do the time for me. And so like,
*  he was like, he was kind of out of shape and he's still fucking people up. But he wanted to know,
*  like, tell me when there's like a minute to go so I can really fucking hit the gas. Like
*  on the coast for a little bit and then decide when to go. Yeah. I love it. I call it like,
*  I call it fat guy jiu jitsu. And I think people are shocked when I say that term, but really it's,
*  it's like the, I don't know, the Dan or her ageless stuff. There's, there's stuff that
*  bigger guys, less athletic are going to have to do because they can't do a flying, whatever. They
*  can't, you know what I mean? And like, I love his smash game. And I, uh, so I was at a, I went to
*  the Machado camp. It was him, Roger, Carlos, and John, John Machado. I love that guy too. You know,
*  John? Sure. Uh, he carries, he carries condom holsters. Nice. Yeah. He's great, man. Um, but
*  I went to their summer camp and I was like, Hey, can I get a picture? And like, he was sitting on
*  the couch and Carlos is like, you know, typical bigger brother shit, get the fuck up. You're lazy
*  kind of dog. So I was like, I was like, you don't have to get up coach. So I sat on his lap and he
*  was like, what the fuck. Yeah. Uh, I went to a Machado camp this year. I spent a lot of time
*  with Rafael Lovato. Uh, that guy's a fucking legend. Yeah, he is. I got invited to Philippa
*  Costa's kind of an affiliate training with Rafael, like shout out to Rafael. He's a fucking amazing.
*  Every one of his black belts gave me time. Like, uh, and then Philippa Costa, like just fucking
*  next level. And, and look, it gives me hope as an old guy, like I know I'm 55 and I know I want to
*  win the fucking 55 year old bracket, but why the fuck do I need to be in the 55 year old bracket?
*  You know what I mean? If my jujitsu is good enough, I should be able to fight anyone. Right. And
*  that's what gives me hope of fucking carrying on that one day, like, cause I know all I do is
*  fight these young guys and yeah, sure. They beat me right now, but like, you know, how many times
*  did Helio get crushed? Right. You know what I'm saying? So like it's the beauty of jujitsu is the
*  age should be fucking the least in this equation. You know what I mean? So that's kind of where I
*  stand. And I'll tell you, man, anytime someone can fucking put it to me where I'm about to go down,
*  I couldn't be fucking happier, man. I had this black belt the other day out of nowhere, just
*  fucking smash me. And like, and then he lets me tap. He lets me up and then I just got the biggest
*  smile on my face. And he was like, looking at me. And I was like, that was fucking amazing.
*  I was like, you ain't never smashed me like that. Right. And he, he just kind of looking at me and
*  just fucking tackled them again. Fucking went right back to smashing me. You know what I mean? Like,
*  I just fucking love it, man. Yeah. That's the best attitude for learning. There's no better.
*  Well, I, as a human being, I need to learn something every day. I think you're the same
*  way in a lot of ways. Like I don't care what it is. Good for you. Yeah, I do too. I think it
*  keeps your brain healthy. 100%. I think it keeps Alzheimer fucking all that bullshit away. Yeah.
*  I think that's why people get old. It's one of the reasons other than your body failing is your
*  mind gets old. Yeah. You're not stimulating it. Yeah. Yeah. For real. Right. John, this is a
*  fucking awesome conversation. Thanks. I really appreciate it. Yeah. I had a great time. Yeah.
*  Thank you. And I can't wait to read your book. So, okay. I'm going to get some rounds in the
*  future when you're healthy. Yes. All right. I'd love to get some rounds with you. For sure. I
*  definitely want to come back. I killed Tony last night. Fucking amazing. It's like bucket list.
*  You can come to the club anytime you want. Man, I couldn't thank you enough. I know I came here
*  yesterday. Not a big deal to me, right? Because like, yo, I got killed Tony out of this deal.
*  Last night was fucking funny, man. This guy told a joke last night. The funniest fucking joke I
*  think I ever heard in my life. I don't know if I could say it or not. Who was it? Which guy?
*  I don't know. There was a guy, just kind of shorter guy, white guy, beard, and he just read
*  jokes. He just said like random jokes. Oh, was one of the bucket poles? Yeah, as a bucket pole guy.
*  He said this joke. You want to hear it? Sure. Okay. This is the fucking funniest thing I heard in a
*  long time. Why don't police have turtles as pets? Why? Because you can't kneel on their neck.
*  This. I was like, oh my fucking God. Next level right there.
*  Listen, brother, anytime you want to come to the club, more than welcome. Thank you very much for
*  being here. It was a great conversation. I really enjoyed it. Thanks for all the swag. Thanks for
*  letting me hold the evil hat. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I got to put it back in its box. If people want
*  to find you online, sheriffofbagdad.com. Sheriff of Baghdad, SOB Tactical, either one will get you
*  to me. You type in Sheriff of Baghdad and a ton of shit pops up. And someone, whoever the publisher
*  is, pop on it. Yeah. Hit me up. I'm sure that book's insane. All right. Thank you very much, brother.
*  Appreciate you. All right. Bye everybody.
