# JRE MMA Show #143 with Sean Strickland
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=6.0s)]
*  Hey, what's up, Sean Strickland? What's happening? We made it happen. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=12.0s)]
*  I made it, bro. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=15.0s)]
*  What's up? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=16.0s)]
*  I'm finally pseudo-famous enough to be on the Rogan podcast. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=17.0s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=20.0s)]
*  You're pretty famous after Saturday night. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=21.0s)]
*  Hey, how's your eye? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=23.0s)]
*  Oh, man, the guy was trying to... [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=24.0s)]
*  It's still pretty red. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=25.0s)]
*  The guy was trying to fucking slew his furor, bro. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=26.0s)]
*  Fucking straight to the eye. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=28.0s)]
*  He's Russian. You can't say that. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=32.0s)]
*  He only moved to Germany when he was 15. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=35.0s)]
*  Well, fuck, I don't know, man. Fucking life's weird, dude. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=37.0s)]
*  It's fucking... Is he Muslim? We all know how that goes. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=39.0s)]
*  Oh, fuck, I'm already getting canceled. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=42.0s)]
*  He's just joking. He's just joking. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=44.0s)]
*  Can't we just joke around, folks? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=46.0s)]
*  Isn't this America? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=48.0s)]
*  That was a great fight. It was a really, really good fight. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=50.0s)]
*  And it was really interesting, too, because [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=52.0s)]
*  that guy is so used to blowing people out in the first round. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=55.0s)]
*  He came out so hard in that first round. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=58.0s)]
*  And it was very interesting. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=61.0s)]
*  You have a very interesting style. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=63.0s)]
*  There's no one like you. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=65.0s)]
*  Stands straight up. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=66.0s)]
*  Even the way you hold your hands is different than everybody else. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=68.0s)]
*  It's more like boxing. I like to box. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=71.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know, it's funny. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=73.0s)]
*  When he was throwing kicks, he was kind of giggling and laughing a couple of times [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=75.0s)]
*  when he hit me in the teeth. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=78.0s)]
*  Once or twice knocked the wind out of me in my mind. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=79.0s)]
*  I'm like, you fucking pussy. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=81.0s)]
*  Have you ever been in a 25-minute fight before, sir? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=83.0s)]
*  We'll see how this adds up. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=86.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing, right? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=88.0s)]
*  People need to understand that. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=90.0s)]
*  If you're sprinting in the beginning, you can't do that for very long. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=92.0s)]
*  Well, he broke quick. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=97.0s)]
*  Three minutes in. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=99.0s)]
*  I was shocked how fast he broke. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=100.0s)]
*  I'll tell you when I knew he broke. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=102.0s)]
*  After he took me down, there was a moment where he was on my back. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=104.0s)]
*  I'm like, fuck, this kind of sucks. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=106.0s)]
*  There's a moment, I'm like, oh, this kind of sucks. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=108.0s)]
*  We know what to do. Get to a hip. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=110.0s)]
*  Get your way up. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=112.0s)]
*  Break the hands. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=113.0s)]
*  But whenever I broke his grip and he let go, it was soft. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=114.0s)]
*  It was delicate. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=117.0s)]
*  He broke like it's delicate. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=118.0s)]
*  I think I hit him. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=120.0s)]
*  At that moment, I was like, what the fuck, dude? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=121.0s)]
*  So he's saving energy. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=123.0s)]
*  He realized it was falling. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=124.0s)]
*  No, he quit. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=125.0s)]
*  It wasn't that he was saving. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=126.0s)]
*  He broke. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=127.0s)]
*  So when you're fighting, you guys, wrestling is fucking hard. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=129.0s)]
*  Wrestling is fucking difficult. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=132.0s)]
*  And you have to make the juice worth the squeeze. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=134.0s)]
*  So if you take me down and you're on my back, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=138.0s)]
*  you got to hold that position loose grip for as long as you can. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=141.0s)]
*  Maybe knee me in the back of the thigh, hit me in the head. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=145.0s)]
*  If you could hold me there for 30 seconds and do light damage, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=148.0s)]
*  that's 30 seconds of a round you won. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=151.0s)]
*  And the fact that he didn't even attempt to do it, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=154.0s)]
*  it was like, oh, man, you're done. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=156.0s)]
*  You're fucking done. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=158.0s)]
*  I was watching it at home and I noticed like at the three minute mark, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=159.0s)]
*  you know, there's a thing that you could tell, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=163.0s)]
*  especially when you've seen so many fights, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=165.0s)]
*  where you see a guy in the beginning [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=167.0s)]
*  and you see like how his body moves and then you see a diminishment. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=169.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=173.0s)]
*  And I saw like at three minutes, I saw the feet were heavier. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=174.0s)]
*  The movement was different. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=178.0s)]
*  He was still, he still looked good, but I was like, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=179.0s)]
*  oh, he's already feeling it three minutes in. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=181.0s)]
*  Well, he knocked me off. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=183.0s)]
*  He fought my buddy Soddy Psy. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=184.0s)]
*  And dude, Soddy Psy is a fucking savage. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=185.0s)]
*  Like he's a PFL champ. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=187.0s)]
*  The fucking guy could strike. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=189.0s)]
*  And he wrestled hard against Soddy for like, you know, hard three rounds. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=190.0s)]
*  So I went in there thinking, oh, this guy has like a tank. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=194.0s)]
*  I watched him wrestle my friend. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=197.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was shocking, man. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=198.0s)]
*  But you know, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=200.0s)]
*  Well, he's only had two UFC fights. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=201.0s)]
*  He had that one fight. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=203.0s)]
*  Was it in France? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=204.0s)]
*  Yeah. Against like Dustin. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=205.0s)]
*  Dustin's a fucking can dude. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=206.0s)]
*  Like he should not be in the UFC. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=208.0s)]
*  Like he, again, I liked he's a fucking yogi dude. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=210.0s)]
*  Like he does more yoga than training. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=212.0s)]
*  He came to Vegas. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=214.0s)]
*  I think I broke his nose in the first minute and like, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=215.0s)]
*  and then he came to extreme. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=218.0s)]
*  I pretty much told Chris Curtis, I'm like, Curtis, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=220.0s)]
*  if you let Justin, Dustin walk out of this fucking round, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=222.0s)]
*  I will respect you less as a man. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=226.0s)]
*  You know, like you're not part of our fucking team. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=228.0s)]
*  Like if you let him have any success with you, dude, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=231.0s)]
*  like I will respect you less as a man. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=234.0s)]
*  How did Dustin get in the UFC? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=237.0s)]
*  So it's kind of, I don't know who he fought, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=239.0s)]
*  but he picked up a guy or a guy picked him up and slammed and broke shoulder. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=241.0s)]
*  So his hype train was fighting a guy who like doesn't belong here. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=246.0s)]
*  So the guy broke his shoulder in the slam? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=252.0s)]
*  Yeah. So now it's like, Oh, Dustin slammed him or something happened. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=254.0s)]
*  And then like, that's how he got signed. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=258.0s)]
*  Yeah. Dustin's a fucking can. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=260.0s)]
*  He's a fucking defector, bro. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=261.0s)]
*  He's an American living in Germany. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=263.0s)]
*  You can't respect that fucking guy. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=264.0s)]
*  Oh, how dare you. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=265.0s)]
*  How dare you. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=267.0s)]
*  Sorry, Dustin. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=268.0s)]
*  I don't even know what country you represent, you motherfucker. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=269.0s)]
*  I do not agree with the things Mr. Tricklin is saying, Dustin. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=272.0s)]
*  But I do agree like that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=276.0s)]
*  Like that there's something about those guys that are used to taking guys out in the first round. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=279.0s)]
*  There's something about those guys. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=284.0s)]
*  A lot of these like daggy Muslim dudes, they like they're bullies, bro. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=286.0s)]
*  They're fucking like, you know, that fucking Ali, that fucking cunt, the manager. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=290.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm probably going to rub some people the wrong way, but fuck him. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=295.0s)]
*  You know, I'm going to see him. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=298.0s)]
*  He's going to go fighting after I say that. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=299.0s)]
*  Did you hear what Sean said about me? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=301.0s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, you're a fucking cunt. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=303.0s)]
*  Like he did the accent. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=304.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's a fucking cunt. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=305.0s)]
*  So like this fucking cunt, Ali, good thing. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=306.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't give a fuck. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=309.0s)]
*  He comes to the gym and he watches me spar Marvin Vittori. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=310.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=313.0s)]
*  And then we spar Marvin Vittori. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=314.0s)]
*  I don't give a fuck. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=315.0s)]
*  Marvin's a friend of mine. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=316.0s)]
*  I'm trying to help him. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=317.0s)]
*  And then fucking three weeks later, you pull out this fucking guy to fight me. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=318.0s)]
*  You know, and then you start betting a prayer that he's going to beat me. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=323.0s)]
*  Like you fucking you fucking rat, dude. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=327.0s)]
*  You come watch me spar and you pull this fucking guy out of your hat and you go bet Alex is going to beat me. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=329.0s)]
*  So it's like, isn't that standard though? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=335.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't know, dude. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=337.0s)]
*  I don't think managers should be in the gym. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=339.0s)]
*  I think it's interesting. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=340.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=341.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=342.0s)]
*  But don't you think they have to kind of get a bead on how guys look and what they're doing? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=343.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=347.0s)]
*  But then it's rough, dude, when you like when you watch me spar and then you're handling the guy and then you're handling a guy like, you know what I'm saying? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=348.0s)]
*  That's a rough one, dude. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=356.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a that's a that's tricky. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=357.0s)]
*  Well, that's why, you know, like elite gyms have closed door sessions. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=359.0s)]
*  Yeah, as it should be. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=363.0s)]
*  You should fucking be able to go watch guys train. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=364.0s)]
*  And again, I always tell guys like my opponents, like you want to come watch me train, come watch me train. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=366.0s)]
*  Bring your best spar partner and come watch me train. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=372.0s)]
*  Well, your style is pretty much the same in every fight. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=375.0s)]
*  It's like a steady forward marching and you're just very good at energy conservation. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=378.0s)]
*  You're just very good at knowing when to sprint. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=386.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, like three weeks prior to the fight, me and my other buddy named Robin Shafar, up and coming boxer. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=389.0s)]
*  Well, he's you know, boxing is the most shady, shady business there is in the fucking world. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=394.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=398.0s)]
*  Makes UFC look like higher education. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=399.0s)]
*  Yeah. Boxing, you guys, is corrupt. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=403.0s)]
*  So he's about 16 to know and the guy could box, man. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=405.0s)]
*  I seen him put work on UFC fighters like I've seen him spar like Bellator champions. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=408.0s)]
*  The guy does work. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=413.0s)]
*  So we did like a no time limit. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=414.0s)]
*  Forty minute boxing just whoever quits. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=415.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=417.0s)]
*  Just because we're just bored. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=418.0s)]
*  You know, CTE special. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=419.0s)]
*  Oh, fuck yeah. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=420.0s)]
*  So it's kind of funny. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=421.0s)]
*  He was actually going through some like personal shit and he beat me. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=423.0s)]
*  He beat me that day. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=426.0s)]
*  But I was hitting him. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=427.0s)]
*  I was like, dude, you just like there's something like there's something with you right now. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=428.0s)]
*  After we get done boxing for like 40, 45 minutes, he starts telling me personal issues. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=431.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh, fuck. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=436.0s)]
*  Yeah, did you already die today? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=437.0s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=438.0s)]
*  I feel I'm about to go for a hike with my girlfriend, bro. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=439.0s)]
*  You contemplating fucking life here. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=442.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, you win, dude. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=444.0s)]
*  You fucking win. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=446.0s)]
*  That's like when Buster Douglas fought Tyson, you know, Buster Douglas's mom died. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=447.0s)]
*  And Buster Douglas had always been like that really talented guy with a wicked jab who just didn't apply himself like many really talented guys. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=451.0s)]
*  And then for that camp, he just went fucking full in. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=459.0s)]
*  Yeah, some guys, some guys do when they have that like, I mean, fuck, even walking, even sometimes me when I walk out, like I got to tell myself like, dude, you are a fucking loser. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=462.0s)]
*  Like you are fucking you don't belong here. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=472.0s)]
*  Like, just go in there and kill this motherfucker. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=474.0s)]
*  You know, like I always joke, I always have like I had a teacher tell me in like 70th grade, one of the one of the few years I went to school. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=476.0s)]
*  She I think it was like her name was like Miss Wajda. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=484.0s)]
*  I don't know history or some shit. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=487.0s)]
*  She looked at me. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=488.0s)]
*  She said, Sean, you're the reason you're the reason why they build prisons. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=489.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=493.0s)]
*  You're a little kid. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=495.0s)]
*  Imagine that naughty, but she she fucking nail on the fucking head. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=496.0s)]
*  Like I was a fucking shit bag, you know, right. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=501.0s)]
*  But shit bags can grow up and become actual men. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=504.0s)]
*  It's totally possible to dismiss a kid at that early in age. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=507.0s)]
*  No, dude, but life is strange, man. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=511.0s)]
*  Like, like they do very good at isolating shitty people. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=513.0s)]
*  So, I mean, I mean, like when I was in elementary school, I was homeschooled in like third, fourth grade till till like, you know, seventh grade and went back to school. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=518.0s)]
*  And then they spotted me right at the back. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=528.0s)]
*  I go, this guy's a problem. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=530.0s)]
*  He's a shit bag like and they'll say they isolate you. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=531.0s)]
*  They put you in like a school where they start two hours later and you end an hour early because they they got to isolate you. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=534.0s)]
*  High school, the same shit went to a continuation school. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=540.0s)]
*  So society like they do well at saying, hey, this kid is going to be a problem. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=542.0s)]
*  We just got to like he's like cancer. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=547.0s)]
*  We just can't let him infect other people. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=548.0s)]
*  Let's fucking put him away. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=550.0s)]
*  And then you go and then you get older and he's going to jail. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=552.0s)]
*  Same shit. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=554.0s)]
*  But it's funny that those kids, a lot of those kids, they can do things. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=555.0s)]
*  They just need a direction. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=559.0s)]
*  They need something. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=561.0s)]
*  And martial arts is the best thing for those kids. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=562.0s)]
*  Every one of them. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=564.0s)]
*  When people say, what's the best thing about bullies or best thing rather to deal with bullies? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=565.0s)]
*  My teach them how to fight. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=569.0s)]
*  You teach bullies how to fight. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=571.0s)]
*  They're not going to want to be beating people up there. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=572.0s)]
*  If you teach them how to train with real people, they're not going to be doing that. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=575.0s)]
*  Man, I always say like MMA, like even like soldiers with PTSD. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=578.0s)]
*  That's like, you know, I mean, I have a little bit growing up. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=581.0s)]
*  Like just not even know what the fuck. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=584.0s)]
*  I always thought like it sounds fucked up, but I've always like when you hear like soldiers talking about PTSD, I'm like, you fucking pussies. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=586.0s)]
*  Like this is how I was when I was a kid. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=593.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=595.0s)]
*  Like, well, you know, at 20 years old, like, you know, I can't go in public or I can't sleep at night. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=596.0s)]
*  I have like I'm like, what the fuck's wrong with you fucking pussy? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=601.0s)]
*  Like, give me a gun. I'll fucking shoot some of the fucking head right now. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=604.0s)]
*  I don't give a fuck. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=606.0s)]
*  But then I realized that like me, I grew up so fucked up that that was my way of life. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=607.0s)]
*  But I couldn't imagine being a normal motherfucker just to be a normal guy trying to fuck the high school prom queen going to parties. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=615.0s)]
*  And all of a sudden you turn 24 and then like the veils lifted and you're like, who the fuck am I? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=622.0s)]
*  So like once I kind of realized that I had a lot more respect for him. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=627.0s)]
*  But you know what I was going with that is like training, man. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=630.0s)]
*  If you guys if you guys have some fucked up issues and demons, man, like train and a lot of people that train are fucked up. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=633.0s)]
*  So you have this good like brother ship. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=639.0s)]
*  Yes. Yes. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=641.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's fucking did me wonders. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=642.0s)]
*  Oh, man. Me too. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=644.0s)]
*  So many people I know, too. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=646.0s)]
*  So many like lost people who are some of the most exceptional people that I know because they went through that. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=647.0s)]
*  I remember the first time in my life that I ever felt happiness. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=653.0s)]
*  Like even when I think about it, it makes my eyes water. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=656.0s)]
*  I was like 14 years old, you know, I was just a fucking fuck up loser, man. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=659.0s)]
*  And my mom brought me to an inmate gym and I got the shit kicked out of me. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=664.0s)]
*  Just fucking like got the bloody fucking nose. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=668.0s)]
*  You know, Paul Herrera. Yep. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=671.0s)]
*  So Paul Herrera used to have a gym empire. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=673.0s)]
*  The headhunter. But he never he never trained like he was never there. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=675.0s)]
*  He was always in the business trying to fucking peddle, you know, fucking juice or something. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=679.0s)]
*  So it just be me and like probably 14 to 21 year old. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=683.0s)]
*  We just be in the cage with four else gloves fighting. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=688.0s)]
*  So the first day I went there, I mean, fucking bloody no. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=690.0s)]
*  I was thinking of Paul Blantell. Paul Herrera was the guy who fought Big Daddy Goodrich. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=693.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was the one who fucking got the elbows. Oh, Jesus. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=697.0s)]
*  With the fireman's carry. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=699.0s)]
*  Yeah. So fucking the first day I trained there, man, I mean, I got the shit kicked out. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=700.0s)]
*  I mean, I was so happy. I remember walking out like, wow, this is what it feels like to be happy. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=704.0s)]
*  Like I've never fucking felt this, you know, you got it all out of your body. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=709.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I was like, fuck, I'm addicted. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=712.0s)]
*  Even going into that, I was like I was like 14, 15. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=714.0s)]
*  I had like crazy racist views. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=717.0s)]
*  Like, I mean, I was like a little fucking Hitler youth, which is fine to make fun of a boost. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=719.0s)]
*  But like, let's get you not do you like I was like I was on a fucked up path. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=723.0s)]
*  Even like, you know, I always like wearing white shirts and boots and jeans. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=728.0s)]
*  I stopped wearing this. I used to wear this. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=732.0s)]
*  This is all I wore as a kid, but I stopped wearing it once I started training [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=735.0s)]
*  because I thought it looked too much like a white supremacist. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=739.0s)]
*  So I was like, I can't wear this shit. A white shirt? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=743.0s)]
*  Well, because you wear your white shirt, your boot. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=745.0s)]
*  You ever seen American History X? Oh, OK. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=747.0s)]
*  So like it's like the standard you look like a white supremacist. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=749.0s)]
*  And I love that shit. When I was a kid, I loved that shit. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=753.0s)]
*  That's why I wanted like I want to look like a piece of shit white supremacist. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=755.0s)]
*  So when I started training and I was like, oh, dude, you like you were lost. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=759.0s)]
*  You're like, that's not who you are. That's not what you believe. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=762.0s)]
*  I like went away from it. I grew my hair out fucking super long, got the name Tarzan. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=765.0s)]
*  I didn't dress like that. And now as an adult, I'm comfortable with who I am. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=769.0s)]
*  I'm not fucking I'm not a racist. I love everybody. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=774.0s)]
*  Now I could go back to like my roots of being just a white trash motherfucker. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=776.0s)]
*  That's nice, man. I really accepted who I am. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=780.0s)]
*  You know, well, it's it's so interesting to watch people go through these changes in life in these trials through adversity and become like a very interesting person at the end of it. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=782.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. You know, like I, you know, I know you say a lot of outrageous shit and it's very funny. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=793.0s)]
*  But you also say some very good shit, you know, like this speech that you gave when you're talking about America, like that speech, the post fight press conference speech. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=798.0s)]
*  It's fucking great speech. Well, you know what it is, you mean I I'm white trash. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=806.0s)]
*  Like I like what I mean by that is like I am the future of America. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=810.0s)]
*  So like like both my parents work and my dad's piece shit. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=813.0s)]
*  But fucking in hell probably right now. But both my parents worked. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=818.0s)]
*  They made good money, but we were poor. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=822.0s)]
*  We were poor because after the cigarettes, the bars and the fast food were fucking poor. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=824.0s)]
*  I mean, like, you know, we had like fucking I can't tell you you'd find a piece of paper and you wrinkled up. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=828.0s)]
*  You use that fucking toilet paper, you know, every time I wipe my ass with a piece of fucking paper, you get laying around. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=834.0s)]
*  But this is like it's like this unholy alliance that corporations are doing to America. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=841.0s)]
*  They want women working. They want lower wages and they want more consumerism. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=848.0s)]
*  And it's like I don't mean it like I'm not sexist like, oh, put women back in the kitchen. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=854.0s)]
*  You know, they suck. And I love fucking women. You know, take off the burka. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=859.0s)]
*  We're a fucking bikini and huzzah. But but you know what I'm saying? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=861.0s)]
*  But we're truly like in a weird time to where like corporations are eroding eroding values of America. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=867.0s)]
*  Well, they act within their best interests and their best interests to keep people consumers and make sure that people just pay attention only to stupid shit. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=875.0s)]
*  You have Wal-Mart in the in the in your phone now. You want to go. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=886.0s)]
*  I mean, I can't even even me. I'm to blame. There's some times you guys where I'm like, man, I'm a little depressed. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=890.0s)]
*  I don't know if I can just in a bad mood. I'm like, I'm going to go on Amazon. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=894.0s)]
*  Let's see what the fucking Amazon fairy is recommending me today. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=898.0s)]
*  Maybe I could maybe I could find something that'll give me a little serotonin boost. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=901.0s)]
*  Find some happiness in a one click. Yeah. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=904.0s)]
*  And then so it's like you and then you have like and then on top of that, now we go full circle. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=907.0s)]
*  You have two parents working and I'm going mostly on the West Coast. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=911.0s)]
*  You have shitty fucking kids, dude. Las Vegas graduation rates less than 50 percent. High school dropout. No GED. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=915.0s)]
*  I'm not one to talk. But how do you raise how do you raise a family, a successful family when your kids are being raised? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=922.0s)]
*  By the system, right? By fucking tick tock. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=930.0s)]
*  After my fight, I had the doctor, you know, good, good guy, the doctor you see. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=933.0s)]
*  He comes up to me, he's like, hey, why are you why are you talking bad about Las Vegas? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=937.0s)]
*  I'm like, well, Dr. John, or your name is Dr. Eaclid, dude. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=941.0s)]
*  What school do your kids go to? And he just like gets a big like smirk. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=944.0s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, I'm sure you're paying like 50 50 plus year. Right. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=948.0s)]
*  Educate your kids like it's so again, man. I mean, where's the reset button? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=952.0s)]
*  Maybe there is no reset button. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=956.0s)]
*  I think the reset button is teaching people that there's things that you can do in life that can transform you. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=958.0s)]
*  And I think as weird as that sounds, a lot of people learn that through watching people like you evolve through fighting, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=964.0s)]
*  because it's the most difficult thing you do outside of war and being a cop and being a fireman. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=971.0s)]
*  It's the most difficult physical pursuit that a person can get involved with for a living. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=976.0s)]
*  But again, we're talking on such a deeper fundamental level. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=981.0s)]
*  If you have no belief like we could say America's becoming atheist, like we could say that if you have no belief, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=985.0s)]
*  if you have no moral right, no wrong, right. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=991.0s)]
*  And you're not taught this from like a stable family and you're being raised. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=994.0s)]
*  I mean, like literally America's becoming like communist China where like we're letting our school system dictate values and beliefs. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=998.0s)]
*  We're letting the system tell you what your kids are. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1005.0s)]
*  And again, I'm agnostic, so I'm not I'm not telling everybody to go find Jesus. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1007.0s)]
*  You know, if you're going to find somebody, at least let it be fucking Jesus. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1010.0s)]
*  Right. But I mean, how do you how do you fix a moral decay of a society when that's just where we're going? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1013.0s)]
*  You got to talk about even and even fucking communist China will will mitigate what shows on TikTok. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1022.0s)]
*  But they give us utter fucking filth. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1028.0s)]
*  But it's just I know exactly what you're saying. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1030.0s)]
*  And, you know, I went through the public school system, but I did it in the 1980s. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1032.0s)]
*  That's very different. Worse. Yeah, it's a lot worse now. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1036.0s)]
*  But I mean, how do you like again, like if you were, you know, if you were God Joe Rogan, how do you fix this? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1039.0s)]
*  You got to you got to pump a lot of money into inner cities. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1044.0s)]
*  You got to you got to figure out a way to make programs. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1047.0s)]
*  And there's there's places in this country that for decades and decades have been filled with crime and gang violence and drug addiction. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1052.0s)]
*  And that's all they know. And that's that's the standard of their community. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1061.0s)]
*  And that's what you grow up with. And that's what you see. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1064.0s)]
*  And if we don't fix that, the odds of those people coming out of there, I mean, there's a few that come out of there that become, you know, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1066.0s)]
*  whether they're artists or athletes or whatever it is, they find a way through. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1073.0s)]
*  They figure it out. But they're the rare ones. OK, they're the rare ones. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1078.0s)]
*  Which we got to do is create systems where you have opportunity for kids and also mitigate the crime and mitigate the violence and whatever the fuck has to be done. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1081.0s)]
*  Look, if they can dump billions of dollars into Ukraine, his fucking name, they could dump billions of dollars into. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1093.0s)]
*  I mean, there's so many different things that they pump money into, but they've never pumped any money into Baltimore. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1099.0s)]
*  They never pumped any money into Detroit. Like, try to figure out a way like if you can like to think about like what Hal Burton did during the Iraq War. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1105.0s)]
*  They got these no bid contracts where Cheney was the fucking CEO of Hal Burton. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1113.0s)]
*  He becomes the vice president of the United States and then the company he works for gets these no bid contracts to rebuild shit we blow up, which is wild. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1119.0s)]
*  But there's profit in that. Right. So what about figuring out a way to funnel that profit into fixing inner cities? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1127.0s)]
*  If we have less losers, we have a better America. And if you give people more opportunity, you have less losers. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1134.0s)]
*  You know, so even let's go on the smallest scale of sex. Like how old are you, Joe? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1141.0s)]
*  Fifty five. When did when is the first time you started watching porn? Can I ask that question? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1147.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was VHS tapes came out when I was like, I was like 15, 15 or 16. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1151.0s)]
*  OK, so I mean, we had my brother. So my brother is a few years older than me. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1156.0s)]
*  So he remembers things that I don't. But he'll like tell me I'm like, oh shit, I forgot about that. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1160.0s)]
*  So I was watching porn in like early elementary school, like first grade and second grade, like because we had like a communal porn box. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1166.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Like my dad, my dad, my dad had this like fucking old school water heater box just stacked with fucking porn. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1174.0s)]
*  You kids don't know about this, but we had like the communal VCR. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1185.0s)]
*  So like you would go to you would go to watch Aladdin, you know, and all of a sudden like Buffuckers 29 is on TV. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1188.0s)]
*  So I started watching porn when I was like, I don't know, I was jerking off to fucking third grade. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1195.0s)]
*  My fucking third grade, my fucking third grade teacher. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1201.0s)]
*  But like but I was surrounded by that. Right. Right. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1203.0s)]
*  So so already I'm at this moral decay and it was like and I was the odd one. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1206.0s)]
*  I was the odd one, man. Like I had to go fucking find the porn. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1213.0s)]
*  I had to go. My brother always jokes. My brother always jokes that like when he would like take my dad's porn tape out of the VCR, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1216.0s)]
*  he would always have to rewind it to where he started. So no one knew he was watching porn. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1223.0s)]
*  But then he jokes. He's always know where my dad's coming now. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1227.0s)]
*  You know, you just shut the fucking thing up. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1232.0s)]
*  How gross. But so yeah, right. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1236.0s)]
*  Fucking yeah, my dad was fucking I'm surprised I'm not more fucked up. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1238.0s)]
*  But you know, so what I'm saying alive now, no, he died of cancer is actually fucking fucking good. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1242.0s)]
*  But it's kind of funny. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1250.0s)]
*  Like so I'm an oddity. I'm an odd. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1253.0s)]
*  I'm jerking off from a little fucking kid. You know, I'm an oddity. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1256.0s)]
*  Like I'm fucking violent. But now but now, did you give a little kid a cell phone? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1259.0s)]
*  And you have two parents working next thing, you know, I mean, you fucking go on Instagram. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1266.0s)]
*  You got titties in your face. Like now we're like hyper sexualizing kids. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1271.0s)]
*  And I think that's also a big moral decay because the moment you become hyper sexualized and I can't stop thinking about fucking pussy and dick like. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1275.0s)]
*  Right. It starts fucking your brain up at such a young age. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1282.0s)]
*  And it's a very unusual way to give it to kids where they have instant access to watching porn on their phone. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1285.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then we have no morals. There's no there's no reason not to be a shitty person these days. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1291.0s)]
*  You know, you ain't going to heaven. Just fucking go fucking fuck the chick coming or like you don't got to raise your fucking kid. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1296.0s)]
*  So I think one of the best things we can do as society is mitigate, mitigate sex because that is like the gateway to like that's why we want to make money. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1302.0s)]
*  That's why kids want to sell drugs. That's why kids want to go fucking party. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1311.0s)]
*  There is no fucking pussy like, you know, no one no one fucking like no one. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1314.0s)]
*  It's like if there is no fucking pussy, no one's going to a party. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1318.0s)]
*  What I want to go to a party and drink. I'm going to go to get fucking pussy, you know. Right. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1321.0s)]
*  Yeah, I always joke. I say no one shoots up a school because they have too much fucking pussy. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1325.0s)]
*  That's true. But there are some good things about it. There are some good things about it. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1329.0s)]
*  Oh, for sure. There's good things about it. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1332.0s)]
*  But it is weird when it's like hyper sexualizing kids. It's not good. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1334.0s)]

*  Yeah, it's true. Norm was a gangster. He didn't even tell anybody he had cancer. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1373.0s)]
*  Yeah, didn't tell anybody. He was a fucking man, dude. My friend Adam was a very good friend of his. He didn't even know. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1381.0s)]
*  He just fucking went off to Canada to die. Solid fucking guy too, man. Like super solid. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1386.0s)]
*  You never think he was like a solid moral human being. But like as you got older, you started showing that like, hey, I'm a decent human being like, oh shit. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1392.0s)]
*  No, he was a great guy. He was a maniac, though. He was really just randomly for some reason twice. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1399.0s)]
*  I was on flights with him sitting right next to him just totally randomly. It was crazy. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1404.0s)]
*  And one time we were on this flight and we're talking and he was telling me, yeah, I stopped smoking. I don't smoke anymore. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1409.0s)]
*  And we're talking about smoking and this and that. And I'm like, what was it about smoking? He's telling me the whole deal. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1416.0s)]
*  The moment we land, he goes right into a fucking store and buys a pack of cigarettes and he's lighting the cigarette up before he gets out the door. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1422.0s)]
*  I go, I thought you quit smoking. I did. But then I started talking about it. I want to smoke. He was lighting it inside before he went out the door. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1430.0s)]
*  Hey, well, fucking man had a good life, dude. He had a great life. Fucking cancer, man. My dad died of fucking cancer. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1438.0s)]
*  It's horrible shit. My dad, dude, he was so fucked up on pills that he had every kind of cancer, like, I mean, like body brain cancer, every kind of cancer. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1444.0s)]
*  And I think the doctors were like, dude, how did you not know something was wrong? [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1454.0s)]
*  Like at this point, you should have been like, there's something wrong with you. Right. Right. Yeah. Fucking A, dude. Yeah. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1459.0s)]
*  And then he was like, my dad was such a fucking coward, though. Like he was the kind of guy like, no, Norm did the right thing. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1465.0s)]
*  He's like, I'm going to go to Canada. I'm going to die with dignity. No, fuck that, dude. My dad was like, give me all the drugs. I'm just going to ride this bitch out. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1469.0s)]
*  Well, if you're doing pills already and they tell you you're fucked. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1475.0s)]
*  The other thing, do pills, man. You want to talk about like the corruption. Like, I don't know. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1480.0s)]

*  Oh, yeah. It's the worst. And, you know, that Sackler family, they just fucking bribed their way out of being prosecuted for that. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1489.0s)]
*  They just gave up six billion dollars so that they're immune to prosecution. It's fucking evil shit what they did. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1495.0s)]
*  They knew that stuff was addictive. They knew that people were going to get hooked. They knew it was going to ruin lives. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1501.0s)]
*  I mean, you're in the entertainment. I'm sure you deal with it, dude. It makes you zombies. Like, like pills suck the soul from you. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1506.0s)]
*  When I was in my motorcycle accident, man, I fucking tore. I'm still missing my quadricep. I fucking I left part of my kneecap on the road and like I would not take pills just because I watched it my whole life growing up. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1511.0s)]
*  I was like, fuck that. I'm just going to be in pain. What's wrong with your quadricep? So it's torn. It's gone. So you don't have a quad? Yeah. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1523.0s)]

*  So I got to the point where it's like I mean, I can go get a fix. I'm going to be out for a year. So, you know, I'll deal with that. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1534.0s)]
*  How would they fix it? Probably just like, you know, maybe it would be a pain in the ass. They probably have to like lengthen it. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1540.0s)]
*  It's probably dead now, but I think they probably could. But I'm going to be out for a year or two years. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1546.0s)]
*  How much of it does it affect your movement? Have you compensated with the other muscles? If I was if I was athletic, it'd be really hard for me to fight. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1550.0s)]
*  But I stand like a fucking tree. You know, I'm the easiest. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1560.0s)]
*  Like, it's so funny, guys will come to the gym like D1 wrestlers. And I'm like, I'm like, listen, dude, you could shoot on me. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1564.0s)]

*  There's good men out there, but it's hard to be a good man. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1771.0s)]
*  So it's a long path. It's a very difficult path. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1774.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. And then, you know, fucking good men make fucked up kids. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1777.0s)]

*  Mm hmm. They see me and they're like, oh, yeah, man, like I was fucked. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1848.0s)]
*  I watched my mom get the shit kicked out of her, too. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1851.0s)]
*  You know, like I've dodged a beer bottle on Christmas morning. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1853.0s)]
*  You know, so I think that's why people like me, because a lot of people are fucked up. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1856.0s)]
*  A lot of people are fucked up. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1861.0s)]
*  But you've managed to go through being fucked up to becoming one of the best fighters in the world. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1862.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the hard path. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1867.0s)]
*  Oh, man, I was obsessive. Like, like, I mean, when I was. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1869.0s)]
*  So I didn't really like when I was fucking angry, dude, like, I mean, I wanted to fucking kill someone. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1873.0s)]
*  So I was a kid. I'd walk around with a fucking knife, just hoping I'd fucking like, fuck, I still want to kill somebody. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1876.0s)]
*  It just would make me feel good. You know, I just fucking just fucking love it. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1882.0s)]
*  But so you had that kind of anger growing up and I needed fucking. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1886.0s)]
*  So that's why I was also white supremacist. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1890.0s)]
*  I mean, could you picture being like, can you picture? [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1893.0s)]
*  I don't even know what this is like. And no one even interjected in my life. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1896.0s)]
*  I remember me being 12 years old, walking around doing the fucking Hill Hitler sleep with a fucking swastika on my arm. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1899.0s)]
*  At no point did anybody say like, hey, maybe we should help this fucking kid. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1904.0s)]
*  You know, I was in a I remember like seventh grade, I took a permanent marker. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1909.0s)]
*  I drew a swastika on my arm and the teacher took me outside and like berated me, like pretty much call me a piece of shit. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1914.0s)]
*  Like, you know what that fucking means? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1921.0s)]
*  Like, you know, like you're like just you're a fucking piece of shit. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1923.0s)]
*  At no point was he like, hey, man, like, why is this fucking like 12 year old kid swastika on his arm? [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1927.0s)]
*  Right. It's fucking. Yeah. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1933.0s)]
*  The system's weird, dude. Systems. Well, life can certainly be weird if you got those circumstances. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1935.0s)]
*  Yeah. You're like best case scenario from those circumstances. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1940.0s)]
*  Training, man. It's fucking training. I mean, dude, I was so fucking angry. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1943.0s)]
*  Like and that was the best thing about fighting for me is I could go in the garage every Friday night, Saturday night and just hit the bag all night long. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1946.0s)]
*  And when my brother's party, my brother had these like so we didn't have like we had parents, but like my dad's probably trying to fuck the girls and my brother brought over for the high school parties, you know. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1954.0s)]
*  So my dad's out there, probably giving him drugs and shit. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1963.0s)]
*  So like I would just be in the garage while these fucking parties and debaucheries and fucking threesomes and foursomes are taking place. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1967.0s)]
*  And I would just be in the garage, fucking smack in the back. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1973.0s)]
*  And then like I was I didn't fit in. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1976.0s)]
*  So like it was it was really just a way for Sean's not weird. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1979.0s)]
*  He's a fighter. Sean's not the fucking weirdo that doesn't know how to talk to people. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1982.0s)]
*  He's a fighter. And that gave you your identity. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1985.0s)]
*  It gave him my identity. I mean, every night I'd be running that night. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1987.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, where did you start? What gym? [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1990.0s)]
*  Empire. I was started when I was about 14. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1993.0s)]
*  And where was that? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1995.0s)]
*  Corona, California. And then I had my first like smoker fight at like 14. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=1996.0s)]
*  So I mean, I'm fucking old now, you guys. That was before amateur. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2002.0s)]
*  How old are you? [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2005.0s)]
*  I'm 32. That was like before amateur MMA. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2006.0s)]
*  So it's like pretty much what you would do is you would just show up. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2009.0s)]
*  They put chairs in, they buy tickets and random people just show up and you'd fight. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2012.0s)]
*  Yeah. So that's how I started. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2016.0s)]
*  And you didn't even want to fight. I didn't want to fight. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2018.0s)]
*  I was like, Paul here was a fucking scumbag. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2020.0s)]
*  He was just like, you would show up and be like, well, if you're if you're training here, you're fighting here. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2022.0s)]
*  Go sell tickets. Maybe in 14. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2026.0s)]
*  I mean, I think my first fight was against guys like 28 years old. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2028.0s)]
*  Like, you know, my fucking nuts barely dropped, dude. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2030.0s)]
*  But yeah, anger, anger is a hell of a fucking thing, dude. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2034.0s)]
*  Yeah. And it's impossible to grow up like that and not have anger. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2037.0s)]
*  You know, it's weird, though. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2041.0s)]
*  And the thing is, though, it's not like and I try to tell people, like, I'm not necessarily anger. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2043.0s)]
*  I'm not angry. Like, like, I would love to fucking cut somebody open and I'm not angry. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2046.0s)]
*  Like, it just sounds nice. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2052.0s)]
*  You got to get that out of your system, buddy. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2057.0s)]
*  I think I just barred three times. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2059.0s)]
*  But like, you got to understand, man. You got to understand, bro. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2061.0s)]
*  You got to understand, like people like, oh, go to therapy. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2063.0s)]
*  Like, your brain, dude, like the damage is done, bro. It's unfixable. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2066.0s)]
*  Like, I mean, there is one. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2070.0s)]
*  Do you think that sparring and training is a form of therapy? [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2071.0s)]
*  I fuck with anything I spar so much. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2074.0s)]
*  And that's why I have such a good style where I don't get hit because I love to spar. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2076.0s)]
*  And if I got hit, I couldn't spar. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2080.0s)]
*  Well, your control of distance, your distance management because of all those rounds. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2082.0s)]
*  The UFC did a test where they let us wear a mouthpiece. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2086.0s)]
*  And I think that, like, my whole training camp, I like I barely got hit. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2088.0s)]
*  And I sparred, like I sparred the most and took the least amount of damage than anybody in the program. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2092.0s)]
*  Because you spar so much. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2097.0s)]
*  I spar so much. But you like... [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2098.0s)]
*  Is that the majority of your training? [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2100.0s)]
*  Yeah, sparred. I really sparred. I hit pads occasionally, but it's all live goes. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2101.0s)]
*  Really? All live goes. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2105.0s)]
*  What about strength and conditioning? You doing any of that? [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2106.0s)]
*  Not really, no. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2108.0s)]
*  Really? It's just sparring? [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2109.0s)]
*  Just sparring, man. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2110.0s)]
*  There's no better way to get in shape for fighting than fighting. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2111.0s)]
*  And it's fun, dude. It's fucking fun, man. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2113.0s)]
*  Like, you know, I'm such a nicer, better person, you know. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2115.0s)]
*  Like, after I go and try to fucking kill a man, I come home and my girlfriend, even she wants to pick a five-mil baby, it's okay. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2118.0s)]
*  Don't worry about it. Like, don't trip. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2123.0s)]
*  Like, what did I fuck up? Tell me. Tell me. I'll fix it. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2125.0s)]
*  You know, like, dude, training, training's fucking nice, dude. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2128.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2132.0s)]
*  But I mean, dude, I don't like... [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2133.0s)]
*  I think a lot of people, though, have these crazy homocellular urges, dude. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2134.0s)]
*  I think we all want to fucking shank somebody, shiv somebody. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2137.0s)]
*  There's a lot of people out there that have that. Yeah, there's a lot of unresolved anger. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2140.0s)]
*  Bro, I used to sleep in my mom's bed a lot, right? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2145.0s)]
*  Because I thought, I mean, we're talking about like when I shunted in like elementary school, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2148.0s)]
*  because I thought my dad was going to fucking kill my mom. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2151.0s)]
*  So every night, dude, I would go to bed thinking like, oh shit, my mom's going to die tonight, you know. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2153.0s)]
*  But his word's not mine, so like... [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2159.0s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2161.0s)]
*  I mean, you got to learn to laugh at it, right? At least he didn't fuck me. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2162.0s)]
*  I mean, I have some bad dreams, but I'm just going to say those are bad dreams, right? [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2168.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2172.0s)]
*  So yeah, you know, repressed memories are bad dreams. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2174.0s)]
*  It's always better to just say bad dreams, right? [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2177.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2179.0s)]

*  like listen to your mom get fucked by your dad because like you're so afraid she's going to fucking die. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2193.0s)]

*  Yeah, so there's one night. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2199.0s)]

*  You know, she grew up in a boxcar. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2211.0s)]
*  How do you fix that? [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2212.0s)]

*  Jesus Christ. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2244.0s)]
*  So me being like third grade, there's a fucking dildo next to me. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2248.0s)]
*  There's fucking fleas jumping all over me. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2251.0s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2253.0s)]
*  So my dad, my dad gets on top of my mom. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2254.0s)]
*  And she says, I'm going to fucking kill it. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2256.0s)]
*  Maybe it's just rough stuff. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2258.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2259.0s)]
*  Maybe they're going to grab the dildo afterwards. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2260.0s)]
*  So my dad gets on top of my mom and he starts fucking like strangling her. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2262.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2265.0s)]
*  And he's like, I'm going to fucking kill you tonight. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2266.0s)]
*  So maybe a little kid, I get up and like, fuck. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2268.0s)]
*  The only thing I see is the guitar. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2270.0s)]
*  My sister's guitar. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2271.0s)]
*  She's still mad at me about it. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2272.0s)]
*  I grabbed the guitar. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2273.0s)]
*  I just fucking smack it off his head. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2274.0s)]
*  Grab the phone, call the cops, run down the hill. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2275.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2277.0s)]
*  I'm on that dumb bitch bells. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2278.0s)]
*  I'm out of jail. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2279.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2280.0s)]
*  But you know, like, and this is where it's fucked up, dude. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2282.0s)]
*  Like my mom, that's where like my mom grew up in a fucking boxcar in Death Valley, bro. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2284.0s)]
*  Like, yeah. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2289.0s)]
*  Like, how do you, you know, how do you fix that generation of fuck? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2291.0s)]
*  You do. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2294.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, yeah. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2295.0s)]
*  No, that's the way you do by becoming you. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2296.0s)]
*  I don't drink. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2298.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2299.0s)]
*  That's literally the only way. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2300.0s)]
*  Like someone has to come out of that. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2301.0s)]
*  They go like there's a way out of this. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2303.0s)]
*  And well, the thing is, dude, I'm not like, I mean, I had a little interesting childhood, you know, a lot of repressed memories and bad dreams and shit. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2305.0s)]
*  We don't need to talk about. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2312.0s)]
*  But but like, man, I'm calm and I'm calm and I'm way I'm way more I'm way more than you think. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2313.0s)]
*  Yeah, they just don't have a voice. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2319.0s)]
*  Yeah. And this is like, you know, like you'd especially say like the black communities, the poor communities, man. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2321.0s)]
*  I'm fucking guys without fucking dads like fucking rough, dude. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2325.0s)]
*  Fucking yeah, life is nice. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2329.0s)]
*  Hard, dude. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2331.0s)]
*  That's fucking hard. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2332.0s)]
*  Yeah, but it really is. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2333.0s)]
*  There's that's the best path. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2335.0s)]
*  Like martial arts are the best path to recover from that. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2337.0s)]
*  The only issue with martial arts, though, dude, and this is like and this is why I tell people and if you got a kid who's trains and let's just say you're training without what I'll tell you, dude. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2340.0s)]
*  And this is factual and you guys should always understand this. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2350.0s)]
*  I tell every everybody that comes in the gym. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2353.0s)]
*  I'd one guy, little Billy Bob's a pancreas champion. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2356.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh, that's cool. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2359.0s)]
*  And I tell him this when I was a kid, I was like 14 training at a gym and there was a guy named Zach Light on a fucking old school. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2361.0s)]
*  I know that guy, but he was like, you know, I'm 14 years old. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2368.0s)]
*  This guy's like here to me. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2371.0s)]
*  I'm watching him teach cardio kickboxing. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2372.0s)]
*  I'm watching him teach like Jiu Jitsu and like he'll spar and fuck me up. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2374.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh, man, this guy's so fucking cool. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2377.0s)]
*  He's the life that I want. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2379.0s)]
*  And then hindsight, this man probably hates his fucking life. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2381.0s)]
*  He's probably fucking half brain dead. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2385.0s)]
*  He's teaching cardio kickboxing classes for 20 bucks, 20 bucks a class. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2387.0s)]
*  So it's like whenever you look at you see fighters and you want to be this understand. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2391.0s)]
*  Most of us, most of us end up poor, broke and regretting our life choices. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2396.0s)]
*  Like it's easier ways to make money, guys. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2403.0s)]
*  I love true. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2406.0s)]
*  I love fighting. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2407.0s)]
*  It was fighting. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2408.0s)]
*  I'd probably be a fucking I want to be a serial killer. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2409.0s)]
*  I'd probably just be just a fuck head in jail with a swastika on my arm. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2411.0s)]
*  But don't you think that like that path? [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2414.0s)]
*  If if you're you, you've got to be 100 percent obsessed. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2419.0s)]
*  If you want to be successful. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2425.0s)]
*  But even then, man, I mean, I see guys so often in life. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2426.0s)]
*  It's kind of funny talking about you've seen money. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2429.0s)]
*  I was I have a buddy named my phone. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2432.0s)]
*  No, fuck his name. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2434.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, Kyle, Kyle, Kyle, some Brazilian guy, contenders guy, really good, really good guy. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2435.0s)]
*  I'm trying to fight Bo Nickle. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2440.0s)]
*  Anyway, you've see guy. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2442.0s)]
*  He just bought his first house, having a kid. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2444.0s)]
*  Dude, like the average house in Brazil to buy is like two hundred thousand dollars, like maybe even less. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2446.0s)]
*  I mean, that's like a nice house, a nice house, an average house. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2452.0s)]
*  And America's four or five. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2455.0s)]
*  So it's like, you know, you see a lot more foreigners in the sport. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2457.0s)]
*  And you're like, why are there more foreigners in the sport? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2460.0s)]
*  America's pussies and like, no, because they can afford it. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2462.0s)]
*  You go when you fight, they're signing guys at 10 and 10, like really 10 and 10, like 10 and 10 on four fights, man. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2465.0s)]
*  Three fights, you get cut. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2471.0s)]
*  So they sign these Brazilians, these daggies, what the fuck you want to call them. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2472.0s)]
*  They go home with their 20K and they're living life good. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2476.0s)]
*  They're living life good. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2479.0s)]
*  How do you live on 20K and 20K? [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2481.0s)]
*  And pay your manager and pay your trainers and pay your gym fees and food and proper nutrition. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2483.0s)]
*  So, again, I think that's also a big reason why we're seeing less Americans because, you know, they're taking our jobs like fuck. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2489.0s)]
*  You know, it's easier to import them, man. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2498.0s)]
*  It's easier import fighters and they go back home to Dagestan, Brazil and they live on their let's just say they make shit money. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2500.0s)]
*  They're happy. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2506.0s)]
*  Well, it's also who's talented and why they why are they so driven and who's training them and what kind of environment. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2507.0s)]
*  America is the best. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2514.0s)]
*  We have the best athletes in the world, man. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2515.0s)]
*  If there was like NFL money in the UFC. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2517.0s)]
*  And I people think that I hate on you. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2521.0s)]
*  See, dude, I make more money you've seen and I should make my entire fucking life like I am a fucking company man. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2524.0s)]
*  Like if it wasn't for the UC broad fucking like a piece of shit, probably a fucking drug addict. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2529.0s)]
*  But if there was NFL money in the UC, we would dominate, dominate the UC. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2534.0s)]
*  There would not be one foreign fucking champion. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2541.0s)]
*  But do you think that a lot of those guys who play sports like they play they play football or they play basketball? [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2543.0s)]
*  Do you think they would want to fight because you have to have a very different kind of mentality to want to get into a ring or a cage with another man? [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2550.0s)]
*  It's different than playing a sport. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2559.0s)]
*  If it was a pressure, the consequences, if it was a high school thing and you could go get a D1 scholarship and you could leave the ghettos by by being a fighter. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2560.0s)]
*  100 percent. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2570.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2571.0s)]
*  Fuck yeah, man. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2572.0s)]
*  So how do we fix that? [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2573.0s)]
*  Like money in the UFC. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2575.0s)]
*  How the fuck I don't know. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2577.0s)]
*  You know more about that than me. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2578.0s)]
*  Well, there's money in the UFC for guys like you. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2580.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2582.0s)]
*  But that's also in boxing. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2583.0s)]
*  The UFC is better than what like when it comes to how undercard fighters get paid again. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2585.0s)]
*  And this is I'm a company man when it comes to you guys. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2589.0s)]
*  Like most people, most people, most guys, like even if they make fucking 80k a year, 90k a year, that's better than what we should have made. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2592.0s)]
*  We're like we fucking most fucking loser. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2599.0s)]
*  But how do you fix it, man? [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2602.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2605.0s)]
*  I don't think it needs to be fixed. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2607.0s)]
*  What's better now than it's been before? [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2608.0s)]
*  We, you see, let me just say you see has the most pay discrepancy. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2610.0s)]
*  Like when you're talking about like top earnings to lower earnings, I think you see probably has the most. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2613.0s)]
*  I think boxing is worse. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2620.0s)]
*  Well, boxing is worse. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2622.0s)]
*  But I mean, we could say let's exclude boxing. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2623.0s)]
*  But like there's way more money at the top and way less trickle down. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2625.0s)]
*  But I don't give a fuck. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2628.0s)]
*  But it's so hard to get to the top. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2630.0s)]
*  I mean, imagine, imagine just trying to explain to someone what you've done to become a top contender. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2632.0s)]
*  You only need to have one fuck up, one slip up, one mistake, two bad losses, an injury. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2637.0s)]
*  But here's the thing, dude, guys, I'm not like even though we're fucking whores, we're prostitutes. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2644.0s)]

*  But it's not because porn. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2657.0s)]
*  But it's also the ultimate form of entertainment for people that are watching. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2659.0s)]
*  There's nothing more exciting. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2662.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Good fight, man. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2664.0s)]
*  Gagey versus Chandler. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2665.0s)]
*  That was your fight this weekend when you started turning it on in the second round. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2667.0s)]
*  I was at the fucking edge of my seat. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2670.0s)]
*  He's got him. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2672.0s)]

*  Oh, my God. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2675.0s)]
*  That was a front row on that one. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2676.0s)]
*  Insanity. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2678.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2681.0s)]
*  But you know, but again, I'm not one of those guys bitching, complaining about pay. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2682.0s)]
*  I get paid good money. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2684.0s)]
*  I shouldn't be here. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2686.0s)]
*  I shouldn't be making what I'm fucking making in life. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2687.0s)]
*  You gave me an opportunity and you don't know how many how many how many opera you have. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2689.0s)]
*  See, is the common man sport right now. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2694.0s)]
*  Fucking you know, fucking Jamie, if he wanted to, he could train. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2696.0s)]
*  Probably not going to happen, but he could be in the UFC if he wanted to. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2698.0s)]
*  Anybody could do it. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2701.0s)]
*  You know, you let me restart my life and tell me to go be in the NFL. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2702.0s)]
*  Probably not going to happen. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2706.0s)]
*  Go be in the NBA. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2707.0s)]
*  100% not going to happen. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2708.0s)]
*  You have seen is a common man sport. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2709.0s)]
*  Any any person on this planet could wake up one day and be like, I want to be a UFC champion. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2711.0s)]
*  And they could make it get it done. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2715.0s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2716.0s)]
*  I mean, not that easy, but you know, right. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2717.0s)]
*  I know what you're saying. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2720.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2721.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2722.0s)]
*  You see fucking great, dude. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2723.0s)]
*  It's the best best sport in the world and anybody could do it. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2724.0s)]
*  Well, it's it's not for everybody. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2727.0s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2728.0s)]
*  And for a guy to get as far as you've gotten, that's it's the rarest of the rare. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2729.0s)]
*  I mean, you think about how many people are training, how many people have aspirations [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2733.0s)]
*  and then filter them all out to how many people get to headline, you know, a main event. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2736.0s)]
*  Ideally, though, if I could, you know, if I could talk to a kid and they were to tell [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2744.0s)]
*  me they want to be used to if I told them, don't do it. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2747.0s)]
*  Yeah, I would say that too. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2749.0s)]
*  It's so much it's America. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2750.0s)]
*  So so easily. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2751.0s)]
*  Unless you're fucking completely fully obsessed. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2752.0s)]
*  I mean, unless that's what you want to do. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2755.0s)]
*  That's the thing you think about all day long, because if you don't, there's someone out [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2758.0s)]
*  there that does. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2761.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of you see fires guys that suck. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2762.0s)]
*  There's a lot of motherfuckers that suck. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2763.0s)]
*  Like, I mean, I get so extreme is like extreme is like open doors. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2765.0s)]
*  Anybody could come. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2770.0s)]
*  Guys are in camp. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2771.0s)]
*  There's some guys are badass. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2772.0s)]
*  But there's some UFC fighters like, dude, you fucking suck. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2773.0s)]
*  How the fuck did you get here? [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2776.0s)]
*  How the fuck did what short notice fight did you get? [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2778.0s)]
*  Like, you are a sacrificial lamb. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2781.0s)]
*  Well, there's definitely a few of those. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2783.0s)]
*  Oh, there's a lot of those in the UFC. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2785.0s)]
*  A lot of those. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2786.0s)]
*  That's a weird one. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2787.0s)]
*  The short notice fight against the top contender. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2788.0s)]
*  Like, you see some of those every now and then you're like, Jesus. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2790.0s)]
*  Generally, that's how you get in the UC, though. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2794.0s)]
*  You generally get in the UC. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2796.0s)]
*  I mean, I think I took a two week notice, a week notice on my first UC fight. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2797.0s)]
*  And that's why if you're not in the UC, you got to stay ready. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2801.0s)]
*  You got to build make way. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2804.0s)]
*  You got to stay fucking ready. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2805.0s)]
*  But yeah, man, greatest greatest fucking sport in the world. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2806.0s)]
*  You fucking love you. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2809.0s)]
*  Hopefully I can fight is he the China's little slut. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2810.0s)]
*  What is what is the status of like who is it? [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2813.0s)]
*  So right now, Whitaker is fighting this weekend against Drekas Duposi. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2819.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2824.0s)]
*  And that will probably that will determine. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2825.0s)]
*  But I mean, nobody I mean, fucking dude, how many times like this would be their third, fourth fight with Whitaker and Izzy. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2827.0s)]
*  Yeah, but the last one was so close. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2832.0s)]
*  That's why it's interesting to people. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2834.0s)]
*  And, you know, we'll see what happens with Duposi. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2836.0s)]
*  But I think I think they want to fight on the Australian card. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2838.0s)]
*  So we're in the works. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2841.0s)]
*  I think I think Izzy wants it. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2842.0s)]
*  I think Izzy wants something. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=2843.0s)]

*  And then I brought it up. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3479.0s)]
*  And I was like, guys, at the end of the day, dude, she's a hot young white woman. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3480.0s)]
*  That's the only fucking reason why. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3485.0s)]
*  And she's fucking trending. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3487.0s)]
*  No one gives a fuck about her. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3488.0s)]
*  Dana White again on a plot to Dana White. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3490.0s)]
*  That was a message directly to you. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3493.0s)]
*  But all you have the fighters in the repost button, this and that. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3496.0s)]
*  You guys are just fucking fags. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3498.0s)]
*  You literally guys are just doing it for attention. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3500.0s)]
*  And what I said, there's a lot of that. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3502.0s)]
*  What I said, things that people do with a virtue signal. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3504.0s)]
*  There was a Brazilian fighter. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3506.0s)]
*  And he mind you guys, I'm a piece of shit. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3508.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm just telling you how like I try to fucking kill my dad. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3510.0s)]
*  I'm like, my brain doesn't work right. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3512.0s)]
*  But this Brazilian fighter died not too long ago. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3514.0s)]
*  I hit by a bus. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3516.0s)]
*  Ex UFC fighter. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3518.0s)]
*  And my first thought when someone told me, oh, fuck, man, you can't dodge a bus. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3520.0s)]
*  Can't fucking can't dodge a punch, right? [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3524.0s)]
*  That's why he's not in the UFC anymore. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3526.0s)]
*  Mind you guys, I've been hit by a truck. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3528.0s)]
*  I almost fucking died once. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3530.0s)]
*  So, you know, it's like, you know, it's like I have a black best friend here. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3531.0s)]
*  Like I've been there, you guys. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3534.0s)]
*  It was almost fucking happened to me. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3536.0s)]
*  But that was my first response was like, but why? [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3538.0s)]
*  But why is this man not trending? [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3541.0s)]
*  This man probably left a family. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3543.0s)]
*  He probably, you know, he left a life. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3545.0s)]
*  He's not training because he's a dirty fucking Brazilian and no one gives a fuck about him. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3547.0s)]
*  If you were a hot young white woman, you motherfucker would be trending. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3553.0s)]
*  You would be on ESPN. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3557.0s)]
*  Our beloved you ex UFC fighter died. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3559.0s)]
*  And it's just like, man, we just live in this fake world. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3562.0s)]
*  It's so fake. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3565.0s)]
*  But that is a problem with social media is that people have this opportunity to try to [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3566.0s)]
*  portray a version of themselves that might not be honest. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3570.0s)]
*  Oh, it's so fair. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3574.0s)]
*  Like when Stefan Stefan Bonner died. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3575.0s)]
*  Yeah, that motherfucker was gone, dude. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3577.0s)]
*  I mean, I had to talk with Forrest and Forrest even like Forrest kind of reprimanded me about it. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3579.0s)]
*  Because, you know, as rightly so, you guys, I'm an asshole. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3584.0s)]
*  I say things that are way off the cuss. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3586.0s)]
*  There might be like an ounce of truth to it, but 90 percent of his bullshit. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3588.0s)]
*  Right. So if Stefan Bonner added me on Instagram, I'm like, oh shit, Stefan Bonner. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3592.0s)]

*  I'm going to fucking add him back. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3599.0s)]
*  And then he would like post shit, send me messages and I block him right out of the back. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3600.0s)]
*  I'm like, you're fucking nuts, dude. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3604.0s)]
*  You're a fucking pill addict. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3605.0s)]
*  I want nothing to fucking do with you. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3606.0s)]
*  What was he sending you messages about? [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3608.0s)]

*  But like a lot of it just like, you know, like just fucking nuts, bro. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3615.0s)]
*  Like his gym clothes down turned COVID nuts. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3620.0s)]
*  But and this and everything I got shit on. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3622.0s)]
*  And I was on one that's like fuck Stefan Bonner, man. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3625.0s)]
*  That guy was fucking nuts. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3627.0s)]
*  He was a fucking drug addict. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3628.0s)]
*  Like I don't give a fuck about him. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3629.0s)]
*  Like I didn't go and fucking force the oxys down his throat. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3631.0s)]
*  I didn't fucking make him OD. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3633.0s)]
*  So everybody got me shit on that and they all posted about it. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3635.0s)]
*  And I'm like, listen, I didn't like the guy and I blocked him. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3637.0s)]
*  But where were you guys when his life was falling apart? [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3641.0s)]
*  Where were you guys when he was publicly saying my gym is failing? [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3645.0s)]
*  I can't I can't I can't keep the doors open. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3650.0s)]
*  They're locking me out. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3653.0s)]
*  Where the fuck were you guys? [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3654.0s)]
*  You guys weren't fucking anywhere. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3655.0s)]
*  You don't give a fuck about him. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3657.0s)]
*  You never gave a fuck. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3658.0s)]
*  And then when he dies, this is an opportunity. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3659.0s)]
*  And then and I'm not saying I'm not going to say names or anything. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3661.0s)]
*  But I've had I fuck I can't remember who it was. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3664.0s)]
*  But I've had conversations with people who they didn't joke about it. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3667.0s)]
*  But it was like, yeah, that guy was fucking nuts. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3670.0s)]
*  And yet they're posting something. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3672.0s)]
*  It's just fake, dude. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3673.0s)]
*  Like if you're going to joke about his crazy ass dying and like him being a pill addict, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3674.0s)]
*  then you go and post about like, oh, yeah, Stefan Bonner. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3679.0s)]
*  He was a great guy. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3682.0s)]
*  Like, no motherfucker. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3683.0s)]
*  He was a fucking pill addict. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3684.0s)]
*  You all knew we all fucking knew there were so many people involved in his life that could have stepped in. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3686.0s)]
*  And I don't think you should have. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3692.0s)]
*  I've dealt with pill addicts my whole life. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3693.0s)]
*  I think you should throw in some oxys and be like huzzah, man, enjoy. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3695.0s)]
*  I ran into him when he was sober. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3697.0s)]
*  I ran into him and he cleaned himself up. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3699.0s)]
*  I was in Salt Lake City about a year and a half ago. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3701.0s)]
*  He went through a stretch that he was clean. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3705.0s)]
*  And I was doing a show out there and he came to show and he came and he brought this stem cell doctor. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3707.0s)]
*  Runs this Utah stem cell clinic and he was clear eyed and we had a fun talk. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3712.0s)]
*  It was what's a force that you that's a force that you and I and I told force on my force. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3717.0s)]
*  I'm just telling you, dude, I've been I mean, I was watching my dad snort oxys off the kitchen table and as an elementary school, like I know drug addicts. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3721.0s)]
*  The guy's a fucking drug addict. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3729.0s)]
*  And I was like, and I'm not saying force is a stand up guy. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3730.0s)]
*  I think force did reach his hand out mobile times to help him. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3733.0s)]
*  But, you know, people know people involved. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3737.0s)]
*  Like imagine like your closest friend, like if they were like addicted to drugs, you would be like you'd be involved like Chris Curtis, man. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3741.0s)]
*  Chris Curtis has a little white baby on the way, you know, a little mixed breed Chris Curtis. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3747.0s)]
*  I'm proud of you, man. You fucking making that money. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3751.0s)]
*  Got your white wife. I'm happy for you. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3753.0s)]
*  We have podcasts together. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3755.0s)]
*  It's nice. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3756.0s)]
*  But if right now, like if Kurt was addicted to oxy, you would help him. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3757.0s)]
*  I'd fucking help him without a doubt. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3761.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'd fucking I would help him. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3763.0s)]
*  Or maybe he just didn't have someone like that in his life. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3765.0s)]
*  And also sometimes those guys, they burn so many bridges that by the time the shit goes sideways, they don't have anybody that's going to stick their neck out. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3767.0s)]
*  That's why we talk about segue to homeless people. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3774.0s)]
*  People like, oh, man, like I will fucking I won't give a damn to a fucking homeless person. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3777.0s)]
*  You'll fucking be homeless. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3781.0s)]
*  Go drink the sewer water like you got to think about me piece of shit. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3782.0s)]
*  But there is always someone in my life that's OK. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3786.0s)]
*  You can sleep on my couch for a weekend. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3788.0s)]
*  You can sleep on my couch for a week. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3790.0s)]
*  Come train here. Sleep on the couch. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3791.0s)]
*  Like if you're such a big piece of shit to where like there is not one person you can't call one person. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3793.0s)]
*  They'd be like, yeah, but it's like you're saying that because you knew people from training, people that knew you and you could sleep on the couch or some people that never have that. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3800.0s)]
*  You never find a thing. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3809.0s)]
*  They never have anybody in their life that's any good. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3811.0s)]
*  There's circumstances involved. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3813.0s)]
*  I see what you're saying. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3815.0s)]
*  Yeah, there are circumstances involved with some people where they just never get a break. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3816.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's few. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3820.0s)]
*  Look, I got better breaks than you did, but you got better breaks than some homeless guy. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3822.0s)]
*  So OK, to that point, I am my family home. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3826.0s)]
*  My mom lives in Fallbrook, Fallbrook, California. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3830.0s)]
*  It's a very it's a migrant migrant community. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3832.0s)]
*  There's this guy named Juan fucking Juan, man, motherfucker. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3836.0s)]
*  I don't think the guy can't even read or write. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3840.0s)]
*  He just he's a migrant worker. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3842.0s)]
*  He a man. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3844.0s)]
*  He raised a family, right? [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3846.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3848.0s)]
*  Like what I'm saying is you have this Mexican guy that comes across the border legally, no license, no anything, can't read or write. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3850.0s)]
*  And this motherfucker is raising a family, a successful family, you know, even as I think only as one one kid is American citizen, but raising a successful family. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3857.0s)]
*  So it's so hard for me, man. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3868.0s)]
*  It's America, dude. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3869.0s)]
*  I know what you're saying. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3870.0s)]
*  It's hard, bro. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3871.0s)]
*  I know what you're saying, but it's you got to recognize that some people have way worse circumstances even even than me. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3872.0s)]
*  Fuck. Yeah. I mean, I like fucking I knew I know girls have been fucked by their dad their whole life. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3879.0s)]
*  Like, you know, I'm saying like I I and some of my friends, bro, at Disneyland, I knew I met a guy in South Africa who had a fucking kill his mom like like crazy. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3883.0s)]
*  I fucking Disneyland. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3893.0s)]
*  That's why I can laugh and joke at it. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3895.0s)]
*  I think about this guy every time I feel like a bitch. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3897.0s)]
*  You guys every time I feel like a fucking pussy. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3899.0s)]
*  I look in the mirror and I think about my buddy in Africa who had a smoke his mom. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3901.0s)]
*  Why do you have to smoke his mom? [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3905.0s)]
*  So again, what they do is they like they'll come into your village or wherever the fuck you're from. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3906.0s)]
*  And they want to like they want to like brainwash you. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3914.0s)]
*  And what's the best way of doing that? [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3917.0s)]
*  And then by like having to do something so fucked up like, you know, and then if they if they could get you to do that, then you're pliable. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3919.0s)]
*  Then they could give you drugs and they could like make you into a rebel. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3925.0s)]
*  And so they talked him into killing his own. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3928.0s)]
*  I don't think it's like that. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3931.0s)]
*  I think the mom is like I think the mom is like kind of like if you don't do it, they're going to fucking kill you too. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3933.0s)]
*  Like the mom is probably like encouraging him to fucking. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3938.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3941.0s)]
*  So what I'm saying, you guys, I tell myself that story once a week at least. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3942.0s)]
*  And I'm like, dude, you're don't be a pussy. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3947.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3950.0s)]
*  But, you know, sometimes like it was kind of interesting telling your security team. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3951.0s)]
*  By the way, Joe has a pretty solid security team. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3954.0s)]
*  You guys don't want to come fuck with this guy. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3956.0s)]
*  All like Navy SEALs, special forces and shit. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3959.0s)]
*  As I said, a little, little, little overkill. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3962.0s)]
*  Fucking Joe. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3964.0s)]
*  Not really fucking more than Biden over here. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3965.0s)]
*  No, it's not more than Biden and not overkill. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3967.0s)]
*  Not it. I can tell you some stories. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3970.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3971.0s)]
*  Now I would imagine. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3972.0s)]
*  Yeah. But, you know, man, every now and then again, this is not has nothing to do with that guy. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3973.0s)]
*  He was a saint. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3977.0s)]
*  But you got to like you got to do some bad shit. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3978.0s)]
*  Like I was telling your security team because, you know, they've I'm sure they've all done some bad shit. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3980.0s)]
*  Like my buddy, Chris Curtis, so irrelevant. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3985.0s)]
*  It's a funny story. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3988.0s)]
*  This construction worker comes to the gym and it's on YouTube. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3989.0s)]
*  It's on Instagram. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3992.0s)]
*  He comes to the gym and then Kurt's like, Spar. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3993.0s)]
*  I'm like, Kurt, you should let me spar. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3996.0s)]
*  You should let me do the work. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3998.0s)]
*  And Kurt's like, No, I want to do what I want to do. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=3999.0s)]
*  So Kurt's being so nice, pulling head kicks and like just hit some of the body shot. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4001.0s)]
*  He falls and he stops. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4006.0s)]
*  And I heard you're such a fucking bitch, dude. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4007.0s)]
*  Pussy. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4010.0s)]
*  So afterwards, he's like, Sean, like he has a family. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4011.0s)]
*  Like he has a family. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4013.0s)]
*  Like I'm not going to take this man out of work. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4014.0s)]
*  Like he just he just he doesn't know. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4016.0s)]
*  So afterwards, the guy says something to Kurt like like, Oh, man, if I was in more in shape, I could have did better with you or something. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4019.0s)]
*  And then Kurt goes straight angry black guy. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4026.0s)]
*  Kurt's like the whitest man you ever know. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4028.0s)]
*  But the moment he gets angry, bro, it's like full fucking bonnets, angry fucking black man. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4030.0s)]
*  And I'm like, Kurt, you had your chance. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4035.0s)]
*  Like you got to stop, dude. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4037.0s)]
*  He's like trying to fight him down the park in the gym. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4039.0s)]
*  Like, you had your chance. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4041.0s)]
*  So the guy was saying, yeah. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4042.0s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, Kurt just goes like straight angry black guy. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4044.0s)]
*  He's like, fuck that hole. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4047.0s)]
*  And we're all holding Kurt back. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4048.0s)]
*  And I'm like, Kurt, you had your chance. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4049.0s)]
*  And sometimes you like you just got to be comfortable doing fucked up shit. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4051.0s)]
*  Like there's probably nothing I could do where I would like lose sleep at night. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4055.0s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4058.0s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4059.0s)]
*  Sociopath. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4060.0s)]
*  No, I mean, maybe like like killing a fan or something or like, yeah, that's probably nothing. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4061.0s)]
*  I kind of want to find out. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4065.0s)]
*  Like, I kind of be curious. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4067.0s)]
*  Like, there's a part of me that like I would never want to do it. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4068.0s)]
*  But like, is there something I can do that would like make me say, oh, man, I don't like myself? [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4071.0s)]
*  Well, you're luckier in the right business. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4076.0s)]
*  But you know what I'm saying? [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4079.0s)]
*  If Kurt, what I told Kurt, like if it was me, I would have fucking, oh, I would have fucking starch that guy as he's falling. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4080.0s)]
*  I would have dropped a fucking people's elbow on his ass. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4085.0s)]
*  But like, man, like you just got to you got to push this. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4088.0s)]
*  Like, you got to fuck a fat chick every now and then, you know? [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4091.0s)]
*  Like like you just so lucky you found fighting. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4095.0s)]
*  It's so hilarious. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4099.0s)]
*  But you know, you're going to look back on this conversation someday and go, God damn, when I was 34, I was out of my fucking mind. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4101.0s)]
*  No, I think I'm going to be this way. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4107.0s)]
*  But like, you think so? [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4109.0s)]
*  If you ever done something really bad, like really bad, really fucked up. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4110.0s)]
*  Not really. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4113.0s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4114.0s)]
*  Nothing like that. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4115.0s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4116.0s)]
*  Nothing where I was shit than that. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4117.0s)]
*  No, but I don't know. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4118.0s)]
*  I'm much luckier. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4119.0s)]
*  I've done things where I should have lost. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4120.0s)]
*  That's the problem. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4121.0s)]
*  But there is this moment where I'm like, man, I really like I'm kind of curious. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4123.0s)]
*  Like I wish like I could just do something super, super heinous. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4127.0s)]
*  Just to see how you react to it. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4130.0s)]
*  Just to see if I feel bad. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4132.0s)]
*  Yeah, don't do that. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4133.0s)]
*  Don't do that. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4134.0s)]
*  You know, fucked up if this conversation comes out after you've done something really bad. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4135.0s)]
*  No, I live in the straight and narrow. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4139.0s)]
*  Maybe some shit in the past, but I live in the straight and narrow now. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4140.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4143.0s)]
*  So like embrace that. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4144.0s)]
*  Don't be thinking about this. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4145.0s)]
*  I live. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4147.0s)]
*  Don't even entertain. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4148.0s)]
*  I live. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4149.0s)]
*  Know what I fucking did after my fight? [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4150.0s)]
*  I didn't go chase pussy. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4151.0s)]
*  I went fucking hat in out my girlfriend and watch a fucking big championship after my [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4152.0s)]
*  last fight. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4156.0s)]
*  What championship? [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4157.0s)]
*  Baking championship. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4158.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4159.0s)]
*  I watch a fucking baking fucking cook off with my girlfriend. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4160.0s)]
*  That's perfect. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4161.5s)]
*  I'm fucking boring. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4162.5s)]
*  I don't do shit, you guys. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4163.5s)]
*  Well, that's whatever. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4164.5s)]
*  You know, you probably know energy after training. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4165.5s)]
*  No, I'm fucking writers. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4168.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4169.0s)]
*  You're kidding me. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4170.0s)]
*  No, I like boredom is my boredom is my Achilles heels. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4171.0s)]
*  You'd like and that's why I sleep. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4174.0s)]
*  I get this voice in my head, dude. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4177.0s)]
*  And you see my press conferences. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4178.0s)]
*  I get this voice in my head. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4179.0s)]
*  And I think it's like I think the clinical term it's like anti-social personality, conduct [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4181.0s)]
*  disorder. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4188.0s)]
*  So when you're a kid, you have conduct disorder, then it spirals and like anti-social personality [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4189.0s)]
*  disorder. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4193.0s)]
*  And it's like it's borderline sociopathic. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4194.0s)]
*  But one of the one of the big traits is self-control. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4197.0s)]
*  I fucking know. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4199.0s)]
*  Well, that's also a factor of getting hit in the head a lot. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4200.0s)]
*  But it was like that was a kid. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4204.0s)]
*  I get this voice in my head and it tells me to fucking do something. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4206.0s)]
*  And then I like it just sits there and I'm doing it. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4209.0s)]
*  I'm fucking doing it. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4211.0s)]
*  I'm still in this car. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4212.0s)]
*  I'm doing it. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4213.0s)]
*  Growing up with no guidance. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4214.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4215.0s)]
*  Growing up with fucked up family. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4216.0s)]
*  Growing up with fucked up circumstances. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4217.0s)]
*  So I do isolate myself. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4218.0s)]
*  Like I'm mad. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4220.0s)]
*  People like, oh, yeah, Sean, like you want to go hang out, go watch. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4221.0s)]
*  No, I don't. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4224.0s)]
*  I want to sit at home fucking maybe play video game, get good food. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4225.0s)]
*  Like that's good, though. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4228.0s)]
*  That's good that you recognize that you don't want to put yourself in a situation. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4229.0s)]
*  I can't say no. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4232.0s)]
*  I can't say fucking no to anything. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4233.0s)]
*  But your life is going so well right now, too. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4236.0s)]
*  It would be a fucking horrible shame if you fucked it up. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4238.0s)]
*  Yeah, fuck. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4241.0s)]
*  Because you gave in to the demons. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4242.0s)]
*  Yeah, demons. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4243.0s)]
*  Well, I do. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4244.0s)]
*  Me and my demons are fucking buddies, dude. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4245.0s)]
*  I always say, dude, I always say like, and this is I'm not religious, obviously. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4246.0s)]
*  But if God and the devil were real, the only person who's ever been there for me has been the devil. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4250.0s)]
*  100 percent. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4257.0s)]
*  I'm back in 24 seven. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4258.0s)]
*  Again, 24 seven. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4262.0s)]
*  But it's true. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4265.0s)]
*  You're going to get a bunch of DMs from Satanists now. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4266.0s)]
*  But it's true. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4268.0s)]
*  But you got to think about it. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4269.0s)]
*  Like evil deeds have been my friend. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4270.0s)]
*  Like when I was again, when I was a kid and I had to do fucked up shit with my dad with a guitar, like I had to like, you know, become a sociopath. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4273.0s)]
*  I had to like turn shut swanders. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4281.0s)]
*  Man, the devil, man. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4283.0s)]
*  24 seven. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4284.0s)]
*  I have my back. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4285.0s)]
*  24 seven made me have like moral fluidity. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4286.0s)]
*  Like I could do bad things now and not feel fucking terrible about it. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4289.0s)]
*  Are you happy with that, though? [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4293.0s)]
*  Do you like that? [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4295.0s)]
*  Or do you wish you were a better person? [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4296.0s)]
*  You know, it is, dude. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4298.0s)]
*  I again, I'm not a bad person. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4299.0s)]
*  I for the most part, like I hold doors for old ladies. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4300.0s)]
*  Like I do. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4303.0s)]
*  I'm a pretty decent human being. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4304.0s)]
*  It's just evolution, bro. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4306.0s)]
*  It's like evolution of being a sociopath. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4307.0s)]
*  It's like it's a purpose when you go like and this is where like this is where like it's hard for me to understand. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4309.0s)]
*  And you don't you know, you don't even know this take it older. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4315.0s)]
*  But like I evolve my brain, my brain thought the world was different. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4318.0s)]
*  And then all of a sudden you become an adult and you're like the way my brain formed and grew up isn't the way the world is. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4326.0s)]
*  Like my brain trained me that the world's brutal. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4334.0s)]
*  It's harsh. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4337.0s)]
*  You're a victim. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4338.0s)]
*  You have to be a predator. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4339.0s)]
*  You have to be a bully. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4340.0s)]
*  You have to hurt people. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4341.0s)]
*  You have to crave power. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4342.0s)]
*  You have to want sex. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4343.0s)]
*  And then you turn to adult. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4345.0s)]
*  You're like, oh, man, that's not how life is. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4346.0s)]
*  But don't you think that you continue to evolve? [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4349.0s)]
*  If you evolve that, don't you think you continue to want you once your base brain? [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4352.0s)]
*  Like you could you could slowly change like you could brainwash yourself to think fucking I'm a chicken if I if I slowly go through the process of brainwashing myself. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4358.0s)]
*  But once your brain, once those foundations are set, dude, it's hard to unset them. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4366.0s)]
*  Have you ever done psychedelics? [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4370.0s)]
*  No, no. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4372.0s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4373.0s)]
*  Jokes scare me, dude. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4374.0s)]
*  Drugs do. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4375.0s)]
*  I mean, I like I'm a dick like I would look at me. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4376.0s)]
*  Oh, coffee's black rifles. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4378.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4381.0s)]

*  And I like what you said about the he was telling me about the written housing, man. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4383.0s)]

*  I drink this shit. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4389.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, they got a real bad fucking rap because a lot of right wing people did the dumb shit that left wing people. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4390.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4396.0s)]
*  So I'm not turned on for no reason. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4397.0s)]
*  They were wrong. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4398.0s)]
*  And they they weren't like turn their back on written house. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4399.0s)]
*  They just factually said they don't because they're everyone was saying they sponsored Kyle Riddles and gave him a T-shirt to wear when he got out of jail. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4402.0s)]
*  So that being said, you don't fucking trust the media, right? [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4409.0s)]
*  Even me. I was like, fuck black rifle. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4412.0s)]
*  I even said that I was like, fuck, I'm not those guys. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4414.0s)]
*  I had a hat from them. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4416.0s)]
*  They gave me a bunch of free shit once. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4418.0s)]
*  And I go back to wearing their fucking. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4419.0s)]
*  Yeah, wear their hat. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4421.0s)]

*  I know them very well. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4423.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4424.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4429.0s)]
*  So fucking great guy from the horse's mouth. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4430.0s)]
*  From the horse's mouth itself, you guys. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4431.0s)]
*  They didn't fucking, you know, just miscommunication. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4432.0s)]
*  No, they're about as right wing and pro America as you get. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4434.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4437.0s)]
*  Kyle Riddles is a fucking dork, though, right? [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4438.0s)]
*  Fucking 80. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4439.0s)]
*  Where's a kid? [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4440.0s)]
*  So that was a point though. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4441.0s)]
*  Did you do you watch that video? [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4442.0s)]
*  You want to talk about a man who fucking sits there in his underwear all day and practices reloads. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4444.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4448.0s)]
*  Bro, he even hit the he even hit the slide. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4449.0s)]
*  I don't know what it's called, but like I didn't even know the little button on the AR 15 that no one even knows why it's there. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4452.0s)]
*  But the motherfucker even hit that once he put the mat or once he fucking nuts, dude. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4458.0s)]
*  He knows how to use her gun. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4462.0s)]
*  I mean, he was being hired to go in to protect one of the businesses. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4464.0s)]
*  They were worried about being burnt down. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4468.0s)]
*  Oh, he was hired to do that? [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4470.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4471.0s)]
*  It was his friends. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4472.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4473.0s)]
*  I thought he was just like a white kid. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4474.0s)]
*  It would be here. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4475.0s)]
*  No, no. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4476.0s)]
*  It was an Indian family that owned I think it was a car dealership and they were worried about their car dealership getting burnt down. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4477.0s)]
*  So they asked him to come and help. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4483.0s)]
*  No shit. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4484.0s)]
*  So when they say, oh, he drove across state lines, he drove 15 minutes away. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4485.0s)]
*  It was 15 minutes away. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4489.0s)]
*  He drove to help his friends and he went there because they were worried about their businesses being looted. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4490.0s)]
*  You know, obviously, who the fuck is sending a 17 year old with an AR to go and guard a business? [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4495.0s)]
*  It sounds insane. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4501.0s)]
*  I'm Kishap. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4502.0s)]
*  You watch that guy on the subway fucking choke that dude out. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4503.0s)]
*  Yeah, I need to see the whole video. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4506.0s)]
*  I need to see how long he held that choke because of the guy. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4508.0s)]
*  I mean, you can't hold a choke for a minute. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4510.0s)]
*  So me and me, I'm the same way. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4512.0s)]
*  I'm generally like the I'm generally like on the Republican leaning side where I'm like, yeah, like, you know, I thought I thought I thought the cop that killed George Floyd was guilty. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4513.0s)]
*  I thought that I think that like I think George Floyd was probably a royal fucking piece of shit. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4522.0s)]
*  I don't think we should put statues in his plan. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4527.0s)]
*  What happened? [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4529.0s)]
*  I don't think we should put statues in his honor, but in your custody, in your care, the fact that man's like, hey, I'm fucking dying. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4530.0s)]
*  And you're just like, right. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4538.0s)]
*  My wife's fucking the neighbor. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4540.0s)]
*  I don't care. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4541.0s)]
*  I'm going to hold this joke till I feel better. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4542.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4543.0s)]
*  So I think that guy was guilty. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4544.0s)]
*  But yeah, that guy in the subway, dude, 100 percent. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4545.0s)]
*  You can't like be able to go threatening people. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4547.0s)]
*  And the guy had a long history of assaults and crime. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4549.0s)]
*  I mean, did you do Jiu-Jitsu? [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4552.0s)]
*  Like how long do you hold a choke to kill? [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4553.0s)]
*  I do Jiu-Jitsu, though. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4554.0s)]
*  I wouldn't have done that. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4555.0s)]
*  Yeah, I would have just once I got the guy's back, I would have just held on to it and just not squoze his fucking neck. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4556.0s)]
*  I hope he gets off. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4563.0s)]
*  I hope he gets again. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4564.0s)]
*  Again, the guy was I don't know what happened. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4565.0s)]
*  So the guy was a guy died from asphyxiation or did the guy have a heart attack because he was on drugs? [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4567.0s)]
*  Because this was the thing that they said about George Floyd is that he was going to die of a fentanyl overdose anyway. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4572.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if that's true. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4577.0s)]
*  But I don't know what the case is with this guy. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4579.0s)]
*  But I do know that there was another guy who was holding him down that was a black guy that they conveniently left out of all these outrage articles. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4581.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4588.0s)]
*  And they tried to make it a white on black thing. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4589.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'd be curious. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4590.0s)]
*  I'd be curious if I will say one thing, if it wasn't fentanyl, he died of the 100 percent guilty. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4591.0s)]
*  You can't you can't hold a choke for no, you can't hold a choke. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4596.0s)]
*  But it's also like some people don't know that they don't all look. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4599.0s)]
*  Anybody can teach you how to do that. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4603.0s)]
*  That's not hard to do. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4605.0s)]
*  It's not like doing a wheel kick. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4606.0s)]
*  It's like a very easy movement for your body to do. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4607.0s)]
*  Every fucking kid when I was a kid, when I was a boy, when we would watch pro wrestling, they knew a sleeper hold. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4610.0s)]
*  Everybody knew it. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4616.0s)]
*  You know, so it's like if he doesn't know any better and he doesn't know that you can't hold on to a choke because he's not trained. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4617.0s)]
*  I know he's a Marine. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4623.0s)]
*  But how much they don't teach you don't teach you shit. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4624.0s)]
*  So who the fuck knows how much this guy actually knew when I'm looking at it with the way he was squeezing the neck. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4627.0s)]
*  It didn't look like he knew what he was doing. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=4632.0s)]

*  Why don't hate? No, I just you love some people [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=5214.259999999999s)]
*  I know what we are [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=5216.74s)]
*  But you love quality people the problem is you just don't have a wealth of them in your life and you haven't had a wealth [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=5217.58s)]
*  Of them in your life. You've had a very small number of them that you only met once you started fighting [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=5222.9s)]
*  So I gave my girl that story and she was like I was like that's what I'm saying, babe [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=5228.38s)]
*  Like there's a situation where this could happen. I might need you to embellish the truth. That's [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=5232.5s)]
*  Not even embellishing that's self-defense. No, I know attack your girl, but it was like, you know, I would have it would have been push [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=5237.219999999999s)]
*  But yeah, that's the most justifiable thing. I mean, what would you do man? Your wife a hundred percent? I do what you just know [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=5243.48s)]
*  No, what if your wife what if your wife does something just fucked up? What if she has like I don't know what I'm trying [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=5248.299999999999s)]
*  To think of a scenario what if like what if she fucking shoots the mailman on accident? [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=5254.38s)]
*  You can make a make a wand and they go away. Would you do it? It's good question [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=5258.179999999999s)]
*  Question fuck. Yeah, you do it. Yeah. Yeah, you do it. Yeah [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=5262.9s)]

*  There's sometimes people make compromises and sometimes people have to make very difficult choices [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=5270.219999999999s)]
*  Doesn't necessarily mean you're a bad human being but it's not a good choice [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=5275.299999999999s)]
*  It's not a good situation to be in either. I'd hide the body go get a saws on [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=5278.339999999999s)]

*  I think people are pushing back against it now because they're realizing how fucking insane it is [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=6498.4s)]
*  But there's certain people that are just lost in the trance and they're just pushing it are these people like are they 14 year olds? [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=6502.28s)]

*  finding these [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=6704.66s)]

*  That's what I think is the way to fix things well [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=6733.48s)]
*  I mean systematic oppression is a real thing and it's a real thing on white people and black people [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=6735.679999999999s)]

*  he thinks that all black people are ghetto and violent and [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=6909.3s)]
*  You know in hindsight there is some truth to that because I did say that and that is kind of what I was implying [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=6912.820000000001s)]
*  but [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=6919.660000000001s)]

*  But to me it's like I I was insulting you because I respect those people. I don't respect you Phil [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=6940.820000000001s)]
*  I think you're a dirty fucking motherfucker. I think you're a pussy. I think you're privileged. I think you have a d1 education [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=6946.1s)]

*  I love those fucking guys you have fucking love those guys [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=6956.0s)]
*  When did you start training the way you train now where most of your training is just sparring? [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=6958.76s)]
*  So well, I mean again. I I spar I I fight I fight so I'm allowed to train [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=6963.84s)]

*  I hate that we talked about it with I had Matt [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=6973.88s)]
*  Sarah Dean Thomas and my friend John Rollo on the pod guys guys fight. It's like [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=6977.48s)]
*  Guys fight way hard. It's like slavery man like again. I'm not saying you've seen slavery, but [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=6982.400000000001s)]
*  Slavery only ended for one reason because it's a shit means of production [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=6987.84s)]
*  If you pay guy people money they work harder, and they do more and [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=6993.12s)]
*  That's kind of how like MMA would be if you guys just paid a little bit more money [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=6998.36s)]
*  Guaranteed pay it would be like the new form of capitalism guys would fight [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7003.4800000000005s)]
*  No one is no one's incentivized to fight harder for a win bonus [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7008.76s)]
*  They're fighting as hard as they can when I fought Jared can near again his corner won that for him, dude [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7012.52s)]
*  It was crazy. I mean had the announcers coming like I it was like kind of a boring fight [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7017.56s)]
*  But you won and like his corners yelling like all this one like those punches are land [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7021.4s)]
*  Yeah, I have a chin of a girl you guys seen Alex knock Matt you touch my chin [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7025.6s)]
*  I fucking fall asleep. I don't tell you [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7028.6s)]
*  But you know that that third fourth round came and I'm like, you know, I do these no these punch your land [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7031.12s)]
*  You know have one mark on my face like I'm landing him. I'm rocking him, you know, like I'm winning this fight [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7035.6s)]
*  I'm just gonna fucking jab and just coast and win this bitch and then that's why I was so upset by the fight [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7040.320000000001s)]
*  But if they were like a Sean guarantee pay maybe we double-triple what you made [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7045.320000000001s)]
*  I would went in there bit my mouth piece of art motherfucker. Let's bang but you know half your paycheck [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7048.820000000001s)]
*  Also with bad judging half your paycheck with a decision that people don't even agree with and you lose half of your money [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7055.120000000001s)]
*  You know my it's all the time. You know my mistake was I should have put Chris Curtis in my corner [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7061.080000000001s)]
*  because like [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7066.160000000001s)]
*  Because Kurt would have talked like so whenever there he threw a couple combinations all [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7069.04s)]
*  Miss and the core and his course coach is like, yeah, man, those are great. Those are all fucking landing [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7074.280000000001s)]
*  I'm like when you box man when you box a lot of punches look like they land but they're missing by like [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7079.240000000001s)]
*  Right and you're turning your chin if you go in a slow motion [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7084.56s)]
*  I mean after the Jericho near fight had bruises all over my chest because that's where he was landing and I kind of wish [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7087.400000000001s)]
*  I had Kurt in my corner just to tell his corner to shut the fuck up and say no motherfucker. Those aren't landing [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7092.68s)]
*  What are you talking about? Right? Right? Yeah, that is a crazy thing though, especially at the apex boy that can influence judges [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7097.4800000000005s)]
*  Because the apex there's no fucking crowd noise. You can hear everything everybody [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7103.6s)]
*  I mean a whole chest was just bruised, but I mean you those aren't landed punches, right? [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7107.62s)]
*  So yeah, and I really wish they would change that but yeah, I wish they would too [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7111.6s)]
*  That's the that's my only complaint about the UFC really [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7116.04s)]
*  I got made more money and I wish people didn't have a fucking win bonus [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7118.48s)]
*  It's just like they don't have that in boxing. Yeah, and I see other MMA organizations adopting it too [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7123.0s)]
*  And I'm like man, this is an opportunity to stand out. Don't do that [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7128.66s)]
*  You've ever have ever got to know and like any boxers on a personal level. Yeah, I've known a few boxes man [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7131.2s)]
*  They're so shady you guys want a deus business like guys [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7135.36s)]
*  They're they're like most most low-level boxing fights like between but tell you get to like 20 fights 18 fights [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7138.4s)]
*  Generally these guys are paying their opponents to fight [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7145.24s)]
*  Very very often and that's why when you go look at a boxing record is like what the fuck did you've lost? [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7148.5599999999995s)]
*  You've had a hundred fights here. You're like 90 you're like one in 99. There's a lot of setups [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7152.5199999999995s)]
*  But again, it's not that they want the setups [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7157.36s)]
*  It's hard to get because these fucking boxers like princesses [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7160.44s)]
*  They know how important their record is if they take one bad loss and it goes from 16 to 1 right? [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7163.679999999999s)]
*  It's a fucking restart. That's one thing that I really do love about MMA is that when fighters lose? [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7168.639999999999s)]
*  It's not the end of their career and that the sport and the culture of sport has embraced the fact that guys get better through [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7174.24s)]
*  Losses boxing is also easy though. It's definitely easier. Yeah, but I mean like but it's different [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7180.3s)]
*  I wouldn't say easy, but it's just at the highest level is not easy [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7185.599999999999s)]
*  I mean you when you watch like Lomachenko Devin Haney. There's the highest there's nothing easy about that fight [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7190.08s)]

*  I think they generally hate what they've done and they feel terrible and so [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7370.44s)]
*  Then they go to Jesus to try to like cleanse themselves and try to find a better path [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7376.5199999999995s)]
*  I think it's cuz they're not bad people. They just recognize they've done bad things, especially when they're partying and getting fucked up [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_lAWmSVoU&t=7382.28s)]
