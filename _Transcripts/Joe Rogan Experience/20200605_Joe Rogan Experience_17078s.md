# Joe Rogan Experience #1486 - Honey Honey
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 05, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqXYKjkVf9Q)
*  What if we like wrote you a new theme song what if we just like start pitching theme songs you could do that really
*  Yeah, cool. Yeah, Ben. We're rolling. We're rolling right now. Yeah
*  How did the band get back together cuz it literally the band is back together like you know that expression you say with your friends
*  Bro, the bands back together. Yeah, they haven't even said that shit. Yeah bands back together
*  BAM the bands back. I said BAM. Oh
*  BAM I know I'd rather say like titties
*  Something I'm a BAM. Okay BAM. Yeah, so bands back together started via COVID
*  We were we're kind of mad at each other is what binds us. Yeah, we were a little mad at each other
*  I was just keeping together and then I got really I got really worried about Ben
*  the person I live with
*  Thought we may maybe did have COVID at a time
*  It turns out he he tested negative, but he had acute laryngitis at the same time
*  So we're just like oh see that like all those other diseases don't take a break like oh COVID's got us
*  No, didn't you run kites? No, he had cute laryngitis
*  well, either way I was like real mad at you at the time and I was like I
*  really loved Ben and I'd be really bummed if I didn't if there weren't a Ben and I
*  And then we started talking hanging out. Sometimes that's all it takes
*  You know, we all get set in our ways
*  You get these grudges and these stupid things he stick near the best shit camaraderie
*  Friendship and love that's the best shit
*  It's like whatever you kind of do and most people want that
*  If you ever felt that for someone at one point in time, you probably would feel it again
*  He's whatever shit you have together. You just got to talk it out. Talk it out. Don't carry grudges
*  Yeah, grudges is the worst. Well, we had to we needed to step back for a minute. Yeah
*  Sometimes we all do right ourselves and like, you know, we took two years took
*  Yeah, really where we didn't speak much and when we did
*  Balls of steel from the old
*  That's an inside story, huh
*  You were right you had to be talented the video he sent was you guys do an angel of death
*  Acoustic on the roof of a building in LA
*  When we were practicing last night there was an earthquake
*  Oh Jesus and I was just like watching like my living room kind of and I looked at Ben I was like fuck
*  What?
*  Doesn't stop the earthquake doesn't it's like God saying BAM
*  Just a little one
*  That's why I don't say BAM could have been saying titties he could have been saying a lot of things he's God
*  Invented all languages and all things. Yeah, all the bad words God invented those two God invented racial slurs
*  So we have to work it out
*  Invented all the
*  It's really we need to find a good one for white people, you know, we really need to balance this out
*  Yeah, a good a good juicy
*  Chad's Karen's
*  What's the white one Brock Chad Chad's Bradley feels
*  Sure. Yeah, a lot of poor Bradley's out there. There's a lot of good Bradley's like what's that Bradley the actor Bradley Cooper?
*  That's badass. He's a really good actor. Super great. Hey, so you can't be a Bradley
*  But there's a lot of cool chads. Yeah, Brad Pitt. Sorry. There's a lot chad ward chad dawson
*  There's a lot of great boxers named chad. Yeah
*  Shit, yeah, can't even go chad. I don't know Jamie. What are you gonna turn it around?
*  Shit he's got a girl's name
*  You know, I love you Jamie don't spell it that way, you know, I love you
*  With girls is jami
*  On the edge you hate your kid it's like a boy named sue it's a Johnny Cash song
*  Johnny Cash wrote a goddamn song about it. She'll serve scene wrote that
*  Oh, that's right. That's right. And johnny cash sang it. That was a great fucking song truth
*  That's a great fucking I like I like boy names for girls
*  I think that always like bobby or billy if they're hot they can pull it off. Yeah. Yeah, I've actually
*  I wanted to name a girl named gary. I want if I if I ever procreated
*  And I have a little girl a little kid. Yeah, but she'd be like the fucking coolest gary on the planet
*  That's one thing she would probably get over people fucking with her real early in life
*  You know what I mean? Because sometimes yeah, if you don't know that's not how the boy named sue song went though
*  You
*  Then didn't work. Yeah, but who knows what gary's gonna be dealing with in 15 years. It's just gonna be crazy
*  She's gonna be I think she's gonna be crushing it. I am not ready to have children. So well then you don't have kids
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah
*  The one thing that the kids zealots like to do is they like to pretend that everybody needs to have kids in order to be
*  Valuable in this life you need to have kids that's a lot of fucking pressure on people. Is that a thing? Sure
*  It's you know what it is when someone's doing something they think you should be doing it
*  Right, like you talk to someone who just started meditating and they can't shut that's me
*  I can never shut the fuck up about what I like doing. Yeah, i'm always trying to get people to do things
*  Yeah, you know, but that's the thing with people with kids. You do you gotta have a fucking kid
*  You gotta have a fucking kid. Trust me. No, where's your wife? What are you doing? You're not gonna have children
*  You're not gonna procreate your name's not gonna carry on
*  Settle down that's never resonated with me like a legacy of like I don't have a penis
*  No, but like as you know, but even with my career like I I just won't play music
*  Like I don't really think about like what's gonna last when i'm dead. There's nothing wrong
*  You're a great person. There's nothing wrong with any way of approaching this life have children don't have children
*  Sing music don't sing music. You can do whatever the fuck you want. You're a great person and you do
*  I appreciate that friend listen friend. Yeah, but this thing that I have two cats pressure
*  People put pressure on folks that they have to have kids or their life is not
*  Valid and meaningful probably because they're having trouble dealing with the pressure of having kids
*  Maybe but it's all silly because you don't live forever. It's just no one your children won't live forever
*  No one lives forever. You live you die. You got to keep moving while you're alive. You should just be happy
*  Yeah, just be happy you're contributing everyone's contributing whether you have kids or don't have kids when you don't have kids
*  You have the option to love and support the kids in your peripheral
*  Area like my nieces and nephew and stuff and and my friends kids and then you can go home and you don't have to deal
*  With the other shit. Yep. Sure. Sure
*  You know, but then like for me it was a strong education education in humanity
*  Just learning how to be a person a different kind of person a person that raises little people
*  Person that's responsible for for babies. It's a totally different feel
*  It's like whoo it fucks with your head, you know
*  It just it for a lot of people creates a ton of anxiety and right existential angst and fear about the future
*  Well, the thing is if I were to have kids
*  I would like being a mother would be like the number one prior like nothing comes before then and you know
*  I would I would take that seriously and it's just something that you know when you think about and i'm like like now's the time
*  But you know, am I allowed to ask a lady? Yeah. Yeah, i'm 35. Oh, you can still pull it off for a few years
*  I don't age shame, you know, i'm really happy where i'm at. I think that's so funny when people get really
*  squeamish about that like well
*  They feel like they only have a certain amount of time to to grab that lightning in the bottle and be validated
*  and uh
*  You know some people just think
*  That you gotta it's gonna burn out quick and then life is gonna suck
*  Right, you know somebody age shamed me once and was like you're almost 40 baby, man
*  And I was like what's wrong with 40 was this online? No, that sounds like a youtube comment
*  Unfortunately, that was in real life. Someone said that yeah a guy, you know, yeah. Oh rude
*  How weak but I mean again, why would someone do that? They're trying to make you feel bad because they don't feel good
*  That's what it is. It's always the case
*  It's no one who feels great on top of the world dolly llama's out there not out there leaving shitty youtube comments
*  What if he was though?
*  secretly like
*  Did you ever see the video of he got I don't know if you know this but he got cancelled for a little while
*  No, what did he do? Yeah, the dolly llama got cancelled. Yes. Yes. Yes. I bet he dealt with it fine
*  He did this and we are he was actually talking about this exact same subject
*  He did this interview where they said, uh, you know, you've been you're celibate and have you ever thought about being married or having children?
*  He goes, oh i've seen a lot of marriages
*  Uh much wordy much cancer
*  And he goes plus uh when they break up a woman get all the money
*  He's like joking around
*  And and and the lady's like what the fuck? This is the dolly llama
*  And then she goes she actually tries to social justice her way out of it because you know
*  She's out. She got to confront him. She goes actually sometimes the woman makes her own money
*  And he's like, oh good one
*  Just like oh sometimes
*  So they just put him in time out for a minute people were saying they should we cancel the dolly llama it was really funny
*  It was really funny
*  He's like you can cancel it. I see people
*  He goes, uh, then I see him like a couple years later new person new girlfriend much worry much cancer
*  Still holding that line puss. He talks about how women want to spend all the guy's money. I'm like this is hilarious
*  But has he had a girlfriend?
*  He maybe doesn't know about that stuff that's guesswork you should tell straight guesswork. Yeah
*  That life is a strange life, you know, they picked him when he was a baby he was a little kid, right?
*  He was a little kid. They picked him and they said you're the fucking man, bro
*  Imagine that when the last one dies, he was really young. I think he was the last one dies
*  They pick a new one. They have they have a slate of little babies. They're like, yeah
*  How how is that monitored
*  They just have a vibe
*  It was like a council of is there a hat and you put a bunch of names in it?
*  Or is it like a I i'm not there. I haven't seen it done
*  Is it required that he's celibate? Is that part of the the gig?
*  Imagine that that's so rude. Yeah, because it's like can't you come to me like in my 50s? Yeah
*  Why do you want to come to me as a holy man when i'm seven? Yeah, you don't have the choice
*  You cut off the sex at seven never wait, well, no, they don't okay. Sorry. I i'm misinterpreted
*  I'm saying i'm like they're not allowed to ever have sex. No, no, no, no sex. I didn't think so
*  Once you said it. I was like is this something I don't know a rude way to put it
*  Dummy, sorry, it's not like they ever put it on. I mean there was no it was already there a baby. Yeah
*  Yeah, it's already attached. Yeah. Wow now i'm thinking about the dali. Lama's what year did they pick the dali llama?
*  Never thought that would happen. No, I didn't either first time we share a birthday. I think I should tell you all you and that
*  Is crazy that's the truth. That's crazy. You might be people those people are hilarious 1984
*  I I share a birthday with the dali llama. It's the same joe also a conscious stream
*  There's a consciousness stream. You know what I watched last night that I haven't seen really
*  I don't think I ever saw it through it was zoolander. Oh, it's so good. It's so good. So ridiculous. Who am I?
*  It's so ridiculous what a great idea to have a like a super vapid beautiful man. Oh, it's so good
*  In one of those really slap sticky silly comedies. There's so much truth to it though. That's the sad part
*  It's like there's a yeah you you knew male models when you were doing male modeling
*  You were doing male modeling you do male modeling, right?
*  Back in my former formative years when I was a male model news grenade, uh things have changed
*  No, I did I did. Yeah, there's there's I mean it's kind of like
*  I gotta choose my words carefully here. Uh
*  There's a thing I think modeling in general is a very odd thing if I was a model from 14 to like 18
*  And it's kind of like the dali llama. They just chose you
*  No, wait, I I went for it
*  And my mom like took me to this agency and I was like making money when I was you know
*  I had like I was just like working every every other week for like value city department stores anyone where my clevelanders at
*  And uh, eventually like kept getting you know
*  Uh, I never saw it as like the end-all be-all
*  I wanted the bridge to something else as I figured out like where my area of entertainment was I was an actor for a while
*  um
*  But you know if that's all you got and you're just sort of like paid to look beautiful like there's something really fucked up about that
*  Like it's not a healthy mindset
*  And I saw lots of eating disorders and all kinds of really sad shit that like, you know
*  people's identities are wrapped up in this and
*  I remember I uh
*  I
*  I gained a little weight when I was 18 because I went on birth control and they
*  Uh, I was in the middle of my agency and they were measuring me in front of people
*  And they were like you gotta lose two inches and and it's a fucking hard thing and
*  I just quit. I started bartending. Um, I didn't it didn't want it that badly and I like pizza
*  That's such a weird thing to say I know it's really it's really fucked up. That's so specific. Yeah
*  Yeah, what if I lose two and a half? Would you well you need to fit the clothes?
*  You know, I think I mean, I don't I'm not fighters though, right? Yeah. Well, no
*  I didn't mean to compare
*  Training as a model
*  Yeah, all right rescinded
*  But no, it is a thing where you're both relying on your body entirely for your living
*  You know
*  And then a lot of people involved though and for women I would imagine women already
*  Women already worry about being marginalized for their brain anyway
*  So then it's almost like some of them feel like they have to prove themselves extra
*  Because they happen to be pretty and they're a model and people just assume they're a moron, right? That's an issue too. Yeah
*  It's an issue. I mean, yeah, I don't know
*  But there's also people who figure it out. There's girls do it then they do other shit. Yeah, they can do it
*  That's why I get kind of annoyed when people will talk about any job being inherently toxic
*  Okay, a lot of jobs have the potential for toxicity everything
*  Including like, you know fucking everything
*  All of them all jobs could fuck you up all jobs could distort your percent
*  I mean, how about being a cop? You know bad that could fucking distort your perception
*  How about being a doctor emergency room doctor every day bullet wounds stab wounds car accidents dealing with that every day
*  That that shit's got to be bad for you. That kid can't be good for your head 100
*  Models worried about losing two inches
*  You know the doctor's not 14 years old that's a difference oh you're only super hot and I'm super duper hot
*  Jesus
*  For sure like there was I was like catalog I was you know, I mean I knew what I was it's all kind of crazy, right?
*  You just get this amazing roll of the dice with your bone structure and then everybody's like here's some money
*  You're like what do I have to do for this? Yeah
*  Dance like a monkey
*  Well, you got to be smart with it. You got to know what it is know that there's a there's an expiration date on it
*  What are you gonna do with the money you make?
*  What are you gonna do with any of the you know, like that's how I started acting and I loved it
*  You know, it's kind of crazy though. If you really stop and think about it
*  Like that that is like the biggest lottery in life for a lot of folks is how do you look, you know?
*  Yeah, like if you're jason mamoa, it's amazing. He's a good guy. It's amazing. He's a good guy
*  Because he's too beautiful. Yeah, he's too good looking. You know, he was sitting next to us at the sturgeon concert
*  Oh, yeah, he was on he was on one side and then johnny burnthal the punisher was on the other and it was like
*  One of the best days of my life. Haha
*  Well, it was cool. I enjoyed that very much. I don't get to see concerts like that
*  It was so great and you know and to go and see it with you that was really fun. We had fun
*  Yeah
*  Where was the show? It was at the troubadour the troubadour dude was awesome
*  And it was the fire and fury this new new show that he's doing
*  Yeah, but he's also doing a lot of stuff from his old his old catalog, too
*  So it was just it was awesome and it was real intimate like what is that 400 people or something?
*  We sold it out once we know it was like one of the greatest moments of honey, honey
*  And it's also one of the great venues in la it's a double decker, but it's still intimate
*  You know, it's really rare in the way the way it's set up. I mean it's set up amazing
*  Like where we were was incredible like up above when you're in that little balcony area next to the punisher
*  Oh
*  I know it
*  We talked about this. I think I told you this but when we went to dinner afterwards, uh, john prine was right in front of us and I
*  Really really wanted to tell him how much I loved his music
*  And I I chickened out
*  Yeah, I remember we were talking about it. I didn't know who he was. That's the first time I ever
*  Heard of him. Yeah saw yeah, and then when I heard he died from covid I was like, oh, that's that dude
*  He you know, he's worth checking out and like really really digging into who he was and and his surgery loved him
*  Yeah, he's magical. Yeah, beautiful song right here. Beautiful. Can you remember like a specific famous song that people would angel from montgomery?
*  What's that? Can you do it? Can you do it? I'll mess it up. So what ben?
*  God damn it. Can you pull up? No, we can do it
*  Listen one of the best one of the best music shows i've ever seen in my life is when you guys were on stage with gary clark
*  And you were singing midnight rider
*  That shit got pulled off the podcast
*  Or whoever owns it. Yeah when you when that happens more than three times, they can't see your fucking account. Yeah
*  Okay, this might be sloppy look at that. Oh, there you go. Oh my god. Is that good? Is this key was a
*  Uh, do the bonnie rate, uh key, I don't know what key she does it but we'll just find it
*  Yeah, okay
*  All right
*  Yeah, forgive her we're finding a key it might be weird does that make people are fine with this don't worry about this
*  They love the weirdness like people love seeing how musicians put together a song
*  Hold on. You know, you have to here we go. You're just talking do it higher and then you jump into an awesome song
*  Ben
*  In the best way like it's good for you, I know my heart is racing
*  Explain this whiskey again ben
*  uh
*  That whiskey uncle nearest this guy named nathan green
*  Was at least to my knowledge the first recognized master distiller who was an african-american
*  Taught jack daniels how to do his thing freed slave after civil after the civil war
*  And this is the whiskey brought in. Thank you very much. It's 1856. That's it. Okay
*  Who is singing that version of bonnie ray bonnie ray, yeah that lady
*  Yeah
*  So
*  I am an old woman named after my mother
*  My old man is another child that's grown old
*  If dreams were thunder
*  And lightning was desire
*  This old house would have burned down a long time ago
*  Make me an angel that flies from montgomery
*  Make me a poster of an old rodeo
*  Just give me one thing
*  I can hold on to
*  You to believe in this living
*  Hard way to go
*  Right job prime come on
*  You'll have to work that out in a fuller version, but you know, there's more to it
*  Do you want to keep going? Well, you want to play big man? Let's keep playing. Okay. Keep playing this. This is so good
*  Okay. All right. I love big man, too, though. I want to hear that next
*  All right
*  When I was a young girl
*  And I had me a cowboy
*  He wasn't much to look at just a free rambling man
*  That was a long time
*  No matter how I tried
*  Oh
*  Just give me one thing
*  I can hold on to
*  You to believe in this living is just a hard way to go
*  Believe in this living is a hard way to go
*  That was beautiful
*  100 cover that song 100
*  Percent but I mean you did but you should put that on something that was awesome
*  We gotta do it for joe don't do it for me do it king of spotify. We will do it for you
*  I'm not even the prince. You're not even the prince. You're the king. I'm the court jester. Oh, whatever
*  Humble man, um, you want to do big man since we're like here. I might need to tune up though because it's chilly in here
*  Is it chilly in here? Do you want to no no from the fiddle point?
*  Right
*  Let me tune that and this isn't live no, right, okay, but we're not editing it
*  Well shit isn't that crazy that you know how
*  Whether it's warm or cold based on the strings based on you running that thing across. What is that thing called the wand?
*  It's a what?
*  That's so much better than what it's called. What's it called? It's called a wand
*  No, it's a bow. It's called a bow. Is it really?
*  Oh, of course bow and fiddle. Yeah, but I made it a horse. I'm gonna call it a wand now
*  Yeah, one sounds better. Right? What's that music wand? Because I've always wanted to be a wizard. You kind of are
*  I was watching this one thing on tiktok where they had this girl who was a witch and they said, uh,
*  You know, we want to know like have you
*  actively cursed the police officers and have you
*  Have you cursed the looters and she was going oh, yeah, we've already done that
*  Like there's active witches on the road to peace
*  I mean, well, I want to I have comments on that. Okay comments on witches
*  No more intentions of like what a spell is and like the way that people um orchestrate that it's kind of powerful
*  Like it's it's like prayer in a way that like if we all sort of do it
*  Yeah, but it gets weird well
*  We all want people to like us and all someone has to do is not like you
*  Ferociously and that can make you upset. I'm not talking about negative spells
*  I'm talking about but i'm just saying that's the beginning of it, right?
*  Now if someone has a lot of intention and they put intention on you like having a terrible life or you
*  Getting diseases and you and you hear about that. It probably fucks with your head
*  I mean, that's what voodoo is probably all about for sure and for all intents of purposes
*  I think there are ramifications if that is the trajectory if you're like really like putting bad vibes into something
*  Yeah, it's gonna come back in a really shitty way, but they only do it because their life sucks
*  I think people that do shit like that. They do it because their life sucks
*  Let's hope their lives get better. Let's do that. Let's give them the tools for them. Actually. No, this is for
*  We're gonna play big man. Yeah. Yeah, we want to do this. This is for them
*  No, no
*  The lyrics is to george floyd. Yeah, because uh, you know, his nickname was big floyd or big right?
*  Yeah, I didn't obviously didn't know well not all the lyrics line up, but it it does it's an homage to a great man who?
*  Who passed originally and it just feels apropos to do it now. Yeah. Yeah cool
*  Can you face me a little bit?
*  Oh
*  They spill buckets out of their eyes
*  Playing white faces
*  And playing gray stones
*  He took that white
*  Cocaine up his nose
*  Oh
*  When he went down
*  There was a trembling pole
*  And they came far in
*  wide to the funeral
*  When the people shut up
*  They were broken will
*  They drank all day
*  And they popped
*  Sing for that big man, baby down by the river in the railroad track
*  Baby, ain't I be that he's gone that won't bring it back to life
*  So
*  Bones buried young, bones buried deep, bones I won't shake now, laid to sleep.
*  And he looks down, oh he looks up, he was a good man, that was enough.
*  Sink for that big man baby, down by the river and the railroad tracks.
*  Baby ain't happy that he's gone, but I won't bring him back to life now.
*  Sink for that big man baby, down by the river and the railroad tracks.
*  Baby ain't happy that he's gone, but I won't bring him back to life now.
*  Oh shit! That was so good. We got through it.
*  All this stuff that's been going on lately. It was heavy. Dedicating it to George Floyd.
*  I'm like, jeez what are you doing?
*  Obviously intense time.
*  I think ultimately society needed this. They didn't need that guy to die, but they needed this event to snap out of whatever bullshit relationship particularly the black community has with police.
*  I think in the videos that have come out since of police officers doing shit while this is all going on, during this, it's like they have a pattern, some of these cops. They can't break out of it. They're used to treating people like shit. They're used to violently assaulting people.
*  Yes, the directive.
*  There's so much of it. There's so much crazy shit of guys using batons on women just standing there. The girl's just standing there and he's using the baton on the front of her thighs and throws her onto the ground. I'm like, fucking come on man. How are you doing this?
*  Because someone won't comply. The position of being a person that has that kind of power over people, where people have to comply to you, is just psychologically fraught with peril.
*  Whether it's black people, there's a lot of it doing with white people. There's a horrible video on my friend Joe Schilling's page. Joe Schilling the kickboxer. He's got a page on his Instagram he's been putting post after post is police brutality shit.
*  Post after post. It's like is this to serve or protect? And this is this old man. And the guy has a cane and the cops are slamming into him with their shield and he goes flying and falls and hits his head on a bike rack. It's fucking horrible.
*  It's horrible.
*  That has been going on. It's been going on in the black community. Clearly we have a shitload of evidence that's been going on with all kinds of people. It's an overall problem. There's a racism component to it. But the problem is police brutality.
*  Yeah, I was reading about, so 40% of police officers have sleep disorders and PTSD. So they're just constantly, 40% of police officers have sleep disorders and admit to error on the job, i.e. falling asleep in their cruisers, violent acts, anger issues. And, you know, a lot of I was, I'm trying to understand as much as possible because it's so fucking sensitive.
*  They need to apply the same rehabilitative mindset to the police force as people are calling for in communities of color as well. Obviously it has to be a joint effort.
*  100%. Look, they have to do something. And something has to be done to psychologically address the real consequences of seeing violence and murder and horrible things every day. There's got to be, there's a price you're paying if that's what you're doing with your life.
*  Like you open the door, a guy killed himself with a shotgun. Oh Jesus. Just brain splatter all over the wall. Open the door, there's a girl who was raped and stabbed. Oh Jesus Christ. Open the door, there's someone who just got overdosed from fentanyl. They're 18 years old. That's what you're seeing all day long. You're just always fucking dying.
*  And then the solution isn't to just pay them more. Like oh here, here's hazard pay.
*  Well my friend Dakota Meyer, Dakota Meyer is a guy who served overseas and had some horrific instances where he literally had to fight a man to the death and kill him with a rock. Jesus Christ. Heavy shit. He talked about it on the podcast and I was like fuck.
*  You know, he's fighting for his life with this guy because they were in war. The guy was the enemy and he had to kill a bunch of guys that day and save his friend. It's a crazy story that's best told by him. But anyway, point is he was talking about this shot that they're doing on soldiers with PTSD.
*  It's some kind of a blocker shot. Remember that shot, Jamie? I could text him if we have to. But they give it to soldiers and people with PTSD and whatever that anxiety is, all that fucking pent up shit that you just can't be normal, it goes away. And it can last for as long as a year.
*  What? Holy shit. It's called the Stelate Ganglion Block. It's administered by healthcare professionals into the neck of an individual who's suffering from PTSD. The treatment is not a cure for PTSD. He was talking about how amazing it was.
*  He was saying, see right there, that second article there, it said something about prolonged relief for the debilitating symptoms. Yeah. It's not a cure, however, it's highly effective, well tolerated, fast acting, inexpensive biologic technique that provides prolonged relief from the debilitating symptoms of PTSD.
*  Did they just start doing that? Is that a brand new thing? Yeah, yeah. I think it's pretty recent. But I also think that your brain, when it encounters a lot of things that are awful, I think it really alters the chemistry of your brain. I think it alters your ability to make good decisions. You can make a real rational case that they're almost intoxicated.
*  Yeah. 100%. Oh, and they're running on adrenaline. Right. When you see these cops, did you see when they were clearing out the square for Trump to have his Bible photo up? You've got cops slamming into people. How do they get that ramped up that they're doing that? Could you ever do that? Would you just walk right up to someone and slam them with a shield? Of course you wouldn't.
*  These guys are terrified too, obviously. The cops are terrified for sure. But you have to get to a point where you can do that. There's something that has to happen. Well, it's a biologic drug that your body's producing. And these guys are junkies. They're adrenaline junkies.
*  Yeah. I mean, literally, I told you about the therapy I just did. This is what I've been trying to weed out of my life is my insomnia and get my brain levels and my ... I've just been running on adrenaline. And now that I'm leveling out, it's so weird to live ... I can function better. I can process my stress in a way that I never could for over a decade.
*  And the reason I was reading about the Saraset ... I think they did this study. I'll send it to you at some point and we could probably post it. But the conditions that police officers are under physically, like from night shifts just to stress to what you said, opening the door and seeing all these just horrifying things and not having the therapeutic elements and rehabilitation.
*  And then you factor in racism or just discrimination. It's a lethal combination and it's so crazy to just see it like we are every day now. It's just all out in the open. And now it's like, what do we do to help these people get to the place that they're supposed to be, which is protecting us?
*  Well, you got to clean house. You got to clean house. You got to go in there and you got to get it rid of anyone who exhibits any sort of behavior like that in any way, in any abusive ... you can't have any abuse.
*  Because you have an extraordinary ability to control people. You're not allowed ... a normal person is not allowed to treat people like that. So for you to be able to do that, you have to show that you're an unusual person. You're a powerful person.
*  You can control it. You can be a good person even under the pressure of conflict, like life or death conflict on a daily basis. That's not a normal person. And by the way, when these guys are in it 15, 20 years, how fucking sick are they by 20 years?
*  And how unprepared are they when they've been training for six months and boom, done, you're out on the street.
*  How about a day? First day on the job.
*  A lot of cops sign up for law enforcement when they're fucking 18 years old.
*  Crazy. Your brain's not even fully formed.
*  No, exactly. Like that in and of itself, you get like a big strong kid. And I'm primarily speaking about men. I'm sure women could do it too, but it's different. And their brain's not fully formed and then their life is in your hands ... or your life is in their hands. It's like what?
*  Well, another thing that came out of this whole COVID thing and then with this coming afterwards, it's like when you're dealing with perpetually crime-ridden neighborhoods, like they've had crime in them forever.
*  And a lot of these neighborhoods are African American neighborhoods that have had crime, whether it's the South Side of Chicago or outside of Baltimore.
*  Like when you see how the government can spend so much money bailing out corporations that are fucked, but they don't bail out cities that are fucked.
*  Like you know, hold on, you knew Baltimore was fucked. Like no one had any questions whether parts of Baltimore were just fucked.
*  In fact, there was laws that used to redline. You weren't allowed to buy a house in certain areas if you were an African American. So we know that.
*  So how come you bail out corporations as you never bailed out these inner cities? It would have cost a fraction to set up community centers, build much better affordable housing.
*  Leadership is too short-sighted for that. And that's like a spiritual deficit.
*  But what's crazy is they all want to pretend that they're pro-American. If you were pro-American, you would want less losers.
*  You would want more people that have an opportunity to get out of bad circumstances. And whatever those bad circumstances are, you'd want to keep people safe.
*  You're always going to run into bad circumstances with people that have drug addictions or people. You're not going to cure all that.
*  That's a human issue. Humans are crazy. You're not going to stop broken families and all that stuff. That's just a part of being a person.
*  But you can do a way better job of protecting people from crime, a way better job of insulating them from drug deals and all that crazy shit.
*  And shielding them or integrating people in a healthier way into an economic system that addresses their needs.
*  But that's what we're so vulnerable from a leadership perspective because of lobbying and because of just a natural instinct of self-protectionism.
*  And like, well, I've got to make sure that my family is taken care of first and not...
*  The cornerstone speech that Killer Mike encouraged people to read. Did you guys read that?
*  I've seen it. Yeah.
*  It's really intense. And it was written by names escaping me.
*  The vice president of the Confederacy.
*  Yeah, okay. I was going to say president or vice president of the Confederacy.
*  And for all intents and purposes, the first half of the speech was pretty logical in terms of commerce and how to care for your cities.
*  And like, you know, just economics.
*  And then he just gets down to this part where he talks about African Americans as like, you know, they're subhuman.
*  Like, they're not actual...
*  Like, it's just so clear cut and dry in his mind that the superior race is white.
*  By God, he was quoting the Bible and like thousands and millions of people, millions of people, like followed that ethos.
*  And that doesn't just go away.
*  You know, there's so like in terms of redlining when people want to know why, you know, ghettos, it's so hard to get out of the ghetto.
*  You know, like this has been made by design and even further back, just the thought that like black people are the slaves.
*  Like they're beneath us. So they need to be in their place.
*  And like, it's just nuts like to read this speech.
*  It was... And to think about how many people were behind it.
*  And that's what we're up against, even though it was 300 or 400 years ago.
*  Was that what it was? 1600s?
*  18.
*  Fuck, sorry.
*  Well, it's weird walking in.
*  Cool.
*  Not in 80.
*  Being an adult in 2020, right?
*  And not having anything to do with anything that happened in the 1800s.
*  But you walk into the wake of that era and to the echo of that era.
*  It's not that long ago.
*  150 years ago, there was 152 years ago, there were slaves.
*  That's crazy.
*  I know.
*  That's not even two lifetimes.
*  That's a blink of an eye.
*  That's a blink of an eye.
*  It's not that long ago.
*  Yeah. And what's really crazy is like, we have a thing that we do with Native Americans, right?
*  We kind of acknowledge that our settler, the European settlers, the original great, whether they're your relatives or not, mine aren't.
*  Mine all came third. I'm third generation.
*  So my family arrived in the 20th century.
*  But the people that arrived earlier than that, like if your family goes all the way back to 1600, there's some fucking Native American blood on your hands, son.
*  Yeah.
*  This is if you get well, my father was in the railroad business.
*  Oh, shit.
*  How did he get that fucking railroad through your country?
*  You had to kill some people, man.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, yeah.
*  So the United States has kind of acknowledged that they fucked up and they gave the Native Americans reservations.
*  That was the whole idea is like you can have your own laws.
*  You can make casinos.
*  You can do wild shit.
*  You can do it all right here.
*  OK, we're just going to leave you alone.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's it's real slippery, right?
*  Well, they didn't.
*  You know, that's a false promise.
*  Yeah, they didn't leave them alone.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  They started finding, you know, wealth on their lands.
*  Then they got even worse.
*  I just finished.
*  I just read this book called Killers of the Flower Moon, which is just a horrifying thing that happened in our history that is not well known.
*  With the Osage Native American tribe in Oklahoma, and they were all forced onto this reservation.
*  And it turned out to be millions and millions of dollars rich in oil.
*  And then all of the members of the tribe were given head rights.
*  And they every year, all these white people would come in and they would they would like rent their land basically for oil rigs.
*  And they each member of the tribe had millions of dollars.
*  But the government didn't recognize them as full citizens.
*  So they were given stewards to manage their wealth.
*  So a lot of them were living in poverty while their fucking babysitters were robbing them, murdering them.
*  And the whole book is about this series of murders and also how the FBI was born.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Damn, the FBI.
*  Yeah.
*  So whoever whoever used this as his platform, because.
*  But the sad part is there was like three dudes that went to jail for killing like 25 people.
*  One, they weren't given they weren't put to death because no white jury could kill them for for killing Native Americans because they weren't considered full human.
*  They like to have a picture of that.
*  It's crazy. It's insane and it's heartbreaking.
*  And it really echoes what's going on now with the way that that black people are treated.
*  It's like people didn't give a fuck about Native Americans.
*  And like and then they got rich and then they're like, let's fuck them again.
*  You know, like, let's make sure that they like we can still steal from them.
*  It's horrifying.
*  But the thing is, there's no there was no justice for their murderers.
*  And there were so it was like a coup.
*  There were just so many people that would come in and marry an Osage tribe member and murder them just to get their head.
*  Yeah, it's not.
*  Was it mostly chicks murdering?
*  No, it was everything.
*  They poisoned them a lot.
*  There's a lot of poisoning.
*  What is this, Jamie?
*  The new this book was this option into the new Martin's.
*  No shit.
*  What?
*  Holy shit.
*  You just did that.
*  You just did that.
*  The Joe Rogan.
*  Wow.
*  Apple teaming.
*  I think it's an old book.
*  I think it's a pretty old book.
*  Yeah, it's not that.
*  But they just.
*  But yeah, the.
*  I literally picked it up at my parents' house.
*  That's amazing.
*  DiCaprio.
*  Martin Scorsese, De Niro and DiCaprio.
*  It was that or Lord of the Flies.
*  I'm going to say bam.
*  Titties.
*  Titties.
*  Wow.
*  That's amazing.
*  Yeah, strikes again.
*  Crazy.
*  I did.
*  I really got into a big long stretch of being fascinated with Native American history from
*  a book somebody recommended to me called Empire the Summer Moon about the Comanche.
*  And it's really like why Texas is the way Texas is.
*  Texas is the way Texas is mostly because they fought off the fucking Comanches.
*  Yeah.
*  People that had to go.
*  Mexico was so sneaky.
*  Mexico was telling white people to move to Texas.
*  They're like, my friend is a good place.
*  They they they tricked these people into moving into Texas because it was a buffer between
*  them and the Comanche.
*  They wanted about the Comanche where the fucking wildest, most ruthless band of Indians and
*  the most successful out of all the all the West.
*  It took hundreds of years to conquer them.
*  They're the reason why people didn't make it all the way to California sooner.
*  When they would go through the plains, the Comanches would fuck them up.
*  It the fucking that book is fascinating.
*  It changed my changed my perspective of what happened in the West.
*  Yeah.
*  Like you realize that there was some people that came over here from somewhere in the
*  neighborhood of between eleven thousand and five thousand B.C.
*  They made it across the Bering land bridge from Asia into America.
*  They were basically the same kind of people that lived in Siberia and they were stone
*  age when they got here.
*  They weren't even on horseback and they lived that way for thousands and thousands and thousands
*  of years exactly the same way.
*  And it wasn't until the sixteen hundreds they started riding horses.
*  Wow.
*  And then they started dominating motherfuckers.
*  Wow.
*  It was like this giant shift in who they were before.
*  They were like really unsuccessful in war.
*  They had no history.
*  They had no songs.
*  They had no stories and very little artwork.
*  All they did is like eat rats and squirrels and whatever they could kill and barely scratched
*  by and stayed alive.
*  But they figured out how to ride horses first.
*  They figured out how to control horses better and they figured out how to steal other people's
*  horses because life was so hard.
*  It was so scratch and claw that they were ruthless.
*  So once they got horses they were just these wild little scrappy motherfuckers who would
*  run run these horses around and kill everybody.
*  They figured out how to shoot off horses and the white people didn't know how to do that
*  yet.
*  The white people would get off the horses and go hmmm.
*  Let's line up.
*  Wait wait wait we got to get up.
*  You stand there and then I'm three.
*  They were shooting like an arrow a second.
*  They were like ping ping.
*  Oh my god.
*  Running on the horses fucking these dudes up.
*  And so no one until they figured out how to make a revolver until they figured out a way
*  a gun that shoots more than once because those muskets weren't cutting it.
*  Right.
*  Like they just kept getting fucked up.
*  That's Texas.
*  When was the revolver birthed?
*  All during that time.
*  The Texas Rangers were the first to incorporate the revolver against the Comanche.
*  The Texas Rangers became the Texas Rangers because of this fucking unbelievably ruthless
*  tribe of Indians that dominated the area.
*  So these dudes instead of being like regular soldiers adopted the way of the Comanche.
*  They wore buckskin clothes.
*  They slept without fires.
*  The Texas Rangers.
*  Yes.
*  They were fucking savages.
*  They out savaged the Comanches.
*  A lot of the FBI agents that were commissioned to find the killers in the Osage murders,
*  they were ex Texas Rangers.
*  Plus it's an amazing Chuck Norris TV show.
*  What the heck?
*  What?
*  Lonesome Dove?
*  Come on.
*  Come on.
*  You ever get into Lonesome Dove?
*  No.
*  I never got into Lonesome Dove.
*  Tell us Ben.
*  Tell us.
*  It's just an incredible book.
*  I mean about two retired Texas Rangers but it's just like a classic western novel.
*  I actually have it on the audiobook.
*  I just haven't gotten around to it.
*  I will.
*  I watched all the Texas Rangers with Chuck Norris again.
*  Wait, do we have any Deadwood fans in the house here?
*  Anybody?
*  Deadwood bothered me because they swore so much.
*  They swore so much.
*  I was like that's not real.
*  I'm sorry.
*  What?
*  Oh no.
*  That's not how they talked back then.
*  It's got a theatrical element.
*  It's a little like Shakespearean in a way but.
*  Yeah but it was.
*  Oh thank you.
*  Thanks for looking out.
*  It made me just check him in.
*  I love you.
*  Thanks.
*  I'm supposed to drink slowly.
*  You'll be fine.
*  It's just your daddy.
*  Trust me.
*  He's my friend.
*  I'm your friend too.
*  Because we're on the Joe Rogan podcast and I don't want to be a fucking dickhead.
*  Listen, you're not going to be.
*  But don't hinder yourself either.
*  Well I haven't drank in a month.
*  I'm sensitive.
*  You look fine.
*  Everything's going great.
*  Oh god, be lost.
*  Everything's fine.
*  She's back.
*  Don't worry.
*  Are you not drinking on purpose?
*  Just give yourself a little cleanse.
*  No, I did my seroset therapy and this is like my month's up.
*  I can start living again.
*  But my brain's in a good place.
*  I know life without alcohol.
*  This is good alcohol.
*  Let me tell you, it's been really hard not to drink this month.
*  I'm sure.
*  Let's be quite clear.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, they say because of coronavirus, alcohol consumption was up.
*  And then because of these riots and all this, I'm sure it's up again.
*  Another notch.
*  Oh yeah.
*  The looting and the riots and people breaking into people's homes and shit.
*  But yeah, vulnerable people just slammed every stop of the way.
*  We got to get through this as a race.
*  I think having a big moment.
*  If we needed a correction, we definitely needed a correction.
*  We still do.
*  We need so many corrections.
*  We need a correction in terms of our thought on war, our thought on international conflict,
*  the way we treat each other.
*  We need corrections on all that.
*  But it takes a big event sometimes.
*  This is it?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's like...
*  Complete restructuring of how we view each other.
*  But you also have to be careful of bad players.
*  There's a lot of bad actors in these things.
*  No, that's the scary part.
*  They want to take advantage of people and they want people to comply with their ideology
*  and they try to push things and say, if you don't go along with this, we know where you
*  stand, we know where you are, you're on the other side.
*  And you get forced into some weird compliance.
*  You got to be real careful about that.
*  Because again, it's sort of the same thing you see with bad cops.
*  When people have power over people, even if it's just psychic power, when people have
*  power over people, they abuse it.
*  Well, have the revolution after revolution, look at the French Revolution or something
*  like that.
*  They tear it down in the name of liberty and then they're just killing people left and
*  right.
*  So there's a pattern that we can examine.
*  But I think it's important to not...
*  Obviously these events are catalyzing, but what we need to take from the event is that
*  we don't need an event.
*  We have to integrate this stuff.
*  Well, I think we need an event, like what we had, along with accountability.
*  This is the strange thing about the culture we're living in.
*  A 17-year-old girl was there when George Floyd died.
*  So a 17-year-old girl's cell phone camera changed the world.
*  That's real.
*  So this poor little girl has to deal with...
*  Imagine being a 17-year-old black girl watching a man get a knee put on his chest while he's
*  asking, please let me up, please, I can't breathe.
*  And you know that guy died and you filmed it and your video gets uploaded and the world
*  just explodes.
*  There are fucking...
*  There's protests in Tokyo, protests in Berlin.
*  People are all over the world protesting New Zealand.
*  Our friend Stylebender was in one.
*  In New Zealand, on the other side of the planet Earth.
*  People aren't asleep anymore.
*  Not asleep anymore.
*  Well, some people, yeah.
*  But she had a great response, too.
*  Did you see that?
*  Because people came after her and saying, why didn't you do more in that moment?
*  She had a really cogent and wonderful response about just contextualizing it.
*  Listen, man, people just...
*  There's too many people.
*  If you say people say this or people say that, people will tell you to eat your foot.
*  They'll tell you.
*  You have to eat your foot if you want to be on this gang.
*  People are crazy.
*  What about the Trump thing with the drinking...
*  Bleach or whatever?
*  People did that in Result.
*  No, no, no, no, no, they didn't.
*  Two morons drank the wrong form of hydrochloroquine that is actually a pond cleaner.
*  It's for fucking koi ponds.
*  These dipshits had it in their garage and they're like, this is it.
*  This is chloroquine.
*  Did they die?
*  One guy died.
*  And there's a problem.
*  One guy looks great.
*  Sorry.
*  Put your tin foil hat on.
*  That's not funny.
*  They were...
*  Here's the problem.
*  They were big time Democrats.
*  That's why it doesn't make sense.
*  One of them was a Democrat candidate contributor, I believe.
*  Make sure that's right.
*  And people were like, wait, you guys are just...
*  You're not supposed to do that.
*  You just think you had magically had this stuff laying around?
*  Yeah, how dumb though?
*  But I wasn't talking about the...
*  The problem is it's just a random thing where it sounds the same and it's real...
*  It's hydroxychloroquine versus some other kind of chloroquine.
*  You sure there wasn't some agenda here?
*  That just seems like...
*  I'm sorry.
*  I don't want to...
*  I'm getting confused.
*  It could be.
*  I don't want to disrespect the dead slash almost dead.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  It could be somebody killed somebody.
*  Yeah.
*  There you go.
*  That happens.
*  Lots of weird things happen.
*  I don't know what the truth is anymore.
*  I have no idea.
*  But why would a person who's like a staunch Democrat listen to anything that Trump has
*  to say about taking a medication?
*  You'd be like, fuck that guy.
*  Nothing about that.
*  Fuck that guy.
*  I'm taking heroin.
*  He's an idiot.
*  Sidebar.
*  A good friend of ours, per the Trump Bible photo, our friend said Trump holds the Bible
*  like a guitar player who doesn't know how to play guitar.
*  I said he held it like a dirty diaper.
*  I said it was like a dirty diaper.
*  Like, what do I do with this?
*  Get this fucking thing out of here.
*  It's fucking awful.
*  Oh my God.
*  I don't want to talk about that guy.
*  But what a stupid fucking...
*  He did that on purpose.
*  Like, he decided to go do this as a press, like some sort of a publicity opportunity.
*  Man, this propaganda shit is...
*  That's the dumbest publicity opportunity ever.
*  Like you literally use...
*  Do you know that one of the members of the military stepped down, a military advisor?
*  Who's the guy that stepped down?
*  There was a guy that stepped down today.
*  No, no, no.
*  Different guy.
*  Stepped down because of that stunt.
*  Because of that publicity stunt.
*  He stepped down.
*  Because he said that the abusive use of force that they used to clear out that square so
*  Trump could come in for that photo op.
*  He's like, I can't be a part of this.
*  Yes.
*  That's what we need.
*  That's what we need.
*  We need videos.
*  We need accountability.
*  And that video, whether he knows it or not, is evidence.
*  We know there's a fucking protest there.
*  They all go away and shut up because you're awesome.
*  Get the fuck out of here.
*  You did something.
*  You did something to people that were peacefully protesting.
*  And it's scary that maybe he doesn't even know.
*  There was some shit that I tweeted today too where it's been proven that they used a certain
*  type of tear gas that you're not supposed to use on people.
*  No, I don't know that.
*  Find it on my...
*  Here, I'll pull it up while Jamie's doing that.
*  To me, he's going to be like a folk legend, Donald Trump.
*  He's like the Paul Bunyan of narcissism.
*  You know what I mean?
*  So far beyond what is understandable from a human to human.
*  He's like a superhero of narcissism.
*  Does that make sense?
*  It makes perfect sense.
*  There's a guy who resigned.
*  He resigned today because of the way Trump cleared out that plaza.
*  I was reading it today on the Google News.
*  These videos are there.
*  You can't do that to people.
*  And why are they doing that to people?
*  They're doing that to people because they shouldn't be cops.
*  Okay, I have a question.
*  Pentagon side.
*  Is that who it was?
*  No.
*  No, no, no.
*  It happened just today.
*  Military advisor resigns.
*  Right there.
*  Photo op.
*  Right there.
*  No, no.
*  Above that.
*  Above that.
*  No, Jamie.
*  Two days ago.
*  He didn't resign.
*  Okay.
*  In my Google News feed, it showed up today.
*  For whatever reason.
*  Sometimes you get a Google News feed story from like seven months ago.
*  But go back to that article.
*  Why did you?
*  Because it's a pop-up thing on it.
*  Oh, you can't get out of there?
*  Trying to get a better one.
*  Jamie, Jamie.
*  Jamie did mention you guys were talking about a drum set.
*  I don't know if he said that to you.
*  No.
*  Why would we get here?
*  Ben's like, do you want a, you should have a drum set.
*  He said why don't you have a drum set?
*  I'm like, why would I have a drum set?
*  Ben was just not interested at all off the bat.
*  I don't understand.
*  He's like, what if Jamie wants to play the drums?
*  People want to play the drums?
*  Look, I made it clear my intentions.
*  I'm like, if Jamie wanted to play the drums, he would just get a drum set and bring it
*  here.
*  So really it's on you, Jamie.
*  Sorry, I was trying to read.
*  There's so many things going on.
*  I'm trying to.
*  You have me looking at three different things at once.
*  I'm sorry.
*  You get on your own here, but I support you.
*  You don't.
*  James Miller.
*  Yeah.
*  This is it.
*  James Miller Jr., who served as the U.S. Under Secretary of Defense for Policy from 2012
*  to 2014, recalled that he swore an oath of office to support and defend the Constitution
*  of the United States and to bear truth and faith and allegiance to the same, similar
*  to what the Defense Secretary had done before he took office.
*  On Monday, June 1st, 2020, I believe you violated that oath, Miller wrote to Esper.
*  Miller's reasoning centered on President Donald J. Trump's visit Monday to St. John's Church
*  in Washington, D.C., where police cleared peaceful protesters with tear gas so that
*  he could pose with a Bible for photographs.
*  That defines 2020, that this was an idea that was not only just throwing up the flagpole,
*  but they're like, fuck yeah, let's do it.
*  Wait, I'm sorry, I feel really dumb right now, but what was the, like, was there like
*  a quote under the Bible, like was just him in the Bible, or did he have something to
*  say?
*  Just the Bible.
*  He didn't say anything.
*  That was it.
*  This is what happened.
*  I don't get it.
*  There's a lot going on.
*  They lit this church on fire, okay?
*  And another thing that's going on is that someone posted that they lit the church on
*  fire, and then CNN's Brian Stelter, does that say his name?
*  This is one of the fellows on CNN, this adorable fellow on CNN was tweeting that there's no
*  fire.
*  There's no evidence, there's no story that there's a fire.
*  This is what I'm talking about.
*  And then the video comes out of the fire, and then he deletes all those tweets.
*  So it's Trump who is also, it's also like a jab at CNN, like, see you fucking idiots,
*  you are fake news, you said there's no fire, this place burnt down, and I'm going to go
*  stand in front of it, and I'm going to hold up a Bible.
*  Yeah, and that's what he's fighting about.
*  There's a lot of ego shit going on with that.
*  That's why he decided to stand in front of that church holding that Bible.
*  It was also that he's trying to, look, he's in a dogfight right now when it comes to like
*  his constituents, when it comes to the idea of a re-election, when it comes to the fact
*  that everything keeps falling apart, he said like the worst set of circumstances, whether
*  he brought it on or not, COVID, George Floyd, the fires, the riots, like he couldn't have
*  predicted any of this, the looting, it's madness, right?
*  So he's like, I gotta, yeah, fucking somebody's gotta love me.
*  Jesus!
*  We're with Jesus!
*  This is where we're at.
*  Oh my God.
*  This is where we're at.
*  Sinking ship.
*  Yeah.
*  What did you say about someone playing a musical instrument?
*  Is that what you said?
*  That it looked like someone who doesn't know how to play a guitar is holding a guitar.
*  Pool is another example of that.
*  Like when you see a guy in a movie that's supposed to know how to play pool and you
*  see him like fucking hold the pool stick all stupid.
*  That's not how it goes.
*  It's what fake violin is, when people play fake violin.
*  What's that?
*  How do I look with a pool stick?
*  You look good!
*  Oh, is it alright?
*  It's alright.
*  We were playing pool earlier, Joe schooled us, he put on the glove for the record, he
*  wore the glove.
*  Hold a book.
*  Like a guy who reads books.
*  Then you can open it.
*  James Lindsay, he's gonna be on the podcast.
*  Hold on while I hold this blade.
*  Cynical theories.
*  Stupid.
*  See, Joe's doing a book.
*  That's how you hold a book.
*  Let him do the book thing.
*  But if I'm holding a book like this.
*  It was upside down.
*  That's it!
*  That's it!
*  Can we kid someone?
*  We gotta make a poster out of that.
*  I have definitely not re-read this book post.
*  Book place!
*  I definitely haven't read this.
*  I buy it.
*  I buy it.
*  You ever see?
*  He loves that book.
*  Or you dabbing.
*  Or you dabbing.
*  Look at him.
*  It's so stupid.
*  This is the Bible.
*  It will never be ever forgotten.
*  It's written all over the world in many, many ways.
*  The best words.
*  An amazing, amazing, amazing book.
*  So special, so important.
*  The thing about the whole narcissism thing is it's terrifying.
*  I'm terrified of that man.
*  He scares the fuck out of me.
*  I want to shave his head and give him mushrooms.
*  That's what I want to do.
*  Do it.
*  I dare you.
*  You probably can.
*  I wish you would listen.
*  You're king of Spotify now.
*  I'm a jester.
*  I'm just a minor jester.
*  I'm second to Bill Simmons over there I think.
*  There's no worries.
*  Just give him mushrooms.
*  Just one fucking really good solid dose.
*  Is that your preferred psychedelic?
*  It's a good one.
*  My preferred one is probably marijuana.
*  I think marijuana is a psychedelic.
*  I just think it's a daily use psychedelic.
*  If you did mushrooms every day, you can't talk to anybody.
*  It would be useless.
*  False.
*  I beg to differ.
*  Micro dose.
*  I'm talking about getting blitz.
*  You have a big chest of mushrooms?
*  No, I don't.
*  I have some though.
*  What are we doing later?
*  Did I tell you guys about when I...
*  So I was quarantined with my parents for a month.
*  Holla.
*  So right after I saw you...
*  Jill, when I was here last with Gary, two days later I went on tour.
*  Tour got canceled.
*  I was in New York.
*  Drove down to my parents' house and then things were getting messy.
*  And then I was there for a month with my parents.
*  I messed up big time because I took acid one day while I was there.
*  You mean you made the right choice?
*  No, I thought they were going to be gone.
*  I had a friend with me.
*  My friend Jose was there, one of my buds from childhood.
*  Did Jose bring the acid?
*  No, I brought the acid.
*  I was originally like, let's take a whole tab and he's like, let's go half.
*  I was like, I'm going to go half.
*  I was like, let's take a whole tab and he's like, let's go half.
*  Honest to God.
*  Good move, Jose.
*  Powerful, Jose.
*  Well, we both cut it in half.
*  We both took a tab and then 15 minutes later my mom walked in the door.
*  I'm 35 years old.
*  And then I was like, fuck.
*  And I was like, oh no, no, no, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
*  Because they were supposed to be gone all day.
*  And she's like, he's...
*  My mom calls me Louis.
*  God bless her.
*  I love my mom so much.
*  She calls me Lumi.
*  And I was like, oh, I got to tell her.
*  It should be noted, not the first time you've been on psychedelics, myself included, in
*  front of your mom.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Well, this is different.
*  She...
*  This is...
*  I respect my parents so much and I don't want to get too personal, but one of my uncles
*  OD'd on PCP when my mom was a kid.
*  So, she has like a...
*  She's got a thing.
*  Mushrooms to her are fine because they're like from the earth.
*  She got really mad at me.
*  You don't even...
*  Because someone gave it to me, someone I trust, but she was like...
*  She was terrified of me.
*  And I was too.
*  I saw...
*  Oh yeah.
*  Because...
*  She got into that Manson propaganda, huh?
*  I mean, I was white as a sheet and I did not look good and it was hardcore tripping.
*  It wasn't a little bit.
*  I went deep, but I was also so aware that my mom was...
*  I went to check on her when I was like really tripping balls.
*  And she was curled up on her bed with the dogs and she was looking at me.
*  I was like...
*  And I looked at her and I was like, I'm going to go.
*  And I just went back to my room and then I had like the giggle part where I just couldn't
*  stop laughing.
*  But at one point, I do want to share this and I might get in trouble.
*  No, fuck it.
*  Jose...
*  I was trying to like get some sense of normalcy and I was trying to eat food and I put on
*  Planet Earth, which was very healing at that time of just being in a total place.
*  And Jose needed to get sick.
*  And at that same time...
*  Not so powerful Jose.
*  What's powerful Jose?
*  At the same time, I was watching...
*  I swear to God, I swear to God, true story.
*  Like, Jose is in the bathroom like...
*  And then at that same moment, there were grizzly bears going...
*  I was just like, is anybody watching this?
*  That's me.
*  It was just the best moment ever.
*  I felt so bad.
*  Oh my God.
*  You know who took the best grizzly bear footage ever?
*  That Timothy Treadwell guy, that crazy guy.
*  Was that the grizzly man thing?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  That guy took the best grizzly footage.
*  He paid the price.
*  Well, he fucked up for sure.
*  But along with...
*  He died doing what he loved.
*  He gave us something.
*  This is going to be a real cynical take on this.
*  But you got to understand, this is all coming from love.
*  That guy, even though he died getting killed by grizzlies,
*  in a hilarious, the best unintentionally hilarious documentary ever.
*  Come on.
*  Grizzly Man is so funny.
*  I'm scared to watch that.
*  I don't like to watch it.
*  I can't watch it.
*  They don't play it for you.
*  There's no tape.
*  Really?
*  No, no, they don't play it.
*  Well, there is a tape.
*  No, no, no, no, no.
*  Werner Herzog got the tape and he destroyed it.
*  He did not want it to be out there for it to be murder porn for people.
*  It was...
*  He said it was horrible.
*  And Werner Herzog, he knows the fuck he's doing.
*  He's made some of the most amazing documentaries of all time.
*  Agreed.
*  But that, I guarantee you, he made that thing funny on purpose.
*  There's no way he didn't.
*  The timing in it is so good.
*  There's a sheriff at one point in time, after the guy dies.
*  The sheriff, first of all, looks like a sheriff in a fucking Quentin Tarantino movie.
*  He just looks like he's total, total Alaska sheriff.
*  He looks right in the camera and goes, I thought he was retarded.
*  When they're talking about picking garbage bags of this guy off of the fucking, off of
*  the shore and seeing the big bear feasting on his rib cage.
*  They show that?
*  No, no, no.
*  They talk about it.
*  He talks about how he flew over in his plane and noticed the ribs poking out and saw the
*  bear rummaging in his chest cavity.
*  It is a crazy documentary.
*  But they, I thought that they play the sound.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  There's no sound.
*  OK.
*  There's a version of it online, but it's not a real documentary.
*  There's a version of it online, but it's fake.
*  I thought that too.
*  I thought that too.
*  That's why I never watched it.
*  You got to trust me.
*  I've seen it nine times.
*  Jesus.
*  I'm not exaggerating.
*  That in Zoolander?
*  It might be like 13 times.
*  Texas Ranger.
*  We got Norris.
*  Then we hit the Grizzly Man.
*  There's time.
*  We're going to go back for Zoolander.
*  But really, here's the thing.
*  There's something in this about, there's something in this movie about acceptance.
*  There's something about, about tolerance.
*  He was gay.
*  Oh.
*  And I'm 99,000% positive that he's gay.
*  But he was pretending he wasn't.
*  So this guy's talking like this, and he's walking through the woods going, I wish I
*  had a girlfriend, but I don't.
*  You know, like girls just don't like me.
*  I don't know why.
*  Maybe because you live with monsters in a house made out of cloth.
*  Is this like a Joe Exotica parody kind of thing we're doing here?
*  No, no, no.
*  That parody is not the right word.
*  He's like this guy that's like, he's got a bandana on.
*  It's like, I'm out here protecting these bears.
*  These bears didn't even know he was alive.
*  They didn't give a fuck about him.
*  Not only that, like the wildlife management of Alaska is fantastic.
*  Like, they know exactly how many bears they are.
*  They got it all covered.
*  You know, I just watched the Joe Exotic thing, and in regards to that, there's like this
*  weird megalomania with like convincing yourself that you have this control over these wild
*  beasts.
*  It's fucking crazy.
*  It's very, very similar.
*  Very similar.
*  It's connected to it.
*  These moments where it was really like, really, first of all, they're all a bunch of narcissists
*  and they're crazy.
*  But I felt really sad for Joe Exotic because it was like, what would have happened if maybe
*  he were truly accepted for who he was when he was a kid and loved by his father?
*  Like would he have gone to these extremes?
*  No, but then we wouldn't have enjoyed that fucking amazing show.
*  This is my whole point about Grizzly Man.
*  Even though that guy lived this fucked up, even though this guy lived this fucked up
*  tortured life, ultimately what was created was amazing and it was entertaining for millions
*  of people.
*  It gave millions of people a great feeling watching Grizzly Man and watching Joe Exotic.
*  You said about art down the line.
*  Yes.
*  All the time.
*  Batentown, that was fucked up, dude.
*  We're still listening to his shit.
*  But this guy's life was like an art project.
*  This Timothy Treadwell's life was like an art project.
*  He's literally holding a camcorder, walking through this bear corridor where these enormous
*  grizzly bears are.
*  And he's like, I wish I could find a girlfriend, but I can't.
*  If I was gay, it would be easy.
*  This is what he says.
*  I'd just go to rest stop and I was just.
*  He said that.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  But I'm not gay.
*  So it's like, who?
*  Bro.
*  Gay?
*  Gay?
*  That guy needed mushrooms, but then we wouldn't have gotten Grizzly Man.
*  He would have got to shit together.
*  Joe, is this how we heal the world?
*  Is this, we need to do like extreme psychedelic dispensing.
*  It sounds preposterous, but everything I say sounds preposterous, so it's okay.
*  I'm a preposterous person.
*  Sort of true.
*  But I believe.
*  There's some good stuff in there.
*  Mushrooms were decriminalized and people were allowed to use them.
*  And in fact, decriminalized is probably better.
*  You know why?
*  Because I don't think anybody should sell mushrooms because I think mushrooms are so
*  sacred you should never profit off of them.
*  I agree.
*  I really do.
*  I agree.
*  I think decriminalizing is enough just so that no one can ever bring.
*  But you can't sell it.
*  Just give it away to people or give make sure if you're selling it, you should sell it for
*  just enough to take care of the soil and feed.
*  You should make your money some other way.
*  And I think that for you, for people, I mean, there's an amazing business that could be
*  had through selling mushrooms.
*  I'm not opposed to it.
*  Don't look.
*  I'll flip flop on this back and forth.
*  But I think if I was giving someone advice, if I said, could you make it without doing
*  that?
*  Could you make it without selling it?
*  I would say, okay, don't sell it.
*  Just give it away.
*  Yeah.
*  Just give it away and make deals with people like they want to give you tomatoes that they
*  grew.
*  Take that and give them mushrooms.
*  It doesn't seem like something that should be tainted.
*  Something that should be tainted rather by the darkness of the human soul.
*  I feel like there's power in money, just like there's power in power.
*  It's the same thing.
*  Like having like wanting to sell more.
*  You sure you don't need any mushrooms, Ben?
*  You don't want that energy.
*  You never want anybody pushing on you.
*  You should do mushrooms because it's like calling you.
*  I don't think anybody should ever.
*  It just makes me think about music because everything makes me think about music usually.
*  But when you're talking about this thing, well, how do we manage the sale of this?
*  The presence in our society?
*  We need it.
*  We're going to do it anyway, always.
*  The human behavior, boom, there's a price tag.
*  Oh, shit, things are getting weird.
*  And it's a constant conversation.
*  You just have ethical people that work with you so you don't think about that shit.
*  Just think about your art.
*  But it's inescapable because it's in the system, right?
*  And the system is going to react to it, respond to it.
*  Consumers are going to react in their way.
*  And if you can, I guess, keep yourself completely apart from consumer opinion, then you can
*  – is that what you're saying?
*  Kind of like maintain a purity?
*  I don't think that's ever really possible.
*  It's not possible.
*  But I think you can have an ethic in your head.
*  Like you can have an operating strategy in your head.
*  You're going to avoid as much of that as possible.
*  And just certainly – what does it take to be the best artist you could be?
*  The problem with that is sometimes it takes for you to be a fuck up.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I don't know if I buy that.
*  Well, no, I mean –
*  I don't know if I buy it either.
*  We don't have to buy it.
*  That's consumerism.
*  It's not for sale.
*  But here's the thing.
*  Some of my favorite artists – I give this an example so many times, but I have to use
*  it – my great friend Joey Diaz.
*  He's one of my favorite people.
*  Love that dude.
*  I love him.
*  He's great.
*  Every time I'm with him, every time I perform with him, I work with him, every time I hang
*  out with him, I always feel like I'm blessed.
*  That's a magical thing.
*  It's so rare.
*  He's been my friend for – I'll tear up – he's been my friend for like 23 years.
*  But you don't get a Joey Diaz without pain.
*  It doesn't exist.
*  You can't have a kid who lives in a gated community, who has tutors to teach him how
*  to play piano, and who's on the soccer team.
*  You don't get a Joey Diaz.
*  You know how Joey Diaz found his mother?
*  He was on acid, and she was dead, and he was 13.
*  He found her when he was on acid.
*  She was dead on the kitchen floor when he was 13.
*  Joey Diaz has gone through some shit, and on the other end, he comes out this beautiful
*  creation of the universe.
*  You don't get diamonds unless you have pressure.
*  You need pressure.
*  But those are uncontrollable things.
*  The things that are controllable – sorry.
*  I'm just saying, some artists, I will never be as funny as Joey Diaz.
*  It's literally not possible.
*  I don't think anybody's funnier than him.
*  I think he hits these moments that are funnier than any – I've seen comedy for – I've
*  been a professional comedian for like 32 years.
*  Never seen anybody funnier.
*  I've seen them all.
*  I've seen Kinnison live.
*  I saw Bill Hicks live.
*  I've seen Chris Rock.
*  I've worked with Chappelle.
*  I've seen Chappelle live a hundred times.
*  I've worked with Prior.
*  I had a chance to work with somebody –
*  Really?
*  Yes.
*  What's that story?
*  It was late in his career when he was –
*  Oh, shit.
*  And he would go on stage.
*  They would carry him to the stage.
*  I went on after Prior.
*  They would carry him to the stage.
*  Carry him to the stage.
*  My friend Chewie, who's an amazing musician – he used to be the doorman at the Comedy
*  Store – he and this guy Dave would carry – who's Marilyn Martinez, husband, who's
*  a hilarious comedian – would carry Richard Prior to the chair.
*  They put him in the chair and they would crank up the volume like this.
*  Like, shh, because he's so far gone.
*  Oh, my God.
*  That's what it was like.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Wow.
*  That was exactly – so if you saw him, you saw me.
*  Because when he would go on stage, Mitzi would always put me on afterwards.
*  Because Mitzi knew it was basically an impossible task.
*  It was an impossible task, first of all, for some 27-year-old dipshit to go on after the
*  greatest comedian of all time ever, right?
*  No matter what I did, I failed.
*  But the fact that everybody got to see him when they knew he was rapidly deteriorating
*  – it wasn't going to get better.
*  And he just wanted to be out there with his fans.
*  And people loved him so much.
*  I would go on stage and it was like I was at a funeral trying to tell jokes.
*  Oh, God, no.
*  It was so bad.
*  It was so bad.
*  It felt so bad.
*  First of all, it felt bad because the first time I ever really understood what comedy
*  was, I saw Live on the Sunset Strip at a movie theater.
*  My parents took me when I was like 15.
*  And we were in the audience and I remember looking around and all these people like falling
*  out of their chairs laughing.
*  And I remember I was laughing so hard.
*  It's like, how is this guy doing this by just talking?
*  How is he doing this?
*  So for me to be able to work with that guy, to do all these shows with that guy, no one's
*  funnier than Joey Diaz.
*  No one.
*  All these people I work with, the greats, I've seen them all.
*  Joey Diaz hits these highs.
*  They're like, there's a new vibration.
*  He pops through to some new level.
*  And he might not be the best joke writer of all time.
*  He might not have the most clever thing to say that makes you go, wow.
*  But he hits you with some fucking punch lines that are harder than anybody's ever.
*  He's the Ernie Shavers of punch lines.
*  He just drops bombs on you.
*  You're like, what the fuck?
*  You know, I think that-
*  Who's Ernie Shavers?
*  Sorry.
*  Ernie Shavers was a very famous heavyweight boxer in the 1970s that was known for his
*  No, it's okay.
*  It was very obscure.
*  No, it's okay.
*  I'm glad you asked.
*  I did a Dennis Miller on you.
*  I brought up some-
*  Yeah, you did.
*  I totally did.
*  But for fight fans, they would know exactly what I'm talking about.
*  He's like the Francis Ngannou of stand-up comics.
*  That's a good way to put it.
*  Francis Ngannou was a top UFC contender.
*  That's more contemporary.
*  Also, you want to make a list?
*  Let's make a list.
*  We got to-
*  Francis Ngannou was the single-
*  Francis Ngannou was the single most powerful combat sport athlete I've ever seen.
*  Francis, with an eye.
*  Pull up a photo of Francis, just so he gets an understanding of what the fuck he's writing
*  down.
*  Francis Ngannou was absolutely the scariest heavyweight to ever compete in the UFC.
*  I think he's 6'6", 260 pounds, freak athlete who grew up working in the sand mines.
*  He dug sand in Africa.
*  Come on, is it not contemporary?
*  Was he from Cameroon?
*  Oh, I spelled that wrong.
*  See, find out where he was from.
*  He's an amazing athlete, terrifying athlete.
*  33, younger than us.
*  And he's younger than us.
*  I don't think that's correct.
*  Age, what is age?
*  What does it say here?
*  What age is it?
*  He's 33.
*  Is that correct?
*  6'4".
*  September 5th, S5.
*  That's amazing, because I thought he was older than that.
*  That's crazy.
*  He's fucking terrifying.
*  The thing about, this is like a little backtrack.
*  You're talking about Diaz and suffering.
*  People that have had really intense things in their lives that they've overcome and grown
*  from are the most incredible people on the planet.
*  100%.
*  And I have empathy for folks that aren't able to do that.
*  The thing is, when you have this capacity to grow from horrible things, you have the
*  capacity for wisdom and also comedy and also trying to live a peaceful, beautiful life.
*  The thing is, life is fucked up.
*  We can't control what's coming at us, but you can control how you fucking deal with
*  it and your accountability.
*  I am with you on the front of people that inspire me on that level, that have been through
*  things that I can't imagine, but have come out in this beautiful way that they express
*  themselves with inspiration and comedy and music and acting or whatever, artistic.
*  Not even art.
*  I mean, American music comes out of that.
*  100%.
*  Blues, that's what that comes out of.
*  That comes out of a cultural experience.
*  You ever listen to that old Robert Johnson shit?
*  Yeah, fuck yeah.
*  That's crazy, right?
*  It's incredible.
*  You listen to that and you go, wait a minute, when was this?
*  You have to put, I think music like comedy, they share this one thing, is that you have
*  to put the music or the comedy in the context of the time that it was created.
*  I'm a giant Lenny Bruce fan.
*  If you walk around this place, you see all these Lenny Bruce concert posters outside.
*  That's because-
*  He was such a pioneer too.
*  He was the.
*  He's patient zero.
*  He's patient zero.
*  But if you listen to his stuff today, it might not be that funny.
*  Some of it's not that good in terms of how far things have gone.
*  If you watched Chappelle's latest special and then you try to watch Lenny Bruce, it
*  would be hard to watch Lenny Bruce.
*  But his timing and all that stuff is still there.
*  It's the context of it.
*  But for me, it's like go back and listen to Robert Johnson and then just think, wait a
*  minute, what year was this?
*  What year was this?
*  What kind of music were people making?
*  This dude was just like this very free haunting sound that Robert Johnson had.
*  I wish we could play it.
*  Jesus, I hope when we go to Spotify, we can play some fucking music.
*  That'd be cool.
*  Right?
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Just play some Robert Johnson.
*  Give them the Shekels.
*  The great stuff.
*  Let them have the cash.
*  I just want to hear it.
*  I want to hear it.
*  I just don't want to get pulled.
*  He said Shekels.
*  And it transcends time.
*  I respect for my Jewish friends.
*  Thanks, brother.
*  Shekel.
*  It's a great name for money.
*  It is.
*  It sounds fun.
*  Sounds fun.
*  Give me them Shekels, son.
*  I'm all about the Shekels.
*  Like, I'm all about the Benjamins.
*  That's okay.
*  Hey, I'm a double duty.
*  I get it.
*  I get it.
*  Ben Franklin.
*  That's a t-shirt.
*  I wonder how much Ben Franklin really did.
*  Because history is so interesting.
*  I was thinking about this today.
*  We need people to write shit down.
*  We have to trust that you're going to tell the truth.
*  And most people are full of shit.
*  So how does that work out?
*  Paul Revere never ran around going, the British are coming.
*  Do you know that?
*  No.
*  I did not know that.
*  I didn't know that either.
*  I found out two years ago.
*  Who told you the truth?
*  I was reading this whole story about what really happened.
*  That Paul Revere wasn't really riding down the street with a horse saying, the British
*  are coming.
*  No, another dude did it.
*  And he was taking credit.
*  Son of a bitch.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, the thing is, I said this earlier, I don't know what's real or true anymore.
*  Even when we have the age of cell phones and people take videos, right now we have someone
*  saying, hey, this is a tennis ball.
*  Another person saying, oh no, it's purple.
*  And you're like, what?
*  What could be purple?
*  Like there's no comparison.
*  Oh, like that dress?
*  That black and white dress?
*  No, that's a bad example.
*  Oh yeah, the Laurel.
*  What was that thing?
*  The thing is, back to Donald Trump, there's just a complete lack of information of like,
*  one person saying this thing, the other person saying this thing.
*  And I'm watching a video and you're telling me it's not true.
*  But how is it not true?
*  Because I'm watching it.
*  I'm so fucking confused.
*  He's creating his own reality and it's extending to...
*  Well, he's not the only one.
*  There's a lot of people doing that.
*  100%.
*  He's playing a game, okay?
*  And the game has already been established.
*  That game is, be full of shit if it supports your cause.
*  The left does it as well as the right.
*  It's a human issue.
*  It's a partisan human issue.
*  And he's particularly shitty at it.
*  Do you know who I love?
*  And I think he buys into it.
*  I think that's a requisite too, is that he has to believe his own bullshit.
*  You gotta be able to say when you fucked up.
*  But you can say that with power.
*  Why is that not a thing?
*  Why can't they do that?
*  They don't do it.
*  I just want to say it right now.
*  The Rockford president, step in.
*  I'd vote for The Rockford.
*  I saw your Instagram.
*  Love him.
*  My brother, listen, you can do it.
*  I'll vote for you.
*  No one's gonna fuck with you.
*  You are America, by the way.
*  Look at you.
*  Look at you, beautiful son of a bitch.
*  Not so many people with a platform, but I will look into it.
*  I've only met him in person two or three times, but he's so beautiful.
*  He's incredible.
*  He's so big.
*  Remember that movie?
*  He's enormous.
*  When I first moved to LA, I was like a PA on this movie, just like, you know, completely
*  brainless.
*  And he was in the movie and he came in.
*  What movie was it, Ben?
*  And he's a super nice guy.
*  Legitimately super nice guy, incredibly ambitious.
*  He's the American dream.
*  He came up from poverty.
*  He epitomizes hard work and he's got a heart.
*  He clearly is a nice guy and he's a real man.
*  He's not some soy boy.
*  He's not some...
*  Is he single?
*  No.
*  I find that insensitive.
*  He should be.
*  I drank soy.
*  You should feel that.
*  You should feel the pain.
*  You should drink raw buffalo milk mixed with blood.
*  No need.
*  No need.
*  Like a Comanche.
*  You're lactarid?
*  No, you gotta get it right from the utter.
*  To all lactose intolerant dudes out there.
*  It's okay.
*  You can drink so you'll be alright.
*  Go easy on it, actually.
*  I don't drink it anymore.
*  I drink rice milk.
*  We gotta get you out there eating raw ducks.
*  Yeah.
*  You're gonna be fine.
*  Don't let this...
*  Get some liver in your diet.
*  This outdated masculinity taking you down.
*  I don't drink that anymore.
*  I drink rice milk.
*  It's definitely questionable, the health impacts for it.
*  You ever see the Rocks cheat days?
*  It's the most special thing you've ever seen.
*  What is it?
*  Like he has a salad?
*  It's a staggering amount of food.
*  No, it's staggering.
*  Okay.
*  Pancakes and waffles and cookies and brownies and ice cream.
*  I just want him to pick me up.
*  Sorry.
*  And madness.
*  Pizzas.
*  This is him.
*  That's his meals.
*  Get out of here.
*  It's usually on like a set.
*  What?
*  Oh yeah, no bullshit.
*  So he has one day where he goes to war.
*  That man is a machine.
*  He's 14 feet tall.
*  Did you know that?
*  Bro, he's so big it doesn't even make sense.
*  14 feet.
*  But here's my thing.
*  This guy is the real deal.
*  Like he's an exceptional human.
*  He works really hard and he's really nice.
*  He stands for a lot of things that we can all appreciate.
*  He stands for hard work.
*  He stands for respect.
*  He's very complimentary with people.
*  He's very friendly.
*  Like he's a nice guy.
*  He's a good person and he's enormous.
*  That's America.
*  He's America.
*  He's a goddamn bald eagle sitting on a machine gun.
*  Is there like a major position of power right now that person that also has the capacity
*  to have empathy?
*  Because that man clearly has empathy.
*  That man clearly.
*  Yeah, the rock does.
*  No, as a president, yeah.
*  Listen, I don't think he would become a politician.
*  I think we're done with politicians.
*  Trump already showed that a non-politician businessman is the host of a reality show
*  can be the king of the world.
*  Okay, well now that we know that.
*  Killer Mike said.
*  Killer Mike.
*  How about Killer Mike for president?
*  I would fucking vote for Killer Mike.
*  Killer Mike.
*  He said.
*  He could be president.
*  No bullshit.
*  Count me in.
*  I worship that man.
*  I think he's brilliant.
*  I love him.
*  By the way, Run the Jewels record came out yesterday.
*  It's amazing.
*  I haven't heard the new shit.
*  It's so good.
*  Mavis Staples sings on one of the songs.
*  Mavis is one of my favorite people, musicians on the planet.
*  It's incredible.
*  Please check it out.
*  But he said, lost it, lost it, come back.
*  He referred to Donald Trump as owner of a casino, like the casino operating and owner is our president.
*  He's like the owner of casinos.
*  Like I just like it's sunk in.
*  I'm like this guy's he's a casino guy.
*  Hotel guy.
*  What did Tim Dillon call him?
*  Totally butchered that.
*  Riverboat casino.
*  What did he call him?
*  Riverboat casino.
*  Have you ever seen Tim Dillon do Meghan McCain?
*  No.
*  Thank you Jesus.
*  Bring it up.
*  I'm not a person I get to give a gift to.
*  One of my favorite things in all the internet that anybody's ever done is one of my good
*  friend Tim Dillon.
*  He's a hilarious comedian.
*  He does this impression of Meghan McCain.
*  Please take it from the beginning.
*  Hold on.
*  Before my father died, I had a baby with him.
*  It will be raised in captivity.
*  It'll be raised privately to be the greatest politician that has ever lived.
*  My name is Meghan McCain and I'm on a new show called The View.
*  And Donald Trump, that fucking riverboat casino captain, is talking shit about my father again.
*  My father was tortured for a hundred years in this fucking country.
*  And he came back and he started seven wars because he's a gentleman.
*  Fuck you Trump.
*  I'm going to wear my father's skin mask and I'm going to primary Trump from the right.
*  Come on The View bitch.
*  If you're that tough, come on The View.
*  You want it Alessandro?
*  You want to fuck these tits Trump?
*  You want to fuck these tits?
*  No you don't.
*  You want to suck cock.
*  But I won't fuck you because the only person I'll fuck is daddy.
*  Oh no.
*  A lot of different.
*  A lot of different feelings.
*  I don't know what to say.
*  Oh my god.
*  Holy shit.
*  Who is that person?
*  That's Tim Dillon.
*  Tim Dillon.
*  Tim.
*  Looking good.
*  He's here with us tonight.
*  He's a gay fella.
*  He gets away with more things.
*  Is that a thing?
*  Fuck yeah.
*  Okay.
*  He's hilarious.
*  Do you know who I love?
*  Andrew Schultz.
*  Oh yes.
*  That guy's brilliant.
*  Love him.
*  He's informative, brilliant, hilarious and like just gets right to your guts.
*  Who's Andrew Schultz?
*  He's a brilliant guy.
*  He's done the best pandemic comedy that anybody's done for sure.
*  He does these videos for Instagram where he'll start the video and go, hey turn your phone
*  over sideways.
*  Turn your phone sideways.
*  And then he has this whole multimedia.
*  Way to control the situation.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean it's amazing.
*  He's got a multimedia presentation.
*  It's really a show but it's with his stand up style.
*  Really, really good.
*  Really smart.
*  He's figured out a way.
*  When's he gonna get a show?
*  He's gotta get a show soon.
*  No, no, no, no, no, no.
*  Fuck that.
*  Okay tell me.
*  School me.
*  That guy should do exactly what he's doing.
*  Alright.
*  He's making those internet things.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Do it on.
*  He's got more than one YouTube show.
*  He's got a YouTube show with Charlamagne that he does.
*  It's called Brilliant Idiots.
*  Then he's got the other one.
*  What is his other one?
*  Flagrant 2 podcast.
*  That's right.
*  Have you had him on the show?
*  Yes.
*  He's gonna be on next week too.
*  What the fuck?
*  I love him.
*  He's a good friend.
*  He's, Benny you love it.
*  He does the thing on Central Park Karen.
*  That lady that freaked out.
*  That was intense.
*  And almost strangled her dog to death and lied about that guy.
*  I shared it with so many people.
*  You wonder, if you wonder why black people are freaking out, this is real.
*  These are real people.
*  First of all, the guy who was using the dog treats, like come on man.
*  I wish you were perfect.
*  I wish you were perfect and she was just crazy.
*  The irony.
*  I don't know about the dog treats.
*  He would like keep dog treats.
*  He tried to give her dog treats.
*  The dogs are not supposed to be off leash.
*  Right.
*  Dogs go off leash and I believe he's a bird watcher.
*  Yes, no, fact.
*  Bird watchers are really hardcore.
*  I got really into optics because when I started hunting I really got into binoculars.
*  I was trying to figure out why some binoculars are really expensive and what they used them
*  for.
*  Bird watching is a big deal.
*  The people that are really into birds, like spotting birds, it's like there's some crazy
*  Are you a bird nerd?
*  Huge bird nerd.
*  Dude, there's something that people, there's an orgasmic quality when people find like an
*  owl that's hiding in a hole.
*  There he is, there he is.
*  I don't know what it is.
*  It might be tied to like hunter gatherer DNA or some shit.
*  I just love birds.
*  But it's the same feeling that you get when you catch a fish.
*  Also love fishing.
*  There you go.
*  But you know that thing that you get?
*  There's a rush that you get when you catch a fish.
*  I think it's like hunter gatherer shit.
*  I got one, I got one.
*  And you see a bird, even if you're just seeing it with your binos, you're like oh there he is, there he is.
*  He's hiding.
*  Oh look, look, look, look, look, look, look.
*  It's amazing.
*  It's weird, right?
*  No.
*  It's not bad.
*  But so that's why that dude is pissed off.
*  These fucking dipshit dogs that are supposed to be on leashes are running around.
*  Well you know she lost her dog and her job.
*  Well that's fucked up.
*  Is it though?
*  Did you watch the video?
*  Yeah, she's fucked up.
*  She's fucked up.
*  For sure.
*  But she lost her dog.
*  The moment where she says I'm going to tell them an African American is threatening my
*  life.
*  And it was just so matter of fact and gross.
*  And in that moment, would you want that person working for you and with you?
*  No, I wouldn't.
*  But I don't know her, right?
*  So I don't know if she's redeemable.
*  I don't know what that was about.
*  I don't know if she had a panic attack because it was just her and that guy.
*  You know what?
*  That's very generous and I appreciate that perspective.
*  You have to consider that a lot of people are very scared of conflict and when women
*  are in the presence of a man confronting them in an angry way about something.
*  I don't care what race you are.
*  He wasn't angry.
*  He was so calm and gentle.
*  That's the thing.
*  Okay.
*  He was genuinely like...
*  He was accusing her of not having her dog on the leash, right?
*  Yeah, and she didn't like being told what to do by a black person.
*  I think that's true.
*  I think that's certainly true.
*  But I also think for sure, 100%, that was a conflict.
*  And during conflicts, people act irrationally.
*  They don't know what to do.
*  Sure.
*  They get out of their own head.
*  They fuck up.
*  It could be a clear example of just how she acts all the time, that she is always racist
*  and she always exaggerates anything that's happening and lies.
*  She posted a video after the fact and said...
*  Andrew Schultz talks about this.
*  She said, I'm not racist.
*  I was afraid for my life.
*  That should be possible.
*  This is the only reason why I would say that.
*  But that's racism.
*  Because you're afraid for your life by a gentle person who was like, hey, can you put your
*  dog on a leash?
*  It could be.
*  It could be racism.
*  It could also be racism on top of conflict.
*  Maybe her racism would never show itself, but then in conflict, she panics.
*  Some people panic during conflict.
*  And when you're looking at someone that's doing something awful in a crisis situation,
*  we've seen people hit people with...
*  I was watching this video the other day of this lady coming up to this guy on the street.
*  The only reason I found this is because people kept saying, dude, is this you?
*  Did you hit this lady in the head with a 2x4?
*  Because this is a fucking lady in some Spanish neighborhood.
*  All these people are yelling in Spanish.
*  And this lady has this big ass fucking stick.
*  She walks up to this dude who looks exactly like me.
*  He has a 2x4.
*  He says something in Spanish.
*  She doesn't listen.
*  And he bonks her in the head with his 2x4 and knocks her unconscious.
*  Watch this.
*  Watch this.
*  This is it.
*  So I swear to God, like five of my friends sent me this.
*  So she gets mad at him and she goes and picks up a stick.
*  Look, they're yelling at each other.
*  Give me some volume on this.
*  Where's you?
*  Yeah, where's Joe?
*  A little bit further.
*  I'd ask them across the full version.
*  Towards the fight.
*  Yeah.
*  So it looks like they're in front.
*  Yeah.
*  See, that's the guy in the white shirt and they're talking shit to each other.
*  This guy and this girl, which is just so crazy, right?
*  Go a little further ahead.
*  Oh, there it is right here.
*  Oh, no.
*  See, watch this.
*  Oh, wow.
*  She comes up.
*  Oh, boy.
*  It's pretty Joe-ish.
*  Those pants.
*  That guy has no tattoos.
*  He has no tattoos.
*  Oh, he has sleeves on, though.
*  He looks exactly like me.
*  Is she knocked out?
*  That might have been me.
*  Holy shit.
*  I might have taken Ambien and hit that lady over the head with a stick.
*  She does not look conscious.
*  She's not unconscious.
*  She's 100% unconscious.
*  He hit her in the head with a 2x4.
*  Oh, my God.
*  This is crazy.
*  I don't know what the context was, but she...
*  Go back again.
*  Watch.
*  Are you talking about conflicts?
*  No, back up so you can see what's happening.
*  She walks up.
*  She grabs a stick and he's like, stop.
*  Get the fuck away from me.
*  So she starts coming towards him and when she starts coming towards him, she's got this
*  big ass fucking stick and I don't speak Spanish.
*  Right in front of United Express.
*  Here goes.
*  Look, she's coming at him full speed with this stick and he's like, oh, no.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Stop.
*  Stop.
*  Oh, no.
*  He didn't really swing that hard either.
*  He just kind of gave a little bop.
*  That's all it takes.
*  I mean, most people are not very 2x4 resilient.
*  It's like...
*  Taking a lot of 2x4.
*  Every time I get hit with a 2x4, I just get right back up.
*  Dude, getting hit in the head with a 2x4 would suck.
*  That would suck.
*  That would suck.
*  Heavy.
*  I have to pee.
*  That was a situation of conflict.
*  Yes.
*  And, you know, we can't assign any racial elements.
*  She's certainly fucked up.
*  I'm not an apologist.
*  And she certainly lied, which is indicative of a character flaw.
*  It's not just that she tried to talk her way out of this.
*  She tried to be reasonable.
*  She wasn't being reasonable.
*  Just look how she's treating her dog, right?
*  She's treating her dog in a very horrible way.
*  Basically holding it up, choking the fucking thing.
*  Once she immediately identifies him as African American on the phone.
*  If you love your dog, you don't ever hang him.
*  Even if you pull out the leash, you don't...
*  Like, hey, get over here.
*  Maybe she just doesn't know how to use the leash.
*  You don't hold him up in the air.
*  It's bizarre.
*  But I also think that's indicative of someone who's going through a panic attack.
*  She just wants to control that dog.
*  She literally doesn't give a fuck.
*  You know, she's just, shut the fuck up!
*  You know?
*  And she's 100% wrong.
*  Don't get me wrong.
*  I'm not excusing her.
*  But I'm saying when you look at what it really is, it's a woman who is alone with a man.
*  And the man is catching her doing some shit she's not supposed to do.
*  And he's got a camera on her, right?
*  So all those things free people out.
*  A lot of factors.
*  There's a lot of things going on there.
*  It's not just this is who she is.
*  And the guy was like, he had treats.
*  But I get it from his perspective.
*  If you live in an area, and this area has been clearly assigned as a place where if
*  you have a dog, that dog has to be on a leash.
*  That's super reasonable, man.
*  Put your dog on a leash.
*  Take it around.
*  Enjoy the park with everybody else.
*  But don't ruin it for everybody else because you want your dog to run free.
*  You need to find another place to have a dog.
*  You can't have a dog here.
*  And if this guy is like, yeah, there's all these birds there.
*  This dude is really in a fucking spot in birds.
*  I've never been into bird watching, but I fucking 100% get it.
*  Because I've seen some cool shit.
*  From hunting, I'm sure you feel the same way, right?
*  Yeah.
*  I think it's slightly different.
*  I mean, you can enjoy the beauty of birds without wanting to go kill them.
*  Sure.
*  But isn't there an element when you're hunting, you find the moment where you come across
*  this animal.
*  It's not just kill.
*  It is a beauty.
*  You've got to put that aside and get the job done.
*  You have to.
*  It's too intense.
*  Right.
*  And it's too fraught with peril.
*  You can fuck it up.
*  So you're confronting those.
*  I've never hunted before.
*  It's real weird.
*  You pull up a file from the back of your hard drive.
*  You're like, oh, I forgot about this folder.
*  And you pull out this folder of these hunter-gatherer instincts that pop in.
*  The same thing when you catch a fish.
*  It's like catching a fish.
*  There's something about, oh, I got him, I got him, I got him.
*  I got the fish.
*  But there's something more terrifying about mammals, like closing in on a mammal.
*  When you're fishing, it's so passive most of the time.
*  You're baiting something and you hook it.
*  But you have to make a decision in a moment to act aggressively and to end this thing's
*  life.
*  Yeah.
*  And you have to prepare for it.
*  So you have to think about it all the time.
*  It's not a simple thing.
*  You have to think about it all the time.
*  So you can choose to get your meat the regular way or choose to do it that way.
*  And I've chosen to do it that way because it adds this element.
*  I still eat domestic cows and stuff like that.
*  But it adds this element of what food is.
*  Like when I eat something that I killed myself, there's a weird element to that.
*  There's a connection.
*  I don't know if truthful isn't the right word, but it's a more clear representation of the process.
*  It's honest.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a better word.
*  You understand what it is.
*  But you also understand, like I've come across ones that have been killed by wolves.
*  We came across me and my friend Mike.
*  We were in, Mike Hawkeridge, we were in Canada, in BC.
*  We came across this moose calf that had been destroyed by wolves and torn apart.
*  It was so strange, man.
*  It was like part of me, because it was real fresh, like within a few days, like maybe a day.
*  It might have been that day when they walked away from it because there was like hair everywhere
*  and these stripped down bones.
*  And it was just a spot in the middle of the woods where you just came across a moose calf.
*  Yeah.
*  And you realize like, wow, this is how they usually go.
*  Yeah, the violence is a different type of violence.
*  This is how they usually die.
*  They just get torn apart out here in this field, which is the thing that freaked me out that I didn't expect.
*  Jamie, I know I have this on my Instagram.
*  See if you can find it.
*  Good luck.
*  Because it's like from 2013, I think.
*  So I was on this moose hunt in BC with my friend Ben O'Brien.
*  And we were when we were going through these woods looking for a moose, we found this moose calf that had been killed by wolves.
*  And it was you could tell it was 100 percent.
*  Mike knew Mike knew right away.
*  He just knows. I mean, he lives there.
*  He's a professional guide and a rancher.
*  That's it right there.
*  So this is what freaked me out is all the hair.
*  I didn't expect the hair.
*  Is that dog hair or is that moose hair?
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, it's moose hair.
*  That's the hair from the animal that they killed.
*  Why is it gray?
*  And it must be fair.
*  Well, they have like a lot of white.
*  Moose have a lot of white under underbelly in particular.
*  They have a lot of white.
*  They all vary.
*  That was two hundred and ninety weeks ago.
*  Oh, wow. Isn't that nuts?
*  You want to measure time in that way?
*  That's kind of scary.
*  Yeah.
*  Two hundred and ninety weeks.
*  So that was a photo that I took.
*  I think it was about three hours north of Vancouver.
*  Wow.
*  It landed in Vancouver and drove up there up north.
*  It was amazing, though.
*  There's something about that when you're around these animals that are just killing other animals and just eating them out.
*  And you just he found it because he saw some birds like, you know, the way people live up there when you live around wolves and bears and shit.
*  You're in tune with all this shit.
*  So I didn't even notice it.
*  He saw some birds that were kind of circling around this one area.
*  He's like, let's go see what the fuck they're interested in.
*  And then we got there and stumbled upon that.
*  When you when you're in nature and you start to integrate yourself and become in tune, it's fucking fascinating.
*  I I've never hunted, but I fish a lot.
*  And when you're fly fishing, you start to become aware of the bugs that are around you and what kind of flies that you want to make for your bait.
*  And it's it's really interesting.
*  It feels very spiritual.
*  I think that what people are when they're in cities are like people what they are when when they're having sex with two condoms on.
*  Who has sex with two condoms on nobody?
*  Nobody. OK.
*  You're all just no sense to it.
*  When you go to the woods, when you go to the woods, it's like you you feel the wind different because it's like the wind just moving through the trees.
*  It's not blocked off by buildings and coming down these streets and alleys.
*  It's different wind.
*  It's wind like in a natural trajectory.
*  You know, it's different.
*  Yeah.
*  City birds and rural birds.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  For sure. Yeah.
*  I mean, it's the smartest.
*  By the way, they're smart as fuck.
*  Smart as fuck.
*  But just present.
*  But when you're out there and there's no sound and there's there's no media, there's no nothing.
*  And you just hearing the whistling of the wind and you hear a stream and you hear a hawk and you see an animal walk through the brush and you don't know what it is.
*  And then you realize like, well, if I wasn't here, this would be exactly how this would go down.
*  This is not how lucky are you to.
*  Yeah.
*  And this and it's great.
*  We're we're muted.
*  Yeah.
*  We're muted by our artificially constructed civilization where we've narrowed down the possibilities of being eaten.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what we've done.
*  It comes at a cost obviously.
*  Everything else is super vulnerable to be eaten all the time.
*  We've narrowed that down.
*  We use our big brains and our fucking opposable thumbs.
*  And we said, look, I'm going to stop being eaten by cats and shit.
*  Let's make some fucking houses.
*  We need some guns.
*  We need to be vigilant.
*  What's interesting now.
*  I mean, I think I'd rather live in a city than get eaten.
*  Yes.
*  Oh, dude, 100 percent.
*  But maybe that's selfish.
*  But I think you can.
*  Shellfish.
*  I think there's a balance to be had.
*  And I don't think we achieve that balance.
*  I think we need to spend more time in that world to understand what the world is.
*  I think we're basing our our view of the world off of blunt data.
*  I don't think it's giving us a real nuanced sense of what your your part in the universe is.
*  I think a big part of that is the light pollution that we're all afflicted by.
*  Sure.
*  There's something really humbling about staring out into the space and seeing all the stars.
*  And we have decided that lights are more important than the enlightenment that you get from staring at space.
*  I don't know if it's a good call.
*  Not a good call.
*  Some of the best moments of my life have been sitting hanging out with people I care about.
*  Yeah.
*  Looking up at the star at the stars.
*  It's so powerful.
*  There's something about it.
*  It's a reality check.
*  Hey, man, this is forever.
*  Above your head, though.
*  It doesn't have an ending to it.
*  You can't even imagine.
*  You're thinking about this small insular little world that you live in.
*  You're a part of something that's literally infinite and you're flying through it right now.
*  And you've decided that it's more important to be able to drive at 10 o'clock down a nice well lit street
*  than it is to see the majesty of the universe.
*  Well, the inability to understand that plays into so many of the things we were talking about earlier.
*  Just cops freaking out, people freaking out, unable to recognize a more total awareness in a situation.
*  But if you want to boil it down to the natural brass tacks of Mother Earth, if you want to look at it that way,
*  saying go to your fucking room.
*  And we have to sit and let her breathe.
*  Let her breathe.
*  I mean, think about what's happened in the past few months is just in terms of pollution and the way that the Earth is growing and breathing.
*  All kinds of incredible things are happening.
*  Like with the monkeys in India.
*  The course of nature.
*  There's one in Thailand.
*  You see the Thailand one?
*  Was that Thailand?
*  I think it's sent to you.
*  Where there was no tourists anymore.
*  So the monkeys were going to war with each other.
*  Yeah.
*  But I mean, that's...
*  Thousands run down the street.
*  It's crazy.
*  Beautiful.
*  I wanted to pick this thought.
*  Those are our buddies.
*  That's my cousin.
*  I know.
*  You're right.
*  Mother Nature is telling us to go to our room.
*  I think we would like to believe that our systems, all of them, they're independent, right?
*  That our system of the way we view each other, if you wanted to look at racism, classism, sexism, all the different isms
*  and all the different biases that things have, people leaning left and leaning right and censoring people that oppose them.
*  If you wanted to look at it like a system, like the thoughts are a system and then all the life forms are a system.
*  There's some sort of a moving, flowing, give and take to all of it.
*  To life and death and the organic structure of the land that you live on.
*  It's all supposed to work together.
*  Animals die.
*  They fertilize the ground.
*  And as soon as we jam ourselves into this and we go, you know what?
*  Fuck fertilizer.
*  How about we grow these fucking things with chemicals and we put them in a big warehouse and we force Mexicans to work here for $3 an hour.
*  We sneak across the border.
*  It's all related.
*  It really is.
*  And then people get sick.
*  And then the abuse and then all these negative things and then they affect crime.
*  And then crime affects the way you think about each other.
*  And no one wants to take accountability for their choices.
*  Like the guys upstairs, like the ones in power don't want to say, well, this is what we did.
*  But since it's all fucked up and it's not working, we're going to just point our fingers at these people.
*  Well, because if they fuck up, we hate them and we want them out of office.
*  You fucking loser, you ruin this economy.
*  You know, like they don't even have a chance to fuck up.
*  Yeah.
*  But people fuck up in everything they do.
*  But so much of the tension of it is that consciousness comes from that natural system and is part of it.
*  So how do you reconciling that is that the chimpanzee or the bat?
*  The chimpanzee or the bonobo?
*  That's where the mushrooms come in.
*  The mushrooms show you the grand pattern and make you realize how you're fucking up, kid.
*  One of the saddest things I've discovered as a fisherwoman, I don't get to fish as much as I would like.
*  You're an angler.
*  Yeah.
*  Angler. You're an angler.
*  It's a better gender non-neutral.
*  Almost every place that I've gone fishing in the past few years and beautiful places, even in pristine nature,
*  we were fly fishing in Montana on the Clark Fork River and it's like not a piece of trash for miles.
*  Like just eagles, ospreys, just absolutely stunning.
*  People getting eaten.
*  People getting eaten.
*  Left and right.
*  A couple.
*  But you can't eat any of the fish that you catch because sometime in the 70s or 80s,
*  the mines that they were using in the area started leaking minerals into the river and it contaminated the area and you can't, you'll get really sick.
*  Is that true?
*  Yes, it is true.
*  Is that a rumor?
*  No, no, no, no.
*  You can't eat the fish.
*  Where are you hearing this?
*  There's some areas where that's the case, like out of, the areas around Billings, there's a lot of places that have had,
*  but if you're in like other places, like I guarantee you, you could eat the fish.
*  Clark Fork River in Montana, I don't believe.
*  But here's what I'm saying.
*  Outside Missoula.
*  There's, it would be an ecological catastrophe of the highest order the United States has ever seen if all the rivers in Montana were polluted to the point where you couldn't eat the fish.
*  You're talking about a certain section.
*  Maybe it was a certain section.
*  I don't know.
*  I would imagine it has to be.
*  That would be horrific.
*  But even then, like when we were, one of our last river trips a couple years ago, we went, we did a, Ben and I were hired as entertainment for this incredible trip on the Snake River in Hell's Canyon in Oregon.
*  And I mean, no cell service for three days, so you don't have a fucking cell phone.
*  You're like shitting outside.
*  Like doing it.
*  Hole in the grass or?
*  No, no, we had like we had like a bucket situation.
*  And then you put this like powder.
*  It's horrifying.
*  But you got to do it.
*  Hey, hey, toughen up Rogan.
*  That's where I draw the line.
*  That's where I become a bitch.
*  I'm not shitting in a bucket.
*  No, when I went hunting with Brian Callan, we had shit in the forest.
*  No, we had shit in the forest.
*  And I took his shit.
*  I have a picture of it somewhere on my phone.
*  I put a flag in it.
*  I made a flag out of aluminum foil and I planted it in his shit and I had him standing over it with his pants down to his ankles.
*  Give me the thumbs up.
*  And we're in the middle of Montana.
*  Let me tell you something.
*  Callan and I, we hunted for seven days.
*  It was one long, ridiculous joke after another.
*  All we were doing is stuff like that.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Brian Callan came up with, he came up with a character called the Ravine Comer.
*  There's a guy who finds ravines, who just jacks off in ravines.
*  He was deciding, some people were into like laying the feet.
*  Some people were into hair and eyes.
*  I like a fucking ravine.
*  And he's like, you know what?
*  I can relate.
*  And these camera guys were dying.
*  They're filming this hunting show.
*  And he got Brian Callan, who was miming, jacking off into a ravine.
*  With his like, crazy, with a flag and his shit right next to him.
*  We were crying.
*  We were crying.
*  It was so ridiculous.
*  I think I'm crying.
*  I had a real tear.
*  I wish you were there.
*  I wish you could see it.
*  Hey, you can bring Honey Honey next time.
*  We'll fake jerk off in the room.
*  I think they even filmed it.
*  I think they even filmed it, but they wouldn't put it on the show.
*  And I was like, you know, I mean, you would lose a lot of fans, but you gain a lot too.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  I'm used to it these days.
*  It's a fucking ebb and flow.
*  Oh my God.
*  No, but there's something there's something to be said about my.
*  It is Clark Fork fish kill.
*  Mind waste.
*  So there's something to be said.
*  That can't be all of them.
*  That's got to be like one creek.
*  Because I think one of the things they do.
*  A pretty big river that goes pretty far.
*  It's got a lot of rain.
*  The fish kills that have happened in the past.
*  A lot of times they're shortly after big rain events.
*  Rain starts to run over land and it'll pick up a lot of metals from those contaminated
*  areas we call sickens.
*  Oh, slickens.
*  Sickens is better.
*  Isn't slickens better slickens?
*  Oh, those metals can get into the river.
*  Betty slickens slickens.
*  Have you ever heard that word?
*  No slickens are pieces of ground in the upper Clark Fork watershed, devoid of life due to
*  heavy metal contamination dating back to the early 20th century flood that washed mine
*  waste off the Butte Hill and down river all the way to Missoula.
*  So all the way down there those fish could die.
*  Wow.
*  That's what's so disconcerting is.
*  Since the 80s or 90s.
*  Back to when Ben and I did this river raft trip which was so, it was just beautiful.
*  But I mean you're in the middle of nowhere.
*  No cell service.
*  Nothing but nature.
*  And when we were on the Snake River in Hells Canyon, it's a canyon.
*  Right?
*  So like any runoff from farms up top is going to end up in the river.
*  And we did a lot of fishing and almost everything I caught, any catfish that came up, bass, all
*  had like weird abscesses on them.
*  But like you could see.
*  Why did we go there?
*  What's that?
*  I wonder why.
*  I mean maybe next time let's go to a different river.
*  Oh, great.
*  Great idea, Ben.
*  Cool, cool, cool.
*  You pick the river, let's go.
*  Let's go there.
*  That place sucks.
*  Let's go to another place, bro.
*  Maybe channeling your inner Jeff Spicoli.
*  Hey, does this river have abscesses on your fish?
*  Because if not, we want to fish there.
*  Yeah, maybe.
*  Yeah, that's the darkest.
*  That's a great idea, actually.
*  That's the darkest deal with mining, right?
*  That's the thing that everyone's terrified of.
*  I have a lot of good friends that are involved in conservation and a lot of the laws that
*  get passed in terms of like what affects wildlife, like what areas are allowed to be open for
*  mining, and stuff like that.
*  They're always like moving and trying to stop stuff like that from being happened, from
*  being drilled.
*  Because you never know.
*  I mean there's just so many times it'll poison a system.
*  And if that's the case, then it goes all the way down to Missoula.
*  I don't know how far that is from Clark Fork.
*  Is that what it is?
*  The river is called Clark Fork.
*  How far away is it from Missoula?
*  I don't know.
*  We probably drove like an hour or so to get to the spot.
*  Not far.
*  But imagine that.
*  If it goes all the way down there.
*  So that's like what?
*  50, 60 miles?
*  There's this great book called The Four Fish.
*  And it came out a long time ago, which makes it scarier.
*  But the writer talks about like the four remaining fish.
*  And then there's all the farming industries and how that's kind of like just kind of cross
*  bread into our river systems.
*  And so at this point, like if someone's like, this is your Atlantic salmon.
*  It's not necessarily the Atlantic salmon that would have been the same salmon.
*  Oh yeah, it's farm raised.
*  Everything is like nothing's what it used to be.
*  The way it's evolved.
*  And the sad part is, and I am such an optimist at heart, but like in terms of fishing and
*  like getting, and you could probably relate to this with hunting, like authentic clean
*  fish, like it's not a thing.
*  It's not a thing.
*  We've fucked with the earth too much with our pesticides and the way that we farm and
*  the way that we try to fuck with nature.
*  Like it's just not, you have to, you don't know what you're catching and if you're going
*  to ingest it, like who knows what it is anymore.
*  There's a great book that actually just got released about salmon.
*  It's my friend Steve Rinella on the meat eater interviewed the author.
*  I like that guy.
*  Yeah, he's great.
*  Steve's an amazing guy.
*  And he's just one of the best representatives for like the best well read arguments for
*  a hunting, fishing lifestyle.
*  But he has this great podcast called meat eater and he had on this guy who wrote this
*  book on salmon.
*  And he was explaining how complicated it is for salmon to bounce back.
*  Because if you took some farm salmon and you just threw them in a river with a bunch of
*  salmon that are swimming up river to breed, like these dumb salmon wouldn't know where
*  to go.
*  They're fucking, they're in a farm.
*  They just sit around waiting to be fed.
*  They don't know anything.
*  So here they are, you know, 24 pounds, just dumb as fuck.
*  Just like a robot person.
*  Like, hey, where are we going for food?
*  Where's the food?
*  Bitch, you got to earn this food.
*  You got to go kill these fish.
*  Look at those bugs.
*  Jump, get them.
*  Jump.
*  Jump up the rocks.
*  Fish robots.
*  You guys are swimming up river?
*  What the fuck is wrong with you?
*  Why don't you just wait for the food?
*  What about the guy?
*  What about the guy?
*  And apparently.
*  There's supposed to be pellets, right?
*  They told me there was going to be pellets here.
*  Yeah.
*  Where's the fucking pellets, bitch?
*  Apparently, each river, like each tributary is specific to one sort of like almost breed
*  of salmon.
*  Yeah.
*  Like the type of salmon.
*  And they don't even know how the fuck they know how to come back to the place where they
*  were born.
*  So they find the place where they were born and they fucking die there.
*  Shit.
*  Like how do they know how to get back there?
*  They know it.
*  And if you block the river, they don't know what the fuck to do.
*  So when people put dams up and shit and they block the river.
*  Oh yeah, all of them.
*  They kill off giant strains of this majestic animal.
*  But it's so it's such a weird animal because it's got to travel to the ocean.
*  It's this weird fish.
*  It gets smaller and smaller every year, the population.
*  And that's what's like at this point.
*  Like, are we just going to start eating farmed salmon and only farms like wild caught is
*  a thing.
*  It's got other consequences, too, with orcas.
*  There's a resident population, I think in the Puget Sound around Seattle in the Pacific
*  Northwest.
*  There's a resident population of these dolphins that only eat salmon.
*  I think they only.
*  Those dicks.
*  I think they only know there's no salmon for them anymore.
*  They're fucking starving.
*  Oh shit.
*  I feel bad now.
*  They won't eat the other stuff.
*  The ones that are thriving, the salmon that are thriving up there are the ones that are
*  transitory.
*  They and they come in and they eat the seals and shit.
*  They mammals and these other ones won't eat seals.
*  They just won't eat them.
*  They only want to eat salmon.
*  Can't get it.
*  Since there's no salmon, they're like literally they're worried they're going to.
*  Wow, isn't that crazy?
*  They should expand their palette.
*  They just don't have that.
*  They don't have it.
*  They don't have it.
*  Yeah.
*  You ever read that book Sapiens?
*  Yes.
*  It's amazing.
*  Oh my God.
*  Was it Noah, Yuval, Harari?
*  Yeah, Harari.
*  Yeah, right.
*  That is amazing.
*  Incredible book.
*  It's so eye opening.
*  And he talks about this is dating back what 70, 80, 90,000 years whenever the human species
*  or homo sapiens were introduced into an environment.
*  It's somewhere between 50 and 80% of the other species in 100 years were extinct.
*  It's just a natural side effect of sharing space with humans.
*  Wow, I never thought of it that way.
*  That's just what we do.
*  Shit.
*  Well, I think it's also because we figured out how to make these houses and get away
*  from being eaten, we've gotten super ridiculous about the way we allocate resources and we
*  made way too many of us.
*  Yeah.
*  No.
*  We're like rats on a sinking ship.
*  There's so many of us.
*  At this point, I kind of feel like holding onto my nostalgic fishing experiences and
*  things like that, I just have to keep going forward and be like, all right, this is the
*  new norm.
*  You can't do this, you can't do this.
*  I think there's something else going on with fish.
*  There's a thing that's-
*  That's one example though.
*  It is.
*  Just everything.
*  But I should just say that in the culture of fly fishing, it's more common and respected
*  to catch and release than I would say any other type of fishing.
*  Yeah.
*  I prefer spin reel fishing though.
*  Respect.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I like-
*  It's more action.
*  I like eating when I catch.
*  Same.
*  Likewise.
*  I think there's something weird, and I've gone catch and release fishing before.
*  I have done it before.
*  It is fun.
*  But there's something about catching and then eating it that day that's extremely satisfying.
*  Yeah.
*  And then also it's like-
*  100%.
*  I know it's legal to catch and release.
*  I know it's legal.
*  But should it be?
*  I mean, what are you doing?
*  You playing a little game?
*  I could have killed you, but I'm going to let you go.
*  You're playing like unwilling jujitsu with some dudes at a parking lot.
*  They just grab at them.
*  I'm just going to kill you.
*  I'm not.
*  It's like, let you go.
*  Take care, buddy.
*  You've decided to fuck with that fish's day.
*  Don't they know?
*  They start to learn.
*  They're like, I'm not falling for that shit again.
*  They're not that smart.
*  We're assuming they're that smart.
*  I think if you make something that looks like a fly, they just jump on it.
*  Yeah.
*  It is a mask.
*  Do you jump on flies?
*  I bow to my instincts.
*  Fly fishing is badass.
*  Don't get me wrong.
*  It's an art form.
*  It's really interesting.
*  I've watched really good fly fishermen.
*  There's something about it with a strip in that line.
*  They're gently plopping that cast.
*  There's something about it.
*  Let it hunt.
*  Johnny stickfish.
*  Mend it upstream.
*  Let it hunt.
*  I like fly fishing a lot.
*  I do prefer spin reel fishing.
*  Is it just preference?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  It's just preference.
*  It is.
*  It's like ballet.
*  It's like the ballet for the river.
*  Yeah.
*  Like hibachi grills.
*  Everybody has a different favorite kind of fishing.
*  My favorite kind of fishing was always bass fishing.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  They're just such an American animal.
*  It's face is way too big.
*  It's got a giant mouth.
*  You mean a large mouth bass.
*  Yeah, a large mouth bass.
*  Even a small mouth bass has a face that's way too big.
*  Small mouth bass still has a big fucking mouth.
*  You know, it's just it's relative.
*  It's all relative.
*  Yeah.
*  But that's a you know, that's a that's an American kind of fishing.
*  You know, you throw in a like a crankbait on a lily pad, pulling it off the lily pad,
*  moving it through the water.
*  And you see this explosion of water and this fucking steroid in that browser.
*  They're fighting fish.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what I like about it.
*  That's what I like about the spin reel.
*  And also there's a little more variety personally for spin reel fishing.
*  You can you know fly fishing.
*  You're on the surface.
*  You're mostly catching trout.
*  Not like trout are great.
*  Love trout.
*  It's for rich white guys.
*  Let's be honest.
*  It's for a few weird lesbians and rich white guys.
*  Your words.
*  Your words.
*  You're hilarious.
*  That's just doing it.
*  It's like guys are looking for peace and quiet and doing shit their wife doesn't want to
*  do.
*  They're putting on rubber pants and they're trying to get away from their wife.
*  Oh my God.
*  Peace and quiet out here.
*  As they jerk off into the ravine.
*  Bass fishing is like you listen to Johnny Cash songs drinking beer.
*  Yeah.
*  And casting.
*  Let's play a song.
*  Casting rubber worms.
*  I'll play a song.
*  What do you want to play?
*  I don't know what do you want to play?
*  Can you play one for me?
*  Can I make a request?
*  Can I request LA River?
*  This is going to get sloppy.
*  No.
*  Okay.
*  I literally have to look up the lyrics.
*  Really?
*  That's your song.
*  I know.
*  You don't understand.
*  There's so many songs between them.
*  Okay.
*  How about Angel of Death?
*  That would be super nostalgic.
*  Okay.
*  This is the song I first heard from you guys.
*  How good is Young Jamie?
*  So good.
*  Busted out.
*  Okay.
*  Let's get Joe both songs because he wants them.
*  He's got LA River queued up and ready to rock.
*  This is such a...
*  Why are you guys...
*  Don't get insecure with each other on my show.
*  This is Joe Space.
*  Space, space.
*  I hate that word, by the way.
*  I hate that word.
*  When people talk about in this space, fuck you.
*  You're playing games.
*  You're playing games with words in this space.
*  What space is this?
*  This is Joe Space, Joe.
*  The fucking space around the human race on Earth.
*  Joe Space Force.
*  Oh.
*  In this space.
*  Ask me what show I'm obsessed with right now.
*  Space Force.
*  Space Force.
*  Are you really?
*  So good.
*  So good.
*  Okay.
*  Now I have to watch because I read a terrible review of it.
*  It's so funny.
*  I'm not super feeling it.
*  Fuck you.
*  I'm just weighing in.
*  I think it's amazing.
*  Also Ben Schwartz.
*  I couldn't follow up with it.
*  Big fan.
*  Big fan.
*  Just saying.
*  This is a range of opinion.
*  Can't he have his own opinion?
*  Can't our friend Ben have his own opinion?
*  Totally.
*  Totally.
*  Why did you shame his opinion?
*  Let me just abuse you in private.
*  But this is not about a critical issue.
*  This shows how tribal people are.
*  We're only talking about a television show about space.
*  You're attacking my sense of identity here.
*  You know what we're doing?
*  I'm going to be very expressive about his views on a sitcom.
*  Sit with it, Sue.
*  Sit with it.
*  I'm going to slur my words.
*  I don't care.
*  I'm going to tell you.
*  Fight back.
*  The alcohol is for you.
*  We're really accepting each other.
*  Our differences.
*  It really helps you.
*  That's important.
*  So.
*  I'm going to hit hell up.
*  You know what?
*  No, no, no.
*  Listen, I test the waters.
*  You're allowed to not like Space Force.
*  You're allowed.
*  What's that?
*  You're allowed to not like it.
*  Well, of course.
*  I respect that.
*  I feel like I can't even watch it now because I love both of you and I don't want to pick
*  a side.
*  No, see, you can feel how you feel though, Joe.
*  That's the thing.
*  I don't give a shit.
*  I'm going to listen to Suzanne.
*  No.
*  Wait a second.
*  I'm going to try not to mess this up.
*  I'm really slurring my words.
*  I'm going to listen to Suzanne on everything other than Space Force.
*  That's all that's important to me, which is weird.
*  But you got one of your candles here.
*  I know.
*  I don't think he's lit it.
*  Big Lebowski.
*  Big Lebowski.
*  Big Lebowski, yes or no?
*  Great film.
*  100%.
*  Love it.
*  Obsessed.
*  You can be my friend.
*  That's what it took.
*  How deep is our way?
*  Is this like an hour and a half, two hours?
*  How are we doing?
*  It's four o'clock.
*  Penn, why are you keeping time?
*  Because I'm about to smoke weed.
*  Oh shit.
*  Can we play first?
*  Otherwise, things get weird.
*  Angel of Death.
*  Oh my God.
*  Angel of Death.
*  Angel of Death.
*  Early, rr, rr, rr.
*  You don't have to play first.
*  Oh shit.
*  No, I can't.
*  Joe, fuck it.
*  I'll get distracted.
*  This is bad.
*  This is going to be so scary.
*  That's that Elon Musk weed, son.
*  Oh shit.
*  What do you mean when you say that?
*  He smoked it or he made it?
*  That's what it took.
*  He smoked that when he figured out how to connect that SpaceX thing to the space station.
*  No.
*  What?
*  This is the stuff that killed his stock by 6%.
*  It'll be fine.
*  I'm going to smoke weed.
*  It didn't really.
*  He bounced back instantly.
*  It's just people panicking.
*  He's a super genius.
*  We should go with a raised dick because it's so much higher now than it was then.
*  Way higher.
*  Yes.
*  Well, I think every time he talks in long form, his stock goes up.
*  You just got to understand who he is.
*  Trust me.
*  Okay?
*  Don't trust me on everything, but trust me.
*  Leave that guy alone.
*  Leave that guy alone.
*  Give him all the encouragement you can.
*  He's doing crazy shit.
*  He's not trying to harm anybody.
*  He's trying to build tunnels that shoot you all the way to Las Vegas.
*  He's trying to make electric cars that go 0 to 60 in one and a half seconds.
*  He's trying to put us on Mars.
*  Positive support.
*  Keep helping.
*  You have to watch SpaceX with him.
*  Don't troll Elon Musk.
*  I'm not.
*  Anybody who does that, like, please.
*  I know you can.
*  He's about to quit Twitter again.
*  You fucks.
*  Yes.
*  No, no, no.
*  Right?
*  Am I right?
*  Yeah.
*  He's about to quit Twitter again.
*  Leave him alone.
*  You fucks.
*  Save him, Joe.
*  Joe, if there's anyone who can save him, it's you.
*  Well, I don't know how much he listens to me.
*  I wouldn't listen to me if I was him.
*  If I was him, it would be like if my 10-year-old came to me with some really good advice, I'd
*  have to put that shit through a long filter.
*  A 10-year-old telling me what's doing with your 50.
*  Exactly.
*  Got it.
*  Same thing.
*  Basically the same thing.
*  If I come to him with an idea, he's going to be like, oh, cool.
*  Yeah.
*  Call you back.
*  He's so chill.
*  I listened to the last podcast and he's just so calm.
*  He's a good guy.
*  I enjoy being in his presence.
*  He's a very nice person.
*  Despite being ... There was a weird moment, like the first podcast we did where I asked
*  him, I said, I go, what is going on in your head?
*  I go, what is it like being you?
*  Because I could tell.
*  You could tell when you're talking to him.
*  It's almost like you're talking to someone who had ... If you imagine that the mind is
*  like every other part of the body, we've all seen people that have ridiculous body parts.
*  We've all seen people that were born with enormous breasts.
*  Don't I know it.
*  Every day.
*  But how crazy is that it?
*  That's just a random.
*  Happens.
*  Some dudes are born with enormous noses, enormous feet, enormous dicks.
*  It's just weird, random.
*  You got to think the same thing happens with the brain.
*  Big toes.
*  Sometimes the brain comes out just some supercharged, 1,000 horsepower, hybrid engine and you're
*  like, holy shit.
*  Let him drill.
*  Let him drill.
*  Let him get us to Mars.
*  You can't get to Mars, Marty.
*  Let him get us to Mars.
*  That's what it's like.
*  That's how I feel with that guy.
*  I'm like, just be nice to him.
*  Be nice to him and let him do whatever the fuck he wants.
*  Yeah.
*  I listened to some of that podcast too and it was interesting to see because he said
*  something that stuck with me.
*  You're talking about his decision to sell all his houses.
*  He says people see that as an attack vector.
*  I was like, dang.
*  That says a lot about his name.
*  He says a lot about his narrative and his feel of the world.
*  He's the real deal, folks.
*  You got to listen to me.
*  He'll go down in history.
*  He's not a perfect person.
*  No one is.
*  He does flare up.
*  He got mad at that guy.
*  He was criticizing him in that Thailand thing and he got sued for it.
*  No one who's human is perfect, but he's trying to do amazing things for technology, for the
*  environment, for the human race, for the propagation of the species.
*  He really thinks that we need to plan ahead and make colonies on Mars so that the human
*  race can survive because he doesn't think it could totally survive on Earth.
*  He's like, there's a high likelihood that something can go wrong.
*  He's right.
*  When you see what happened with the pandemic, that was a dress rehearsal for a real event
*  and we failed miserably.
*  We panicked.
*  There was no talk of the immune system.
*  All the talk was like, oh, protect yourself.
*  Put a mask on.
*  Rubbing gloves.
*  Sanitize.
*  There was all this crazy talk.
*  And then at the end of that, Emerging were realizing this is not correct.
*  They all had probably our best interests in mind.
*  But human beings are human.
*  They fuck up.
*  They're not right all the time.
*  We're all trying to figure this out together.
*  When is it going to be okay to have that though?
*  When is it going to be okay to fuck up?
*  It just appears to not be okay.
*  You have to be honest.
*  We could do it anyway.
*  It doesn't matter.
*  You have to be honest and you have to stay away from any sort of forum where someone
*  can judge you in a dishonest way.
*  So if you're honest and someone is judging you on Twitter, if they're saying something
*  new and type on Twitter, something mean and nasty to you, like we were talking about earlier
*  before about people who are bullies and people who are bullies like send you things.
*  When someone does something like that, it's a function of the limitations of the system
*  that you're working in.
*  You're working in this weird thing where you're agreeing to type things.
*  You're not even saying them.
*  You're just writing it out and putting a period there.
*  I don't even know what the sound your voice was making.
*  You've broken things down to some real weird thing.
*  And also there's no accountability for what you're saying.
*  You can't say in front of me, like you told me you would take me to the moon.
*  What the fuck are you talking about?
*  There's no, you know what I'm saying?
*  So any kind of conflict that anybody gets online, part of the problem is it's a shitty
*  way to interact with people.
*  It's just, it's a super limited.
*  It is.
*  It doesn't make any sense to me personally.
*  I recently this weekend opened up my Instagram to talk to people and I talked to like maybe
*  like a hundred people over the weekend, just like via voice message and video message.
*  And every conversation I had, whether I was met with adverse opinions was peaceful.
*  And like, cause we got to hear each other's voices and I don't want to fight with anybody.
*  There was a rule of like, if you're going to be nasty, I'm not going to respond to you.
*  But if you want to talk to me about your opinions and the progress that I felt like I was, I
*  made for myself just in trying to understand things that I could never understand because
*  of who I am and where I come from.
*  It was, it was so valuable, but that per what you just said, like I got to hear people's
*  voices and look into their eyes and talk to them.
*  Complete strangers.
*  It felt like something to do that wasn't just reposting things and that's, that's, you know,
*  has its purpose as well.
*  But I got to actually talk to people that, that had something to say and it was, it was
*  great and all the trolls that like to comment without, you know, having any like, you're
*  not going to fucking get anywhere.
*  I didn't hear from those people and I really wanted to.
*  That's a good forum though.
*  You're actually talking, you're talking, they're talking.
*  That's a good forum.
*  Even if you're doing that just like a FaceTime thing.
*  It wasn't exhausting either.
*  I had all this energy afterwards.
*  I felt fueled.
*  I was inspired.
*  I didn't like, if you're going to hate on me, sorry, see you later.
*  But if you have, if you want to try and meet in the middle, that's where something is going
*  to get done.
*  And, and like, you know, I posted a couple of things and I, people are so angry and.
*  What did you post that got people angry?
*  I posted a few things.
*  I posted, um.
*  All lives matter.
*  No, fuck you.
*  I posted, I posted a photo of you, dick.
*  Could you imagine?
*  No!
*  Could you, but could you imagine if I ran up to you in like 1995 and I said, listen,
*  one day, one day if you write all lives matter, people will kick your ass.
*  No, that is hilarious.
*  That is fucking nuts.
*  I keep thinking about that.
*  If you had told me when I was a kid that like in 2020 we're going to be like, that's
*  weird.
*  But imagine, just imagine that phrase.
*  Imagine a fucking Orwellian reality where that phrase could get your ass kicked.
*  You're like, wait, what?
*  What?
*  What?
*  What?
*  What?
*  For real?
*  Well, our language is changing, you know, like.
*  Yes.
*  But we have to be careful because the same way cops have power, people who want to control
*  your language have power.
*  It's all power.
*  We shouldn't have magic words.
*  Words should convey intent.
*  And as soon as you have some words that have an extra abracadabra to them, they get abused
*  with any kind of magic word, any forbidden word.
*  I'm against forbidden words.
*  I'm not against the sentiment that's attached to good or bad words.
*  I want you to be able to accurately express yourself.
*  So I can't play games with what you're saying.
*  So you say something to me and it seems valid, but then you say the word pussy or something
*  like that.
*  Oh, well, now I discredit everything you said because you said a magic word that you can't
*  use in my accepted version of speech.
*  That's what I'm worried about.
*  I'm worried it's a sneaky back door for people to control conversations and pretend they
*  understand what your intent is.
*  Language is supposed to just be noises.
*  You just have to have so much patience.
*  And that brings me back to Elon Musk.
*  One of the things that he said was that you're going to be able to talk without using words.
*  He's going to drill holes in people's heads and shoot wires in there.
*  I don't know.
*  I like talking.
*  I just love talking.
*  It's like the acoustic guitar.
*  Call me old fashioned.
*  Talking is like the acoustic guitar of communication.
*  No need.
*  Well, we do that stuff all the time anyway.
*  We need acoustic guitars, my point.
*  Oh my God.
*  You heard it here, people.
*  You thought they were gone?
*  The backs.
*  Yes.
*  All right.
*  You know, some people really enjoy traditional archery.
*  They want to like shoot a bow.
*  Totally do.
*  Like fucking Robin Hood.
*  Yeah.
*  And dress up like a shoot.
*  You never shot a bow?
*  No, but can I?
*  Yes.
*  You look like you could be Gina Davis' daughter.
*  Fucking.
*  She's beautiful.
*  Gina Davis is beautiful.
*  I know.
*  I love her.
*  When I was an actor, I remember auditioning for a part for her daughter and I didn't get
*  it.
*  I was good.
*  I was good enough.
*  I was good enough.
*  Those idiots.
*  100% you could be Gina Davis' daughter.
*  And Gina Davis is a serious archer.
*  What?
*  Yes.
*  Like really, really good.
*  Like amazing.
*  Like there's videos of her online.
*  She got obsessed with archery.
*  She was learning it for, I believe it was a film role.
*  And so she got really obsessed with archery.
*  That pirate shit.
*  Remember that pirate one?
*  Okay, moving on.
*  Moving on.
*  There's so many movies, man.
*  I told you about Zoolander.
*  No, it wasn't Zoolander.
*  I just only remember so much.
*  But it was another movie.
*  I only have so much room, Ben.
*  Forget I said the pirate thing.
*  No, but Gina Davis is, I loved her in The Fly.
*  The Fly.
*  Jeff Goldblum.
*  Jeff Goldblum in The Fly is one of the greatest horror movies of all time.
*  Yeah.
*  When people talk about horror movies, they're like, oh, I love this movie.
*  I love this movie.
*  I love this movie.
*  I love this movie.
*  I love this movie.
*  The Fly is one of the greatest horror movies of all time.
*  Yeah.
*  When people talk about horror movies, there she is.
*  She's re, I'm telling you.
*  Get out of here.
*  Look at this.
*  41 took over.
*  And 41 landed in the U.S. Olympic Trials.
*  Wow.
*  Just before the 2000 games in Sydney.
*  She said she did it on a whim, became obsessed with it.
*  60-year-old actress admits.
*  A League of Their Own is one of my favorite movies.
*  Dude, she's amazing.
*  Hey, Thelma and Louise, step the fuck off.
*  Hey, what?
*  Okay, can't we agree that I also love that movie?
*  How about that video?
*  Pull up a video of Gina Davis doing archery.
*  But you gotta see how she does it.
*  Like when, sometimes like someone who's a badass at one thing will get really interested
*  in something else.
*  And it's interesting that you see, look at that.
*  Bro, Gina Davis is a fucking serious archer.
*  Like, you watch her.
*  I love you, Gina Davis.
*  Look at this.
*  Look at this form.
*  That is very Suze-ish.
*  Dude, her, look at this.
*  She's shooting a fucking arrow through three bones.
*  And she's dressed in the Peaches uniform.
*  Suck my dick.
*  That's a League of Their Own.
*  It's back.
*  And not only that.
*  She shot that dude in the head.
*  She doesn't give a fuck.
*  It's a rubber dude.
*  Relentless.
*  But she's also doing traditional archery.
*  And what I mean by that is she doesn't have, she's got a gun.
*  She's got a gun too.
*  Don't fuck with Gina Davis.
*  But she uses a recurve.
*  So it's not a compound bow.
*  Compound bow like what a lot of bow hunters use.
*  Is she wearing a mustache?
*  That's like an old school bow.
*  That's a modern version of an old school bow.
*  And she just shoots it again.
*  She's releasing it.
*  Oh she's going Gallagher.
*  Hilarious.
*  Anyway, shout out to Gina Davis.
*  That's so cool.
*  Yeah, she got into archery and she found out that a lot of people, what a lot of people
*  found out ever since the beginning of time, there's something really weird.
*  It's really satisfying about releasing an arrow and watching it land on a target.
*  You could be a total vegan and enjoy archery.
*  Archery is a sport for everyone just like yoga.
*  There's something to it.
*  It's yoga sport?
*  Like fishing.
*  When you catch a fish, you know how you catch a fish and you're like, ah, it taps into some
*  sort of ancient DNA?
*  It's the same thing with archery.
*  There's something about it.
*  When you watch that arrow.
*  It's like intention and relief.
*  But I think it has to do with the fact that throughout human history for like thousands
*  of years that was the best way to kill your dinner.
*  You had to have a bow and arrow until they figured out guns.
*  So that shit is still in our system.
*  I think it's a tension release thing.
*  I think that's a natural human.
*  We're attracted to that in everything and so much of our communication back to music.
*  Boom.
*  I think it's that too.
*  So much of communication and music is just tension and release.
*  I think that as well.
*  But I think there's many factors at play.
*  But I think one of the factors is the DNA.
*  For sure one of the factors is that too.
*  I think there's a lot of factors.
*  There's also the complexity like the game, the puzzle factor.
*  Like one of the things that people like about catching a fish is the same thing they like
*  about beating someone.
*  It's sorry.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Like you want to win the game.
*  Come on baby.
*  Come on bitch.
*  Take the bait.
*  Gotcha motherfucker.
*  Gotcha.
*  Totally.
*  That's what it is.
*  There's a strategy involved.
*  Yeah.
*  100%.
*  There's a skill set.
*  Yeah.
*  Alright.
*  Alright.
*  It's all taps into our human reward system that is designed to reward us for the behavior
*  that makes us more likely to survive.
*  Particularly when we're living in a place where we can get eaten.
*  Which is most of the human history.
*  The eaten days.
*  I think the eaten days are a big part of our DNA.
*  I think that's a big...
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah of course.
*  Our fear response.
*  Fight and fight.
*  You know there's a guy named Rupert Sheldrake that was talking about this.
*  One of the things he was saying is that...
*  Oh his fields.
*  Yeah yeah yeah.
*  Yeah yeah yeah.
*  Morphic resonance.
*  Morphic resonance.
*  We were on tour with Jake Bug and his tour manager was obsessed with Rupert Sheldrake.
*  And he was talking about these...
*  Sorry.
*  I should...
*  No I was just going to say that one of the things that he said that's really fascinating
*  is that things have a memory to them.
*  And that he believes that maybe even objects have memory to them.
*  And one of the things that he was talking about is that children who live in New York
*  City, they're not afraid of child molesters or car accidents.
*  They're afraid of monsters.
*  They're all afraid of monsters.
*  Because we used to have...
*  Define monsters.
*  Big cats.
*  That's what everybody was afraid of.
*  Everybody was afraid of the thing in the dark that gets you.
*  Because that's what kept killing people all throughout history.
*  That's where all the werewolf movies come from.
*  The wolves are so smart.
*  They must be part human.
*  They're really smart.
*  Wolves are really smart.
*  They ate people forever.
*  Until we figured out how to make houses.
*  They just ate us.
*  And all these things are...
*  Well they are dogs.
*  But all these things are programmed into us.
*  And you don't realize that until you're out actually in the woods.
*  And all those things are turned on again.
*  It's like kick on system three, four and five.
*  Like three, four and five.
*  This bitch lives in the Bronx.
*  Coyotes near Griffith Park.
*  I live near Griffith Park.
*  And I saw one maybe a hundred yards away.
*  And it couldn't give a fuck.
*  No it bade.
*  It went awry.
*  And the hairs on the back of my neck.
*  It was a feeling I hadn't felt before.
*  I've never seen a wolf in the wild.
*  Did you thirst for its blood?
*  I offered my blood as a sign of compassion.
*  That's weird.
*  I've never seen a wolf in the wild that I'm absolutely sure of.
*  I saw one.
*  I was with my friend Cam Haynes in Alberta.
*  We saw one walking across this dirt road.
*  We're pretty sure it was a wolf.
*  It was pretty big.
*  It was like dog sized.
*  Yeah.
*  Which is like when you get to anywhere around dog size, like 70, 80 pounds, you know you're
*  not dealing with a coyote anymore probably.
*  Especially in the woods.
*  And there's a lot of wolves up there.
*  But that's...
*  If there's any animal that I would love to like...
*  If I could just fucking follow them around with a drone and just watch them live their
*  lives without me having any idea I was there.
*  Just watch a wolf for a week.
*  You know?
*  Yeah.
*  That would give you a sense of what...
*  We have this fucking weird Pixar ideology when it comes to like wildlife.
*  I think if you...
*  Even if you watch a documentary, like how close were you?
*  Where are these animals?
*  Our instincts have been muted.
*  We are in a digital age of self-obsession, narcissism, and kids don't play outside anymore.
*  They don't go...
*  The population for like ranch life or getting to integrate with nature and your own instincts
*  is very small.
*  Very small.
*  And back to New York, talking about people not feeling... fearing getting hit by a car,
*  all that stuff.
*  It's a product of environment and our environments are so...
*  They're so digital.
*  And I think about my childhood a lot and how...
*  We just went and played outside.
*  I grew up outside Cleveland in the suburbs and there'd be like a bunch of kids and you
*  get hurt, you get stitches, you get cut or whatever.
*  But we were creative.
*  Like, I never wore shoes for like months at a time in the summer.
*  Oh, you got hookworm.
*  And then probably...
*  You got that hookworm.
*  Fuck you.
*  I never got hookworm.
*  I never got head lice or hookworms.
*  So thank you very much.
*  You know that makes people dumb?
*  No, does it?
*  Hookworm?
*  Oh, dude.
*  Oh, shit.
*  I hate to do this again because we just talked about it like last week.
*  Don't scare me because I got cats and I was so afraid of the parasites.
*  That's toxoplasmosis.
*  I know.
*  But hookworms, this is a real thing and I'm sorry for anybody who's heard this before
*  but I have to bring it up again.
*  Hookworms are responsible for the stereotype of the dumb southerner.
*  Really?
*  Come on.
*  That's because they didn't fucking wash their hands.
*  No, no, no.
*  I had nothing to do with that.
*  It was walking barefoot.
*  Stop it.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Walking barefoot.
*  People were infected by hookworms and hookworms are a parasite that affects brain function.
*  It drains people of their energy and pull this shit out.
*  Do I have hookworm?
*  Because it will freak you out.
*  Stop scaring me.
*  It thrives in regions of extreme poverty.
*  Poor sanitation affects some 740 million people worldwide.
*  That's a lot of people.
*  Hookworm, just Google hookworm.
*  Do I have hookworm?
*  What do I do?
*  Oh god.
*  Dumb southern stereotype.
*  Google that real quick.
*  Oh, here it is.
*  How a worm gave the south a bad name.
*  So this is really all about.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  I'm trying.
*  If you've heard this before, you're like, Joe Rowan is going to fucking know this story.
*  Bro, I love you.
*  You got to listen.
*  There's a lot of people listening to this podcast that haven't heard this.
*  And this is like really important shit.
*  There's reasons for some stereotypes.
*  And when you're like, hey, well, Trump's going to get us through this.
*  And you're doing a dumb southern accent.
*  You must be on the hookworm.
*  This is why you're doing a dumb southern accent.
*  Because there's a prejudice.
*  There's a prejudice that we have.
*  Sometimes my toes itch. Oh no.
*  But listen, this happened.
*  It was up to 40% of the population stretching from like Texas to, scroll down a little bit.
*  The copper basin.
*  This is to West populations stretching from southern Texas to West Virginia.
*  Hookworms stymied development throughout the region.
*  And bred stereotypes about lazy moronic southerners.
*  While the South eventually rid itself of hookworms, those parasites caused the region decades of development.
*  And bred widespread misconception about the people who lived there.
*  Yet hookworm has not been defeated for good.
*  Today hundreds of millions of people in dozens of nations around the world suffer from hookworm infection.
*  The South's experience measured in both successes and pitfalls can provide a rough blueprint of how to seek out and quash this American murderer no matter where it's found around the world.
*  Imagine that.
*  Imagine that.
*  Every time I hear things like this I'm like, I have hookworm.
*  Ah fuck.
*  Slow down.
*  Let's pause this.
*  Can we pause please?
*  Just imagine all the stereotypes we have about the South.
*  Why would it be dumb to live in a place where it doesn't snow?
*  Like why are they dumb?
*  Right.
*  That's fair.
*  That's totally solid point sir.
*  All those fucking people in Minneapolis and Illinois, they're fine.
*  But they don't have hookworm.
*  Right.
*  There's fucking something stupid about people that live where it never snows.
*  You assholes can't even get out of your driveway until you've shoveled that bitch.
*  And then you're driving on this bullshit ass slippery road.
*  And you want to say this dude who lives in a place with alligators is dumb?
*  Come on.
*  Are you sure?
*  A lot of other factors though too Joe.
*  What are the factors Ben?
*  Other factors in the South as far as we're not getting into.
*  But take out all that other stuff.
*  Reconstruction, slavery, all of that.
*  But listen, this is one of the things that I really want.
*  I think they might be connected.
*  Sure?
*  If that many people down there had it, I think it's really likely that it affected their ability to decide what's right and wrong where the rest of the world had moved on.
*  I think there's a real argument for that.
*  I think that's absolutely worth exploring.
*  But there's cultures around the world who have had slavery that weren't connected.
*  But still do.
*  Or maybe still do.
*  So there's just something in humans where they're able to adapt to the situation.
*  It says,
*  What the heck?
*  How do you get it?
*  That millions of those parasites inhabited the guts of people throughout the South.
*  So you get it from not wearing shoes?
*  Hookworm symptoms were written off as simply being indicative of Southerners backward character.
*  That's crazy.
*  That's crazy.
*  Because you really have to stop and think about it.
*  Like all those people in the South are dumb.
*  Why?
*  They're people.
*  People are smart as fuck.
*  People figure out how to put satellites in space that lets you get better VCR or whatever.
*  Better VCR for everybody.
*  Docked on a space station.
*  So we can watch Zoolander.
*  They're living in the sky.
*  Oh my god.
*  They're living in the sky for a year you fuck.
*  Oh my god.
*  Some people are dumb as shit but some people aren't.
*  Why?
*  Well a big part of it might be these fucking parasites.
*  We might have a fucked up view of human beings totally, we might be behind the curve.
*  God this is a bully in my mind.
*  It's like, no I'm just like, question.
*  How do you get hookworm?
*  Just walking around.
*  You can get it from a lot of places.
*  Through your skin?
*  Yeah, it goes through your skin.
*  It's transdermal.
*  It's transdermal?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  There's a lot of...
*  Is what you said poor sanitation and stuff like that?
*  Sure, yeah, yeah.
*  Poor sanitation.
*  Look, throughout history, here it goes, contracted by direct contact with feces as unseemly as
*  in the South unsurprisingly wanted no association with such a disease.
*  Oh my god.
*  So they're not on board in the beginning.
*  The idea of hookworms, parasites that live within the body and are contracted by direct
*  contact with feces.
*  So they tried because they're proud people.
*  Look, there's a thing that I listened to, I think it was on, I forget the podcast, it
*  might have been NPR, but they were, Radio Lab, where they were talking about the South
*  and one of the reasons why the South is what it is is they have this sort of honor tradition
*  and it's like a different way of looking based on the people that initially...
*  Like the Scotch-Irish?
*  Yeah, based on the people that initially arrived in that area and there's so many factors.
*  And again, you could take this out of context and say I'm some sort of an apologist for
*  racists.
*  I'm not, but I think you absolutely have to think that all those people down there, whether
*  it's the people that were the slaves, the people that are slave owners, all those people
*  most likely had a lot, there was a giant percentage of those people that had that hookworm and
*  who knows how much that affected just the whole region, the culture.
*  There's always going to be a problem when someone can force someone to work for free,
*  right?
*  And that's what slavery is, right?
*  You're forcing someone to work for free, you're controlling them, you're owning them.
*  There's always going to be a problem with that.
*  People always have a problem if they can get away with shit.
*  If they can get away with shit, they'll fucking do it.
*  But if they can get away with shit and also they're dumb and also they're like, their
*  brains are depleted by a parasite.
*  They're like impaired by this thing.
*  So the rest of the world is saying, hey man, maybe we shouldn't have slaves anymore.
*  They're like, I'm going to fucking fight for what's right.
*  I'm going to fight for what's mine.
*  No!
*  They got a fucking 69 Charger, Confederate flag, bell buckle.
*  Fuck the Charger!
*  Watch the Chargers go down.
*  Don't ruin it.
*  The Logan show destroys Charger.
*  No, listen, I'm a giant Mopar fan, everybody knows that.
*  That's a dope car, but that's the Dukes of Hazard car with the Confederate flag on the
*  roof.
*  It was a 68 or a 69 Charger, I think it was a 69.
*  But that Confederate flag, do you know that show they can't have on TV anymore?
*  Dukes of Hazard.
*  It's not on TV anymore because of that flag.
*  The flag's offensive.
*  It is.
*  It is.
*  It's fucking offensive.
*  I wish it wasn't.
*  I wish we got to a point where there was no racism.
*  We can have a Confederate flag and people are like, who gives a fuck?
*  I don't know if it's going to work out that way.
*  No, it might not ever, but maybe a thousand years from now.
*  Maybe a thousand years from now.
*  Just how we go back and we read the Sumerian text.
*  A thousand years from now, they'll be so woke.
*  They'll just watch a Dukes of Hazard episode and go, oh, the first Daisy Dukes.
*  There it is.
*  This is the original Daisy Duke.
*  Or the people a thousand years ago from now were like, swastikas are cool.
*  Yeah, I was just going to say, there's a Hitler metaphor in here.
*  Oh shit.
*  Have you guys seen?
*  That went wrong.
*  Have you seen the meme of a child, there's a child with his hands over his head, leaning down like kids in the future, trying to remember for history class what happened in 2020?
*  Oh no, that's hilarious.
*  Fuck, no.
*  It's a kid going, oh my God.
*  You posted something the other day and I started following the account.
*  It was like Lil Duval, is that right?
*  Lil Duval is the best follow during the pandemic.
*  It's so funny and right on point where there's a woman going like this and it's like, what area of Revelations am I looking at now or something like that?
*  Which chapter of Revelations are we doing today?
*  My mom said this to me the other day because they're also alive right now.
*  My mom was like, in her beautiful Cleveland accent, she's like, you know what?
*  If a bunch of weird bugs start flying out of the sky, I won't be surprised.
*  And I was like, me too, mom.
*  I'm not going to be surprised either.
*  It's getting weirder every fucking day.
*  Are you optimistic?
*  Yeah.
*  You think we can pull through?
*  I think we can.
*  I think just the nature, the fact that so many people are protesting.
*  I think we're dismantling things that haven't worked for a long time and I don't know what the answers are.
*  But we're bulldozing this shit.
*  I'm hopeful that as a collective people, we will work towards cohesion and peace.
*  We've got a lot of white guilt we've got to work through.
*  These fucking videos of these people that are on their knees bowing.
*  Have you seen this?
*  Is this a church?
*  They're basically apologizing to this group of black people about all racism.
*  It's hard. It's so hard.
*  I told Ben this the other day and then he kind of laughed at me and then I realized that...
*  Sorry, I don't want to say it.
*  What are you about to say?
*  I went for a walk in my neighborhood and this was on Saturday.
*  This was when things were super heated.
*  They still are, but it was kind of like, oh my god, the Grove is on fire.
*  Mozza, one of my favorite restaurants, was gone.
*  It's charred.
*  Mozza on fire?
*  Yeah, they fucking burned it.
*  Oh no, that's one of my favorite restaurants too.
*  Well, too bad.
*  How dare you make fun of that?
*  That's the whiskey talking to you.
*  It is. I'm so sorry.
*  They'll come back.
*  Pass that whiskey.
*  I'm sad now.
*  I was walking around the Silver Lake Reservoir and I told Ben I had this...
*  Every black person I passed, I felt more love for them than I have...
*  I mean, I always feel love for everybody, that's the truth.
*  Maybe it's just awareness.
*  I just felt so aware of their road is different than mine right now.
*  I also want them to know, hey, I'm standing up for you.
*  But also, not every black person wants that.
*  They're like, get the fuck away from me.
*  So in terms of white guilt, I don't have white guilt, but I have white awareness.
*  And I feel aware.
*  And I'm trying to step carefully and not hurt anybody's feelings, because I don't want to do that.
*  Listen, you are in no way, shape or form a racist.
*  I think the problem is the idea that you are until you prove you're not.
*  I think you're a beautiful person, you're a great person.
*  Just keep doing you.
*  I'm trying, man.
*  You see black folks and you guys make eye contact and they know what the fuck is going on in the world.
*  And you know what the fuck is going on in the world.
*  Just say, what's up?
*  And they say, what's up?
*  And everybody feels good.
*  That's a real thing with people.
*  There's a weird thing when you run into people and you don't know, you go, what's up?
*  And they go, hey, what's up?
*  And everybody's good.
*  It's good for everybody.
*  That's what we all need to do.
*  We all need to do.
*  That guy's not us.
*  That cop that did that, that's not us.
*  That's a sick person.
*  That's a sick person.
*  One of the reasons why we're so angry about that man killing George Floyd is because we know in the darkest of darkest regions of all of our minds that it's humanly possible for someone to do.
*  We know that and we hope and pray it's not possible for us to do or anyone we know or anyone we love.
*  Could you imagine if that was your son?
*  Could you imagine if your son was on television leaning on this man's neck for eight minutes and 40 seconds?
*  You'd be like, what the fuck?
*  What?
*  You'd be like, what did I do wrong?
*  What did I do wrong that I made a monster?
*  Fuck!
*  Imagine watching that.
*  Imagine just freaking out while you put someone into the world that leaned on someone's neck until they died.
*  Every person.
*  And this is one of the weird parts of being a parent.
*  But also what if they propagated that mentality?
*  What if that were the thing?
*  Not to throw this into the arena, but things I've been reading are like white supremacy infiltration into the police force and that fucking terrifies me.
*  Look, any white supremacy is awful.
*  Any racism is awful.
*  But what I'm more interested in than any of that is what gets a person to be that fucked up?
*  Whether it's racist or murderous or ruthless or deceptive or stealing.
*  What gets a person?
*  That's what we need to concentrate on.
*  Instead of getting mad at the people that fuck up and do terrible shit, which is all justified, but we really need to trace this back publicly.
*  What is making a cop kill someone by leaning on his neck for 8 1⁄2 minutes?
*  Or almost 9 minutes?
*  It's a mental health issue.
*  It is!
*  It's also a developmental issue.
*  A person, when you're 35 years old, you're kind of an equation.
*  There's a lot of you that is just an accumulated gathering of experiences and your interpretation of those experiences,
*  along with your genetics, your neighborhood, your family, all the expectations people have on you.
*  Boom, here you are.
*  It's an equation.
*  Yeah, it is.
*  We all are.
*  And a huge part of that equation is the system we grew up in, which happens to be fucking racist in a lot of ways,
*  or at least has had trouble dealing with that issue from the very beginning.
*  Here's what I would say. It's not even.
*  When you have these neighborhoods that are traditionally suppressed, like when you're talking about Baltimore,
*  I had this guy, Michael Wood, on the podcast. He was a cop in Baltimore.
*  It was one of the weirdest moments of the podcast ever, where he was a cop in the early 2000s, if I remember correctly,
*  or somewhere in the 2000s.
*  He found this piece of paper that was a docket of all the crimes from the 1970s. It was all the same shit in the same areas.
*  So here he is risking his life out there with a gun, wading into crime, trying to arrest people,
*  and then he finds this piece of paper that says, this is systemic racism.
*  And then he finds out about the Red Line laws.
*  Did you ever see Do the Right Thing, Spike Lee movie?
*  Oh yeah, for sure.
*  Same exact thing.
*  A cop chokes a guy out and kills him.
*  And that's 30 years ago. I mean, obviously this is going on hundreds of years, but the point is...
*  Look, I know a lot of cops, and a lot of them are great people, but they're a lot like soldiers.
*  It's not a normal request to ask people to be life or death every day.
*  And when you ask people to be life or death every day for a job, you better make sure that you get a Navy SEAL.
*  You better make sure you get an Army Ranger. You better make sure you get someone who has gone through...
*  You don't want that, man. You gotta read the horrible shit. They killed babies, bro.
*  They were ruthless.
*  Bad choice, man.
*  Yeah, they used to roast babies over the fire, slowly, in front of their parents.
*  Difficult context for those people.
*  Not a good thing.
*  If they caught you, they tortured you. They were the kings of torture.
*  I'd like a quick death.
*  Yeah, you don't want a command sheet death.
*  Me personally.
*  I'm telling you, Empire of the Summer Moon. It's an incredible book. Just get the audiobook.
*  Listen to the first week of it, and you'll be like, holy fuck.
*  Just take it with you when you drive to the store or whatever the fuck you do.
*  Because I just go to the store.
*  Have you been going out? Have you been hiding?
*  Yeah, I've been doing stuff. I've been building furniture.
*  Are you starting to move back into society again?
*  Yeah, I hang out with my friends.
*  The coronavirus seems to be less of an issue?
*  Okay, I'm cognizant of the coronavirus.
*  The only people I know that have gotten it are in New York.
*  I work out. I walk. I go to the grocery store.
*  I go to my friend's house, and I build furniture.
*  You're building furniture?
*  Yeah, I'm building some furniture.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  Are you building it, like, do you have a design?
*  Yeah, yeah. I have a walnut shelf I'm building that goes under my TV.
*  Are you a carpenter?
*  No.
*  How do you know how to do this?
*  You figure it out. It's not that hard.
*  Really? That's so cool.
*  Yeah, it's not that hard.
*  I mean, my friends have the tools, so I'm really lucky to use them.
*  Like, I don't own that stuff.
*  But, yeah, I mean, it's not that hard.
*  And it's really gratifying to make your own stuff.
*  And that's something I've really gotten into just to, you know, keep myself entertained and busy.
*  Yeah, well, that's a good thing. That's a good way of using your energy.
*  Your energy comes this fork in the road where all of a sudden, live touring, stop, can't go anywhere.
*  Well, Joe, it haunts me when I was on here with Gary because we were literally talking about,
*  what does the world look like without live music?
*  And I'm like, bullshit, you can never replace live music, and here we are.
*  And I've been doing these live shows.
*  I started doing Zoom sessions on my website as supplemental income and also just to have that experience with people
*  because any live stream I do is just, you're literally fucking looking at yourself and then comments underneath.
*  And I don't get to have this experience where I'm sitting across from someone even digitally where, you know, it's like...
*  Nailed it.
*  What is that?
*  Didn't nail it. Totally didn't nail it.
*  Just want a lighter, cave person.
*  Love you.
*  To everyone watching, I didn't catch that.
*  Or do you want to use a joint?
*  No, I see this is...
*  Dad grass.
*  Yeah, this is... what is this?
*  That's my dad grass.
*  That's some bullshit designed by the man to make you sleepy.
*  Hey, it doesn't make you sleepy, it makes you cool and chill.
*  You know what I mean? It's like a blend so I don't get completely...
*  Don't hurt me, Joe.
*  Put that down.
*  Joe, don't hurt Ben.
*  I will bow to this.
*  No, no, no. Let me smoke my...
*  Oh my God, there's a joint off.
*  Jamie, there's a joint off.
*  Here, you smoke a little bit of this, I'll smoke a little bit of that.
*  Split screen, split screen.
*  Boys are firing up the joints.
*  I haven't smoked anything, but I will later.
*  I'm already so drunk.
*  Look, we all have an obligation.
*  To show that...
*  Smoking pot and drinking whiskey is not for bad people.
*  We're all good people, we're nice to each other, we love each other.
*  We get high together.
*  We really do.
*  This is so much fun, I love you too.
*  I'm so happy.
*  When you texted me, first of all, when I saw on Instagram...
*  Sorry.
*  That was hyper speed.
*  I literally said, oh shit, and I immediately texted you.
*  We were like, ah, let's just take this slow.
*  Fuck you.
*  We go easy, we dip our toe in and we're fucking tsunami.
*  15 minutes, Joe tech.
*  Okay, it goes like this.
*  Ben and I came by this honestly.
*  We love each other, we love our music together, we're great friends.
*  Two months ago, we're not speaking.
*  We weren't just speaking two months ago.
*  Mushrooms for everyone.
*  And then we started playing together and it's like, it's too good.
*  It's too good, the feeling that we have when we play together.
*  And we were going to do what we failed this week because...
*  Are you kidding me right now?
*  I'll do it.
*  Count me in.
*  Backtrack for a second.
*  We're going to do a little podcast this week with each other and just post a couple songs
*  and it was like a big deal for us and it still is.
*  We're going to do it but obviously this week fucking blew up and it wasn't really lined up.
*  But 10 or 15 minutes after we posted on our Honey Honey page that we were going to post some podcast songs,
*  you texted and were like, let's do a podcast!
*  And we were like, oh my god!
*  And it was just like, mew! Like hyper speed.
*  I got bummed out when you guys stopped working together.
*  We were too, man.
*  I didn't like it.
*  But we needed to do it.
*  It's okay.
*  Life takes weird turns. It's like a river.
*  It goes down the mountains.
*  It's got to take the right path.
*  Want some of this?
*  No, it's fine.
*  Want some of this?
*  Yeah.
*  Ben?
*  It's magic bubble gum.
*  That's a big one.
*  I love that poster in the bathroom.
*  It's skinnered and then it says, the stones.
*  It says, the greatest rock and roll band on earth.
*  Isn't that crazy?
*  That was what you called them back then.
*  That was their bias.
*  Well, for a good reason, man.
*  The stones are interesting.
*  In that there's a lot of stone songs that people forgot.
*  There's not a...
*  Like there's some bands, you just want a microdose?
*  There's some bands that...
*  That's not a microdose, but do you.
*  Listen, we got to make this legal, ladies and gentlemen.
*  We got to make this legal.
*  What are you talking about? What legal?
*  We're just eating birch wood gum.
*  It's from a birch tree.
*  Dear God.
*  Yeah, just shut it down if it gets...
*  Don't put any... hey.
*  I'm going to put that back.
*  I love pez.
*  We got to protect people.
*  Protect people from assholes.
*  And we got to let people do the shit they enjoy doing.
*  Joe, we love you so much.
*  I love you guys too.
*  All things considered, the world is in a crazy place.
*  And this is one of the best feelings I've had in a very long time.
*  Well, I always enjoy you guys.
*  I enjoy seeing you.
*  I enjoy listening to your music when you're not around.
*  I listen to you guys all the time.
*  I listen to you guys when I work out.
*  I do.
*  I listen to you guys when we're on trips.
*  You guys are cool as fuck.
*  Thank you.
*  Hey, we listen to you too.
*  Music is an interesting thing.
*  You guys put words together that change the state of people's consciousness.
*  You put tones together.
*  You have rhythms and sounds.
*  It invades people's minds.
*  It changes who they are.
*  And some songs are really indicative of the times.
*  I think it was Snoop Dogg had Marvin Gaye...
*  It was a live version of...
*  Brother, brother, brother.
*  What's that song?
*  Damn, Joe Rogan.
*  It's a trick.
*  What's going on, Marvin Gaye.
*  You listen to it and you're like, wow.
*  I don't know what it was like back then.
*  I was too young. I don't remember.
*  But I hope it's better now.
*  I feel like it is.
*  I feel like there's something about these marches.
*  You've got to take the looting out of the picture.
*  Because I think if you want to follow the ideology of determinism,
*  however you got there,
*  there's a combination of a bunch of things
*  that are probably out of your control.
*  Who you are and where you're from,
*  who your dad was and who your mom was.
*  Hey, you're a bang.
*  But there's something about when you hear a song from 1971
*  or some shit like that,
*  and you realize we're still dealing with the same shit in 2020
*  that really makes you worry that we're not going to get it right.
*  I didn't think you were going to go that way with it.
*  No, really. No bullshit.
*  I think there's beauty in the fact that everybody's gotten together
*  and they're rising up against it.
*  And they realize this is enough.
*  It's enough. It's enough.
*  It's so enough.
*  It's so enough.
*  But you've got to worry.
*  You've got to worry that shit will go sideways when you see the looting.
*  This is like, there's a lot of it,
*  there's like this weird battle going on.
*  A battle between logic and anger.
*  You know, people raise well and people raise poorly.
*  People are mad and people are happy and everyone's together.
*  And a big soup of equilibrium,
*  trying to find your way to the fucking,
*  to the steady ground, trying to figure it all out.
*  Most people just don't.
*  And we're involved in that as much as we're involved in any other aspect of this.
*  We're all just trying to figure out life.
*  All these things are information.
*  And yeah, of course, how could we know?
*  You have no idea what's going to happen.
*  But it's all information to apply to the situation.
*  People are looting.
*  Okay, this, among a range of factions,
*  there's economic problems and we've got to fucking deal with them.
*  Yeah, it's a perfect storm.
*  Well, I think the thing is, like, we have to try to find each other's perspectives.
*  And that's really hard for some people to do.
*  And one of the really wonderful people I spoke to this weekend
*  really gave me an insight that I never would have had.
*  And this gentleman lives in Texas.
*  And he had something to say about, I posted a good cop video.
*  I posted a video of a cop praying with a black woman.
*  And it was really beautiful.
*  I saw that video.
*  And I got a lot of crap for it.
*  I got a lot of heat.
*  And I'm trying to find the middle ground of some of my also police force friends that,
*  actually one of our really good friends texted today to talk about how horrified he was
*  that his city had gassed people.
*  And he's a lieutenant colonel of a very big city, retired now.
*  And he said he was depressed and he didn't know what to do.
*  And I got to think about him because he's a good man.
*  And in that respect, this gentleman who reached out to me very kindly,
*  and I'm so grateful for it, said,
*  here's why I don't like you posting that video of that happy cop scenario.
*  He said, because I grew up in poverty.
*  I slept in the bed with my dad till I was 10 because we didn't have another bed.
*  There were holes in our walls.
*  We didn't have food.
*  He said cops weren't playing basketball with me in my neighborhood.
*  If anything, I would see them beat up my friends and I couldn't do anything about it.
*  He said, I'm angry and I don't want to see that right now.
*  And I really respect that.
*  That was a perspective I didn't have.
*  And he also said, hey, I've done things in my life that I wasn't proud of.
*  All I could think of in my life was getting out of this place that I lived in.
*  And he admitted to stealing things, theft, and to get his life in a place that he needed to get out of.
*  And he's out.
*  And it was a perspective for looting that I never would have had.
*  Looting is mania at this point.
*  I'm not sure.
*  It's so many things.
*  It's just a fucking vomitus of either people trying to cause trouble, anarchy, people just trying to be heard.
*  I thought it was an interesting outlook on it, which is a guy framing it saying these are people who can't take part in consumer economy.
*  So this is, you know, a theory.
*  It's a great framing.
*  Yeah, and that should be recognized.
*  I don't think that's the answer, but I see you.
*  And that's the thing.
*  It's like these people want to be seen.
*  They want to be hugged.
*  Yeah, and I want to fucking hug them.
*  Everybody wants to be loved.
*  You know who Robert Sapolsky is?
*  You ever heard of him?
*  He's a professor at Stanford.
*  And he's done some really interesting work on primates and baboons and that toxoplasma shit that we were talking about before.
*  But one of the things that he was talking about, I had a podcast with him a couple years back, and he was saying that he's a really interesting guy.
*  He was saying that in the future, he thinks that one of the biggest mistakes that they'll look back on with us is that we didn't understand how a human being comes to be the person they are today and how many factors are out of their control.
*  And we try to pretend that everybody is that.
*  I'm paraphrasing greatly, but it was basically that human beings are responsible for their own actions and that collectively we all influence each other's actions.
*  We're all different people around each other.
*  We're different people.
*  It's one of the things that's the most important thing about having really good friends, like really good, important, awesome friends that literally make you better just being around them.
*  They make you feel better.
*  They make you love better.
*  You become a nicer person if you have exceptional friends.
*  And that we're all weirdly connected, like weirdly.
*  And we don't understand it.
*  So when something like this happens, everybody's like, let's march the street.
*  Like, yes, let's march.
*  Like, we feel good that we're all out there together.
*  We feel good that we all agree.
*  We feel good.
*  And then there's some people that disagree and there's some people that say stupid shit.
*  There's some people that get canceled.
*  We're all trying to right this ship.
*  We're all like, just fucking stay in the boat.
*  Stay in the boat.
*  We're all like holding on the boat of civilization.
*  We're going to be OK.
*  We love each other.
*  We're going to do it.
*  We don't have to worry maybe.
*  There's plenty of food.
*  There's plenty of roofs.
*  We can do this.
*  Plenty of toilet paper.
*  We just got to get.
*  This one dude's going to Mars.
*  We got to get the game right.
*  We're going to him.
*  We got to get the game right.
*  Right?
*  We can't like, some people can't start the game.
*  If you play Monopoly and a dude starts out with a billion dollars, that's fucked up, man.
*  I just played Monopoly.
*  You got a billion dollars?
*  It was horrible.
*  I just played Monopoly on mushrooms like a month ago before I had to do the sober thing.
*  And my one friend was dominating the whole game and I was getting more and more bitter and angry.
*  And she had so many fucking hotels.
*  That bitch.
*  She killed us.
*  You got to accept the fact that that's just how the game works.
*  Don't hate the player.
*  But the irony of it is like, oh God.
*  OK, noted.
*  Got it.
*  Because I'm like, every time she's like, I'll buy that.
*  I was like, bitch.
*  That fucking bitch.
*  Why she don't need that?
*  It's a basic game.
*  It's a basic game.
*  But is it?
*  Is it?
*  But is it?
*  Deep.
*  Super deep.
*  I need to own some property.
*  One day.
*  One day.
*  That's the weirdest thing about all of us.
*  We just thrust into this game.
*  We realized we were playing it while we're up and running.
*  We're up and running.
*  Learning how to walk.
*  Keep going.
*  What's going on?
*  You're in the game.
*  What kind of game?
*  So the rat race.
*  It's the rat race.
*  The guy, the gentleman who, I swear to God, I'm having deja vu.
*  I feel like I talked about this last time I was here.
*  But the guy who wrote Rich Dad Poor Dad created a game called, it's like the rat race.
*  And it's how you economically get out of your debt and your spiraling investments or whatever.
*  And then you like get to the big leagues.
*  I mean, that's America.
*  You know, like that's the trajectory.
*  That's America that we like.
*  That's the eagle.
*  But it's not exactly.
*  That's the eagle.
*  And the eagle is a fucking vulture.
*  The rock 24.
*  In real life.
*  The rock 2024 is going to take care of all of that.
*  I don't know what you're talking about.
*  This eagle vulture bullshit.
*  I'm going to be gross for a minute.
*  I just want him to pick me up.
*  He could definitely pick you up.
*  I just want to be held.
*  He could pick you up and probably not even know he picked you up.
*  Great. That's all I want.
*  I don't want to be weird.
*  Who's this person?
*  I'm a tall girl.
*  And like, you know, it's like I just want to just pick me up.
*  I'll bullshit aside.
*  I take a lot of inspiration from.
*  Close on.
*  Close on.
*  Your friends.
*  We all get it.
*  We're all just friends.
*  I take inspiration from that guy.
*  He's like legitimately I'm joking around earlier about what I said, but I'm also being honest.
*  I believe what I'm saying.
*  No, I think he's a wonderful person.
*  Unusual.
*  He's unusual.
*  I shouldn't objectify him as a big strong man.
*  He's also a really good person.
*  Fucking sexist.
*  I'm an asshole and I'm sorry for telling everyone.
*  In this space, you've heteronormative-ed him.
*  I think it worked.
*  We're going with it.
*  No, that's not a fucking new word.
*  That's real.
*  No, I almost just.
*  Heteronormative.
*  It's an important part of gender theory, you piece of shit.
*  I'm with you.
*  Write another thing that rhymes, you fucking asshole.
*  I'll write a letter of apology.
*  I'm sorry.
*  Part of the problem.
*  I am part of the problem.
*  White silence is white violence.
*  We're going to be okay.
*  I don't know.
*  I hope so.
*  We're going to be okay.
*  We all want everybody to be okay.
*  We just got to get over this, man, as a species, the human species.
*  We got to get over all our ripples.
*  Yeah, the sensitivities though, that thing is like, you're this or you're that.
*  The superlative talk is going to fucking get us nowhere.
*  I saw a t-shirt that I loved and it was in a photograph and it said, not left, not right, but forward.
*  And like this whole bipartisan stuff, like you can't, if you can just take a minute and listen to each other with an open heart.
*  100%.
*  It's so hard for people, but it's really not.
*  It's really fucking not that hard.
*  No one's taught them how to do it.
*  That's why it's not hard.
*  It's hard to learn that.
*  It is.
*  We mimic, and everything else, and everything else, like if you want to learn how to play guitar, you learn from people who knew how to play the guitar.
*  If you want to learn how to do archery, like Gina Davis, you learn from people who know how to do archery.
*  We don't apply that to how you view the world.
*  Well, people can't accept things.
*  Our parents and not everybody initially has a great hand when it comes to them.
*  You said earlier, it just makes me think about us.
*  We had a terrible time communicating with each other.
*  Fucking sucked!
*  That wasn't easy.
*  We went to therapy?
*  It took us 12 years.
*  Who knows if we're over?
*  We could fucking go down after this.
*  Please don't.
*  Let's not.
*  Let's keep it going.
*  Keep it going.
*  Bam.
*  Bam.
*  Titties.
*  Titties!
*  No, that's not mine.
*  That's yours.
*  I don't want that one.
*  You take bam, I'll take titties.
*  It just made me think what you're saying.
*  It is not easy.
*  It's something that it's taken a long time and experience for us to be able to even communicate.
*  I feel like you set me up to, like our relationship has set me up to face adversity in the world,
*  because we have fought so much, but we love each other so much.
*  And at the end of the day, we just want to hear each other out.
*  And that's the thing with people that are aggressive or disagreeing with your rhetoric.
*  They just want to be heard, and so do you.
*  So, with that said, it's a time to have as much patience as you can possibly muster with
*  healthy boundaries.
*  But I really have gotten a lot out of speaking to people on social media lately, literally
*  speaking, not just comments.
*  And I'm learning and I'm growing and I'm grateful and I've fallen on my fucking face.
*  People telling me things that I never would have thought of.
*  It's so humbling.
*  Because ultimately, I want to help what's happening.
*  I don't want to see another black person get murdered by a police officer in a video ever
*  again, as well as all of the other things that everybody wants to talk about.
*  We're all coming up.
*  I think we all agree.
*  We do.
*  No one disagrees.
*  Exactly.
*  I think about this time, I think everybody's looking at this and going, yeah, there's obviously
*  problems.
*  There's real problems.
*  We're seeing it in the cops that are treating the people that are peacefully protesting.
*  Like, you can't do that.
*  No one's doing anything wrong.
*  Here's what's crazy.
*  They're letting people loot, but they're fucking shooting tear gas at people that are just
*  standing there saying the system's fucked.
*  Yeah, that's the information.
*  There's so many details.
*  We were speaking earlier about police officers and their instability, their mental dysfunctional
*  aspects, and that needs to be addressed in an acute manner.
*  It's not a product at all.
*  People aren't sleeping.
*  We just expect them to be superhuman.
*  Yeah.
*  They're not human.
*  And that's our fault too.
*  If you are in credit card debt, you're freaking out and you can get fucking therapy.
*  But if you're a cop and you're seeing people get shot in the face every day, you're like,
*  suck it up, pig.
*  We barely pay attention.
*  We barely pay attention to them.
*  So when they go hate wire, you know, those three guys that sat around while that guy
*  kneeled on that dude's neck, like, what do you charge those guys with?
*  You know, there's been a real movement to say they should-
*  I wonder how old they were when they joined the force.
*  Like, were they kids when they joined the force?
*  It's like a fraternity.
*  Are they that hateful?
*  It's a hundred percent a thing that when you're in it, you're surrounded by people who are
*  there to protect you if shit hits the fan.
*  There's a brotherhood that's involved in the police force.
*  If I had to guess what's wrong with the police force but what is right about, like, the Navy
*  SEALs, is that one of them, it's really difficult to get into.
*  Like, if you meet a person and that person is a Navy SEAL, that motherfucker can take some shit.
*  He has a strong mind.
*  He's figured out a way to navigate the maze of consciousness to go further than most people are
*  capable of doing.
*  But that's not everybody who's a cop.
*  So there's a lot of people who are cops who are just bitches.
*  They're just bitches.
*  And they just got a job as a cop.
*  And they have to work with guys like The Rock!
*  They're right alongside The Rock!
*  And they're bitches!
*  No, but you're so right.
*  There's a validation in that badge.
*  There's a validation.
*  And if it's not actually a genuine part of your integrity, then that's a fucking scary place for all of us.
*  It's one of the hardest jobs the world's ever known.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a really, really hard job being a cop.
*  Big fan of Killer Mike's review board idea, like, bringing back review boards where the community, like, you know.
*  I've never disagreed with anything Killer Mike's ever said, ever.
*  He should be president.
*  Did you see Obama's thing?
*  He's so powerful.
*  It's like the way he speaks, I did not want to be here and I don't want to do this.
*  Like, you're like, God damn.
*  You see his TV show?
*  Yeah.
*  That's who he is.
*  There's no filter.
*  That's who he is.
*  I really, really hope I get to meet him sometime.
*  I'll introduce you.
*  I will die.
*  Next time those guys are here, like, I think we're supposed to do something.
*  I love both those dudes.
*  They're so important in this time.
*  There's no bullshit.
*  There's no bullshit.
*  If you want Killer Mike, it's right there.
*  Killer Mike's right there.
*  There's no filters.
*  Positive, negative, good, bad, son of a cop.
*  Talks about, you know, the Second Amendment and the need for handguns.
*  But it's also super progressive.
*  He and I both were like, let's get Bernie Sanders in this thing.
*  Let's see what the fuck happens.
*  If you get someone who redistributes wealth, we're finding out now there's trillions of dollars.
*  We just want to fix a fucking REI.
*  We're going to fucking bail out Starbucks.
*  We found all this money.
*  Got to save REI for fuck's sake.
*  Did you see that where he's making porn where people are teaching people to fix their home appliances and stuff like that?
*  He was like, I'm going to make a series of YouTube videos so people can learn how to be handy around their home.
*  Killer Mike, that is.
*  And he's like, but people don't pay attention to anything except porn.
*  So I'm going to make a bunch of porn that you see how to fix your sink.
*  It's so good.
*  Porn is like human, right?
*  What is human?
*  Human is the weird, the contrast of what we want you to believe, but what we really are.
*  Porn is the best example of that.
*  How many people are at work talking about porn?
*  How about zero?
*  It might be like the same amount of people that catch Corona and die.
*  It ruins your sex life psychologically because there's no correlation between that and real life sex.
*  And like just like from the digital stimulation, it's like really messes people up.
*  I think that's like saying like whiskey ruined your life.
*  False.
*  No, you ruined your life, stupid.
*  Don't blame whiskey.
*  Yeah, don't blame your porn addiction.
*  Whiskey's been great for me.
*  Me and whiskey have had a great relationship.
*  We made it work.
*  Yeah, we made it work.
*  That's true.
*  We had a good time.
*  100%.
*  There's probably a lot of dudes out there that understand the abracadabra of porn and they want to stay on the outside edges of the dangerous fear of control.
*  And they just hang in the background.
*  I mean, I think porn is like heroin.
*  You should be able to do it, but you probably shouldn't.
*  And you're not going to be able to stop.
*  Keep it together.
*  That should be your goal.
*  You will never stop.
*  Keep it together.
*  It all comes down to accountability.
*  Period.
*  I love whiskey.
*  It's weird how many people are fucking on video.
*  If you really stop and think about it, it's like it's doing it right now.
*  It's barely even unusual.
*  It's barely unusual.
*  The amount of sheer porn.
*  Like I used to have a joke about it was like, why are they still making porn?
*  Has anybody ever seen it all?
*  Could they stop now?
*  Let us catch up.
*  You got to say the country.
*  I want to die.
*  I'm thinking I missed the hottest scene ever.
*  Because it's too much goddamn content, you gluttons.
*  Just out there fucking every day filming it.
*  Never enough. It's like music though.
*  I mean, across the board, we're getting schooled right now.
*  Like all of those quote unquote comforts or whatever we're going to funnel our energy into.
*  All that shit is like fading out.
*  We're being restructured.
*  And in the matrix.
*  I think we're learning how to be adults.
*  We're learning what's important.
*  Like who's far enough ahead on this weird race that you can stop and go, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
*  Let's stop and work out the resources.
*  We're going to eat.
*  We're running too far.
*  This is not necessary.
*  We're getting crazy.
*  We only live to be 100.
*  What are we doing?
*  Let's be nice to each other.
*  Shit.
*  Why are we mad?
*  There's plenty of food.
*  There's plenty of food.
*  It just needs to be distributed.
*  There's plenty of money.
*  We just need to figure out how to fix it.
*  What do you think that is?
*  The panic.
*  And I really say this honestly.
*  Like, no, I don't want to be raped and murdered.
*  I don't want my home to be invaded.
*  I'm so glad you showed up here.
*  But what is this need to jump over each other, take all the toilet paper?
*  Because we're in competition.
*  Right.
*  But more so.
*  I want to know.
*  But that's the whole thing.
*  The whole thing is competition.
*  Competition for what?
*  To survive?
*  For resources.
*  So are we mad maxing this right now?
*  For attention, for money, for prominence.
*  We've always done that.
*  Well, it's what you were talking about earlier with these fears that are kind of buried deep
*  in our genetics.
*  We're still dealing with software that's 100,000 years old.
*  I also think there's two things playing out at the same time.
*  There's this sexual thing where human beings are attracted to each other and you're trying
*  to figure out how to choose mates.
*  And then there's this whatever intrigues you thing.
*  There's like you want people to like you.
*  If you're gay, you want gay dudes to like you.
*  If you're straight, you want a straight woman to like you.
*  And you also want to figure out this thing.
*  This thing that you're doing.
*  What's the thing you're doing?
*  Are you playing tennis?
*  What do you do, man?
*  What do you do?
*  I love tennis.
*  What do you do?
*  You're a chess master?
*  What's your fucking expression?
*  What's your mode of expression?
*  And through your singing, particularly you, you're right here, my friend.
*  I know who you are because there's a way you sing where you figure out a way to get it all out in these tones.
*  And that's what makes singing so exciting for people who can't sing and for people who love to listen.
*  There's a thing where they're getting it's like you're figuring out you're figuring out a way to use a special lens to look right into a person and find out like what is that person when they're at their lowest?
*  What is it when they're at their highest?
*  And what is this when when they're really passionate about something?
*  What is that expression?
*  And it comes through in this weird melody, this weird weird sound that you can make with your voice.
*  But what you're doing is you're showing people who you are.
*  You're showing people who you are through the sound that you can make and these words and this.
*  And we use those sounds and those words as this like translator to figure out what what what you're really feeling and what you're really thinking.
*  And then when it's wrapped up in your lyrics, the thing that's fascinating about is how you guys are so tight and you love each other so much.
*  And like you're putting words together and you're singing these words and you're all putting it together in this music like L.A.
*  River is one of my favorite songs ever.
*  It really is.
*  And one of the reasons why is because it's so it's so indicative about the beauty.
*  I thought I saw a body in the weeds.
*  That's a part of a beautiful song.
*  I thought I saw a body in the weeds.
*  Do you want to talk about the fact that it was put on?
*  We had this great moment where this TV show used the song in this like romantic marriage.
*  It was a wedding.
*  And it just showed you they don't listen to the fucking song.
*  That song is L.A.
*  It was a wedding scene.
*  Yeah.
*  I thought I saw a body in the weeds.
*  I do. I do.
*  Had to hop a chain link fence.
*  I went down to the banks of the L.A. River.
*  Had to hop a chain link fence.
*  Hey, we got a prop to Ben Jaffe.
*  He wrote that song like fourth quarter of Billy Jack when we were doing that record.
*  We were putting all our songs together.
*  And like he wrote that very quickly and brought it to the table.
*  And it was beautiful.
*  And you know what else also is like when you guys had just moved here, you know, so this part of you saying, oh, I love my new home.
*  Yeah.
*  And, you know, I hate want to abandon L.A.
*  But I hate when things get really big and they're run by people who haven't done mushrooms.
*  It bothers me.
*  Well, how do we get the mushrooms, Joe?
*  How do we do it?
*  I don't think they know what they're talking about.
*  I really don't.
*  I don't think they're projecting the right.
*  You heard all of them.
*  I don't even want to say anybody's name.
*  Get your shit together.
*  This is what I think.
*  I think we all need to understand there's a lot of messages that can be conveyed right now.
*  And you can't just constantly worry about what your side thinks.
*  We got to figure out some way to get through this.
*  We're all better off than we were before it started.
*  And it can be done.
*  It can be done.
*  They can all do it.
*  It can be done.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's being done in a lot of places.
*  It is.
*  This is a fucking breakthrough moment.
*  Although looting and the riots, it'll be in history.
*  It's terrible.
*  It's horrible that it happened.
*  But this explosion that happened, we got a real shot at moving things forward in a really powerful way.
*  We got a real shot right now.
*  Well, when people are uncomfortable and we are really uncomfortable, that's when things move.
*  Yes.
*  Because you have to, there's action.
*  You can't just sit in it and no one likes to be uncomfortable.
*  So what the fuck are you going to do?
*  100% with everything in life.
*  Like if you have a bad moment in life, it feels terrible.
*  And that is life's way.
*  If you're playing this weird game of good and bad and love and hate and what feels amazing, what feels terrible, you follow that.
*  You follow whatever that is.
*  You follow whatever that feeling is.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's back to Joey Diaz though a little bit too.
*  It's like you have these monumental moments in your life and how do you grow from them?
*  Yes.
*  And I have no disrespect, but I've always had a really hard time relating to people that are like, never been through anything difficult.
*  Life's been great.
*  I'm just sort of like just ghosting.
*  But you know what?
*  Which probably isn't even true.
*  But this is what I think we all need to consider.
*  It's not their call.
*  They didn't say, hey, I don't want Suzanne to have this fucking dope ass life in Beverly Hills.
*  Fuck that shit.
*  I don't live in Beverly Hills and I'm on unemployment.
*  Let's be clear.
*  Move that bitch to Van Nuys.
*  Move that bitch to Van Nuys and let's do some cocaine.
*  I know where my limit is with my unemployment.
*  But you know what I'm saying?
*  Musicians.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  I do know what you're saying.
*  It's not your call.
*  It's not their call.
*  Yes, idealism.
*  Paris Hilton didn't want to be Paris Hilton.
*  She was thrust into this.
*  Wow, remember her?
*  More ways than one.
*  Of course I do.
*  That's why I brought her up.
*  No, I know, but I'm like, wow, that's a name.
*  I saw Zoolander.
*  I told you.
*  I saw Zoolander last night.
*  I told you.
*  A little cameo.
*  I saw last night.
*  It was amazing.
*  It awakened me.
*  Can we talk about 21 Jump Street?
*  I hate to say this because it's like counter, it's almost like counter competitive, which
*  is a lot of what America is.
*  There's some weird competition that fuels innovation.
*  But I think it's like anything else.
*  You should only go so fast.
*  If you're going around a racetrack, you should only go as fast as you can go without sliding
*  off the road and slamming into the fucking trees.
*  Right?
*  But it can be done.
*  It's been done.
*  You can navigate it.
*  And I think we need to figure out how much gas we need to give life.
*  And if your objective needs to be to get around it fast, that isn't the only, we're so driven
*  into that mentality.
*  Yeah.
*  Sometimes it's nice to just have a nice drive.
*  Cruising.
*  What a nice tree.
*  A nice drive.
*  Especially in the convertible.
*  I love driving.
*  It's fucking chilling, man.
*  Yeah.
*  I've been really excited to drive, but also you can't stop and pee anywhere.
*  So you can't go too far for me as a lady.
*  I was like, I want to drive with PCH.
*  But I've done it.
*  And then I was like, oh my God, I have to pee.
*  And there's nowhere to pee.
*  I wish it was safe.
*  A she-wee.
*  I wish it was safe to drive on mushrooms.
*  I wish it was like 100%.
*  It's like Starbucks.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Go ahead.
*  Walk on mushrooms.
*  I'm fine with that.
*  But if people said no, it's actually statistically been proven that you operate faster and more
*  coherent while on mushrooms.
*  So please.
*  Yeah.
*  What's going on in Denver?
*  By the way, I'm Pete.
*  It's decriminalized?
*  Go ahead, Pete.
*  I'm gonna.
*  Moving on.
*  Excuse me.
*  I believe they're voting on it.
*  Oh, so it's still up in the air.
*  I believe, right?
*  Is it okay if we turn the AC down a little bit?
*  Is that okay?
*  Impossible.
*  Impossible.
*  We're going to light a fire in this room, Ben Jaffe.
*  What are you scared of?
*  I'm fine with that.
*  Scared of marijuana?
*  You know what?
*  When I smoke something, it, I get, brr.
*  Yeah man, that's what it's for.
*  What's that?
*  This is 75 degrees in here?
*  That's an in-ship, right, Jamie?
*  I'm just saying.
*  Just saying, bro.
*  No way.
*  Come on.
*  Listen.
*  I just want to say, even though I'm embarrassed about this, but Jamie and I, we did an NAD
*  drip the other day and he got there faster than me.
*  First time.
*  I beat him.
*  He beat me.
*  Dang.
*  Smoked him, actually.
*  I didn't realize.
*  He beat me by like four minutes, right?
*  Four solid minutes.
*  Way, it's like five times faster than I've ever done it.
*  Yeah, he went full out.
*  I don't know exactly what that is, but it seems.
*  It's some ridiculous thing that we do every week and I've been, this is what's interesting
*  about Jamie.
*  It's like we, there's a thing we do, it's called an NAD drip.
*  I forget what it's called.
*  I forget the actual scientific terminology.
*  But it's basically some, what would be the best way to describe it?
*  I don't want to fuck this up.
*  What is it?
*  What is NAD specifically?
*  I want to Wikipedia this.
*  I don't want to ruin it.
*  I want the real information.
*  But the idea behind it is it helps your immune system, it helps your body recover.
*  So this is a drip as an intravenous?
*  Yeah, yeah, IV.
*  And also I do an IV vitamin bag and Jamie and I start doing this every week.
*  Dang.
*  Here it is.
*  It feels amazing, man.
*  NAD is helpful for individuals undergoing therapy for substance abuse and addiction
*  recovery.
*  This treatment reduces cravings and withdrawal symptoms, provides energy to the body and
*  boosts brain regeneration.
*  NAD IV treatments can assist with addiction recovery.
*  But there's some other benefits too.
*  That's just one of them.
*  But it is really good for that apparently.
*  It's really good for addiction recovery.
*  So it's a compound, a synthetic compound?
*  Yeah, I guess it must be, right?
*  Right.
*  Synthetic's a weird word.
*  It's like organic.
*  Like what's organic?
*  Is your piss organic?
*  Here's a bottle of organic piss.
*  Thank you.
*  If you have antibiotics, is your piss organic?
*  I'm not sure.
*  You might be a fraudster.
*  Shit.
*  What was that?
*  Words are confusing, Joe.
*  I don't know.
*  There's a lot of them.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the problem.
*  They're hard to pin down.
*  That's what the Buddhists say.
*  That's what the Buddhists say.
*  They're like most problems, it's with words.
*  You're right.
*  And they're right.
*  That is what it is, right?
*  It's like, that's what I was saying earlier.
*  Words convey intent.
*  That's what they're supposed to do.
*  I want to know what you think.
*  I want to know if you think mean or if you're just making a mistake in the way you communicate
*  what you think.
*  Well, yeah, and I'll say I don't know if words convey intent because they're usually not
*  that nuanced.
*  No.
*  They convey an agreement, which is, okay, this is whatever the fuck this thing is called.
*  Right.
*  Here's a microphone.
*  That's a rat.
*  This is a skunk.
*  Exactly.
*  That's a tree.
*  Intent is much more difficult to communicate, especially talking about digital communication.
*  I need to see you, how your body moves, how you're looking at me, all this shit.
*  For sure.
*  Yeah, we all, I mean, that's the thing.
*  That's why the threat of being canceled is so scary for people, right?
*  We don't ever want people to be mad at us because if we did something wrong and people
*  are mad at us, if it makes sense, we're like, oh my God, I made a mistake and everyone knows.
*  Ah, I got no friends.
*  But we got to be real careful with what we get mad at and what we don't get mad at.
*  And here's a great example that fucking everyone, I'm not taking credit for this thought.
*  Everyone has had this thought.
*  It is so fucking insane that you could get arrested for opening your business just a
*  couple of weeks ago and you don't get arrested for looting that very same business.
*  Last week or fucking Friday night, you're like, what happened?
*  You were going to put that guy in jail.
*  What hits close to home for me is Long Beach, 10th planet, 10th planet Jiu-Jitsu, Long Beach.
*  I never trained there, but it's in a 10th planet family.
*  10th planet Jiu-Jitsu, I started out in Hollywood and then now they're in downtown LA, but there's
*  a bunch of them.
*  My brother, Eddie Bravo, has like, I don't know how many gyms he has all over the world,
*  but one of them just burned to the ground in Long Beach.
*  For no reason, for no reason.
*  That sucks.
*  You know?
*  Laws are made of words.
*  Words don't make sense.
*  That doesn't make sense.
*  What doesn't make sense is that anybody's frustration bounces off the wall of reality
*  to the point where people get victimized that had nothing to do with your pain.
*  That's not good.
*  Yeah, there's a lot of friendly fire happening right now.
*  I think we all want a lot of the same things.
*  And in that respect, I'm looking for my Orbitz gum because I'd like to chew it.
*  But in that respect, you have such a solid point.
*  The ridiculousness of the logic is like, it's fucking overwhelming.
*  Everyone's kind of saying the same thing, but they're still fighting.
*  You're like, okay.
*  Someone needs to get on television and tell the looters and tell all the people that have
*  stole shit, we forgive you.
*  Let's start from scratch.
*  Let's let it go.
*  Yeah.
*  You fucked up.
*  You got caught up in this crazy wave.
*  And a lot of people say, fuck that, they need to pay.
*  Maybe they do.
*  Maybe they do.
*  Maybe they do.
*  But is that better for everybody?
*  It's better for everybody is everybody realized what the fuck just happened.
*  We collectively lost our marbles.
*  As a society, America collectively lost its marbles.
*  Well, and there's some marbles that have been missing the whole fucking time.
*  And there's some marbles that are being pushed around.
*  Pushed around by shadow characters.
*  Shadowy actors.
*  It's true.
*  It's so dark.
*  It's so dark.
*  And I'm glad you brought that up.
*  Yes, there's darkness.
*  There's 100% agent provocateurs.
*  This has been the idea that this is not going to happen today.
*  It's one of the most provocative and engaging encounters in the history of civilization
*  as we know it in recorded media.
*  Right?
*  What year other than 2020?
*  What year can fuck with 2020 when it comes to all this shit happening together all at
*  once?
*  Coronavirus, three month lockdown of the world.
*  I think the onset of World War I in the Spanish flu could probably be like, suck our dick.
*  Close in terms of bodies and all that, but we haven't realized the amount of time that
*  that took place in.
*  We never would have imagined in 2020, where we are here in June, that we would be here.
*  If I came to you in December and I said, bro, I'm going to tell you some crazy shit.
*  I've been thinking about that.
*  But you know what, it made me think of something you were saying earlier too.
*  I was at this talk.
*  It was about collapse, civilization collapse.
*  It was at the Getty Museum.
*  And the thing I took away from it was this guy says, the future is here.
*  It's just not evenly distributed.
*  Whoa.
*  You know what I mean?
*  So you're talking about 2020 and the insanity of it.
*  If you're living in Syria right now, you're like, what?
*  We've been living in the point being all these different contexts is so hard to relate to
*  ones other than what we perceive to be our own.
*  That's a great way of putting it.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's hopeful and intimidating.
*  And I think there's real limitations.
*  We're hoping that we understand how you really feel when you say something.
*  We're hoping.
*  I think I got it.
*  Say it again.
*  Say it again the same way.
*  You know, it's like we have a different ways of saying things.
*  As soon as you have different ways of saying things, but yet you maintain that if you said
*  I could take it and put it in print and everybody can know what exactly what you said.
*  That doesn't make any sense.
*  There's no trust anymore.
*  There's no trust.
*  Like, we need Elon Musk's brain drill.
*  Bring it in.
*  But we need to be nice to him so he doesn't think everyone's attacking him.
*  He's going to be okay.
*  I'll mediate.
*  I love that dude.
*  There it is.
*  He's a good guy.
*  He really is a good guy.
*  Tusculate.
*  Hello.
*  She's got his, sorry, Elon, his old car registration up on her fridge.
*  I know.
*  Oh, that's right.
*  You guys bought for honey honey the Cadillac Escalade.
*  Well who knows?
*  Maybe he had a bunch of them.
*  I'm sure he did.
*  He has eight homes in Bel Air.
*  He's like, I don't want a home anymore.
*  Oh, how convenient.
*  You have eight of them, you fuck.
*  It's literally on the side of my fridge, the registration.
*  It says Elon Musk.
*  Bro, he bought Mars.
*  That's what this is all about.
*  I know.
*  It was for sale.
*  But you know what I thought, I was in that same podcast.
*  He says, I could either be designing my perfect home or I could get us to Mars.
*  I was like, why don't you design your perfect home too maybe because we'll probably figure
*  out some cool shit.
*  Because Hyperloop.
*  He's got to put the Hyperloop together.
*  He's trying to make a new Tesla.
*  He's got a Roadster.
*  He's got a Cybertruck.
*  What about like a toilet or something?
*  We need that.
*  He just needs a back massage.
*  He needs a back massage, some electrolytes.
*  What's that gun thing?
*  The gun thing.
*  It's right there.
*  TheraGun.
*  I want to get one of those.
*  He needs a TheraGun.
*  He needs electrolytes.
*  There's a lot of those companies.
*  Tim Tam's a really good one too.
*  A real person with an elbow.
*  Rub it in your back.
*  Hire a professional.
*  Those are around.
*  Look, people who are really good at that shit.
*  You've got a real connection.
*  Remember when we used to be able to get massages?
*  Oh, hold on.
*  You can tell by your intimates.
*  No, I mean, total fucking champagne problems.
*  But I got a fucked up back and it's been, you know, I've been managing all kinds of
*  shit.
*  Tell me.
*  I fixed problems in my back.
*  I can tell you.
*  I've helped a lot of my friends.
*  From the violin, I've got like a left shoulder thing up the neck that sometimes I just can't
*  go this way.
*  But it's more physical therapy that I just regularly was doing with like chiropractor.
*  I'm OK, by the way.
*  I was playing pool so much that I was developing this really bad pain in the middle of my back
*  when I lived in New York because he spent so much time bent over a table.
*  I would play pool eight, ten hours a day.
*  So eight, ten hours a day, I was bent over this fucking table looking at these balls.
*  Like story of my life.
*  I was going to say it, you fucking made me do it.
*  Can you imagine like I'm trying to save for college?
*  Every day just balls, balls, balls, balls, balls.
*  That's a lot of time, dude.
*  Whenever you think about, or I used to read about a lot of drummers, you know, famous
*  drummers and eight hours was kind of the magic number.
*  All these guys, Tony Williams, even Billy Corgan, great guitar player.
*  Talks about.
*  Try to get me to buy a drum set.
*  I'll buy a drum set, bro.
*  Just think about it, Joe.
*  Send me one on Amazon.
*  OK.
*  Are we allowed to support Amazon or are we not woken up?
*  I don't know.
*  I saw some really cool stuff about supporting black businesses and like buy your books from
*  like bookstores.
*  This is my thoughts on Jeff Bezos.
*  He could be way worse.
*  We should be nice to that guy and give him a hug and tell him, look, bro, I get it.
*  No one's supposed to have 180 billion dollars.
*  That's a lot of money.
*  Let's be friends.
*  Jeff, Jeff, I know we don't know each other, but I love you.
*  OK, the olive branch.
*  You're going to be OK, man.
*  We're all going to be OK, but we're not going to make it.
*  Get him on the podcast.
*  I'd love to have you on Jeff Bezos.
*  Order him.
*  Of Amazon.com.
*  Order him.
*  I'm really, really inspired by you.
*  Legitimately.
*  You think he'll get here by Saturday?
*  Kevin Hart was on the podcast last week and he was talking about Jeff Bezos.
*  That he met Jeff Bezos at a party and he made a beeline right to him.
*  And his friend was actually urging him not to do it.
*  Wait, Bezos made the or Kevin?
*  No, Kevin did.
*  Got it?
*  And Jeff Bezos was like, I'm moving in.
*  Was it well received?
*  And his friend was like, no, no, no, I'm talking to him.
*  He was like, get the fuck away from me.
*  Doing this.
*  Damn.
*  What did you see Jeff?
*  Or maybe it's a person.
*  Anything.
*  I'd give Jeff my number and I'd say listen.
*  I don't know what Jeff Bezos looks like, to be honest with you.
*  If I saw him at a party, I'd be like, that's a guy.
*  Well, I'll introduce you.
*  Oh, fuck.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  If you want to be subtle.
*  No, I'm good.
*  I don't.
*  The internet's not the place.
*  I'm really OK.
*  Fuck you.
*  I'll put you in whatever headlock I know how to do.
*  I'll show you how to kill me.
*  Triangle.
*  I'll show you how to kill me.
*  I'll show you how to kill me.
*  As long as you wear blackface, you can choke me out and kill me.
*  How dare you?
*  Come on.
*  I want it to be so little racism that that's not even a term anymore.
*  Yeah.
*  Can we get to that?
*  I think we can.
*  I hope so.
*  We can get to the point where there's just morons, assholes, and people you can hang
*  out with.
*  Yeah.
*  I think we can get there.
*  Morons, assholes, people you can hang out with.
*  I was thinking about you because you're a comic.
*  The thing is, there's a lot of things to make fun of, but people are so fucking sensitive
*  right now.
*  For good reason.
*  That's why I signed with Spotify.
*  I'm like, I got plans, bitch.
*  I'm riding this wave right into the rocks.
*  Come with me.
*  Ben, what are you doing?
*  He's stretching.
*  I'm not thinking about my bag.
*  Ben's doing yoga.
*  That's what Weed in California does to you.
*  Is this podcast on the move?
*  He's like over the...
*  How long has this podcast been going on?
*  Three and a half hours.
*  Let's play a song.
*  A mere two hours less than the Kevin Smith podcast.
*  Let's play a song and eat a sandwich.
*  What's the Kevin Smith one?
*  If you had to guess.
*  I don't know.
*  I want to say it's five hours.
*  What?
*  You weren't here?
*  Who was here?
*  No, he was here for the second one, but there was a really long one before Jamie.
*  Jamie...
*  Jamie Time.
*  Jamie Time.
*  Jamie Time.
*  Jamie Time.
*  Jamie Time.
*  Jamie Time.
*  Jamie Time.
*  Jamie Time.
*  Jamie Time.
*  Jamie Time.
*  Jamie Time.
*  Jamie Time.
*  Jamie was a thought in another dimension.
*  I apologize to Gary Clark after our last podcast because I talked so much.
*  Listen, don't you ever do that.
*  Well, I love Gary so much.
*  Just tell him you love him.
*  I do.
*  I love him so much.
*  He loves you too.
*  He was a man.
*  He loves you.
*  I love him.
*  But I think he was really stoned.
*  Everybody was great.
*  You're freaking out.
*  I freak out all the time, but I just want Gary to know how much I love him.
*  So do I.
*  All right.
*  Ride the wave, Suzanne.
*  I'm trying.
*  I'm not a very good surfer.
*  Do you want to do Angel of Death or what?
*  Let's do Whatcha.
*  You got to do both.
*  We'll do both.
*  Let's do this one because I know I'm not going to fuck it up.
*  Angel of Death is how I met you guys.
*  We're going to do, let's do Whatcha Gonna Do Now first, Ben.
*  Okay.
*  I love that too.
*  Let's do Angel of Death after that.
*  Do whatever you do.
*  Because I'm starting to get a little, I'm pretty fucked up.
*  See?
*  Time is your friend.
*  Is it?
*  You know what?
*  Yes, it's only a, it's a, it's light out.
*  How can you tell?
*  It's light out.
*  I can tell.
*  Okay, check.
*  I don't know.
*  I read it.
*  I'm a security camera.
*  I'm 26.
*  I support that.
*  We're fine.
*  I'm so glad you brought sandwiches.
*  We're all going to be fine.
*  This might be the first podcast we ever make, part one and part two.
*  Jamie, what do you think?
*  If we go straight psychedelics, we should totally do part two.
*  I think we should give a round of applause to young Jamie, who is perhaps the greatest
*  podcast producer in the known universe.
*  And he wears Columbus Ohio shirt.
*  Come on now.
*  The best reps Ohio in a strong way.
*  The best one handed Googler in the world has ever known.
*  Fastest finger shit to wish.
*  He's telepathic.
*  I'll start talking about shit.
*  Teach me.
*  I mean weird shit.
*  Hyenas.
*  Fuckin monkeys.
*  You guys are like unibrain.
*  Unibrain?
*  Yeah.
*  I think we've integrated.
*  I think we've integrated.
*  Jamie and I are connected.
*  Neural link.
*  Yeah.
*  This is not very good.
*  If we're in the ether together, what's wrong?
*  Oh, this is the old, it's my dad's dish.
*  Oh, sorry dad.
*  You guys are swapping guitars?
*  Yeah, we're kind of fucked up too.
*  I'm running guitar.
*  We brought everything.
*  I've said this before.
*  I'm going to say it again.
*  One of the things I love about music is I don't even know what the fuck you're doing.
*  I got no idea.
*  I could say the same about a kettlebell.
*  I could teach you that right quick.
*  Let me tell you.
*  I could teach you that really quick.
*  I'm good with the arms, but the core and some of the whiffs, I want to tighten up the whiffs.
*  Jamie's going to film this right after here.
*  We're going to go right over to the gym.
*  I'm not kidding.
*  I'm not kidding either.
*  I'm going to fucking bring it up.
*  I'm going to die.
*  See, my whoop is not in the right place for kettlebells.
*  See why?
*  My whoop is on top.
*  My whoop is on top.
*  When I do kettlebells, that's what I do.
*  It's a whoop strap.
*  First of all, I'm going to switch that bitch.
*  There shouldn't be any reason that we're not in the best shape of our lives right now other
*  than depression.
*  An age.
*  How dare you?
*  Me.
*  Sure.
*  You're in the best shape of all of us combined.
*  No, we're all going to be okay.
*  We're going to be fine.
*  We've got to stay on top of the wave.
*  Don't get locked.
*  How are we doing on Sears?
*  Hold your breath, soldier.
*  If we had a drum set, we'd be a band right now.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  No.
*  Jamie, you don't play drums, right?
*  Come on.
*  You're trying to con me.
*  You're trying to con me and you get into the drum sets.
*  Stop conning your Logan.
*  Everybody wins.
*  I'll definitely learn.
*  I'll learn.
*  Jamie would earn some hearing.
*  I don't want to lose Jamie to SpaceX.
*  As soon as they figure out he can learn everything, we've got a real problem.
*  Fair.
*  I don't want to lose him.
*  Teach him how to play drums.
*  What if he gets as good at that as he is at one hand Googling?
*  No, no.
*  You know what?
*  I was thinking about that.
*  I had this weird, I was like one day 20 years from now when everyone's like, when Joe's
*  like, young Jamie.
*  Because that's where your voice is going, Joe.
*  He's young Jamie.
*  Undeniable.
*  Jamie is young in spirit.
*  Jamie, Jamie, look that up.
*  It's 90 year old Rogan.
*  I can't wait to see that guy.
*  It doesn't matter how old Jamie gets.
*  He's always been young in spirit.
*  I know.
*  I love it.
*  When I met Jamie, I'm like, this dude's cool.
*  He's just a fun kid.
*  He's young Jamie.
*  This is a good crew.
*  I had a ponytail back then.
*  Whoa.
*  You had a ponytail back then.
*  I mean.
*  I met young Jamie at the ice house in Pasadena.
*  That's pretty awesome.
*  We were talking about audio engineering.
*  Love that stuff.
*  Here's this cool motherfucker.
*  No, this is a great crew you got here.
*  Like things are going well.
*  There's no crew.
*  It's just Jamie and me.
*  I know.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  That's a trick.
*  That's your crewman.
*  Yeah, I like how you took the same room.
*  I'm just like, we could have been in another.
*  I'm going to do it again in Texas.
*  Oh my God.
*  There's always air travel.
*  International.
*  Is there?
*  Yes.
*  Okay.
*  When you get the spaceship fired up.
*  How fly you guys are.
*  You call us.
*  You call us.
*  Listen, my thoughts about Austin are if I do move there.
*  Is this a public thing?
*  100%.
*  I'm just going to fly people in.
*  I'll fly anybody in.
*  That's cool.
*  It's a day.
*  It's one day.
*  Let's be friends.
*  We'll go down because by then there'll be venues again.
*  And we'll just go there, play a show, do a podcast, hang for a week.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  You got to give people the choice to do what they want to do.
*  I don't know if they're right.
*  I don't know if you, we have to inform people and then we have to give them the ability to make decisions.
*  And I don't know if you're right.
*  I don't know if I'm right.
*  I don't know who's right.
*  I'm scared.
*  You're scared.
*  Yeah.
*  Talk.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what I think gloves work.
*  For what?
*  Trust people who drive with masks on.
*  It's weird.
*  I think they're pussies.
*  You're in your own car.
*  It doesn't make any sense.
*  Where are you going bitch?
*  You're going to fold.
*  You're going to what?
*  Interrogation.
*  You're going to fold.
*  You're going to fold up shop you fucking pussy.
*  Hey!
*  What?
*  Why are you getting a mask on?
*  You're in your own fucking car.
*  I'm scared.
*  Is the sky poison?
*  I'm scared.
*  They're making the wrong choice.
*  I thought you just said they're making the wrong choice.
*  That's the right choice.
*  Listen, you're always going to have bitches.
*  We have to, everything is real.
*  All things are real.
*  Liars, poets, cur lovers, thieves.
*  I think that-
*  Everything is real.
*  We got to all accept it together.
*  Recognize bitches.
*  Flush them.
*  Wake them up in the morning.
*  Get up son.
*  Ben.
*  Give them your love.
*  Could you imagine?
*  I think that's part of what you're saying.
*  It's time to be a man.
*  I'm going to work out to this every day.
*  A manly love.
*  Just wake them up.
*  It doesn't happen on its own.
*  You must force it.
*  You must force all of it.
*  Love, force love.
*  Hugs.
*  Hug your friends.
*  Mike, I love you.
*  Who is Mike?
*  I don't know.
*  I'm an imaginary person.
*  I have a couple of Mike friends.
*  Mike Young.
*  Mike Young, I love you.
*  I love what's happening right now.
*  I love a lot of people.
*  We all got to love each other.
*  100%.
*  I think that's pretty much the key.
*  That is the key.
*  Unlock that door.
*  The key is this.
*  We got to accept that we're all living in this fucking fantastic soup of possibilities.
*  Oh yes.
*  And we all come from different backgrounds and different deficits and different strengths.
*  Different, different ideas.
*  Different ideas.
*  Different perspective.
*  Different biases.
*  Preach.
*  God damn.
*  Yeah.
*  All these things.
*  Like we might look like we, we, we, first of all, we should have a George Floyd Memorial.
*  A big one.
*  Like a Mount Everest style.
*  Yeah, but why stop there?
*  What is the one with all the presidents?
*  Not Mount Everest.
*  Rushmore.
*  Rushmore.
*  That one.
*  Do it George Floyd.
*  Come on bro.
*  Fuck yeah.
*  How about if we did that?
*  It's.
*  Can you imagine if that one shitty cop for whatever, let's just let him get away with
*  all the shit that he got away with forever.
*  There's a ton of complaints about that guy.
*  Are there?
*  I didn't know that.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Over the years.
*  I didn't get into that.
*  Way, way, way, way, way back to like the early 2000s, right?
*  Like 2006 was like his first complaint.
*  I've ignorantly only just seen the video and that man has tweeted.
*  That's insane.
*  Just he hasn't, he hasn't.
*  I don't care if you've gone over the facts, but if you tweeted.
*  I think it's Richmond.
*  Do you have an Instagram black square?
*  Cause if you didn't lose my number.
*  Fuck you.
*  I did.
*  I didn't.
*  I know you didn't.
*  Kidding.
*  No, but that man.
*  For me not to.
*  I can't.
*  It's okay.
*  It's not that I don't support the movement.
*  I do, but I don't know who the fuck told everybody to have a black square on fucking election
*  days on a primary day.
*  Okay.
*  Even if most people said, okay, I'm going to post the black square and then I'm going
*  to post my other shit.
*  There's for sure a step back.
*  Yeah.
*  It's for sure.
*  It was confusing.
*  The messaging on that one was confusing.
*  I don't know where it came from.
*  If I knew where it came from.
*  The weird thing is, I think I need more whiskey.
*  We all need to post a black square to support that we love everyone.
*  We love black people.
*  We love Asian people, Polynesians, South Americans.
*  We love everybody.
*  If the rock would just take the reins.
*  I'll be your press secretary.
*  I think he's going to.
*  I'm going to be his, uh, was that dude, Steven, the one dude that keeps getting in trouble's
*  bald guy.
*  Paulie short knows him.
*  Steven bald guy.
*  Paulie short knows him.
*  Steven Miller.
*  Yeah.
*  That guy.
*  I'll be that guy.
*  Is there ice in the bucket still?
*  For the rocks administration.
*  Is ice in that bucket.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  You know, back to the blackout thing.
*  The nearest is almost gone.
*  I like to think that it wasn't some kind of weird conspiracy because I found a really
*  I found a lot of people that think I'm disrespecting that I'm joking around.
*  But one thing that I am, I understand what it is.
*  You want to know how many people are with you here.
*  Here's here's reality.
*  Everybody's with you.
*  Everybody who has a heart, everybody who loves people, everybody loves Marvin Gaye and Mike
*  Tyson and Muhammad Ali and Laurence Fishburne and Ice Cube and every fucking brilliant African
*  American artist across every Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy and Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle.
*  We love everybody.
*  We love you especially.
*  It's not a fair game.
*  The game that African Americans are playing is different than the game that you're in
*  a European American settlers like my family is playing.
*  We drifted into this game that was established by slavery.
*  It's not our game.
*  It's a different game.
*  And for anyone to if we're going to progress, we have to acknowledge that this didn't start.
*  It's not like everybody's like, OK, you all have four cards like each one of those cards
*  worth 40 points.
*  Do your best.
*  Are we playing Monopoly again?
*  Well, you're playing the game.
*  Society.
*  If you want to think about what economic equality is or what just any sort of just community,
*  like the way we feel about each other, what's equal and what's not.
*  It's not 100 percent based on what you've done.
*  There's a giant chunk of it is based on things that are completely out of control.
*  Oh, of course.
*  Right.
*  But that's that's the thing that doesn't get talked about.
*  Right.
*  And when you talk about presidential campaigns or gubernatorial campaigns, whether it's the
*  Senate or Congress, no one says like, hey, this is a crazy game.
*  This is a crazy game.
*  And some people get a million chips and some people owe chips the moment they're born.
*  They're bad.
*  Yeah.
*  The moment they're born.
*  Yeah.
*  And some of those people swim through those waters.
*  Yeah.
*  These incredibly powerful artists.
*  And that's what's so fascinating about America.
*  The James Browns, the princes, the people that swam through that water who are extraordinary.
*  The Marvin Gaye's, the Muhammad Ali's, the Joe Frazier's, the David and Goliath.
*  So many people.
*  Yeah.
*  No, it's a thing.
*  I'm listening to the David and Goliath, Malcolm Gladwell book.
*  And it has a lot of that, like, defying the odds in a lot of ways, you know.
*  But you know, in terms of the black box, that is an action that, like, to have us, to do
*  something, like, even if it's so simple as a digital action in solidarity, it feels powerful.
*  It does.
*  It feels like a recognition and a cognizance that is a consciousness that, you know, you
*  can sit here and thought.
*  But when you start to open up a conversation or express yourself, and it's scary.
*  I've been expressing myself and I've been falling on my fucking face, but I keep getting
*  back up because I want to understand.
*  And there's a real...
*  Can I stop you right there?
*  Please, yeah.
*  You weren't falling on your face when you're talking to those people in real life, like,
*  the real video back and forth stuff.
*  No.
*  No problems.
*  No.
*  The problem is Twitter.
*  The problem is talking through text.
*  If anybody talks to you or you, you guys are really nice people.
*  Like, from the moment I met you.
*  Like, we met in, like, 2012, you know.
*  Holy shit.
*  I think at the ice house.
*  We did.
*  We said that before.
*  Hey, we did that end of the world show in December of 2012.
*  That's so long.
*  December 21st, 2010.
*  2010 maybe.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  Probably before...
*  Hey, 10 year anniversary, y'all.
*  Yeah, let's do it.
*  Ben's out of booze.
*  Ben's out of booze.
*  Don't drink that.
*  Ben, pour first.
*  We have patience.
*  He put a joint in his glass.
*  I put my joint out of there.
*  You desecrated your whiskey glass.
*  Don't listen.
*  I'm sorry.
*  Then take mine and pour whiskey in the joint one.
*  I'll drink that.
*  Don't be a bitch.
*  No, pour whiskey in that one.
*  Pour whiskey in your...
*  I'm gonna drink out of that?
*  Yes, of course I will.
*  That's the point of this.
*  Guys, stop fighting.
*  Pour the whiskey.
*  No, no, no, no, no.
*  Don't drink out of that glass.
*  Pour the real amount of whiskey, like a drink.
*  I don't want to sue you.
*  What are you talking about?
*  If I was at a bar and I bought a whiskey...
*  There's gotta be more glasses around here.
*  There's a lot more glasses.
*  Give me the joint glass.
*  I'm not scared.
*  Joe.
*  I'm not scared of dirt.
*  What are we gonna do?
*  I'm not giving it to you.
*  Yes.
*  There's action.
*  What are you scared of?
*  We shared a joint!
*  Look, your life matters more than ours.
*  Give me my fucking weed!
*  Give me my fucking weed!
*  Give me my fucking weed!
*  Give me my fucking weed!
*  Give me my fucking weed!
*  Unnecessary.
*  Unnecessary.
*  Stay alive.
*  Yeah, we can't give you this contaminated glass of whiskey.
*  I wish I could tell you what's going on in my body.
*  Just pour it in the fucking...
*  All right, Ben.
*  I want to just drink out of this fucking thing.
*  No!
*  Ben, give it to him.
*  He wants it.
*  Give me that.
*  Give me that.
*  Give me it.
*  Give me it.
*  Give me it.
*  Give me it.
*  Give me it.
*  Give me it.
*  Give me it.
*  Thank you.
*  Pour whiskey in that.
*  Pour whiskey in it.
*  Pour more like a real drink.
*  It's going to be okay, guys.
*  Jesus, Ben.
*  Ben, Joe Rockin says we have to conquer our inner bitch.
*  You're not going to give him feces with hookworms in it.
*  It's just a little bit of whiskey.
*  It's fine.
*  It's fine.
*  Okay, but I still don't have whiskey.
*  I've been doing this forever.
*  This is yours.
*  Take that one.
*  Pour glass and let's clink.
*  Oh my God!
*  Clink.
*  Pour glass.
*  What's going to happen after this?
*  Zero.
*  Zero.
*  Zero.
*  Zero things.
*  No, I mean ready for the long haul.
*  You're going to wake up and you're going to start life again.
*  Salute.
*  Hey, I went in on that.
*  I love you guys so much.
*  I love you guys too.
*  You guys are awesome.
*  Are we talking a decade here?
*  I think we've been friends for...
*  What the fuck?
*  ...recently at least nine years or eight years.
*  It was at the first studio I remember I thought was in the ice house.
*  It was like a side room.
*  I'm talking about it was definitely in Pasadena.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Oh my God.
*  Yeah.
*  My friend Eddie Bravo is a really...
*  He's great.
*  We met him.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  But he's a really big fan of you guys.
*  What?
*  Yeah.
*  And when you guys performed at that show where it was you guys, Joey Diaz, Doug Stanhope.
*  One of my favorite times of life.
*  I wore a fucking suit.
*  I never wear a suit on stage.
*  You look dope as fuck.
*  It's the only time I ever wore a suit in a comedy show ever was with us.
*  I was like, if the Mayans were right...
*  If the Mayans were right...
*  We're gonna go down looking good.
*  Let's ride this bitch out.
*  But Eddie Bravo, who's like...
*  He's a real fan of music.
*  You guys were on stage and he was like, God damn, these motherfuckers are talented.
*  He's a sweet dude.
*  I love him a lot.
*  But it was really interesting because Eddie had never seen you guys before.
*  He didn't know.
*  And he goes, who are these people?
*  I go, they're really good friends of mine.
*  They're called Honey Honey.
*  I go and I start telling them this song, that song, Angel of Death, pa pa pa.
*  We start talking, let's get wrecked.
*  And then we're sitting backstage and he sees you guys go on stage and he goes, whoa.
*  He goes, bro, these motherfuckers are talented.
*  That was 2012, December 21st.
*  That was at the...
*  Thanks Eddie.
*  Thank you for having us on that show.
*  Yeah, it was really special.
*  I love you guys.
*  I love you guys.
*  One of the coolest things about having a...
*  Oh my God.
*  Oh my God.
*  That's right.
*  Jamie took all these pictures.
*  Look at you guys.
*  Jamie, that's a great shot.
*  I had a fucking...
*  I put a suit on.
*  Oh, you both look so handsome.
*  I actually had a suit made, but because they don't make them for chimps.
*  You gotta go...
*  Yeah, there it is.
*  Oh, that's so special.
*  I want that.
*  2012.
*  Was Duncan there?
*  Yes, he was there.
*  Oh yeah, I had a picture of him.
*  I had a picture of him.
*  I had a picture of him.
*  I had a picture of him.
*  I had a picture of him.
*  I had a picture of him.
*  I had a picture of him.
*  I had a picture of him.
*  I had a picture of him.
*  Oh.
*  Didn't he come to hang out?
*  Oh, Bill Burr came down.
*  I remember meeting Bill that night and being like, holy shit.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, he's cool as fuck.
*  Well, I felt like, no bullshit.
*  There's Doug in his cool little plaid jacket.
*  There's Eddie.
*  There's very few times in all of life where someone has the opportunity to be the person
*  who says, hey, we might all die tonight.
*  So let's rage.
*  So this is what I think, it was fill up a giant place.
*  I'm going to get together with a bunch of my friends and let's love each other.
*  Let's have fun.
*  It was so much fun.
*  Let's listen to music.
*  Let's talk some shit.
*  You crushed it that night.
*  It was a fun night.
*  It was fire.
*  Everybody was really excited.
*  It was a fun night.
*  It was like everybody.
*  And even if it didn't happen, and it didn't happen.
*  Here we are.
*  Eight years later, everybody's okay.
*  Apparently the world was not supposed to end then unless this is the afterlife.
*  But I hope we keep that place, the Wiltern.
*  I think that's one of the great theaters in LA.
*  Oh yeah, that's amazing.
*  I hope they can open soon.
*  Just open.
*  Open.
*  You can probably, a place like that would probably be easier because there's chairs
*  you say no one's sitting there, no one's sitting there.
*  This is my motto.
*  It's four words.
*  Let people take risks.
*  You let people do motocross and BMX.
*  I gotta tell you, I am mourning the live show.
*  It's been tough.
*  Yeah?
*  It's hard.
*  It's hard.
*  There's a special connection you have to audiences, right?
*  Yeah.
*  I feel that way too.
*  I'm sure.
*  You can kind of make songs with nobody around, you know, but I can't make any jokes.
*  If I had to write out my shit and then go out like randomly without ever trying it out
*  in an audience, I might hit like 70% of the time.
*  That means like 30% of my jokes are gonna be terrible.
*  Dude the pain of 30% of your jokes failing might kill you.
*  No, no, no, don't.
*  No.
*  No, it wouldn't me.
*  No.
*  30%, a lot of people paying money to hear jokes and 30% die.
*  I feel like our set was like 10% worked when we first started and we slowly like over 10
*  years it took us and we probably got to 85%.
*  That's a fair assessment.
*  I'll hang with that.
*  But don't you think, don't you think, no bullshit, that the 85% you hit when you guys got comfortable
*  was probably one of the most satisfying experiences you could ever imagine because you know you
*  went through the beginning.
*  Yeah.
*  Well and then we both also went off and did different projects and sort of had different
*  assessments of what that percentage spectrum looked like and now that we're sort of coming
*  back to, you know, integrating our music together, it feels so differently like we're both such
*  musicians and I'd like to think, you know, we've had our separate therapy and our work
*  and so like it just feels different.
*  What kind of therapy you guys do?
*  Oh, all kinds.
*  I mean, oh my God, you can do the one.
*  I'm so jealous.
*  I've always wanted to.
*  You can't do that?
*  No, you dick.
*  Stop doing Botox.
*  I can't.
*  I couldn't do it before Botox.
*  You did Botox?
*  Shut up.
*  Whoa.
*  What?
*  I've never heard about this.
*  Yeah, I'm here.
*  I got a line here.
*  Wow.
*  Jo knew.
*  I didn't even know.
*  Ladies don't want wrinkles.
*  No ladies want wrinkles.
*  None of us.
*  Look, look, look, look, look, look, look.
*  First of all, Listen, stop shaming the Botox, Ben.
*  I'm not shaming the Botox.
*  It was just a surprise, a moment of, caught me off guard.
*  First of all, yes I've had Botox.
*  Have you heard of Bro-Tox?
*  Yeah, I've seen it.
*  I've seen it.
*  I know what it looks like now like when this shit doesn't work.
*  I saw a cat kill a squirrel.
*  I know it's real.
*  The poop was in the pudding, Jo.
*  No, I'll tell you what, I don't fuck with my lips.
*  Please, thank you.
*  I won't.
*  I don't like that look.
*  Don't worry about your forehead.
*  And no disrespect to the ladies that do.
*  Stop shooting botulism.
*  So close to your dome.
*  I just had this angry line that was bumming me out.
*  Welcome to my life.
*  I did it once and twice.
*  But you're the fucking Buddha of podcasting and the king of Spotify.
*  I told you I'm the Joker.
*  Whatever.
*  Anyway, let me have my Botox.
*  I really don't know what to do.
*  I'm going to have to go to the bathroom.
*  I'm going to have to go to the bathroom.
*  I'm going to have to go to the bathroom.
*  Anyway, let me have my Botox.
*  I wish there was something better that wasn't botulism.
*  No, there is.
*  And you know what?
*  I've done it twice now.
*  I've done Botox twice.
*  And that's a fact.
*  And there's all kinds of things you can do.
*  I do, we'll have a lot of really great natural skincare.
*  This company called Epicurean that I really like.
*  And then there's also laser light therapy.
*  No joke.
*  Get your joy out of your whiskey, dude.
*  While I talk about skincare.
*  Unnecessary joke.
*  Unnecessary.
*  You know, he's like, you bro, you jock.
*  I love you.
*  I told you, I'm making up for the fact that Jamie beat me in our weekly NAD IV drip.
*  There's a match in there.
*  That's how you win.
*  And that is how you win, Jamie.
*  Are we going to lift weights after this or what?
*  I'm so down.
*  Sure.
*  Have you been lifting?
*  Yeah.
*  Look at this.
*  I'm going to get you to a bona fide kettlebell instructor.
*  Get you doing some shit.
*  Get you doing some wood nails.
*  Do you want to hold plank and take, and like, I'll lose.
*  I want to hold plank till I die.
*  That's how I want to do it.
*  When I'm 75, I'm just going to say today is the day that these are my words of life.
*  Joe Rogan's going to be in better shape at 75 than we are now at 35.
*  Is your back feeling fine right now sitting in this chair?
*  Yeah, I'm good.
*  Yours is bothering you?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, we're back.
*  Why?
*  What are you doing wrong?
*  That's what I'm trying to figure out.
*  When you say bothering, what do you mean?
*  It's just like an ache.
*  If you've gone to a doctor at all?
*  Is it your taint again?
*  No, my taint's all good.
*  How's your taint, son?
*  He had a taint thing for a while.
*  Your dad grabbing you by the shoulders.
*  How's your taint, son?
*  No, no, it's the thing.
*  Ben's tainting all the time.
*  Your pelvic floor, bro.
*  You've got to address it.
*  You're kegel.
*  Jamie.
*  Jamie fell down off a hoverboard right out here on our polished fucking concrete floors
*  and broke his ass bone.
*  What?
*  On the coccyx?
*  No, it's like an SI joint, but it's all the same area.
*  Fuck, I'm so sorry.
*  It's called SI.
*  He figured it out because somebody else is explaining.
*  Who was it?
*  Yeah, Zach Bitter had a sense for me.
*  That's right.
*  Zach Bitter, the guy who broke the world record 100-mile run.
*  He ran 100 miles faster than any human being has ever ran it.
*  What the fuck?
*  He ran 100 miles.
*  What kind of shoes was he wearing?
*  With an average, who gives a fuck?
*  He could do it better than a book.
*  I give a fuck.
*  He's an animal.
*  I want to know what kind of shoes he was wearing.
*  I don't want to tell you.
*  Okay, fine.
*  I want you to look in your soul.
*  Are we still friends?
*  I'm not yelling because it means I lost the fight.
*  I bought a pair of his shoes.
*  They are excellent.
*  They're escalators.
*  Jamie, did you say something?
*  You addressed your pelvic floor and healed yourself.
*  Is that what you're saying?
*  Yes, through a lot of physical therapy, basically, but almost basic stretching.
*  Can guys do Kegels?
*  Is that a Salkenese?
*  I don't know, A6?
*  I don't know.
*  No, no, no, it's not that.
*  I just pulled up a quick picture and they look like Salkenese.
*  Yeah, I think it's another company.
*  I bought Salkenese.
*  Salkenese make really good...
*  Ultra.
*  That's right.
*  ALTRA.
*  I'm going to ditch this.
*  Salkenese makes a really good trail shoe, too.
*  So this guy ran 100 miles in like 11 hours.
*  How many hours?
*  Holy shit.
*  Wow, look at him.
*  This was around the track.
*  He also did it on a treadmill.
*  Damn.
*  Yeah, the treadmill was really recently, but he broke the world record on ground for the
*  fastest 100 mile ever.
*  I like the beard better.
*  Sorry.
*  He's an animal, but he's a really nice guy.
*  Forte vibes.
*  Well, Forte vibes has been over there stretching.
*  He has these...
*  He runs in these Ultras and he told me about them.
*  They're flat, as opposed to like the idea of the heel of a lot of running shoes are
*  fatter.
*  But those are really not the way your body's designed.
*  I wonder what kind of feet he has.
*  How is his arch?
*  I personally have a collapsed arch.
*  I have pancakes for feet.
*  I have no fucking arch.
*  I think that dude...
*  It's difficult.
*  I want to talk about me.
*  I think that dude...
*  I probably did.
*  ...could run on lava.
*  Look at Joe Rogan talking about run on air.
*  He's talking to him probably about shoes.
*  I think he could run on the moon.
*  He just runs.
*  It's a mind thing more than anything.
*  Having a really good pair of shoes, whether it's Nike or Ultra or Saucony, that's great.
*  I thought it was Saucony, but whatever.
*  Saucony.
*  I'm not weighing in on this.
*  Jamie?
*  I'm sorry I brought it up.
*  Is it Saucony or Saucony?
*  I honestly don't hear anybody ever say it.
*  I just read it.
*  You're 100% right.
*  Yeah.
*  Thank you for drawing attention to this, Suzanne.
*  That fucked me up with voila forever.
*  What?
*  Voila.
*  Voila.
*  It's a mind thing more than anything.
*  Voila.
*  It starts with a V. Like voila.
*  Oh, like voila.
*  Voila.
*  Voila.
*  Yeah, voila.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I get it.
*  When I first started reading scripts, I was like, voila.
*  What the fuck is this?
*  Oh my God.
*  Beck?
*  How can you know all of the things?
*  I mean, God.
*  The things?
*  Well, just like pronunciations.
*  There's so many variations and I say this from a place of earnest.
*  I misuse a lot of words.
*  Me too.
*  And mispronounce them and it's very humbling.
*  No.
*  Oh yeah.
*  It's only humbling because you feel like you want people to, like you need a bodyguard,
*  you know like a psychic bodyguard.
*  Almost everybody does.
*  Like, come on, no, get the fuck out of here.
*  Like one person who gets it.
*  This is my psychic bodyguard.
*  Look over your ideas.
*  It's Ben Jaffe.
*  I'm real.
*  Yeah.
*  That's my psychic bodyguard.
*  You don't need me.
*  You got this.
*  Where do I donate?
*  You don't need me.
*  You guys have a PayPal or?
*  Yeah, actually.
*  In fact, we do.
*  Yeah.
*  Also Venmo.
*  Patreon is so weird.
*  I'm trying to figure out how to interact with that.
*  It's so weird.
*  Listen, this is what I think.
*  Like a lot of people think you shouldn't do sponsors.
*  This is what I think.
*  Let me talk about some sponsors that I actually believe in.
*  Please.
*  And then let's pretend I never said it.
*  Okay.
*  This is also a...
*  And then just go.
*  This way.
*  This way.
*  Should we delete that part or?
*  No.
*  No.
*  Okay.
*  Cool.
*  No, because all of my sponsors are like good companies.
*  Like you want to buy a Yeti cooler.
*  That's a good cooler.
*  You want to buy Black Rifle coffee.
*  That's great coffee.
*  But let's forget about all that.
*  That's what we're really talking about, Joe.
*  What are we talking about?
*  You tell us.
*  We're talking about life.
*  We're talking about Honey Honey.
*  This idea that you got to be scared.
*  Like scared of what?
*  Wait, but what does that have to do with Patreon?
*  Because if you want money and you...
*  I don't want any sponsors.
*  This is one of the support of my fans.
*  If you just go to one...
*  No, I want sponsors.
*  Buffalo Trace.
*  You hear me?
*  800 honey honey dot com slash Patreon.
*  Yeah.
*  No.
*  We've never...
*  We haven't Patreoned before.
*  No.
*  I don't.
*  I always feel weird about other platforms even though you can't avoid it.
*  I mean like YouTube, that's somebody else's platform.
*  At this point our own platform is good enough for me.
*  But there's something to be said.
*  Sorry.
*  I would submit that it's better to take money from sponsors and then say what you feel.
*  Any sponsors you want to throw away, just let us know.
*  Say what you feel.
*  I mean, on Patreon your audience is...
*  That Patreon shit is wack.
*  But they're your sponsors.
*  It's the same shit.
*  No, it's not.
*  It's a bunch of creeps who want you to not sell out.
*  Do you want to tell me, you bad chaffee?
*  You fucking pussy!
*  That's my pussy voice.
*  Who's telling you to do it?
*  Oh, the people that you're saying...
*  YouTube commenters.
*  Well, who gives a shit?
*  You said that the first time we met.
*  Listen, the first time we met, you were like, guys...
*  I'm a hypocrite, you're a hypocrite.
*  Would you like to be a hypocrite too?
*  Get the drum set.
*  For God's sake.
*  I think there's a...
*  This would be a good room for it too because there's baffling in here.
*  It wouldn't be overwhelming.
*  What's baffling?
*  I'm so fucked up.
*  There's a lot of absorptive substances and textures.
*  900%.
*  I mean, out there it would sound fucking great.
*  I don't know what you mean.
*  That's the thing.
*  You go out there, it would sound massive.
*  It's like Jon Bonham.
*  Sound baffling.
*  Sound baffling.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a good spot.
*  If you were going to have a drum set, where would you put it in this room?
*  In this room?
*  Well...
*  Your butt.
*  I'd put it in that corner actually, except for the door.
*  Sorry, that corner?
*  Except for the door.
*  You're going to bump into it and I'm not moving it.
*  No, it's that corner.
*  No, no, no, I'm just saying...
*  No, you got to move some shit around.
*  The one place that can't be changed.
*  The fucking door.
*  That's not practical Ben.
*  That's not practical.
*  Oh, you're just like everybody else.
*  Social justice warriors.
*  I don't see the connection.
*  NRA members.
*  Don't understand the connection.
*  No flexibility.
*  That corner, right there.
*  Right there.
*  That corner.
*  I think that corner is the optimal choice.
*  Me and my Thai Buddha?
*  Made out of gold?
*  I'm scared.
*  Right?
*  For what I actually meant to say.
*  For the record, I'm going to go under the table and I'm going to wait there until things
*  calm down.
*  You didn't have to do that.
*  You didn't have to drink the joint.
*  You didn't make a difference to anyone.
*  But I did.
*  This guy.
*  This guy.
*  But I did.
*  You didn't have to.
*  But I did.
*  Yeah, that's true.
*  That was your choice.
*  And I celebrate that.
*  I celebrate both of you.
*  I celebrate both of you.
*  I celebrate that.
*  I celebrate both of you.
*  We couldn't do this today if it wasn't for each other.
*  100%.
*  Truth.
*  I've said that probably as many times as could be a drinking game.
*  I hate to do this, but I'm going to assume that you know I love you.
*  I love you back.
*  I love you.
*  We love you too.
*  But you know, right?
*  Oh yeah.
*  Like when we were like, let's do it, let's do it.
*  We were like, yeah.
*  We know.
*  We know.
*  It was going to be hugs and fun.
*  We've known each other for 10 fucking years.
*  Ben said we had a relationship development yesterday.
*  And you said to me about, I said, Ben, I'm really excited for our drive to Joe Rogan
*  because I think we should listen to Run the Jewels and get super pumped up.
*  Oh yeah, this is my Sue's revelation.
*  And you said.
*  Oh, well, I've just been realizing you just like to get excited.
*  Like it doesn't matter what it is.
*  It's the act of getting excited.
*  It has meaning.
*  It's exciting to you.
*  But yes.
*  And I felt.
*  That was new to understand.
*  So seeing by you, I've known you for 15 years-ish.
*  And like, I just felt like, oh my God, you get it.
*  Yes, I love to be excited.
*  And you supported me in that moment.
*  Kill a mic for president.
*  Yeah.
*  So what do we do on our drive down here?
*  So Dwayne the Rock, how do we work in this?
*  Whatever.
*  Run the Jewels fast.
*  Run the Jewels fast.
*  Run the Jewels fast.
*  It's Titan FC.
*  Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
*  Fuck the slow mo.
*  This is.
*  What's that movie with Schwarzenegger?
*  The Terminator.
*  No, the one where like the fucking.
*  True luck.
*  Conan and the Barbarian.
*  Fighting for their lives.
*  Kindergarten Cop.
*  The nanny?
*  No.
*  Where he gets pregnant.
*  Junior.
*  Junior, that's what I meant.
*  It's not called Junior.
*  No, it is called Junior.
*  It's called.
*  The Running Man.
*  No, that's a different movie.
*  You fucking CIA shit.
*  It was Junior.
*  No, it's not called Junior.
*  Oh, damn.
*  None of us were alive when I came out.
*  Pretty sure it was Kindergarten Cop.
*  How dare you?
*  I was a fan of playing.
*  What's going to happen to us after this podcast is released?
*  I don't know, but you know what?
*  I don't give a fuck anymore.
*  I don't give a fuck.
*  Listen, we're going to be fine.
*  We're going to be fine.
*  No, I just want to be my real self all the time.
*  There's a thing.
*  This is it.
*  There's a thing that's happening because of the lack, the lack of like, if you hear someone's
*  words, you kind of get it.
*  If you hear someone's words repeated by somebody else, you don't really get it.
*  If you see them written down, you barely get it at all.
*  That was amazing.
*  That's what's happening.
*  That's what's happening.
*  That's what's happening.
*  No, but Joe.
*  Another beautiful thing about music, sorry.
*  Yes, you're right.
*  Transcend time.
*  100%.
*  Centuries.
*  I can play a piece of music and fucking Bach wrote that down and now I can experience the
*  same-ish thing.
*  I got to be real careful.
*  Shout out to Ben's side project called the Bach Street Boys.
*  Bach Street Boys.
*  You heard it here first.
*  We could look that up.
*  I think we should plug Ben Jaffe.
*  No, it's so good.
*  They wear wigs.
*  Let's not before I get angry.
*  I don't want to piss Joe off.
*  No, it's so special though and you worked so hard at it.
*  It's lovely.
*  I'm so proud of you.
*  Thank you, Suzie.
*  I love you.
*  That's not comforting at all.
*  When a girl ever tells you something's really so special.
*  It's fucking awesome.
*  First of all, fucking riff that shit, bro.
*  Oh, there we fucking are, Joe.
*  You got it.
*  Bach Street Boys.
*  Bach Street Boys.
*  Is this you?
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  Me and Drew Tompkins represent.
*  Which one is you?
*  What do you mean?
*  The one on the right, Joe.
*  You said you love me.
*  But really quickly.
*  Now I get it.
*  Okay.
*  It's these fast MTV music video cuts.
*  Who's that cowboy with the white hat?
*  The one who's kicking us off his car with just their bunch of hooligans.
*  That's the Bach Street Boys.
*  And don't you forget it.
*  That guy has glasses on.
*  Take it from him.
*  He doesn't even know where he is.
*  Piss on his door.
*  He can't see now.
*  Hooligans, hooligans, boom.
*  Look, it's what needs to be done.
*  It's what needed to be done at that time.
*  Why the wigs?
*  It's what needed to be done.
*  It's Bach.
*  It's just Bach Street Boys.
*  Do you know where the wigs came from?
*  Syphilis.
*  Come on.
*  Syphilis.
*  Because people were losing their hair?
*  Yes.
*  Oh no.
*  Ben, do you have syphilis?
*  I got my hair, girl.
*  Go check it out.
*  Do you know the expression?
*  Check your dick.
*  Big wigs?
*  What's wrong with this girl?
*  She's awesome.
*  That's what's wrong with her.
*  She's awesome and she's drunk.
*  She's awesome.
*  She's awesome and she's drunk.
*  She's awesome and she's drunk.
*  She's awesome and she's drunk.
*  Okay, thanks, Joe.
*  Have you ever heard of the expression big wigs?
*  That's from guys with huge wigs where they were losing their fucking hair from syphilis.
*  It was started from...
*  Big wig?
*  Yes.
*  It was starting from these royal brothers.
*  When was that, James?
*  I don't think it worked out.
*  Was it like France or something?
*  By the way, who's better than Jamie?
*  One hand.
*  Zero people.
*  Jamie's the best.
*  Jamie.
*  Okay, so these two guys...
*  Also looking pretty good, though.
*  What year was this?
*  Can we talk about Jamie's biceps?
*  You can if you want, but let me take my pants off first.
*  1580.
*  I admit to objectifying my friends and I'm sorry.
*  Can we make that bigger?
*  Damn, worst epidemic since the Black Death.
*  Infinite.
*  Oh boy.
*  So, all these dudes had syphilis because they were living without...
*  Long hair was a trendy status symbol in a bald dome.
*  It could stain any reputation.
*  Why didn't they go the other way?
*  That's unfortunate.
*  Why didn't they say, fuck it, we're all bald?
*  No, no, no.
*  This is the...
*  They were living without the internet.
*  Fuck you, right.
*  But were they?
*  No.
*  Guys, I am on another planet right now.
*  Those are real mushrooms.
*  Oh no.
*  Easy, Jim.
*  I don't...
*  Boo!
*  Here we are.
*  What, Jamie?
*  Good?
*  Make that...
*  Jamie's good.
*  Put that shit up on the screen.
*  Is there a hot tub here?
*  I love this clock.
*  I wish there was.
*  Sana.
*  Does the person who makes these clocks continue to make them or...
*  Can we get a clock?
*  Can we?
*  Yes, you can.
*  TGT Studios.
*  Thank you for saying that.
*  He's awesome.
*  That's all I'm saying.
*  That's what I'm trying to figure out.
*  They're dope, right?
*  Yeah.
*  It's beautiful.
*  What are those things called?
*  Nixie tubes.
*  They're just like the same thing that get put in...
*  I could totally make that.
*  Amplifier.
*  Say that again?
*  Nixie tubes.
*  Nixie.
*  Wow.
*  And really beautiful hardwood.
*  Yep.
*  Love it.
*  There's a lot of great shit in here.
*  There's something that's like undeniable about wood, about a beautiful wood connected with
*  electronics.
*  Are we still talking about Jamie's biceps?
*  No, no, no.
*  I think we're moving south.
*  We're moving to his taint.
*  The perineum.
*  Nixie tubes.
*  And Jamie's taint.
*  That pelvic floor.
*  Jamie, we're sorry.
*  Not sorry.
*  If you're a girl and you're in love.
*  Got it.
*  And you get to Jamie's taint, you see Nixie tubes.
*  He's more machined than man.
*  You freaked out or you just keep going.
*  Pledge allegiance to the new world order.
*  Holy shit.
*  Nixie tubes for Jesus.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I'm sorry.
*  Oh wow.
*  Here we are folks.
*  I think they're from Russia.
*  I don't trust any of them.
*  They're Huawei designed.
*  I wanted a Huawei for a while.
*  Me too.
*  I'm a rebel.
*  Well because of the, what's that?
*  Sorry.
*  Like a camera lens.
*  Beautiful.
*  But because I like taking photos.
*  Other side project.
*  Jamie.
*  Empty.
*  It wasn't likey.
*  Likey.
*  Likey.
*  Likey.
*  Likey.
*  Likey.
*  Likey.
*  Likey.
*  Likey.
*  Likey.
*  Likey.
*  Likey.
*  Likey.
*  It wasn't likey?
*  Likey?
*  I have one.
*  Soggy.
*  No I'm talking about the Huawei phone.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  They didn't put this lens.
*  So it was a lie?
*  Not a lie but I read into it.
*  They hired like engineers to produce a Leica style image.
*  Oh.
*  They were using software and what not.
*  Okay.
*  They didn't actually have like a glass.
*  I mean let's be honest.
*  The iPhone takes a great photo.
*  That's what I read.
*  And I also, I have a little Fuji film with a 50 millimeter lens that I love and it's
*  really fun to learn how to use.
*  I'm getting there.
*  But overall the Huawei is whatever.
*  Nobody else is back in Asper.
*  Ben's doing yoga.
*  Ben.
*  What's going on with you?
*  Is it your grundle again?
*  You keep going there.
*  You don't need to go there.
*  Jamie.
*  You know a lot about like photography and stuff like that.
*  Do you think that there's like certain cults of brands like Sony versus Leica?
*  Definitely.
*  For the longest time it was Canon versus Nikon.
*  Right.
*  The same way it's like Apple versus Android.
*  There's a thing they do with hunting optics too.
*  Like I use a lot of different stuff.
*  Leica has a whole different brand.
*  Yeah.
*  Extended beyond cameras and what not.
*  But it's like they're all good though.
*  It's like they're in denial that they're not all good.
*  It's very highly engineered glass from hundreds of years and proprietary.
*  It's so hard to detect differences.
*  Like guys have to get them on tripods and like stare through the lenses and look at
*  a parakeet and go, I might get close.
*  It's kind of the indicator.
*  And then they look at another one.
*  This is like a lens cut in half.
*  What the fuck?
*  I don't know if anybody that's looking, that's really small.
*  I don't know the actual number size.
*  Describe it.
*  But like this is really probably only a two or three inch lens.
*  And there's all that mechanic stuff going on inside there.
*  There's like one, two, three, four, five different.
*  What does the aperture get down to?
*  So it runs from 2.4.
*  Science!
*  It's like 16.
*  I don't know this one in particular, but it's probably like a 2.4 or 2.0.
*  They could be cutting an $11,000 lens in half just to show it.
*  I got some other stuff going on.
*  Why did people wear powder wings?
*  Leica.
*  But this is why it's so expensive is because they put all this into a tiny, tiny, tiny
*  little package.
*  Like I'm saying, I can't show it on camera because I don't have it, but it's like two
*  inches by two inches, like a little two inch cylinder.
*  And DSLR cameras, that would be similar to that.
*  The lens is three to five pounds, maybe 11 pounds and they were somewhere like two feet
*  long.
*  That's huge.
*  That's too much.
*  No!
*  I want a camera nerd out with you later.
*  I only want an eight inch hot dog.
*  No 12 inches ever in my park.
*  Joseph.
*  Hot dogs.
*  What the fuck do we do now, guys?
*  Oh my God.
*  How's everyone feeling?
*  Does everybody breathe?
*  Let's Wim Hof our way out of this shit.
*  Wait, that's the breathing technique.
*  What's his name?
*  Wim Hof.
*  Yes.
*  He's the first guy I ever talked to didn't give a fuck if I breathed out of my nose or
*  out of my mouth.
*  I've had people send me videos of this man.
*  This is him.
*  And then a certain dance between the cold and your breath begins to start up, begins
*  to charge your body.
*  This guy.
*  And after 25 breaths like that, very conscious in the cold.
*  The cold is a force and it has its impact.
*  I love his shirt.
*  You go along with the cold and what it does on the physiology and you use your breathing.
*  Now I know what happens physiologically, but then those days it was all by feeling.
*  What does happen physiologically?
*  You become fully charged.
*  The carbon dioxide goes out.
*  O2 begins to roam freely throughout the body and fills up every cell and the pH levels
*  go up.
*  When you say you altered your breathing, what you're showing me here is just breathing in
*  and breathing out.
*  What is specifically different about that than normal breathing?
*  The way I used it was like after 25 breaths, I was so fully charged.
*  I could stay like five to seven minutes under the ice.
*  What?
*  Very controlled.
*  What?
*  That means that there is not only a whole lot of oxygen inside the body, but the pH
*  levels go up.
*  Later on I began to understand by signs, by thinking about it.
*  How?
*  It's like saturated with oxygen.
*  Yeah, deducting and all that.
*  I saw that we are able to tap into the brain stem, the adrenaline.
*  We showed lying in bed people producing more adrenaline.
*  Now I know how to show to people just in a couple of days.
*  That means every listener right now is able to do that.
*  So we have proven this scientifically.
*  It showed that people lying in bed were able to produce more adrenaline than somebody in
*  fear going for its first bungee jump.
*  Bungie jump.
*  Wow.
*  I'm still confused as to how you're doing anything differently other than deep breathing.
*  You're taking a deep breathe in and a deep breathe out.
*  No, we retent from breathing after exhalation.
*  Retent?
*  We stop breathing after exhalation.
*  Once.
*  Breathe in.
*  Show me the method.
*  If you go with me.
*  Thirty times.
*  Let go.
*  Fully in.
*  Once again.
*  Fully in.
*  Letting go.
*  Right on.
*  Fully in.
*  But letting go.
*  Not fully out.
*  Just letting go.
*  But fully in.
*  Once again.
*  And once again.
*  Come on.
*  Don't hesitate.
*  Give it.
*  It's about changing the chemistry right now in your body.
*  So I'm breathing in.
*  You become lightheaded.
*  And at a certain point you're so fully charged and the pH levels go to a very high level you're
*  able to stay without air in the lung for minutes.
*  What?
*  Just keep on.
*  The feeling is understanding.
*  Go on.
*  And deeply in.
*  Letting go.
*  Deeply in.
*  Letting go.
*  Deeply in.
*  Letting go.
*  Ten times more.
*  Deeply in.
*  Letting go.
*  Deeply in.
*  Letting go.
*  I'm going to time it.
*  Letting go.
*  Deeply in.
*  Letting go.
*  Give it fully.
*  Take him in.
*  Letting go.
*  Take him in.
*  Letting go.
*  Take him in.
*  Letting go.
*  Take him in.
*  Letting go.
*  No hesitation.
*  I do this with the ovary as well.
*  And he feels wonderful.
*  Take him in.
*  Fully letting go.
*  All through the mouth.
*  Not like no mouth.
*  Okay.
*  Five times more.
*  Deeply in.
*  Letting go.
*  Deeply in.
*  Letting go.
*  Deeply in.
*  Letting go.
*  Two times more.
*  Letting go.
*  And stop.
*  Just stop.
*  Witness, without end zurge.
*  Witness, without end orptg Or夫 ort.
*  Witness, without end ortion and from their own end or �rg
*  Remember that they know that.
*  From their own way.
*  witness without air in the lungs you are able to stay much more than normally
*  than normally why because we change your chemistry carbon dioxide went out O2
*  went up filled up all the cells and the pH levels go up then we are able to tap
*  into the central nervous system and at the end that we got the brain stem and
*  that's the place of the pineal gland hypothalamus pituitary gland and the
*  pineal gland makes the secretion of adrenaline in dangerous situations
*  normally we do not get into it because of of our shallow breathing this is the
*  way to get into the most primitive part the reptilian brain without many
*  difficulties and fend off bacteria getting better into the endocrine
*  systems we talk about later you're past one one ten in minutes and you're still
*  on that shows that the capacity to fill yourself up with oxygen is a lot more
*  than we normally use and as we do not use it we are not making a use of the
*  full capacity of our physiology now we found out we got a different layers and
*  we never use it and this is the way to learn to use it to tap in and bang into
*  the primitive brain into the endocrine systems immune systems the way nature
*  has mended to be everybody is able to do 145 and this is only around one if it
*  would do like three rounds you would go to three minutes four minutes without
*  air without training it only shows the capacity to store up oxygen inside we
*  never use that you're doing great is he is doing already to two five almost to
*  ten whenever you feel the earth holding your breath you don't need to force is
*  only learning how to oxygenize the body and all the cells you're going great man
*  nice one ha ha feels good huh hey yeah yeah yeah that's okay to 30 year yeah
*  when you feel the urge to breathe you breathe in fully and keep it for 10 15
*  seconds then that's one round fully in and keep it and now will you press your
*  belly yeah the neck and then the head and now you are able to tap into the
*  brainstem yeah that's it that's insane how weird is it that we need to breathe
*  you don't even think about it you need gas yeah in your your cell sacks it hit
*  me when he was talking about shallow breathing because when I was really
*  dealing with insomnia that would be like this thing yeah like I could I never
*  felt like I could I just didn't have that capacity I want to say to something
*  you talked about like talked about it today singing is a healthy expression of
*  that kind of breathing sure yeah I injured my vocal cords and had to go
*  through therapy and this style of breathing this is something was
*  addressed and learned to do and it was incredible how fast I healed myself just
*  through breathing there's there's also something and when people talk loudly
*  whether they're singing or speaking there's a thing that we do where we
*  strain the vocal cords sure yeah yeah and that's been a crazy we were talking
*  about it today pushing when it comes to your breath and singing is completely
*  antithetical to what you're trying to do I know you're like caught up in the
*  momentum of trying to get people to pay attention yeah but someone like Marvin
*  Gaye or James Brown they're so calm in those moments or at least in relation to
*  that behavior that they're able to resonate with their bone structure in a
*  way that makes you react emotionally yeah because they're so connected to
*  their breath people talk Ginsburg talked about Bob Dylan that way he said he got
*  to this point when he was had kind of his peak in the 60s of that power he
*  said Dylan became a column of air he just breathing he just turned into a
*  focused breath I think that Sturgill when he nails it he's an incredible
*  artist yeah Sturgill he catches this fucking vibration what some of his songs
*  are like Jesus Christ yeah and I think he's lucky it came so late for him
*  because he had so much ground underneath him that he can make real artistic
*  decisions yeah I feel like that about Nathaniel
*  Rateliff too like he's a lot came later for him too almost all I mean it doesn't
*  mean you have to have it like Taylor Swift could be like amazing I can't you
*  don't have to define her by who she was like X amount of years ago it's all
*  bullshit but the reality is like whatever it whatever it is like it's how
*  you address it and how you express it yeah and when you get a guy like Sturgill
*  that was working on the fucking railroads till he's like 36 yeah it's
*  authentic as fuck he was working on yeah Ryan Bingham Ryan Bingham is a friend of
*  ours we've toured with him a bunch he's he's similar in that like like I
*  remember Ryan Bingham had he's a beautiful man he was in Jeff Bridges
*  movie crazy heart crazy heart and he wrote he wrote the theme song for he
*  won an Oscar for it and he dedicated his Oscar to his wife it was really
*  beautiful but Ryan Bingham we toured with him a lot and and I remember saying
*  Ryan I love your like you have such great teeth he's like this shit ain't
*  real I got my teeth kicked out by a bull when I was 18 and I was like right sorry
*  gotcha but like he is he is just like he is a cowboy he's from Texas he's an
*  incredible songwriter and he's a wonderful person and he's one of those
*  that you're just like that is the real deal and you know I we're all the real
*  deal in our real different ways you know and like but like some people have had
*  like acutely different paths like Sturgill and it's just like tip of the
*  hat man it's it's really really special like everybody it's all different yeah
*  so I could saw a contest see who's fucked over more not that that's not
*  what I want that's what so another music thing is that's a medium you just
*  expressing it's not accomplishment base it's different from sports sport offers
*  different shit yeah but with music the people with the clearest expression of
*  self are the communicators as opposed to this this degree of achievement and I
*  think that's just a beautiful and linguistic part of it mm-hmm you know
*  it's weird right because sports like I want to dunk on you you want to dunk on
*  me fuck you yeah competitions an interesting thing in terms of
*  development you know like it helps people excel but it also represses people
*  it's like that like big fish in a little pond little fish in a big pond thing you
*  know this is the problem competition without compassion it's not that
*  competition is bad competition is good but being a dick is bad and the problem
*  is the two of them go hand to hand that's really the problem yeah yeah yeah
*  people that want to win in competition they can also be a dick yeah it's not
*  necessary which is why when I beat you in pool the last time I was on the podcast I didn't bring it up I was like internally just like
*  I had like three balls on the table Suzanne shot that eight in the corner I was like
*  all bullshit Suzanne Santo can play a little I noticed he didn't mention me as
*  definitely Ben you don't need to play a little as well like a little bit me bitch
*  yeah maybe at least one game but in your defense we were super fucked up we were
*  super fucked up we were having fun like we started talking about Spotify and I
*  couldn't hit a ball believe how are you gonna sort through your shit on Spotify
*  it's the same people man it's like if you have Spotify you can't have iTunes
*  yeah but I mean I don't know how many carryover people there are between both
*  platforms yeah I'm just saying you can't like well maybe I guess you can
*  absolutely search it on Spotify I don't know what I'm talking about you definitely can
*  search yeah yeah I was just thinking I don't know I'm talking about I'm stop
*  talking it's all right thanks guys it's weird it's weird just a different move
*  it to a new platform it's weird yeah yeah and it's mostly a mobile thing I
*  guess that's why I always when I think Spotify I think my phone you know I
*  think YouTube I think my computer I mean I do but but I think you can see it on
*  everything yeah you can listen on everything right is there a timeline
*  with it like starts September it starts and then it becomes only on Spotify in
*  January whoa I don't know this is fucked up did YouTube counter offer there was
*  no conversation no conversation interesting YouTube I have such a
*  cute there's nothing I don't have anything against YouTube especially
*  since I'm so drunk you are not alone sir yeah we definitely can there's nothing
*  wrong with anything it's risky Ben that's good thing but you know the thing
*  was like Spotify was like let's do this shit together my okay yeah this is
*  dangerous these waters are fraught with peril well now you're like we're taking
*  down ships and demonetizing you were already global before but now it's like
*  like it's just it's great man I'm like thank you honestly I've been friends for
*  a long time yeah and I don't understand any of this no but you do something
*  important it's special and like I sorry I did Lee except it except whatever I'll
