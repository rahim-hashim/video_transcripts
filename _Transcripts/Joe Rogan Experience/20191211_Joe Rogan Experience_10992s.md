*  of fun you're a fun guy like your shit it's fun I just try to be genuine with
*  it that's all that's cuz that's all I've been on there from day one and that's
*  what got me this far and it's been working so why not yeah man you know I
*  found out about you well I found out about you from two people one for my
*  friend Andrew Schultz I love that dude he speaks very highly of you but two
*  because my friend stylebender UFC middleweight champion he played your song
*  and one of his walkouts and his fights I didn't even know I didn't even know him
*  honestly until it's just like a lot of stuff out of really don't be knowing I'm
*  not the loop of the mainstream stuff so if I'm not if I can't especially
*  something like like UFC I'm still new to that I'm still learning it so when he
*  so when um I think Andrew or Charlamagne the one told me in the
*  Instagram told me too when I looked at like oh shit this shit is big like smile
*  because this one he did it like why smile bitch was still bubbling so he was
*  one of the people that I kind of realized oh no this shit going to a whole
*  another level just by him doing that and I appreciate him doing that too he's
*  huge now he's huge now yeah the champ now so he did this back before he won the
*  title this was I believe a year shit to me he did win the title when he did
*  that I thought that was the title I didn't know I don't know I'm still new
*  to this that UFC thing actually that's what brought me into it really that
*  made me give a fuck about that was like shit let me see what this is about you
*  gotta come to one live I want to weekend you want me to tell you what it is I
*  was I didn't like to see the actual nigga getting his ass whooped like like
*  I don't want to keep saying get punch punch punched while they're down I mean
*  yeah I guess cuz the environment you come from I tried to get away from that
*  type of shit and so to see it like I don't even watch videos like that seeing
*  somebody get shot in the head and I'm just starting to get comfortable watching
*  fights mmm so so so with that but now I want to go to a UFC fight now just
*  because now I guess my body done got on my mind I got the sensitize to where
*  don't bother me as much well anytime you want to go let me know this is a big one
*  this weekend where Vegas shit I might come fuck with come on down
*  hello let me think I don't want to say I got think do I got something is at least
*  two titles right oh shit three three titles I can't go I'm going to Honduras
*  how do you forget you're going to Honduras I don't know I just be doing
*  shit I do shit whenever I get a chance to now as far as traveling just for fun
*  yeah just for fun just for chill that's why we have my my me time my space time
*  to gather my thoughts and do my thing hmm yeah so not even not work related at
*  all just enjoying yourself that's kind of where I'm at mentally and everything I
*  just I'm kind of pre retired in my mind really to prepare myself for when when
*  shit slow down I think you should do that I think I should with me for for
*  that when you're about 40 you need to prepare for 60 I always try to prepare
*  for later I'm 52 so 60s around the corner for me and they get 50 I'm just
*  realizing because I remember when I was a kid and I used to be like man man I
*  want to I want to give my life to God and all that but I'm gonna have no fun
*  I'm gonna wait till I get about 50 and then here come 50 about to pull up shit
*  so now I mean but oh my 50 is a cool cool age and I'm just and I'm just
*  start preparing for when when I can't take care of myself well what it all is
*  is that we know it ends we don't know when we don't know if it's a hundred we
*  don't if it's 80 we know it ends so you hear 40 and you go oh how close how
*  close my which I know it's about time to wrap up I don't win half the century
*  like what's the average a hundred at the most so I'm like yeah I know this shit
*  for the end pretty soon some type of way so yeah let me prepare and then I look
*  at I watch old people a lot so I pay attention to them so I see what they
*  going through them like I it's my turn pretty soon I had John Witherspoon in
*  earlier in the year with his son JD yeah and he died shortly after he died
*  like a couple months later and I've known that guy for a long time and I
*  remember thinking like he was just here he was like happy he had all this energy
*  he was hilarious and then a couple months later the lights shut off that's
*  life man that's life that's life that's life that quick just like this in the
*  big scheme of things from thousands of years it's just like that but a guy like
*  that is just like iconic figure hilarious comedian like he's it's weird
*  that he's gone you know why because it's weird when everybody leaves it's like
*  they're just they're just it's just they're not in this space anymore you
*  know it's just gone I don't see it as weird though because I see death is just
*  as much as life it's the same thing oh it is yeah so I don't see it as weird I
*  mean of course emotionally we're emotionally attached to what bothers us
*  you know but at the same time I get it yeah that's why I think I think that's
*  the key to all this shit understanding once you understand you just you can't
*  pretty much got life figured out you think you have life figured out I never
*  feel like that I never feel like I got life figured out yeah you think you got
*  it nailed I mean it's stuff to learn like I was just telling stuff like this
*  it just opened my mind to stuff he was just telling me stuff but the float tank
*  but the beginning and end is pretty much life and death yes like it's just like
*  any other thing in life I mean any other thing that's living there's nothing no
*  difference so it's like we just think it is because this shit here make us
*  arrogant that's true and I also think it's a thing it's a manage your
*  perceptions thing you know like you have to manage your perceptions like how you
*  view things like you could freak out about things or you could just everything
*  perception is everything I mean it's just how you look at it and this that's
*  what keep you sane understanding like it's just how you look at it and
*  understanding there's no good or bad and shit is what it is you just got to be on
*  the right side yeah and the universe doesn't care just keeps marching the
*  universe nature don't give a fuck nothing's more powerful than nature and
*  once we realize that we'll be a more humble you said you saw a cat's hunt on
*  a safari yeah what was that like I got it on my phone you see him get one you
*  got to sit there for a minute and I didn't have no weed and then
*  yeah I didn't know where were you you know what was that Tanzania Tanzania I
*  posted on my Instagram I try to share shit like this here cuz when I'm from
*  we never seen no shit like this but it was dope as fuck it was it was way more
*  interesting than I thought it was gonna be it's like really watching like being
*  in the hood and watching the fight or watching somebody get get shot
*  okay yeah I got a little bit give it a second cuz there's an old iCloud it's on
*  the iCloud give it a second unless y'all got Wi-Fi yeah I got cricket you know I'm
*  on it rich broke lifestyle but yeah it was dope as fuck man like just being out
*  there I take I took a lot of pictures and shit I got a like an Instagram page
*  where I used to post post dope pics from when I traveled and shit did they make
*  take malaria medication I never took nothing it know where I went really and
*  I'm glad I didn't cuz I heard people that do take them shots and stuff they
*  get sick real sick yeah well thank you and plus I don't eat a lot so it ain't
*  too much that's gonna fuck me up I eat McDonald's wherever I go McDonald's is
*  your friend when you're out the country it's a thank this it is that you that
*  ain't it oh yeah yeah yeah I took that pic so is this your other Instagram the
*  comedic guy yeah that's my other other instance so it's just photographs
*  photographs like just and I call the comedic guy cuz I think comedians got
*  the best I you know cuz we observe you know so I mean you should be able to
*  take good pics if you're a comedian well this meat markets intense where is that
*  that was it uh Zanzibar oh I think what kind of meat is all that uh shit I don't
*  know something I even eat told you I only eat McDonald's man like I don't
*  trust me and matter of fact me and our Andrew one time we went to we did the
*  hip not the hip-hop awards shit the MTV Awards over in Europe and while we was
*  over there the crew and everything and I traveled the line I'm like it was like
*  we finna go get something to eat and I'm like I ain't eating this shit like
*  now come on let's go get something else like man you gonna fuck up go over there
*  everybody the whole crew had to go to the hospital I was the only one they go
*  really yeah cuz I don't eat that shit food poison they all got food poison
*  trying to eat Andrew too I'm not sure he said he didn't but I swear I told him
*  too he say he didn't get it but he might have listened to me that time but but
*  for the most part I just don't eat when I go out the country I eat shit that I'm
*  used to a fruit rice chicken and McDonald's McDonald's you ever see one
*  of those cheeseburgers they put it on a shelf for a year and they film it for
*  a year to see if it deteriorates here later it looks like it just got put
*  there that's a good thing though right maybe that's like space food like that's
*  space food like if space food is good for astronauts yeah it gotta be good for
*  us like we be hating on McDonald's way too much like nobody's really really
*  died on on paper I'm like right they have from Jack in the Box they died from
*  eating a lot you eat anything a lot you gonna that's people eat fish and fat as
*  fuck that's true but I think someone's died from E. coli I think that was a
*  Bert that was Jack in the Box so right they had an E. coli outbreak I mean but
*  that could be at everything and I could be at any any restaurant any place that
*  that shit that you showed on there I'm pretty sure it's E. coli and that shit
*  they just oh yeah they body immune to it yeah that's what they learn too from
*  traveling at the end of the day you can eat anything you just can't eat a lot of
*  it you know like you get when I go over to Asia they eat everything moving do
*  you see that there's a thing to like a hundred my kids explain this to me I
*  didn't know about this it's called mukbang what's that it's a style of
*  video that they do in Korea where Korea like I guess they're proper and polite
*  when they eat that's you know they have good manners they try to do that
*  culturally so they have these videos that are real popular where they just
*  eat like slobs they'll eat like an octopus and they have they just splatter
*  food all over their face and make a lot of noises while they chew and these
*  videos are insanely popular millions and millions of views of people watching
*  someone eat that's cuz it's well you can't go by they I've view of millions
*  and they view ain't that much because you gotta think it's billions of them
*  so I mean that's true but there's not billions of Koreans but I guess it's
*  worldwide it's a lot of how many Koreans are there that's Google it's a small
*  country relatively hey Siri how many how many Koreans are they out here
*  I'm Siri your virtual assistant oh he's a guy how many Koreans population out
*  here I don't know that you know let me just do the paper right tap type at the
*  old-fashioned yes population Korea 50 million 50 million what I guess the one
*  point 51.47 that's a lot and how many is America 330 is that what it is now so
*  it's more of us they don't know how many Mexicans are they do not they do not
*  they do not you'll never figure that out you never get to figure that out unless
*  you go to a concert look you go to a concert you see them all endlessly fucked
*  up that there's a population of people that live amongst us can't get green
*  cards and they if they left like you ever see the documentary a day without
*  Mexicans LA would fall apart LA would literally collapse show them show us
*  it'll humble us yeah but they can't because they don't have the paperwork
*  that's the thing they're all they're all illegal if people come over here
*  illegal in their you know Valley parking and washing dishes and don't these
*  different jobs and landscaping and everything they could do if if they
*  stopped other people just gonna take their job other people someone else is
*  gonna find that nobody's gonna take a job that's paying two dollars a minute an
*  hour like they're not making that much nobody other than someone else just like
*  them that needs that opportunity and they're all coming over they would have
*  to organize and they would have to have some resources and needed to sustain
*  themselves while they're organizing yeah but the thing is about the green card
*  thing is like you just should be a way where someone can earn a green card I
*  mean if someone's been over here for all this time doing great having a good life
*  being a good part of the community but they're still not it's like how does
*  that work though like if if we get overpopulated cuz I mean Russian like
*  what do we do then like I keep hearing like we always say like we we gotta let
*  everybody in because that's how we got here but then when they get full and
*  look like LA and traffic like a motherfucker and then you like all right
*  go back home we don't want y'all you don't know tourists here we don't want
*  no outsiders here so how does that work like what do we do there is no solution
*  you're right perfect solution it's no perfect solution it's real messy I think
*  if you wanted to make a perfect solution what you would do is you'd have tests
*  for everybody mm-hmm everybody but you get over here you kind of slow to
*  American thought like what would be the test like doesn't you can have a test
*  like that because it'd be biased maybe but I mean who works harder than
*  Mexicans just have to be on paper what it's gonna be like who can build a house
*  who are you like maybe there's a way to find out who you are like what kind of
*  person are you a person that's a valuable member of the community well
*  nowadays with technology they could just put something in you and scan you and
*  figure it out find out your thoughts yeah put you on an fMRI read your brain
*  yeah but then you gotta figure out what would they be looking for to see if
*  they can let you in like they convicted a lady in India from a brain scan of
*  murder there was a they used a fMRI and they said that through this machine they
*  were able to detect functional knowledge of the murder ain't that's
*  Minority Report yeah that's that movie I don't think the I don't think it's real
*  though I think they just didn't understand the science if they wrote
*  somebody this it can happen or it's gonna happen oh it's gonna happen I
*  definitely think it's gonna happen but I think the where they're at right now if
*  this person really did get convicted I don't think they really understand the
*  science I think they're just convicting them because someone said it makes sense
*  and then there's not enough people that actually understand what how little you
*  actually can read like she could have had she could have been told about the
*  scene right and then develop oh yeah you're reading something in this brain
*  it's not clearly defined yet it's just like if you told me some of you like
*  well somebody told me after a while if you keep replaying in your head you
*  think you told yourself yes yes you think maybe it was your story and was
*  somebody else's story that shit happens to people yeah especially like
*  minor shit from like 20 years ago and then your friends like I told you that
*  yeah last week like oh yeah I told you it happened to me on Instagram all the
*  time I'll post something ten years ago a tweet and then next day I know somebody
*  else do it and then I bring it back they say I got it from them like bitch I've
*  made it up memories a strange thing it's a very strange thing that's good that's
*  the thing reason why I like technology too because it kind of keeps it our
*  brain in here oh yeah for sure it keeps our brain in here so you just got to pay
*  for it you got to pay for your brain the iCloud that's really our brain but it
*  kind of solves all times it's an all-time or two that's a good point it
*  really is kind of our brain it's where everything gets stored you have to pay
*  for your brain for the rest of your life in that video of that lion it's just like
*  one of those fucked up old memories yeah it's like stay woke stay woke
*  what you said you don't feel like you got life figured out why not like what
*  was I just endlessly confused by all of it I mean I understand it you live you
*  die I understand how to be nice to people I understand what's good and bad
*  I understand you know so what you feel like you missing something what no it's
*  still bizarre as fuck like the more when you look at it when you really look at
*  what it is it's bizarre as fuck all these random interactions taking place
*  simultaneously amongst billions of people swarming on a planet that's
*  spinning and twirl twirling through infinity going through the galaxy but
*  that's what all the stars are yeah just all that when you see all that and you
*  notice all that you realize we are pretty much an aunt like in big scheme
*  with you smaller than the end we just out here so it makes no sense to put
*  that much thought into this bullshit like fuck it like it is what it is I mean
*  that's true too yeah it's not like I want to think about it all the time but I
*  just I do it out of boredom like I'm damn near wanna wanna go to Mars and
*  all that shit you know but I just don't want to be the only nigga up there
*  Mars is too long that's six months yeah I know that I thought about that I don't want to be there six
*  months unless it's a party on that goddamn shit even if that shit gotta be lit bro
*  think about that think about this what if the earth was moving there now we own
*  the party bus now right we are in the party but we in the party bus and there's
*  a space they don't tell us nothing and then we get there they'd be like I we
*  here yeah because if you think about it earth is like a spaceship with like a
*  convertible spaceship there's just no roof yeah yeah yeah I mean there's the
*  only thing to save us is the atmosphere that's real though yeah yeah I want how
*  much would the space should be different be like an apartment complex versus a
*  whole city yeah honestly they could be doing that that's what he should be
*  that's what them motherfucking billionaires should be trying to do
*  move this goddamn earth out the way just push it we want to go wouldn't that make
*  most sense the sun with it yeah we can bring the sun how does the sun how come
*  maybe I'm just being retarded or something how does the Sun heat this
*  heat the earth up but not the moon like why the moon coat move doesn't have an
*  atmosphere the atmosphere is what captures the heat but yeah that's what
*  captures it but so the heat ain't out there in space well the heat is on the
*  moon the moon in the Sun it's 250 degrees and in the shade it's 250 degrees
*  below zero so the moon never turns neither it's always like just stuck in
*  one position yes and it's it's the moon is stuck in one position right I'm trying
*  to picture it hold up this the moon the earth and then the Sun and then the Sun
*  revolving around the Sun the thing is the moon revolves around the Sun like
*  this like it's always doing the same thing right so it's a piece of the moon
*  is hot there's a the Sun if you get in the Sun the Sun spot the bright spot of
*  the moon it's 250 degrees if you get in the shade it's 250 degrees below zero
*  it's a giant so there is a Sun part yes it gets very hot in the moon the thing
*  is they're protected or they're not rather they're not protected by an
*  atmosphere so we have an atmosphere the atmosphere the the magnetosphere the
*  oxygen the nitrogen all that stuff filters out all the heat and captures and
*  keeps us steady that's one of the reasons why we're here
*  it's great we understand why the moon yeah because I but the moon is diving I
*  understand how the moon is important for the ocean and all that but I'm just
*  wondering I was sitting there watching on my favorite movie interstellar and I
*  was just yeah that's a good movie and I watched it underrated it's definitely
*  it's really very very light like it's pretty much what it is but I was
*  watching that and I'll watch it in a mankind that new one that's on Apple
*  Plus I was watching that it's on the moon and I'm just looking at him like
*  where the Sun it like and if the Sun would start making me think like that but
*  I ain't know I appreciate you telling me that now I can look at it some more see
*  there's no atmosphere and the atmosphere is the reason why we have blue skies the
*  I know all that so I thought that was I thought that was stopping it from
*  burning us up no no no no no no so that's not it stops us it helps us from
*  getting burnt because we have an atmosphere yes but the moon there's the
*  moon it's hot as fuck yeah that's what I'm saying so so the moon is hot it do
*  get hot on the moon and it also gets insanely cold okay if you go in the
*  shade it's fucking cold as shit 250 degrees below zero you ain't never want
*  to go out of space yeah I'd like to go and just see I'd like to go over the lip
*  that's my goal that's my goal that's my my goal in life like I just want to do a
*  selfie with the earth behind that's gonna happen that's it that's gonna be
*  available real soon yeah I've seen it's like 250 now right is it saving up is
*  that what it is now I think according to take you on like Virgin Virgin yeah you
*  get to go out there and then come down like so this is something they're
*  already doing I'm in sort of sort of paying attention to find out that day
*  I am buying a ticket for any problem I definitely won't want for real like yeah I'm
*  gonna do it I'm gonna start a go fund and tell them to put me up there tell
*  the black people to put me up there for how long have they been doing this I
*  don't know there's another company I know than and there's doing they have
*  a race as a platform race for outer space man so is this the Virgin Jet this
*  is the version show yeah there's another code that's got like a balloon that's
*  gonna shoot people kind of straight up and come back down yeah that's all that
*  rides on see how it did that it rides on top of a plane and then let's go yeah
*  he's fucked to me if I had money like that I would be kind of like this look
*  where they go holy shit like you get to go like like a rollercoaster like two
*  lips up there maybe like 10 minutes maybe that's my goal right there not a
*  lot that's all I need right there just to talk shit and stunt book
*  you motherfuckers ain't never did this though that would be the ultimate stun on
*  there stun above the earth that shit hard as fuck and I want to prove to all
*  the flat earthers that's dumb fucks I want to show them so bad you stupid
*  motherfuckers yes I want to do that so bad shit on them it's so I can't believe
*  that's a real thing me neither man cuz like I well live in I got a house in the
*  Bahamas like you went at nighttime you can really see how round the earth is
*  because it's so pitch black and when you walk out the yard at night it feels like
*  you out of space and you can really see how round the earth is listen is damn
*  this stupid how people don't don't believe that is right like this it's
*  just people want to believe shit is a trick people want to believe everything
*  is a lot even didn't think America was here when it was over the years like
*  true it is yeah so it's just like people think out of space we don't think it's
*  hard to think that far as then you think therefore you got to think about it no
*  one think the people that didn't think America was here at least they have the
*  benefit there was no photographs they had never been you know anybody who's
*  been so it probably was way more of a question whether or not America existed
*  versus whether or not the earth is round the earth is round you can see it it's
*  not hard they have satellites that take a photo of it every ten minutes the idea
*  that all that's fake it's so crazy the idea that every mission is fake every
*  space station mission every satellite all that's fake like why these guys the
*  end the weird thing is a lot of the dudes that are doing it they're like
*  super Christian a lot of flat earth people yeah they're super Christian they
*  think that this is all like the idea that we're in space that we're on a flat
*  balls to keep us from God like what it doesn't make any sense you have to keep
*  yep I mean religion and I do believe in religion but their religion you have to
*  keep them in a certain space to keep their mind focused on that right there
*  because otherwise they so you can't tell everybody everything no because then
*  they'll go crazy that's why that's why I believe in religion I really do for
*  normal people I know you say it gives people help it gives you the hope
*  anything that's gonna bring you to love and peace you can't be mad at yeah you
*  I feel like it's it's like something that helps evolution almost like a
*  vehicle for aiding evolution to take us out of our barbarian days into our
*  civilized days and then transcend but this is religion what we're doing right
*  here I think so I know so because it's with we're conveying and talking and in
*  preaching pretty much this is I mean this is our evolution of I believe where
*  we're at we're at the evolution of entertainment and conversation is like
*  our Bible and that's what we're doing with social media and I tweet my shit
*  like that like I tweeted thinking like a hundred years from now somebody gonna
*  read this shit like we read Hieroglyphics okay so I see what you're
*  saying so it's our all of our way of talking shit out and figuring things out
*  the same how religion was and that's why they established these parameters yes
*  because you understand all right if you'd to go this way this is what's gonna
*  happen so I got to tell them this so they it's like a child you're not gonna
*  tell them all the truth because if you tell them they ain't ready for it and
*  that's what religion is like I ain't gonna tell them that that God was I
*  mean that Jesus was really a regular person because if you do ain't nobody
*  gonna trust no regular person I got to make this motherfucker amazing walk on
*  earth walk on water then you'll trust it yeah you know I'm saying but if he just
*  like me and you he fuck up no one wants you don't want to see a fuck up yeah
*  especially back then when everybody knew that no one knew what the fuck was
*  going on and they were you know they made up I mean not that any of the gods
*  aren't made up but they'd make up gods they were god for thunder the god of war
*  the god of this the god of that and all these gods battling out over destiny
*  they were just it was bored yeah that's all that shit that's what all this shit
*  come from boredom this shit we doing right now this is boredom yeah for sure
*  this is I mean it is funny that what people do today when they talk is kind
*  of like they're trying to figure things out and reestablish that like that's one
*  of the so much change going on with the way people communicate man the thing
*  that fucks us up is our brain for sure we are more nature than we're more this
*  than we are this this is like this is just oh everything we talking that we
*  just speaking just talking just talking shit we done thought a thousand times
*  regurgitating but what really makes us how we move yeah what we do you know it's
*  about how your actions your actions really much your creatures of habit you
*  know that's what really tells you like I'm talking all day I can say I'm a good
*  guy but if I don't show it I ain't that person you know yeah and the other thing that you just said
*  what creatures are how we're creatures that's the other thing like human
*  beings want to think of ourselves as something separate we're definitely
*  the exact same thing everything do yeah live and die we just do it weirder than
*  anybody else we do it weirder than everybody else that's the I bet every
*  other creature be looking at like look at these motherfuckers yeah yeah all they
*  do is get up shit fucking that that's it get high play video games do they get
*  movies animals no oh yeah yeah we're they're saying us like fight care about
*  shit that don't matter we fight we fight for sport but this the most entertaining
*  shit of I wouldn't get this shit up for nothing no it's enjoyable we're at a
*  great time too I love watching this shit I love life that's the only reason I
*  want to live long because you enjoy it I want to see how this shit gonna play out
*  how do you think it's gonna play out you never know it's all about humans
*  emotions because it can go either way but I know I mean I think it's gonna
*  play out weird there's not gonna be it's not the same world that it was 50 years
*  ago it's not gonna be the same world it's gonna be a totally different world
*  and I just want to look at and be like I remember I did that one day I was at um
*  in Vegas at um what's that place where everybody be performing Dreyus Dreyus
*  Dreyus was at then you know they got the outside club and I'm looking at it and
*  I remember going to Vegas 20 years ago and like I'm like damn this shit look
*  like the future like now it looks like how I thought it was gonna look 20 years
*  ago and I was thinking about all the people that didn't see this mmm right
*  right shit yeah I gotta stay to see how this shit gonna be after this like I
*  want to I want to see even if I'm locked y'all like this here I just want to see I
*  want to have and have my memory that's my that's all I want yeah if you can
*  take a performer from the 1950s from Vegas the old-school performers like
*  you know Frank Sinatra and bring him to 2019 they'd be like what the fuck what the
*  fuck happened they'd be like what the fuck someone hands him a pamphlet of
*  girls that'll come to your room like what the fuck it would be a different
*  world man it'll be shit what is it gonna be what's it gonna be 20 50 years from
*  now I think humans gonna all be one like men women it's gonna be one we gonna
*  evolve into one like aliens yeah like when you see those alien little gray
*  guys they always have no dick we getting close and closer like even if
*  you look at Asians you can't really tell a boy from a girl you really can't
*  like they all look like they got the same structure like they so they've all
*  and I think Asians the oldest people on earth so they've all way before so we
*  come around to it all right well they there's crazy thing about they
*  definitely a hundred years ahead of everybody on earth well they definitely
*  are for technology for all the things they created they mean we talked about
*  this yesterday like a million firsts came out of China everything came out of
*  China man like they ahead of us they were way ahead they were ahead of with
*  gunpowder they were ahead with everything that's why that's why life
*  you won't see how the future gonna look go over there yeah you'll see it future
*  looks overpopulated that's how I think about a miracle Hong Kong protests no
*  protested in Hong Kong for how long now months for what for months well their
*  their government is changing they used to be under British rule now they're
*  under Chinese rule and that happened I think in the 90s and there was a little
*  in the 90s whatever it was it was there's a there was a there's a lot of
*  issues with the Chinese government running them the way they run China and
*  the people from Hong Kong wanted to be back the way it used to be when it was
*  run by Britain and they're extraditing people they're doing they're doing
*  things where and then the protests have been violent the cops have been shooting
*  people it's like a lot of crazy shit and then there's a lot of video of this and
*  the the streets are filled I mean just filled with people protesting every day
*  and it's it's I mean it's not something that comes up too much in the news how
*  often you hear about this in the news what can we do about it though it's good
*  question we just watch play out just like we do with the with everything else with
*  Vegas and that's why I don't get too much into that type of shit because if
*  I can't change it it's like what the fuck I'm gonna do the only thing I could
*  do is change what I think the future gonna be that shit there's some shit
*  that was planned 50 years ago that's true you can't change it but it's also
*  true that's fascinating is it yeah to me it is it's cuz I'm watching I just think
*  it's right over or a group of people with no power try to overcome a
*  tyrannical government that's happened before and in other in other countries you
*  know it's happening plenty times and some won some lost it's just you got to
*  figure out what if you're trying to make it not happen to us we got to figure out
*  why it happened like this and try not to to make that happen over here for our
*  butterfly fit yeah well that's one of the reasons why a lot of gun advocates
*  are very happy that there's not very happy that is happening but you happy to
*  use it as an example of what happens when you have an unarmed population and
*  an armed military that sort of tells it what to do and there's nothing you can
*  believe in gun law I just don't see the point of like cuz at the end I don't
*  like if you put the who not who not gonna get a gun now if you make it
*  illegal right the people that should get exactly they're gonna get it we can get
*  the legal guns anyway not me yeah not me but I mean you can get legal guns
*  anyway but the people the people the law abiding citizens you make that law
*  nice they can't get one yeah so it's stupid at this point and then people can
*  YouTube and make a good like it's just stupid yeah it's just like that when
*  they make them with 3d printers yeah I seen I seen it on YouTube yeah but
*  remember there was a guy who got in real big trouble because he released the
*  designs remember that Jamie I think was a torrent torrent was it supposed to be
*  and I think they were arguing that you should be able to do that essentially
*  plans you can go out another country and make a YouTube page and do it like it's
*  this the way the world is so connected and far as kind of you could do pretty
*  much anything you want if you know what you can do yeah no nowadays oh that was
*  a good tweet you could do it what I said you do what you want anything you want to
*  do if you know I'll watch this and then and then post it about 34 minutes in
*  you you didn't smart start smoking weed to four years ago yeah that's crazy I
*  never smoked I never drink I mean I drunk every blue moon like on my
*  birthday but I don't drink I hate liquor hate the way it tastes so what happened
*  with smoking yeah um well well when I was younger everybody did it so that was
*  one reason I didn't want to do it because everybody was on drugs and all
*  that my daddy used to do crack and all that so I was I was against drugs so as
*  I grew up I just never gave a fuck about it as much as everybody else did but I
*  used to love the way it smell you know like I love the way it smells I used to
*  be in the room just smelling the shit and then after a while then once I got to a
*  point in my life I was like I can't fall off right this is the worst my life gonna
*  gives like all right I tried and then that was the best thing ever happened to
*  me trying that shit when you tried it were you like what the fuck was I
*  thinking yeah I should have been doing this yes because when I first did it I
*  didn't get high cuz like I tried to get the soft shit I was scared like I was
*  like I'm just gonna do something and I was like shit ain't doing shit I smoked
*  everybody that was with us you know I was just smoking smoking smoking and then
*  once I started really getting into it I was like this shit is really what's up
*  like what are the laws down in Atlanta I don't know
*  oh it's so stupid it's illegal everything is stupid man all this shit
*  just make all drugs legal well this the only thing that's gonna stop the cartels
*  I don't know what this shit I just smoked but that shit good as hell yeah
*  that's Kevin Smith shit that's uh what is he called Jamie do you know J and Bob
*  they all have different little names on them I think that shit has some what's
*  name on it for sure Snugans this one says Snugans this shit good in the bitch
*  this is the Indica one oh you smoked the Indica one black ones in yeah I like I
*  like black I like Indica's Indica's you like they to me they like slow me down
*  that's what I need that's what you want that's what I need I really do need it
*  this does slow me down I was way hyper I was doing way more thinking too like I was wild
*  about too much shit you mean no not too much I was just wild like I don't even
*  say wild in a bad way I just say I was saying way too much I shouldn't be
*  saying that especially this day and age when people be in their feelings and shit
*  you know not that I give a fuck but when you're trying to help people you want to
*  teach them the right way so what do you think happened like what you just said
*  the people in their feelings today like what do you think happened why do people
*  get so sensitive because we're attached to our emotions more and we don't do that
*  much thinking you know I don't think we changed social media yeah a lot of it
*  but I don't like to blame it on social media because it's just an evolution
*  because they say the same thing about television and all that shit but I just
*  think it's the use of it to the to the public I think that's what it is I think
*  now every person and it opened up our minds and it's just new to the society as
*  one but over time it evolved and we'll get smart enough and figure it out and
*  it won't be that much we still learning humans are still learning their feelings
*  now I mean especially in America they're still learning their feelings like Asians
*  ain't got their feelings no more so now we just said our stage of still learning
*  our feelings and hating each other and all that shit there once that does settle
*  and it'll come evolve naturally Louis CK had a real good point about this he was
*  saying that it's like what you have on Twitter we've always had it's just
*  people talk like sometimes people talk and they say shit that's stuff that's
*  dumb they say nonsense he goes no but this is kind of like the same thing
*  they're just talking exact same thing it doesn't mean anything it's just all
*  everything is down thing we all want the same thing we just want to package
*  different and that's what I learned on social media that's why I was on it
*  quick because I learned it I figured it out I'd seen like oh shit this is a new
*  real estate yeah this is where it's going so I I knew what I applied that to
*  the social media and internet and and that's that's how I work so good for me
*  it's the same thing because it's nothing changes you just got to figure out what
*  it is and take it from the old you apply to the new I feel about it like two ways
*  I feel well I enjoy social media I think it's a good thing overall but I think
*  that all the complaining is because people getting there they have a voice
*  now that they never voice before and they also get rewarded for complaining
*  yeah right people but it don't last long doesn't last long it filters out but
*  it's also annoying so eventually what happens is people gonna wake up to it
*  and what this is is just a new it's a new level of communication because
*  everybody can communicate now with almost everybody it's real close to
*  everybody to everybody but it's getting better though because ten years ago they
*  was real sensitive I remember on Twitter but now we got points like like now
*  people like Dave Chappelle could put out a special talking real shit yes and people
*  take it for what it is well five years ago you had to be like Kevin Hart you
*  know so it's like now you can really speak your mind so it's evolving people
*  getting it's like it did bring out the the whole ass motherfuckers at the same
*  time after why you like all right now yeah like Bill Bursch it that shit was
*  genius to me like he can say that now like five years ago that special
*  wouldn't have worked as much as it would have got beat down but now it's like I
*  the tides turn yes turning so it just it just takes time it takes time for
*  people to get it takes time people to warm up to what they don't want to
*  accept yes I 100% agree and I think overall the more reasonable way of
*  looking at things is gonna prevail because the the dummies won't be the
*  cream arrives at the top you just got to be patient yes just gotta be patient and
*  yes trust me I know I'm a patient motherfucker we are with those Indica's
*  yeah I love this shit Indica's a that's a patient type of weed mm-hmm how long
*  you been scuba diving about ten years now yeah about ten years and this that's
*  where I learned about life through scuba diving yeah scuba diving let me know I
*  didn't know shit how deep do you go down how the deepest I've been like 130 but
*  ain't nothing down there when you get to that point ain't nothing living down
*  there only thing you might see is shipwrecks and shit like that but so
*  fucking deep yeah it is hundred and thirty this is you there you go from his
*  page oh so that's from there and take pictures yeah that's an iPhone down
*  there or no that's an Iceland no not that deep that was the take the tectonic
*  plates mm-hmm where you could touch the only place on earth where you could
*  touch North America and Europe oh my god what if they ground right way and
*  and honestly you can't I don't even think you could do it no more because
*  they say it's it's sprays a centimeter every year some shit so it's separating
*  the part like pangea right you know the theory of pangea all the continents at
*  one point in time a long time ago they actually can piece them back together
*  and form one land yeah I saw that yeah but that's what that's another piece of
*  where still splitting as we speak yeah this motherfuckers moving that's always
*  finding shit right there always finding they're like off offshore find a city
*  they find some it's there's a lot of places that we don't know oh for sure we
*  we more into business than we into life well especially this aspect of life that
*  things are constantly in transition and constantly changing when you find cities
*  under oceans when you see shit like this here you didn't think you know we
*  thinking backwards like it's like we should care about this more than we care
*  about that cuz natural disaster shows us every time it's like we ants well you
*  live in a good spot boom you're living in Atlanta I mean you have to deal with
*  hurricanes should that hurricane almost hit me in Bahamas my house did it hit
*  not move the last day it was coming it was coming directly to my house and it
*  10 miles up in this my 10 10 20 mile and he had Abaco and all that shit how much
*  of the Bahamas got hit they're just the island of I think Freeport and Abaco
*  Abaco got hit real bad though like that shit like natural disaster type shit
*  like wiped out right wipe out type shit like are they getting worse do you think
*  that hurricanes are getting worse I don't know I think just life it nature is
*  doing what it's do it's nature and it's like that's like that's like a little
*  grasshopper saying you think that you think the humans are getting worse like
*  he can't control us and we can't control nature yeah but these fucking hurricanes
*  are I think what's causing them is the ocean water and it's definitely warmer
*  it's definitely that I mean that's that's just what this earth is it's
*  going to definitely die do something eventually but there's nothing we can do
*  to stop it we can slow it down that's why they're trying to find other earths
*  so we can move at this motherfuckin go somewhere else yeah we so far away from the earth
*  ending too in our lifetime yeah even though I do believe we need to save the earth
*  more so than anything well we definitely need to save it for ourselves it's gonna be
*  fine if we go extinct yeah yeah yeah it's gonna be fine with or without us
*  yeah even if we blow ourselves up it's gonna be fine earth gonna be okay as far
*  as life yeah we got to save life that it would save this process no signs of
*  life volcanic eruption kills five eight missing this morning earthquake yeah New
*  Zealand people on it what happened eruption kills five eight missing people
*  died on a vague they were on top of a volcano I was like watching the news as
*  us yeah they had three tour boats that were there there's like up to a hundred
*  people that were there right before it went right before exploded like oh my
*  they would take tourists into the crater where you could be like oh look at look
*  at a bubbling and people were two tour boats had just left that's why they have
*  this video of it going off like it's literally like they're right there oh
*  fuck there's one boat of people that was still there and that's why people have
*  this in our world baby yeah you can't say eight missing that's eight dead
*  people yeah they took some drones and we're trying to like see if they could
*  go everybody's there you know it's so crazy though America hasn't had one yet
*  that fuck us up mentally like we're not ready for it like other countries they
*  get them bitches every year yeah we ain't ready for it that's I mean in the
*  Bahamas it happens so when this is worse as ever happened but it happens so much
*  that you you understand you're not big as nature America hasn't had it there's
*  definitely spots that don't like LA LA does not have it but Mount St. Helens
*  had a big volcano eruption back in the day remember a bunch of people died not
*  modern-day time yeah yeah it was like 1980s I don't think in this society man
*  they could we couldn't do it when was Mount St. Helens eruption there's no way
*  to get everybody out the way neither now good for how much we try to plan it well
*  the big one is Yellowstone that's not my earthquakes no volcano there's a
*  volcano eruption in 1980 Mount St. Helens in Washington State I remember that I
*  was a kid that was big one man that was like right before I was in ninth grade
*  so I was probably in eighth grade when this was going on getting anybody there
*  oh yeah a bunch of people died yeah it was a scary one is it a city no no it's
*  a mountain you know but there's enough people that live near it that got
*  jacked well you look at all the like if that hurricane would have hit New York
*  that would have fucked up America oh yeah yeah I don't even think they realize
*  if that hurricane with what it did I was up there when it when they hit it wasn't
*  bad it was a tropical storm but what do you remember when Tribeca flooded a few
*  years ago in New York remember Shane Smith from Vice had a video of it during
*  their hurricane it was during after one of the storms and the entire area Tribeca
*  was like underwater like people go in their apartment complexes the first four
*  feet of the lobby would be filled with water so you'd be sloshing through water
*  to get up to the stairs elevators down that kind of shit so just imagine the
*  hurricane hit that exact a real one that's what I like the one that hit the
*  Bahamas they understand how to live and keep and bring it back
*  Americans don't even know how to do nothing only people that would be I
*  probably the Amish hmm if technology starts from scratch it start from scratch
*  again yeah we'd be fucked man like we don't know what to do hey my daughter I
*  had I got an old-school like a 75 Caprice it wasn't my 72 my 72 Caprice I
*  had my daughter in my car she didn't know what this was rolling down the
*  window rolling down the window like motherfuckers wouldn't know what it did
*  motherfuckers like matter of fact funny Andrew I was trying to get directions
*  here cuz my shit was fucking up it was so weird he'd give me directions by voice
*  all right you gonna see a light you gonna turn left you got the old-school way
*  like oh no we don't even know how to use those little simple things like we
*  don't know east west north south when I first used to get gigs I used to get a
*  notepad and they would call me up on the phone they go okay here's the directions
*  you're gonna take the this to the that you're gonna take that for six miles and
*  that's how you got to every gig you got a dur and you would write the direction
*  down a piece of paper and I would have like a folder for all the different
*  times that I went to these places I was just one of the reason why be I get
*  where I live on the island allies to keep my mind on some regular shit like
*  my mind is if I won't need on this island I don't really need it yeah I
*  learned how to so if worst-case scenario happened I could still survive so if you
*  get stuck on the island the rest of the world fall apart after if the rest of
*  the world falls apart I could still survive like an Amish motherfucker yeah
*  that's saying I know how to cook like like killed animals and shit like that
*  cuz I ain't good at that yeah I still want to learn how to how to clean a
*  deer I want to learn how to do that type of shit but but for the most part I can
*  get some fish I know how to fish yeah well in the Bahamas that's all you're
*  gonna need anyway right yeah and chicken chicken chicken and fish chicken and
*  fish and you could probably have chickens just run around out there's no
*  predators right mmm snakes what have I seen out there it might probably you
*  know rich mother might be bringing some type of animal up there they put pigs
*  in the wall and shit oh that's right oh that's right those are that's the place
*  where is that the Bahamas where all the wild pigs are they come up and people
*  feed them yeah it's a tourist spot now I remember I used to go there it was used
*  to be just me and the pigs getting high really how long ago was that about five
*  years ago when I first started cuz that's the first place I went back when I
*  started smoking when I start smart I want to go everywhere I went before and
*  get high there and that shit was one of the places why do they have wild pigs
*  swimming around the tours and they get tourists there really it's just like in
*  scuba diving they start just throwing shit in the ocean and what like like
*  little statues and shit throw it in the ocean and you go look at it and people
*  be just for pictures oh so they put it in there to try to get more people to
*  scuba dive yeah it's stuff and shit yeah and then it ended up become a coral
*  reef and shit like that over time so it kind of is good but at the same time
*  it's really that's the only reason why they put it in there pay people to pay
*  for toy it's a weird way to get people just throw pigs in the ocean it's weird
*  that people will go all over the country yeah people I've heard people talk about
*  in LA pictures on my Instagram on the pigs those pigs will fuck you up too if
*  you have if you're around them you don't feed them they'll bite you in your ass
*  that's a pig yeah maybe fuck motherfucking be picking them up taking
*  pictures you know that's so dangerous yeah they'd be fucking with them they
*  gotta stop but I'd be seeing them trying to they'd be trying to get them drunk and
*  shit you gotta stop that come on come on so they feed those pigs every day is it
*  that like a daily the tourists do I mean so many tourists come in there they give
*  them stuff don't lose bread and she's they're almost tame oh yeah they kind of
*  done evolved with it then they they used to it they come in this swim then they
*  got iguanas on that I think Nicolas Cage used to own that island but he
*  probably sold it look at that yeah I took that picture that's a great picture
*  man do they get food what do they eat out there told you like just bring
*  that's all I know so it's just what the people give yeah and they have tourists
*  tourists on tourist boats every day on how they control their population how
*  they keep them from exploding what you mean pigs make a lot of babies yeah and
*  they eat them which they do when the mother get be alright next oh so the
*  people on the island eat them okay they still pigs I guess I mean yeah it's
*  still bacon yeah so they feed them that's kind of a wild way to grow home
*  that motherfucker look like a tiger I just looked at this look like tiger pigs
*  they do it weird yeah you know that happens to regular pigs if you let them
*  pigs do look nasty but they so fucking good mean delicious huh like the bacon
*  yes good as fuck I had some bacon recently from pigs that they gave
*  chocolate milk and hazelnuts too they fed them chocolate milk and hazelnuts
*  and do it taste better was I don't know I don't think so I think it just tasted
*  like bacon it's like a Ferrero shade bacon forever know what those little
*  things are called those for I don't know how to say it it's a hazelnut chocolate
*  thing like that okay yeah I know it's a rare Roche yeah okay yeah I don't know I
*  don't I can't really determine what that tastes like but it was just bacon pigs
*  have a lot of babies man what's weird about the pigs is they're all one thing
*  like wild pigs and domestic pigs they're all the same thing oh yeah they just get
*  weird when they go when they get wild their body changes their hair grows
*  longer their nose grows longer the tusks grow longer just from being wild and it
*  happens like immediately they could be out there for a couple months so just
*  naturally does that yep take a domestic pig you let him go and live in the wild
*  when he knows he's on his own there's a shift that happens in his biology and
*  his hair starts growing thicker and his nose starts growing longer that's what
*  scientists can use that for something yeah for people that's what we go out
*  there we just go naturally grow horns and well we're gonna get meaner we're
*  gonna revert back to what we used to be when we had a hunt and gather yeah the
*  hood that's what the hood is now and people mad at us yeah that's what the hood is
*  yeah life this I forget the quote somebody somebody made this quote
*  maybe it was George Orwell or someone famous that if you get a man
*  sufficiently mad you can see the caveman in the red gleam of his eye something
*  along those lines the idea if you push person far enough that's why people are
*  always fascinated by survival stories yes like that part where he beat him so much to
*  where he ended up just being like a pet yes you know it's the same thing you you
*  can do that that's what anybody you just mold them how you want them after why
*  you mold them to what you want them to be hmm that's why that movie was with
*  that show that's what we do in stand-up that's what we do in everything
*  entertainment we we mold how we want how we want it to be yeah how we see the
*  world what we want what we want is the world to be do you ever think of stand
*  up as mass hypnosis I don't know what that means you know what hypnosis is
*  that maps of mass like mass oh oh okay yeah yeah it you have to put people on
*  the hypnosis yeah that's why if in most comedy clubs the bars outside of it
*  because it takes away the attention and all right hey I thought you said mass
*  of sources I was never heard it feels like hypnosis yeah in the groove it is
*  like that because and that's why you hate when somebody talks or because it
*  throws you out of the yeah other hypnosis and it's the people near him out
*  to yeah that's the real problem yeah it fucks it up for the people need you see
*  people you see him turn their head away yeah that come on shut the fuck up you
*  see that it's an art and it takes time but it's hard now because people don't
*  care about art no more some people do like that dude who paid 120,000 dollars
*  for a banana tape to the wall that was promo that was promo it was right that's
*  why we're talking yeah I wouldn't talk about that's why I never post about it
*  see I know what I'm doing I don't talk about shit I don't want to promote you
*  see the other dude ate it some other guy pulled it off the wall and ate it and he
*  said that was you don't keep talking about it huh yeah it is promo you're
*  right but it's funny because now that promotes another person to do it yes you
*  see that is the ecosystem that's why I try to watch what I push because I know
*  how stupid people are oh that's an idea let me put a naked woman there on tape
*  on the wall either like it's true do stupid shit making sense yeah that
*  actually makes a lot of sense it was called comedian okay what was called
*  comedian the art piece yeah he's gonna keep talking about it he's gonna talk
*  about it more look at him you ever go to the LA County Museum of Art good don't
*  go there if you hate that banana you'll hate that place this fucking LA County
*  Museum of Art is one of the weird just like some of it is art some of it's
*  interesting shit and then some of it is like there's one of them there was a
*  plexiglass box that was on the ground and I literally I thought it was a seat
*  like what is it somebody sit on they got some crafty way said no no that's the
*  art piece mmm so I go well what is that supposed to be and it's like well the
*  artist wants you to interpret you know whatever is in that box is the art
*  whatever it is you it's up to you like what I interpret this mind I would have
*  walked off with it that's how you do it. Interesting. I think it's bolted down. I don't think you have the first idea of that.
*  It's dope man. You got some dope shit man. Thank you. Thank you. Is this the clock from back to the future?
*  No it's a there's a guy named TGT studios and he makes these dope clocks you
*  want one I'll get you one man I want everything you got in this motherfucker
*  the flame throwers. The flame throwers out of sale. They sold out of the flame throwers. That's dope though man. We ran out of gas on it too. You got a dope life man. I envy people that just can do what the fuck they
*  want how they want you know I envy that. Thank you. Because I have to think about
*  what I do because I have to think about the people under me mmm so which I
*  don't what I do I just feel obligated to. But how does that stop you from buying a
*  clock? I'm talking about being able to do what the fuck you want like like this shit
*  is that's what I feel when I'm in here just like hey you can tell he really do
*  what the fuck he want yeah I do what the fuck I want don't get it twisted but I

*  blessed. For sure if you're listening to this you're blessed. You're alive today
*  you're blessed. It's 2019. If you're breathing you're achieving. Yeah I like it. Come on. That's some Joel
*  Olsteen shit. That's me smile bitch.
*  That's a great fucking song. You got a lot to be smiling for. That song is the
*  universe song. That was from the universe. Yeah. Yeah that was all the universe. That
*  was put out there for the universe. I love to see what it did. That was the
*  dopest shit. It's a great message. It's a fun message. It's great to see what it
*  did just the people just how it brings people together how it just when people
*  tell me what it how it got them through what they doing or just seeing older
*  people seeing people from from babies to 90 years old just enjoying it. It's all
*  you want it even as a comedian as an entertainer see people just enjoying it
*  and enjoying it for the right way and what you put it out there for. Yeah. You
*  know you're like damn this shit working. That's the best part of what we do. Yeah.
*  The best part is you know well for me is like like you like I really do what I do
*  for other people because I don't got everything I wanted you know it's like
*  now just all my agenda is for the betterment of other people as a whole.
*  That's what I want to see. That's your ultimate your ultimate goal. My ultimate
*  goal. Yep. My ultimate goal is to have a little bit of a little do-volve in
*  everybody. I feel like if everybody act like me the world will be perfect.
*  It'll be a more fun place for sure. You're making some good points. I'm
*  thinking about Hong Kong. What the fuck can I do to help Hong Kong? Nothing. Shit. I'm thinking about it.
*  You can't do nothing at this point. You can do something like if you implement
*  the best thing we can do in life is just be the change you want to see. Just be
*  that. Everything we are is what we saw so you have to give more examples of that
*  move in the movement that you want others to move and it trickles down
*  over time and the butterfly fit. Everything is the butterfly fit. That's
*  real. So if you're trying to change that's how you change it but in the
*  meantime that shit gonna happen. I don't know who right or who wrong. Depends on
*  which side yo. That's the second one. Don't know who's white or who's
*  wrong depends on what side you're on. Lil Duvall. Bars. You can see that like
*  in a like all black screen white letters. Fade black in the beginning of a film.
*  You ain't hit the J no more. I know give me that lighter. I was just starting to
*  think that. Starting to sober up here. I'm high as a bitch.
*  As Kevin Smith we just legit a bit. Did he say that some crazy amount of THC?
*  It's like 40 something percent THC. I need some more of that. Kevin's another
*  one. He didn't get high until a few years back. I don't know what happened.
*  All of a sudden he went from never getting high to getting high all day every day.
*  That's what I am. I love to get high. It's my pastime like I needed at this point
*  just to pass through life. It's like alright. I only do it when I ain't got nothing to do.
*  Which is most time. Most people ain't got shit to do. We just do. Do you get high
*  before you do shows? Yeah. It was one time I just like that shit whatever it was I was like no I
*  can't keep doing this. I gotta wait till after. When I'm by myself I just have this. Sometimes
*  too when you're traveling you're already like a little fucked up in the head. Like your head's
*  always kind of a little foggy. Plane rides. Getting up early. Not enough sleep. That kind of shit.
*  Then you have to do a show. That's why I got a plane now. So that made it a lot easier. Do you
*  fly yourself? You actually fly don't you? I try to fly. I'm learning. That's why I just I bought
*  a plane and learned as I go. What kind of planes you get? I got a Baron 50 and a Baron 55 and a
*  Cessna 421. And you learn how to fly them? Yeah. I know how to take off land and do all that but as
*  far as like really paying attention and that's where it's hard for me still. I'm still trying
*  to learn to pay attention and learn what's what and knowing when shit out. Instrumentation.
*  Yeah learning when shit broke. Because the motherfucker do break and I wouldn't have known
*  if my own pilot wasn't there. Oh really? Yeah because I don't know. I'm still learning. What broke?
*  A lot of things. Them shit break like a motherfucker. Every time I land there's something on that
*  motherfucker. Really? Yeah but I'm blessed the way I can afford to do it and it pays for itself
*  kind of in what we do. So I like it though and I like the fact that if I like getting more people
*  like me into it you know I think because I think a lot of black people need to get into it more so
*  because this shit been going on for a long time and for it to be going on so long we not into it
*  as much we should I think that's a problem. But aviation's freedom. It's man it's the most freedom
*  I mean you got a three-dimensional road in the sky you go wherever the fuck you want. But you don't
*  know that though until you do it. So is this this is you right here? Oh yeah. And this is uh that's
*  my baron. So is this propeller driven? Is it a jet? No this is an engine just just a regular engine.
*  But is it driven by a propeller? Yeah yeah two two continentals I think they've got continental
*  engines in them. So those are supposedly the best if something goes wrong because you can still kind
*  of land them. Yeah they best they say it's always best to have two engines because my first plane
*  I bought had one it was a Piper and and he and that would be cool too because it's a lot of land
*  to land on on the earth but I used to go to the Bahamas and he was like if you don't want to be
*  over that water with just one engine so I was like all right you're right so I got the planes with
*  two engines on them so if one go out that bitch will still fly. I got video of that on there too.
*  Go to my rich broke page rich broke air. I got pictures of that showing with the plane flying
*  with one with one um engine plane. How long have you been doing this for? About a year that I had
*  this plane for about a year now about a year and a half maybe. So right when you started flying you
*  just went ahead and bought a plane? Yeah right when I bought a plane that's when I that's
*  because that's my way of getting into it because I don't know I didn't know how to get into it.
*  I was like I'm buying it and I've bumped my way into it and that's what I did. I found somebody
*  how did I find that guy in the Bahamas I think I rented his house out or something he said I'm a
*  pilot I said for real I'm trying to buy a plane and that's the conversation bumped into that but
*  is that there right there with the uh fly rich broke air. No that ain't it that's my old. Go to
*  one of the last two posts on there you can see you can see where the propeller now. And this old one
*  is the one that had one propeller. This the one that had one propeller. Yeah you don't want that
*  right? You went to rich broke air? I found something on twitter. Oh yeah go there instagram my fuck.
*  I can send it to you I think.
*  It is kind of amazing how few people learn how to fly. Right yeah that'll go right there I think.
*  That's it with the one of the engines out. Oh shit so why did it go out? Did you just show it?
*  Yeah just showing that it can still. Dude fuck that what if it won't start back up again? Well
*  the other ones. You can still land. Now the only problem now is you got to watch like if now that
*  shit don't cut if that bitch cut off while you taking off you're gonna you're gonna crash. Yeah.
*  So you you want to watch your way you know that shit there and make sure the engine's running.
*  Have you had any close encounters? No. No close calls? I should say close call. Close encounters
*  are like aliens. The only thing I might have had was uh
*  uh nah he never had nothing really happen. So everything smooth? No problems? Easy landings?
*  Uh my first plane as soon as I bought it as soon as it landed that bitch cut off. Really?
*  Soon as it landed. My first plane but it was an old old motherfucker. You don't want an old
*  fucking plane. Honestly you do. All these planes I'm telling you I'd rather an old one than these
*  new because the new ones are still trial and error and they crashing and all that shit there.
*  Oh like the 737? Yeah it's like those are still using new technology you want some shit that's
*  been there for like 30 years. Most of these planes you see now they old they're like 80s and 90s.
*  Really? Yeah most of them golf streams unless you get the new one but the ones the rappers
*  renting them some old 90s golf stream but they still nice and they still good if you keep them
*  up and then most of them they ain't keeping them up. I keep my plane up more better than most of
*  these these commercial planes. I flew here on the commercial that motherfucker sound like the
*  transmission was slipping. What the fuck? Oh I do not want to hear irregular noises on a plane.
*  Let me see the plane.
*  Oh my god.
*  Burr flies helicopters. I went out with him. Who? Bill Burr. Oh for real? Yeah he took me all around
*  Malibu right after the fires. You get to see everything that was just devastated. That's
*  dope. That's crazy to see. That was one thing about here that humbled people up let them know
*  that nature's real is the forest fires the wildfires were out of control here last year.
*  We got we got it we got it I think I think we need to be humbled as a country as a whole honestly.
*  I don't want to prey on it for us but we need something to humble us towards more so life than
*  money. Yeah and I think a natural disaster. Yeah it was. We don't have no choice. Do you remember
*  post 9 11? Do you remember what happened? Yeah. The way the country changed. Yeah I was I was supposed
*  to be doing carolines. Really? That day. Wow. They I'll probably be opening up for earthquake. I was
*  in St. Louis and I got stuck in St. Louis. Wow. And we had to drive a Greyhound back. Wow. That was
*  the longest ride ever. But that changed the way everybody was for a little bit. Yeah it made you
*  realize nothing else matters. That's when you realize what really matters. Well that's when
*  people oddly enough that's when people are happy. Yeah. People are happier when they've survived
*  something rough. That's what island life living does for you unless you you understand what
*  matters and what don't matter. And that's what America needs. A little humbling. Just humans
*  need it in general and when we get out of control we're like spoiled brats. A lot of countries got
*  it. Like I say islands get it. You know what I'm saying. I mean you always gonna have corruption
*  and stuff like that there but for the most part they get it more than we do. Yeah. They're in tune.
*  Yeah you're in tune. Nothing comes before nature. Yeah island people, Hawaiians. Hawaiians are like
*  that. Very I mean as a culture. We got to detach from nature now. Yeah. Where we don't we don't
*  need it. We think we don't need it. Right. You know so that's that's where we got fucked up at.
*  Yeah. We need to humble back for a second. No I think you're right.
*  I think you're right. I just don't want it to have to happen.
*  Me neither. Not on my watch. I don't feel like going through it. I honestly don't. Like I'm
*  really on that type of time. I'm like shit I know it's gonna happen. That's why I try to practice
*  now and prepare myself. What do you do? Live on the island and chill so I can be prepared. I don't
*  want to be culture shocked. I don't be culture shocked when the shit like the lights go out.
*  You be like oh shit you know the first five minutes you cooled and like 20 minutes later you're like
*  all right all right get me up out this motherfucker. Turn the lights back on. Put the generator on.
*  Yeah. Like even on the island the shit last time I was there all electricity they cut that shit off
*  for like three four hours just because. They don't be having no reason but they just cut it off.
*  They say they fixing shit but they don't be fixing shit. Well weren't there there was a big lawsuit
*  about brownouts in California. They were doing it on purpose. They were just shutting down giant
*  wasn't it part of like a negotiation or something? I'm trying to figure out what it was but it was
*  criminal. No it was a bunch of years ago. Well see I just use it as a way of all right this God
*  will show me all right let's see what you can do without this. You know it's kind of my way all
*  right I can't use the phone. It's stunning how quickly you feel weird. Yeah. All the powers out
*  now everybody has no power. No one has any power. Whoa. Just practice it but you practicing in that
*  goddamn tank. What's that thing you think tank? Sensory deprivation tank. Yeah like that's just
*  meditation like you get away from everything. That's why people like camping. Yeah. Because
*  camping is like hey this is what it's like you know this is what it's like if you live outside
*  in your little cloth house. Man if you go outside and leave your phone for about 30 minutes or hour
*  the grass start looking greener. It's like you start really seeing shit you know. Yeah.
*  It's just maybe it be through the shrooms or something but it just everything's enhanced
*  is when you put that down for a little bit. It just takes too much your attention. Yeah. It takes
*  all that attention. Mine too. Yeah. I try to put more into it than I give then then it feeds me.
*  Yeah. You know. It's hard. It's just sometimes you just bored you just want to find out what's
*  going on in the world. Yeah but you got to put your nature back. I try to put my I try to put
*  it's still humanity back into it you know because you can use it for good to put it back out so
*  shit we doing it now. Yeah. Yeah we're doing it now. It's just you could listen to this while
*  you're in nature. Someone might be on a run right now in nature. Listen to this high as fuck.
*  What's up boy.
*  What's up boy.
*  But that's an amazing transition between No Weed and Four Years Later.
*  Full blown. All in. I went the same way in the beginning but for me it's been more it's like
*  20 years now. 20. But it's the same thing you know. I just thought it was for losers.
*  And then as soon as I did it I was like oh I can't believe I was missing out on this.
*  That's how I felt about shrooms. Oh yeah. Shrooms is really drugs. That's what
*  that's that's like everything else is synthetic of that.
*  That's what you realize oh this is what they trying to imitate. Yeah that's what they're trying to
*  get. This is what they're trying to get. They're trying to get to this crazy place where you're
*  interacting. But I don't like to promote it though because it ain't for everybody.
*  No. Like everybody shouldn't do it. I used to think everybody should. But I think your
*  audience is okay. That's cool. I'll talk about it. There's five guys out there that shouldn't do it.
*  Yeah but. I used to think everybody should do it too but then people with schizophrenia
*  could become a real issue. Yeah if you're not if you're not at peace. Yep. And you got to really
*  be understand when you see things because sometimes you don't come back. You know what I'm saying. Some
*  people don't come back. Yeah. You got to be able to. Yeah. You hiding the bitch. Just give me the
*  box. Thank you. It's not that bad. Just a little splash on me. But yeah it's some people don't come
*  back and you know famously. Yeah. Acid. Acid does a lot. That's why I don't fuck with acid. I mean I
*  can't. I don't fuck with nothing that people die from. You know I don't fuck with nothing that I
*  can't see came from nature. Yeah. It's good. That's only weed and shrooms. That's as much as that.
*  That's a good call for everybody just as a general rule. You know don't fuck with anything that
*  doesn't just come out of the ground that's natural. Especially when something like weed or mushrooms
*  that has thousands of years of use. And has shrooms. Like you're right. Like weed you realize like
*  there's something for everything. Like any other drug you got. They got a strain or something
*  that'll give you that same stimulant. Same thing with shrooms is just like
*  man that's the only time I feel like I eat bad. When you're on shrooms? That's how I know that
*  shit really. That shit is just like that shit is amazing. It's even hard to explain because this is
*  like this shit is fucking amazing. It's pretty amazing. What's amazing is that it's been around
*  for so long and it's still illegal. So guys like you have these crazy experiences. It's legal
*  in Colorado now right? I think Colorado did something to decriminalize it but Oakland
*  famously recently decriminalized everything. Ayahuasca, mushrooms. What is Ayahuasca? Ayahuasca is the
*  edible form of DMT. It's a drink that they take and like Amazon indigenous people have invented.
*  I think somebody just told me about that. It's real simp. It's not similar to mushrooms in that
*  it's obviously a different thing but it can be insanely potent from what they say. I've done the
*  synthetic form of it which is DMT. I haven't done the ayahuasca which is the edible form of it. The
*  edible form of it is like supposed to be like more mild but last longer. I just haven't had a chance.
*  When you do it let me know. I'll let you know. Let me know what it is. Everybody loves it. I know
*  a lot of people have done it. Has anybody ever died from it? No. Maybe like one person
*  ever. There's someone who died recently from it. I'm still on certain level. I'm still probably
*  at level two or three with shrooms. I ain't even went all the way yet. What's level two or three?
*  How many grams you taking? The most I've taken and this was by mistake like four grams because
*  I missed and put the scale on the wrong thing. That's a good solid dose. Yeah that was too much
*  for me. That had me so emotional. I've never been there. I've never laughed and I'm a comedian. I've
*  never laughed so hard with that day. I was laughing. I was crying. I was just and it wouldn't stop.
*  It just wouldn't stop. It's just laughing, farting, peeing. I just couldn't control no type of
*  it. All my shit was just like and it felt amazing. It was just like amazing.
*  After that I couldn't do it. I was like I can't because I couldn't shake it. It just wouldn't go
*  away. It lasts about seven, eight hours. Wow. That's another thing about shrooms. They do last a long
*  time. Long time. Ayahuasca is shorter than that apparently. I like it for a long time. I like it
*  but I only do it like once a month because I can't go through that emotional roller coaster so much.
*  It's fun but it's like a ride. It's like all right I don't want to do it no more but I can do it like
*  once a month. Maybe two grams and I fucked on it one time and that was good but I didn't do that
*  much. I could fuck on it when it's just a little bit but when it's a lot I can't. I ain't even
*  thinking about fucking. I feel like I'm fucking. It feel like fucking. That's what it feel like.
*  I'm just thinking about it now. I'm going through my mind. I'm sorry. No, no worries.
*  You know there's a lot of people that think that's the origins of religion. It is. I think the
*  origins of that and zodiac. I think zodiacs is really real religions. I think we really are our
*  signs in some kind of way. The stars and all this shit connects. Like real astrology. Yeah,
*  I think it all connects. I wish I knew enough about real astrology to make fun of it
*  but every time I start talking shit about astrology I'm like I don't really know that much.
*  I don't know shit about it neither. I'm learning as I go. I'm looking and I'm paying attention. I'm
*  just going by observation. Right. See scientists will tell you it's nonsense but are they sure
*  like there's so many weird factors that they're taking into account. The moon is in this and the
*  Mars is in retrograde and Venus is. Oh that retrograde shit. All that shit they're taking
*  into account. Is that even real what they're saying? I kind of like I was saying earlier
*  I believe we are more of our nature than we are what we think we are. So I think if we're connected
*  all together. I'm trying to think how to articulate. Good. I've been working on this. That's why
*  I went back and watched Illa Sella again because it's kind of like that. But it's like
*  like say for instance a dog before it shit it turns around like that just natural. Right.
*  Like we do certain things natural that we don't even know we do but if you understand the
*  connections of that you can kind of use it to your favor and change everything.
*  To recognize your own patterns. But I just ain't figured out. Yeah I ain't figured out how to use
*  it as my superpower yet. Like I'm trying to figure out how to use it and you know how people could
*  take numbers and they say numbers do shit in the world or certain things. I think there is that
*  in nature you know. You just got to figure out like which time. It's kind of like even the social
*  media I kind of do it just let nature take its course and do certain things in life. I'm not
*  even social media just in life. I kind of let nature take its course. I plant the seed and
*  let it grow you know and it kind of does what it do. So in the same sense in life and I don't know
*  I got to figure it out a little more. I got to do more research with my words. I know what you're
*  saying. But I think I got it. I think women are more powerful with it than we are. They have more
*  intuition towards it. Yeah they just don't know it. Like if they knew how to control that shit
*  they'd be like Gene on X-Men. You get what I'm saying? Yeah I do. Yeah. You ever heard of the
*  I Ching? You know what the I Ching is? I Ching is an ancient Chinese method of divination
*  and I think you like would ask questions and throw these stones and there's all I think there are
*  hexagons. I think that's what they are and they have different marks on them and they read these
*  marks and it's supposed to predict things and it's they've had it's been around for thousands of
*  years and it's really complicated. It's a bunch of different stuff. Do you have what it is?
*  It's just the charts that yeah this is very visual so cool. It's gonna be tough but pull up one of
*  those charts. This is well when you throw the three coins you get a number. Yeah. That number
*  then correlates to this chart and then you get this symbol and I'm gonna imagine then you take
*  that symbol and then it equals one of these things. Wind, heaven, lake, fire, thunder, earth, mountain,
*  water and then I don't know how there's a lot. I think like charts are very big. Like say for
*  instance if I knew the charts thing I could know when to be at a certain place at a certain time
*  to get a certain type of energy that I want. Yeah. Something like that you know what I'm saying.
*  Like it's I can't explain it but it's I'm still trying to learn. Well there was a guy named
*  Terrence McKenna and he was this very famous psychedelic philosopher dude and he studied
*  the I Ching for a long time and he had some really wacky ideas but one of them was he thought that
*  I Ching was a map of time and that that's what it was created for and that we're just we don't
*  really totally understand it yet and that what this method of divination the reason why it's so
*  effective is somehow or another through these things and viewing these things you're actually
*  having some sort of an impact. Yeah. It sounds like total nonsense like hippie bullshit. No I don't
*  because people crystals. Shit I just lost my train of thought. It's like when you
*  we don't you know how when like 20 years ago the stuff that you know now it was still the same
*  shit but you didn't have a clue about it. Right. I'm trying to think how to explain it in lamest
*  terms like like back in the day like we used to wear baggy clothes you know hip hop we bagged in
*  the motherfucker now that I look back I was like this shit looks stupid than the motherfucker but
*  I was blind back then but I really would because I had on what I had on but I was blind in the
*  motherfucker. It happens with people how about cell bottoms? But I'm saying in this in the yeah even
*  in bare bottoms now you look back like what the fuck do I have on but in your mind so what I'm
*  saying is in our minds we really are really blind it might be something right here we're just not
*  paying attention to it because our minds ain't got there yet. Right. You get what I'm saying? I do
*  get what you're saying. So and I said that to say because when you said we just ain't figured out
*  the methods that you say that we we ain't figured it out yet it's there right in front of us we
*  just gotta we gotta stop overthink because it's really simple everything is simple we just over
*  think it think about the car car had all them different components to it now it's just a laptop
*  now simple and we could have skipped all that if we would have just had our minds right where it's
*  at now. Go from the Model T to the Tesla. Yeah and go to just just be me up. Right. Be me up. You know
*  the shit sounds so far-fetched but now it's like that shit probably could happen. I think it's
*  gonna happen but I think it might not be really happening when it happens. I think we might get
*  locked into some sort of digital realm that's what I think. I think we are in the digital world that's
*  where all this shit coming in we've all become in digital so we can go somewhere else. It's closing
*  in on us like you said your brain is now the cloud. Like we're just a piece of nature like we think
*  we're just the evolution of the next thing. Humans like we're not even supposed to be humans.
*  All right I'm going to fuck we're going to we're going way too. There was a guy named Marshall
*  McLuhan and he said human beings are the sex organs of the machine world. That's it. That's it. That's
*  it. He just worded that shit. Yep. It's like we really think we're important but we're really
*  just a step in between another step. Yeah we're the what was Elon Musk calls he calls us the organic
*  bootloader for our artificial intelligence. What he thinks is that we we are here to sort of give
*  birth to artificial intelligence and it's going to take over from there and then it'll be the new
*  life form. I wonder if that's on the way and like the gods are looking down on us like these dummies
*  are worried about global warming. They got about 10 more years of people left. Or somebody from another planet watching us as a show and is like look at them.
*  Look at them they over there doing this shit again. Dude I had that guy in here yesterday.
*  Are they looking at this world like oh they finally figured out how to get to the Mars.
*  Think about that. I got this book from this dude. The author S.C. Gwynn was in here yesterday. It's
*  Empire of a Summer Moon and it's all about the Comanches and the United States fight against the
*  Comanche and how long it went down and then at the end of it by the end they had defeated the
*  Plains tribes. You just get this horrible feeling of how all these people got wiped out. Their way
*  of life they had for who knows a thousand two thousand years is now gone completely. Like
*  that could be us and that could be us by our own doing. I mean that's happening. That's happening
*  in Egypt. Yeah. That happened in Egypt. Oh that shit just done. Yeah. So I mean this happened in
*  what's the story in the Bible? Shit. I forgot the story. Which one? The one where they
*  Sodom and Gomorrah when they cleared the whole place because they saw there was like Babylon.
*  It was fucked up. Oh I know what you're talking about. Sodom and Gomorrah. Right. Right. Right.
*  It was so fucked up over there that that guy just washed the whole place up. Yeah what was the
*  place? Shit. What happened when Sodom and Gomorrah? Oh my Christian. Sodom and Gomorrah. Those are two cities.
*  That's what they're walking away and he said don't look back and one of them looked back and he
*  bombed the place. Yeah. It's over. That's the story. That's what the story says. I'm not saying it's
*  facts. I mean but it's something probably like that happened. That's because they were all naughty.
*  That's what's hilarious. Very naughty. That's what's hilarious. Not a butt fucker and shit.
*  That's just hilarious. What kind of a weird god?
*  It's the problem with. I don't think god. I think it's more just as a whole just how everything
*  evolves into you know you put something there and see where it rolls. This is what I shit rolled to.
*  Like what the fuck? That's what came out of that shit? Like that's what that's why I say you really
*  can't predict because that shit can roll into anything. Right now it certainly can. You know
*  what I'm saying? Like especially at this moment like at the shift we are as far as in the big
*  picture we had a shuffle like at the beginning of the century of 1900s. We had that shuffle now.
*  I think we're one or two big inventions away from being unrecognizable. One or two big ones. One
*  or two big ones in maybe 10, 20 years and things could be unrecognizable.
*  To the robots too? I think that if all we have to do is get to a point where there really is an
*  artificial intelligence and it can make choices and it can think for itself. I don't know how
*  long that takes. Maybe it takes 30 years. I think they're doing it. I think that's here now. I don't
*  know if it is but autonomous artificial intelligence that can move around like something that's built
*  like a person or a dog and can move around and run the world. I went to this expo in Japan and I saw
*  something damn near like it. Yeah they're close. They're getting close. I don't think they're there
*  though. I think for real artificial intelligence I think they need more more time but all that shit
*  is happening so quick. They're developing quantum computers. Google now has quantum computers.
*  That's just like man this shit been going on. I didn't realize till I started flying planes.
*  All that navigation shit was there 50 years ago. What navigation satellites? Yeah the satellites,
*  all the stuff we're getting on on GPS now. Really? GPS that's on our phone. When was that invented?
*  Shit I don't know. When was it? Dude I had GPS on my phone in the 90s. On your phone but I'm
*  saying even before my car. Even before your car. That's what I'm saying. Even before your car.
*  They was in planes. 73. Yes. Started by the U.S. Department of Defense in 1973. The first prototype
*  spacecraft launched in 1978. The full constellation of 24 satellites operational in 93. You got to
*  think they had facetime on the moon. Like it had to be so that means it's been going on.
*  So this technology been going on. So just imagine what they got now.
*  Yeah there's probably some shit we don't know about. Yeah they got people morphing into animals
*  around this bitch. You think so? You never know. Never know. Stay woke. Stay woke. I'm telling you
*  you never know. You never know. You never know. Man the world is amazing man. This shit is dope.
*  Did you hear the shit that they announced that China had created human pig hybrids or monkey pig?
*  Monkey pig hybrids? They make hybrids out of anything now shit. You can hybrid anything.
*  Who knows what they're going to do man. Who knows? People just doing anything. Putting
*  their shit in the pot and just they're doing that with humans now. I want green eyes. I want tall.
*  One day they're going to have an artificial body. There's going to be a company that's going to
*  have an artificial body that works perfectly and they can guarantee that they can take your brain
*  out of that artificial body and put it in this new perfect body. Take it out of yours. That's
*  like the movie Serigant. And they guarantee you you'll live longer. You get an extra 150 years
*  with this artificial body. Would you do it? I'm a moron. I would definitely do it. Would you want
*  to live forever? No not forever. Me neither. But I would never know when to end. That's the thing.
*  There's like a parable about that about some guy who lives the hundreds of years but he has
*  to kill his kids in order to do it. I think True Blood was kind of like that too. That movie when
*  the motherfucker was the vampires. He got tired of living. He's like all right this shit boring.
*  Well that was in the- Could you imagine seeing people complaining about the same things for
*  hundreds and hundreds of years? Plus you got to kill people every day. Here they go again.
*  Here they go again fighting for their rights. Here they go again tired of this shit. Here they go
*  again. Because you go through the same shit every 20 years. Yeah. You probably get tired of killing
*  them too. People that's 90 years old tired of hearing this shit. People 80 years old. You just
*  laugh at the young people going through their shit. Here they go. Did you ever see Interview
*  with a Vampire? I don't remember it. It's that Tom Cruise Brad Pitt movie that Kristen Dunst-
*  Yeah but I don't remember it. Should I watch it again? It's a great fucking movie. I got to watch it again.
*  But the whole idea is that part of it is that these vampires have been around for hundreds of
*  years and they're starting to get sick of it. They're kind of freaked out. Yeah that's how True
*  Blood was. They're tired of that shit. Makes sense. My grandma is mad. She alive. Really? Yeah. My
*  grandma from Bahamas. She be like depressing. Because you got to think about it. When you that
*  old, you the only one around. You ain't got nobody to talk to. Nobody to give a fuck. Your kids want
*  to come over there to take pics, photo ops. Nobody give a damn about them. Right. You know so like
*  and this is a true story. She passed out in the garage and stayed there because she thought she
*  was dead. And then she realized she wasn't. Got up and walked away right back in the house.
*  Wow. So you don't want to be here? That's why you want something. You would, even if you don't
*  believe in God, you would want something after this. You be like, it got to be something after this shit.
*  I want it to be. You would want to think something after this because this is boring at the end.
*  This don't end good. It doesn't end good. Shit. Some people think that for sure nothing happens.
*  And that to me is just as dumb as thinking for sure something happens.
*  Man, who knows? Either way, I'd rather be right than wrong. Shit. Shit.
*  I'd rather believe. And you're like, nah, you ain't believe. I told you, I believe.
*  When you see a dead person, it seems like something's gone.
*  I swear to God, when one of my best friends, a comedian that passed, died, that's when I was
*  like, oh, nah, this shit has got to be a God or something because I saw it. You feel they're gone.
*  And that when I was in the room with him, right on his deathbed, I saw it. Like you could just see,
*  and you could see that they see it because he really, at the time, he asked me to play
*  smile bits for him. And I played it for him. And then after that, he tried to pull the thing out
*  of his mouth. Right after that. And the funny thing about it, I didn't think it was like,
*  I didn't see it as no suicide thing. It was just like, you could see that he saw, all right,
*  next level, I mean, next step. You get what I'm saying? So I didn't let him do it because I
*  didn't want to see it. I said, no, no, I pulled it down and told his sister to come in. But
*  it's just, you really see it then when you're in there and you see life and see where it ends.
*  It's not a bad thing. You just see like, this is what it is.
*  Yeah. This is what it is. It comes and goes.
*  Comes and goes. I mean, there's something next, I hope.
*  You know what someone said once, and one of the Gracie fathers talked about this too, said,
*  he believed and he lived his life, Ilio Gracie, lived his life like you have to get everything
*  perfect. You have to do everything the right way. Or you come back and you do it all over again.
*  Yeah. That's how karma, that's how people in Indonesia think. And there's no crime over there.
*  None. Where I was at in Bali.
*  Well, it's a great way to think.
*  It's a perfect way to think.
*  And if it's right, I mean, maybe that's what you are.
*  Because think about it, even if it ain't right, you should think that way. Because if you thought
*  that way, if you thought you come back looking like an aunt, you ain't finna be doing too much
*  crazy shit. You're going to do right. You're going to do right by people in the best way you can.
*  Well, that always makes me think like someone like you, like how many times have you done this
*  ride? You know what I mean? Like maybe some people just maybe the dumbest people amongst us are just
*  they're just new on the ride. That's what you know what, that's the best way to articulate it.
*  Because it's like to me, my whole life, like this shit is so simple. But to everybody else,
*  it's so complicated. Maybe you've been on the ride a lot. Maybe you've been on this ride like
*  a thousand times. That's crazy. If it's real. And look, how many times you think you've been
*  on this bitch? I don't even want to think. But life makes, none of it makes any sense. It doesn't
*  make any sense that you and I are making noises with our mouth and we both know what we're saying.
*  And we're laughing. We just met, having a great time, smoking weed together, talking shit. That
*  doesn't make sense either. Like life is bizarre. So if life this way, this way that we live, which
*  is really interesting, if this goes on forever, like I enjoy life and I know you do, right? Enjoy
*  it. It's great. But if you told me it was going to go on forever, I'd go fuck like this just goes
*  on forever and ever. That's going to give me anxiety. So it's just don't say nothing and just
*  let the spirit. But if it happens again and again and again and again and again and again
*  throughout eternity, if that's what life is, if you just live this life over and over again,
*  why would that be scary? But it would. It'd be scary because if maybe I enjoy this life,
*  but I want to think that there's something better. But if it's just this life over and over and over
*  again until I get it right, why is that scarier than doing it once? Because it's not scary to do
*  it once. Like right once, like right now, I'm having a great time. You're having a great time.
*  Jamie's having a great time. We're having fun, right? Why wouldn't I want to keep doing this?
*  But if I knew that it was going to happen over and over and over again forever,
*  I'd probably freak the fuck out. But that might be what life is.
*  Yeah, that's definitely what life is. It could be. And it's just as weird as life itself. It's not
*  weird. It's great when you look at it as beauty. It's just like I look at it like this, like certain
*  things I'd never asked for or thought would happen, but it happens. Certain spirits is just
*  going to come towards. That's why I think we're more spirit than we are anything else because
*  where I'm from or where you're from, we would have never met. We would have never
*  met. But even when we just come in here, we can vibe and it's just you can feel it. I can feel it.
*  You can just feel it like damn, this shit's supposed to be here at this time, at this moment.
*  It's just all a part of the moment. You get what I'm saying?
*  I do get what you're saying. It's like there's a process going on and all the ups and downs.
*  Yeah, like we just talking, but it's a process in the spirit that's using us at this moment to get
*  whatever they're getting out of it and then go somewhere else.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I wish I could draw it.
*  I know what you're saying. I've thought about this before too because I've thought that ideas,
*  imagine if ideas were a life form. I mean, an idea just comes in your head. Say if you have
*  an invention. That's what the internet. In a lot of ways, right? I think in an idea in general,
*  it might be a type of life form. What are these ideas? I think this is sativa. I don't know what
*  that is. Give it a shot. What was I just saying? I swear I had a point.
*  Ah shit, my bad. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to throw you off, bro.
*  I was trying to be a good host there. No, it's all good, man. I was just vibing.
*  I completely forgot what I was saying.
*  Fuck, what did he say? It was important too, apparently.
*  It kicked me in that report.
*  It'll bump back in. Just vibe with it. At the end of the day, I do feel like
*  it's bigger than us. Even us two. It ain't even about this is about whatever this spirit
*  is going to take to something else. Whatever that is.
*  Well, one of the things that I think is great about cool conversations-
*  Stuff we can't even articulate.
*  Cool conversations like this that we could get and put on the internet, it's a fun conversation
*  and it makes people want to have more cool, fun conversations. It makes people better at it.
*  I think that talking is in a lot of ways like an art form.
*  People can talk and it's annoying, but they're expressing. It's their self-expression,
*  even if it's just regular communication, where some people can talk. They can tell you anything.
*  And their voice is so cool, you want to hear them talk about everything. Tell me about some other
*  shit. I don't think I talk that good when it comes to shit. I'm good at just conversation talk,
*  maybe. But conversation talk is what everybody wants. You're authentic.
*  That's what people want. People want to hear a guy talk like you that's just talking the way you
*  talk rather than someone who's talking like a newscaster or a morning radio personality.
*  But I think people need more to see how people move by actions. You need to see.
*  Because I could talk, that's like a preacher. A preacher could talk you out of all your money
*  if he know how to talk. That don't mean he's a good motherfucker.
*  That's true.
*  I'd rather a person judge me off my actions more than my words. Because my words might offend you,
*  you might get pissed off, but my actions never... None of my actions are going to show a flaw in it.
*  None of them?
*  And if they is, I can accept my flaws. I can say, yeah, you right. Yeah, I did that.
*  But for the most part, genuinely, I'm always moving in a way to where
*  I'm not trying... I'm just moving in a way of a good way in the space of
*  more benefiting you than me.
*  That's beautiful. I believe you too. I can tell you are on that kind of a path. But the thing
*  that I was getting at in a way is that both those things are important. The way you talk
*  is very important too. Because the way you talk, it affects young people in particular. It's cool.
*  I'm listening to you philosophize on things and just relaxed approach. If I can't control,
*  what the fuck am I worrying about it? And that is a message that a lot of kids could use.
*  Somebody just said on my Instagram today, they said I'm like the Robin Hood of knowledge
*  for the hood. But they said, hold up. And I was like, damn, I like that. And because it
*  do feel like that, I feel like I'm able to articulate it for people like me to get it.
*  You get what I'm saying?
*  100%. Yeah. But also, you don't have... There's nothing about you while you're trying to talk
*  where it's contrived. Robin Hood of knowledge.
*  There's nothing about the way you talk that's contrived. And that's what's lacking. What people
*  are lacking is people... It bothers people. When you're talking to someone and they're doing like
*  the morning news guy voice, you don't even know who the fuck that guy is. You have no idea. And
*  that's a style of talk that they make them do if they want to tell the news in the morning. But
*  you don't have a goddamn clues to who that guy is. When you talk about something, you have zero of
*  that. You have zero of that fake thing that you're trying to project out there. The fake thing's a
*  weird thing. Ladies and gentlemen, very good to see you this evening. We're having a wonderful
*  time here at the show. And you see darkness behind that guy's eyes. He's talking like...
*  But you know what that is? I think that comes from where I had no choice but to be myself. I
*  countermolded myself. I never was raised with rules. So now trying to be fake... It's harder
*  for me to be fake than it is for me to be real. I be trying to put on the face and it don't work.
*  I be really wanting to be fake because it seems like it work for other people, but I can't. I be
*  trying to. So it's easier for me to be just genuine. Because I'm not good at lying like that.
*  It's definitely easy to be genuine, but it's hilarious that you tried to be fake. How would
*  you ever try to be fake? Because it be working for niggas, man. I be like, shit. What did you do?
*  What did you do where you tried? Just trying to go in the room and do the industry talk shit and
*  act like I care. I don't give a fuck. It just get boring and shit. Thank God. Thank God you're here.
*  I never gave a fuck about... I never gave a fuck about... The only reason I won't be famous
*  is just to be with the people. I never gave a fuck about the industry part of it. Like that.
*  Maybe because I've been doing it a long time now in my world. Maybe that's what it is. It don't
*  intrigue me as much. It's like fucking a bitch a thousand times. Maybe that's what it is. But
*  I don't know. Shit don't do nothing for me like that. What does it do? What? The
*  the entertainment part of it. It gets me to where I can get to the people. That's what I use it for.
*  Like I love the people for real. And then the funny thing about it is like I recently found out
*  Harriet Tubman is my aunt. Like blood aunt for real. So it kind of makes me like... So that's why I feel
*  like that. Like I do like helping people. You do like helping... She's your great aunt? Yeah. On my
*  granny side. My name's on the statue. Hold on. I got that too. Let's see. My brain. This is my brain.
*  Your brain's on a statue? No I'm saying I got my brain. No man. I'm saying I got the statue in here
*  in my brain. My brain is in the eye cloud. Your name's on the statue? Yeah. The brain's on the eye
*  cloud. Yeah. My name's on the Harriet Tubman statue. Have you always been like that? Or did that change
*  at all when you started smoking weed? No. I was always loved people. I've always... That's where my
*  name come from. Just representing Jacksonville. Duval. I've always did that. So whenever I can't
*  rep it, it's in my name. So it's kind of like psychologically for a person that's from there,
*  it makes them see something because you are what you see. So that's why I always use that name.
*  Really? Yeah. To elevate the people from where you came from. Yeah. That's beautiful. That's a
*  beautiful name for a name. That might be one of the best names. Duval? Yeah. Because of that,
*  the sentiment behind it is one of the best names I've ever heard. I love that. I love that you're
*  doing that. But I love the thought behind it. That was the whole thought from day one. I mean,
*  I've always knew I was... Even where I grew up, I always knew like, I ain't supposed to be here.
*  Like, what the fuck am I doing in this shit? But then I was like, maybe God put me here to see this
*  shit for that reason. To get out and tell everybody that you can get out too. Not just to be
*  an example, you know? Because I mean, I think the world's going to evolve how it's going to evolve,
*  but I don't want the people from where I'm from to get left behind too. So it's just like, all right,
*  let me show y'all what's going on so you can get a chance to be in this same situation.
*  Just to see the world a little more. So that's why... Behold, let me find this... That's a great
*  name and a great reason for a name, man. Yeah, but Harriet Tubman. So it just... The Harriet
*  Tubman thing just made me realize like, damn, that's why maybe I'm like this. It just all goes
*  back to the nature thing we were saying. Like, it's in us over time. You start realizing.
*  That might really be where it does come from. I mean, who knows where personality traits like
*  that do come from besides learning from the people around you? And my grandfather, that's not even
*  like my blood grandfather, because I grew up with three granddaddies and I didn't realize that wasn't
*  normal until I got older. But he was always in the community in Jacksonville. So I think I get a
*  lot of that from watching him growing up. Yeah. Yeah, if he's a mentor figure and you saw the
*  benefit that he got out of it... I don't even know if I saw the benefit. I just think it just
*  comes second nature. You are what you become. I mean, you are what you see in this.
*  That's just the way I move from around older people. Like I've always been around older people
*  and then I think older people, people that was raised by older people, they end up being all
*  right because older people teach you the right values in life. My first friends was old people.
*  They used to have bridge parties and shit. Here it go right here. I'm gonna see what you got.
*  You know, the shit in the brain has got to remember like, oh, let me think about it.
*  I think. Seriously, what data plan are you on? This is the slowest I've ever seen a photo come
*  up. I told you I got a quickie. We're still waiting on that line. Oh, the line? I forgot
*  I was about to fucking line. Oh shit. Hold up. Y'all gonna think I'm lying and shit. Okay,
*  what do you got here? Oh, that's the wrong one. That's what? That was the wrong one. Oh no.
*  Fuck, I had just posted on... Well, that's the monument in Bristol, Pennsylvania, some shit like
*  that in Bristol. And is it just her living surviving relatives on the monument? Yeah,
*  yeah. All the names of the people that... Wow. Look at my name. Look at that. That's all my
*  mom and my sister, my nephew, all of us on there. That's some dope shit, you know, so I can talk shit
*  about that too. For sure. You ain't got nobody great grandma, Harriet Tubman though. I wonder
*  how much of that actually gets in your genes. I think all that do. Just like an athlete.
*  It's like athletes. The next athlete be better and better and better. It's like that. It's just
*  natural. It's genetics. It's just natural in you. I think so too. It's like spirits. It's just
*  natural to spirits. We probably met four spirits ago. Probably. Yeah. Yeah, like maybe we're out.
*  If we are both living the same life over and over and over again, we've probably done this
*  a couple of times. Yeah, maybe so. For sure. That'd be dope. Come back the next lifetime.
*  Well, there's people that you run into in your life where you do feel like they're supposed to
*  be in your life. There's people that you run into like this person is me, I'm them, we're family.
*  You know that and you'll keep that forever. I got friends, long-term friends for 25,
*  almost 30 years that are family. They might as well be me. You get to that point with certain
*  people where you know them and you love them so well. How does it feel like over 50? You think
*  that's because over 50, it makes you feel like, all right, I got to be friends, keep the friends I
*  get close by? No. No. That's one thing I don't worry about. I know I'm 52. Are you worried
*  about being alone? No, not right now. Maybe one day I would be. But right now what I'm worried
*  about more than anything is just keeping my health. Just make sure I exercise and eat correctly and
*  take a lot of supplements and make sure I keep my health. To live two more years longer? Not even
*  that. Just maintain quality of life. See, everybody's worried about extension. You can get hit by a car
*  tomorrow and be in the best shape of your life. You look like Ronnie Coleman when he won Mr.
*  Olympia. Still get hit by a car and die. I think happy people live the longest. I think they live
*  longer. I think how long is longest? Even if you're pushing 114, if you're dead at 112 or 114,
*  you're not going to fucking care. The end is near. Yeah. But I mean most of the people I see
*  that's older, that's genuinely happy and moving and healthy looking, they're happy. They always
*  be the moving ones. They be happy. Like the ones that's, they be like that. There's a lady that
*  goes to this yoga class. It's like cancer. Yes. Yeah. Well, specifically exercise. You can see
*  people that are in their 70s. They're still fit. They're still exercising, still working out. They
*  don't have a problem when they can't move around. When you get too old, your body starts to fall
*  apart. One of the biggest problems is you can't get around. Let me ask you this. This might be
*  weird or stupid. Turtles live like a hundred years. A lot more than that. Well, however long.
*  Yeah. They don't do that much moving. It's true. If we didn't do that much movement,
*  we could live longer. I don't think that's how it works. But I do think it has an impact,
*  a slight impact. I mean, because it's like we're using, it's like a car engine. You keep running
*  it hard. It's going, no matter how much it's helping, it's going to hurt it more than it's
*  helping. There's a statistic about professional athletes not living to over a hundred and how
*  many professional athletes die before they reach a hundred versus regular people. I don't know.
*  Tall people don't live long. Right. Too much distance. Yeah. Find out how short people live
*  the longest. I'm good. Like that's why I ain't tripping. Y'all got to worry about y'all health.
*  You got to worry about that shit. That's true. Really tall people. What is the average age?
*  What's the oldest professional athlete has lived?
*  Borderline. They have been around for a hundred years. Right? When was professional
*  ad support started? That's a good point. Bill Russell got to be the oldest athlete. Tall
*  motherfucker. He the oldest tall motherfucker I've ever seen live. He looks perfect. Him and Kareem.
*  He looks fine. Oh, that's Kareem. He's old, man. He was in a Bruce Lee movie. Remember?
*  Yeah, he was. There's three football. What is that? Game of Death? 98, 97, 96, a couple
*  91 year olds that were playing football. Football players. Whoa. But what's the percentage of that
*  though? But you know what? When they played football in the 20s, they had those bullshit
*  helmets. You couldn't just clash into each other like today. See? But see, when you little,
*  you don't have to worry about all that. Oh, what? We're going to live. We're going to live.
*  All we got to do is just be happy. Yeah. Think about all the old people short. That's true.
*  There's a lot of short old people. Not a lot of giant old dudes. No, ain't too many big old
*  motherfuckers. There's too many fat old motherfuckers. No, that's a- B.B. King might have been one of the
*  last ones. He lived a long old fat life. Yeah, a lot of them died really young. Like Ralphie May.
*  Yeah, rest in peace, Ralphie. Rest in peace, Ralphie. Ralphie was in his 40s, right?
*  John Candy, I think he was in his 40s too. He was a big guy. Man, I don't even get into like when
*  people die the age, because we all, I mean, I know they say too soon. I don't really know if it's too
*  soon or too late, because at the end of the day, it's still all like 100 years in the mix of 100
*  years. Just do what you can while you're here. Yeah, do what you can while you're here. Don't sweat it.
*  Don't try to change things. You can't change. Hell no. And that's the big one. The big one you
*  can't change is your own fragility. Where you get that from? The Game of Thrones or some shit?
*  The clock? Yeah. No, that's from Russell Bilt, a dude on Instagram who makes dope custom metal
*  clocks. He does everything himself. He welds it together. I got to start getting, start some dope
*  shit from, I don't be accepting stuff like that, because people won't stuff back. That's a problem.
*  People want stuff back. Yeah, it's like, if you're going to give it to me for me, and if I choose the
*  poster, I might, but don't, I don't do no promo shit. I don't know the last lost, I mean, I don't
*  want to say messed up, but a lot of money I turned down just because I don't do that type of shit like
*  that. I don't do it either. But I've had people send me things and then send me a script. Could you
*  please put this on social media? Like they wrote it for me. Holy shit, this cool exclamation. Like
*  literally, they write it out for you. I'm like, what are you talking about? They make it bad, man.
*  They don't care. They don't care. They're just trying to get your, something from you to help
*  their business. That's, they don't give a fuck about you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I hate that. Like I'm,
*  especially me, I do shit really from the heart and I do it because I want to do it. I don't expect
*  nothing in return. So when people don't have that same type of mindset, I don't want to help them.
*  Exactly. Like you can get it how you want to get it, but I just don't feel, because you're not good
*  for the ecosystem. Yeah. Fuck it up. That's true. If you're around people that have that negative
*  mentality, it is a drain. It's not an asset. It's a drain. It will fuck it up. Yeah, man. You got to
*  keep genuine people around you. I try to just keep that spirit, like, or keep it going that way. Like
*  I try to put that still in Andrew too. Like, Andrew's a, I fuck with Andrew Schultz, man.
*  You're a good guy. Andrew one of the funniest motherfuckers. I put, there's two people I put up
*  that I think the funniest people, him and J.Ske. Them two motherfuckers. And I ain't just saying
*  because they're my friends. They are my friends and I might be biased, but I still would put them up
*  against anybody. I don't know J.Ske, but I love Andrew. He's awesome. I still love how he markets
*  himself too. He's relentless. Like he didn't need Netflix, didn't need anything else. He's done it
*  all himself. He does it like a business. He's a, he's stand up, stand up, you know, and that's one
*  of the artists that's kind of dying, you know what I'm saying? But he's like a stand up, stand up.
*  And he keeps it, I envy him how he do it because I'm more into entertaining and doing stand up and
*  doing everything else, but just straight core stand up, I like that shit. And he takes it there.
*  Sometimes I have to reel him back though, cause he will go too far.
*  He's like on that borderline of crazy and genius. Like you gotta say, all right, nigga.
*  Well, he's taking risks. You know, if you want to make some good comedy, you gotta take some risks.
*  Yeah. But just, it's interesting for me to see people with like him to have a great work ethic.
*  Like he's a, he's a brilliant guy in terms of like how he's putting things out there and editing
*  things and strategizing and doing shows in Russia. He studies the game, man. He studies,
*  he sees and he takes his thing. And that's good for young guys. Once he, once he understood like
*  just you don't need Hollywood no more. Like, you know, cause a lot of, especially in our generation,
*  they're stuck in the mind instead of thinking that it's Hollywood, but that don't really exist in
*  this day and age like that. Not as much as impact on the culture like it used to. It has,
*  an impact, but it's not the only impact. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. All right. Yeah. That's what I mean.
*  It's not the end all. So you can create your own shit. This internet made it an even playing
*  field. Like you can do your own thing. So you don't really have to just use that route. And once he
*  understood that he took it and ran with it. Yeah. It's not even an even playing field. It actually
*  tips the other way because you need to use the internet no matter who you are. Exactly. You need
*  to use the internet. If you're, they got to come to you. Yeah. If they're your emotion picture
*  company trying to promote a movie, you got to use the internet and they got to come to you. Now,
*  now you're the, you're the network and they got to come to you for the brands and the ads and shit
*  like that. So you're Hollywood now. I'm a Hollywood. You're in Hollywood. Like you're really the new
*  Johnny Carson round this mother fuckers. You know, shit being on this shit from where people,
*  where people have been saying shit like they've been like, man, you got to get on that show. You
*  got to get, honestly, I just respect you as a comic. Like I've, I didn't see it as, I don't see
*  people as like the fame part of it. I just see it as he doing his thing. He got his lane, he winning.
*  I don't be seeing the big, big picture of it and the way people seeing it. And I'm like,
*  this motherfucker got a, got a goddamn cult following around this motherfucker like this,
*  man, you got to go get on there. You just got to get on the show. And I was like,
*  I'm going to get on the motherfucker. And, and, and Shels was like, man, y'all damn near the same
*  person. Y'all got to meet. Y'all got to meet. I'm like, man, motherfucker don't know shit about me,
*  man. You think about me. You don't give a fuck about me. I do though. So it's just dope, man.
*  It's dope. It's dope to have you here, man. It's been fun. How long we've been talking?
*  It's two hours now. For real? Yeah, it's like two o'clock. Oh, okay. That's cool, man. Light that
*  joint, man. No problem. I'm stealing some of this shit. Steal it free. You know, niggas stealing
*  free shit. I give you whatever you need, man. We get a drop off from Speedweed. Do you ever use
*  Speedweed in LA? It's a weed delivery service from my friend Gino. Outstanding. Five stars.
*  He delivers some shit. Well, ordinarily we keep a chest. We have a war chest. He gives us this
*  giant wooden box filled with weed, but we kind of drained it. So they're filling it up so it has to
*  come back. Should have had them come back before you were here. A tragic miss site. We've been
*  having a lot of those lately. You study Buddhism and Hindu? I've studied a little bit of it. I've
*  read a little bit of it. I've never practiced it. I try to practice it in my way of living.
*  I think all that shit comes from the start of Hinduism. I think that's what it was saying.
*  I just like the piece of it. I think that's where it all starts. Just nature and
*  dude, you can just live free. But everybody can't live free because some motherfuckers crazy.
*  The Hindu stuff, the ancient Hindu stuff is fascinating because they always talked about
*  this shit called Soma and no one knows exactly what it was. It seems like it was some sort of
*  a psychedelic. I don't think they've ever figured out what it is. They think it might have been like
*  mushrooms mixed with something else and they called it Soma. They might have created some
*  sort of a concoction. They would do it and trip balls. It figured things out. Soma. It's probably
*  real similar to what's happening when people are tripping today. When you were saying that you took
*  four grams, it's probably real similar. That feeling is probably real similar throughout
*  history. People figured out different ways to get it. Man, when I was on that shit, I seen the
*  hundred dollar bill. The hologram on that bitch was up. You know the little hologram? That shit
*  comes up off the dollar. Off the hundred dollar bill. When you're on mushrooms it does? Mine did.
*  That motherfucker came up. Imagine if that's how the cops find out if you're on mushrooms.
*  That's why I was like whoever made the hundred dollar bill, they was on shrooms.
*  Ass it. That shit was dope. I can't think of nothing bad about it.
*  Only bad is maybe I wouldn't do it in front of people like that yet. I'd be just loose.
*  They did some studies on mushrooms and they found that it actually increases people's vision
*  in low doses. It makes your vision more accurate. If they have parallel lines,
*  I forget who did the study, but the study was if you have these two parallel lines and one of them
*  shifts ever so slightly offline, you would be able to detect it quicker when you're on psilocybin
*  than when you're not. So it's statistically proven with randomly selected people who are
*  either on or not on and they ran this series of tests and they found that the people were more
*  effective at detecting whether or not the angle has changed so you can see better. You have a
*  better view of reality when you're on mushrooms. I'm going to start telling my homeboys that now
*  I act like I'm smart. You know mushrooms make you see better. They think it might have been
*  one of the things that led to us evolving. Shrooms? They made a C? Oh, you ever watch that
*  show? That's a good show. Which show? C. No, what is that? That's with the guy from Aquaman.
*  Oh, Jason Momoa? Oh, that's right. What is that called? That's a new Apple show, right?
*  Yeah, it's called C. That's a good show? No, that's a real good show.
*  Yeah, and it's about them being blind. Damn, that makes sense. So it's like-
*  Not that it created vision, but that it improved vision. It was one of several things they think
*  led to us evolving quicker. One of them was that we started experimenting with different food
*  sources. We had more access to bugs and rats and all these little things that we could catch. We
*  started hunting things, then we started using tools to figure out how to hunt things. And all
*  during this process, we're eating weed and we're eating mushrooms. So we're probably interacting
*  with these psychedelic compounds that people have used for thousands and thousands of years when we
*  were primitive man. And so as we're taking these things, we're trying to figure out new ways to
*  hunt, new ways to protect ourselves from our enemies, new ways to farm. We started inventing
*  things. We started inventing language. I think there's a direct connection between psilocybin
*  use and the ability to create words and language. So really we are just nature. Yeah. We just keep
*  evolving and evolving. Yeah, we're nature that lives in houses. Yeah. That's what we are.
*  That's crazy. Now that I'm thinking, so the shrooms- So really everything came from the
*  shroom and the shroom kind of- Shroom used us. Yeah, the shroom used us in growing into us to-
*  The shroom used us to manifest reality. The shroom used us to create life. And it's not just the
*  shroom, it's the ideas too. I think all these ideas that you get, we were talking about this earlier,
*  what is an idea? If you have an idea like, hey, I'm going to invent this thing, this thing's going
*  to benefit mankind, and you just have some crazy idea that's supposed to fix things. Maybe it sucks
*  pollution out of the air. And then someone takes that and runs with it and improves something else.
*  Then someone takes that and improves something. And then you're doing this on giant scales.
*  Millions and millions and millions of people are doing this, and they're contributing to this,
*  and they're all using ideas. They have ideas, and they turn that idea into a physical form.
*  And then every year they expect it to get better and better and better. Every year they innovate.
*  Nobody ever looks at a television and goes, 72 inches, it looks clear, let's just stop, no more
*  TVs. Yeah, we always got to get bigger. Always got to get bigger. Always. But why? The reward is
*  improvement. It's constantly gearing towards improvement. We're obsessed with it.
*  It's like we need that. It's boredom. Boredom makes us do more.
*  And these are ideas, right? Ideas that we turn into things. And along the way, there's a bunch
*  of shit that fuels our desire to get those things and make these things happen, like lust,
*  like materialism. Maybe what materialism, or people worry about it being so empty,
*  maybe what it is, it's a function of getting us to invest heavily in newer, better shit so that
*  more things accelerate faster and faster, and that these new inventions come at a faster and faster
*  rate because that's what we're constantly focused on, is newer, better shit. So they're constantly
*  inventing and improving. And all the while, we're just dumping money into the birth of our successor.
*  Yeah, the technology. So we're just a movement. We evolve from the shrooms to the human,
*  to the ideas, to the culture, to the different cultures interacting with each other,
*  the resistance of these cultures interacting with each other. So really, we're just an organism.
*  We're an organism. Yeah. A fucking awesome one, though. I mean, no organism is having as much of
*  a fucking good time as we. Yeah, fuck what they talking about. Ain't nobody getting shot,
*  ain't nobody doing all that type of shit. That shit look boring to me. Nobody sending
*  videos through the air. Yeah, they ain't facetiming. Ain't nobody getting porn and shit. Yeah,
*  nobody's flying helicopters. Yeah, they ain't flying. Getting into submarines. People getting
*  into submarines, man. Yeah, ain't never seen no goddamn, I ain't never seen no lion 120 feet.
*  I done that. Fuck submarines, man. If you were high on a submarine. I always wondered,
*  that got to be the dumbest job to ever want. Do you know you're like, have you ever been,
*  have you ever scuba dived? I've snorkeled. That's the most I've ever done. Like I'm saying,
*  scuba diving, by the time you get past 100 feet, it's just dark. There's nothing down there. That's
*  worse than being in jail in solitary confinement. And how long do they be down there? There's people
*  that be in them submarines. Oh, for a long time. They got to be crazy. There's no way you can't
*  tell me. Like that solitary confinement by themselves. Yeah, but it's also. That's just
*  like on that movie I was saying on, I mean that show, Fall of Mankind, they was up there going
*  crazy. Yeah. They was going crazy because they had to wait for something to be fixed for them to sit
*  up there. So every two weeks they had to wait and they was watching the same show over and over,
*  over and over. They had to practice that shit and they went crazy. I couldn't imagine.
*  Average 30 days up to a hundred. Underwater? Yeah. Oh my God. 30 days, bro. 30 days underwater.
*  How bad is that toilet smell, by the way? We should talk to some semen. How much do they get paid to
*  do that? How much do they get paid to do that? Not enough. There's no way they would get paid
*  enough. 30 days underwater. It could be all the money in the world. If they were getting paid
*  correctly, there'd be no money left for anybody else. 30 days underwater in a submarine. What?
*  That's the craziest reality show ever. Shit. I just put that out in the universe. Someone's
*  going to do it. They're going to be, it's called Project Nemo. Big Brother Project Nemo. You just
*  film people underwater for 30 days. I'm going to be like, hell nah, I don't know what Joe said.
*  Shit. That could be a great reality show. Look, whoever is listening that's thinking about doing
*  it, just go ahead and do it. Make it. You have that. Do it. Have that one. Do it for the culture.
*  That's for you. Do it for the culture. That would be a popular show. A fucking submarine filled with
*  people for 30 days. I don't even want to get on a cruise ship, man. Do you fuck with cruise ships?
*  No, I've never been on a cruise ship. Never want to. I'm not that guy. I don't like being in the
*  place. I like being in my own place like the island that I'm on. There's not nobody there.
*  I like being there, but I don't want to be in the middle of the ocean. I can't go where I want to
*  go. You're not going to do me like that. I know how powerful that ocean is, so I'm not playing
*  with that most powerful thing on earth. It's also like the thing that's beautiful about you
*  and your playing is you can go over the fuck you want. You get up and fly and you're free.
*  You get to experience it. Same thing in a boat. Why not? I don't know. I'm thinking about it right
*  now. The same thing in a boat. When you're in a boat, you're out there on the ocean. You can go
*  left. You can go right. You can go wherever the fuck you want. That's something beautiful about a
*  boat is that you're gliding across the top of this water and you're kind of in control of your
*  destiny. You can kind of decide where you want to go. You could be casual. You can enjoy the,
*  let's just drive along the coastline. But if you're in a fucking cruise liner, you ain't doing none
*  of that. You ain't doing none of that. You got to go where they want you to go. And you're on there
*  with a bunch of other people. And everyone's drunk. If I don't want to be bothering somebody,
*  I don't want to just sit in my room cooped up. And every now and then people throw people overboard.
*  I don't like tourist spots like that. Right? It's surprising how rarely it happens that people throw
*  people overboard. It's always like- Probably lately. Husband and wife. Back in the day,
*  they probably used to, but they probably got it to where you can't throw people off. They probably,
*  I mean, like most of the places- No, you can still throw people off.
*  Because like in Vegas, you can't throw, they can't jump off no fucking building no more.
*  Really? They ain't got balconies on them casinos, not in the regular hotel rooms.
*  Because too many people were jumping. Too many people was jumping.
*  That's a crazy way to go. 300 people since, nearly 300 people since 2000 have gone overboard on
*  cruise ships and ferries. Holy shit. They included that too. Holy shit. How many people have recovered?
*  This was according to a professor in Canada. So I don't know if that's just Canada.
*  Do they ever recover them? Have you ever heard of one getting recovered?
*  Don't they just keep going usually? Because they can't stop.
*  Oh my God. They can't stop. Is that true? Bro.
*  I've just heard that you got to be careful because they're not going to stop for you.
*  I've never been on one. So I don't know. I just heard that.
*  That's one I don't care about because I'm never doing it. So it doesn't even matter.
*  Fuck that. Are you crazy? They don't stop for you if you fall overboard?
*  Check. I'll check. I feel like if you want to do that, do you?
*  Yeah, Jamie, we might be getting sued now by the cruise lines.
*  Someone might stop for you. There is absolutely no merit in anything
*  young Jamie has said. I disavow. If you could see the amount of smoke in this room.
*  I disavow. I don't even know what he said. That's wrong. I'm sorry.
*  He said if someone fell overboard, they wouldn't even stop. Oh, well, we lost them. I was like,
*  do they go get you? I mean, how many times do they get you after you fall overboard? Don't they stop?
*  If they don't stop, that is fucked up. If you go overboard and they don't have some
*  sort of a solution to try to go get you, that seems crazy. But if you did it on your own will,
*  you crazy. That's true. You got to survive the fall first.
*  Because the ships are very high, what I'm reading right here. They do have a process to go get
*  people if they fall. I think they have smaller ships they can send out and go back and get you.
*  You got to survive the fall. I ain't even thinking that. That's a long jump to the bottom, right?
*  What if you hit it face first like an asshole? That's a fucked up way to go, man. Falling off
*  a cruise ship in the middle of the night. Splash. That's been in plenty of countries where if you
*  just want to drive off, you can. Right. So I mean, if you don't value your life, you can't put
*  everybody else upset. I'm not going to be upset more upset about it than you are.
*  If that's what happened, if people just jump off, I understand what you're saying. Yeah,
*  that's what I'm talking about. But sometimes people get thrown off.
*  It's always like a husband's like, I don't know where she went. I came out here. I came out here.
*  You know, she wasn't here anymore. I don't know what the fuck happened.
*  They see him the day before. I don't know what happened. They see him walking around the day
*  before looking up for every security camera. They got him on footage marking security cameras,
*  trying to figure out where's the best place to throw a reward.
*  Soon we'll be making another round. I was watching that not too long ago.
*  This says they turn around. They turn around. Who says they do?
*  If it falls off of that, man, it's so hard to put back in place. Oh shit, my bad, man. That's
*  amazing. You didn't knock it off. I thought it was like one of them that you touch it and the light
*  touch. No, it's a there's some some magnet that is making it float in the air. But when I tell you,
*  it has to be perfect. I mean, it is so hard to do. Jimmy, how long did it take you to do that?
*  I didn't even get to do it. Someone else had to do it. Taylor do it. I've done it once. Jeff did
*  it. Oh shit. I'm glad I didn't fucking know. It takes like 10 minutes. Good luck. 15 minutes.
*  It could take you. You could get lucky and do it right away or you might be. I just was doing like
*  this. Oh shit. Who gave us out here? And I was about to do this next. I didn't even know it
*  wasn't connected. And think on that. I know who it was. You do? No, I mean like a good one.
*  But yeah, we came real close. I thought that was going down.
*  That one next to it. That's a real. Fuck the whole vibe up, man. No, it would have been fine.
*  That's too fragile. I mean, it's awesome. But I mean, if that's what happened, that's not your
*  fucking helmet is the shit. That's all that too. Is that from World War II?
*  No, no, it's a real helmet. See you Hollywood. So I thought you had.
*  No, that's a guy named Shane against the machine. He's also an artist on Instagram.
*  I bought a couple of things from him, but this one is a real helmet from World War II and a real
*  bayonet that they converted into a lamp. That's hard. Oh dude. It's weird. Every time I look at
*  it, I think about like somehow or another, this helmet from war from the 1940s is now a lamp
*  in my studio. How do you think the next war going to be? I'm terrified. I'm terrified. It's going to
*  be kind of socially. I mean, I think it's going to be more electronically. Yeah, electronically.
*  It could be. It also could be diseases. It could be engineered diseases that wipe out
*  half the fucking population. So many different things can happen. Russia was working on a lot
*  of that shit during the cold war. I wonder how that shit going to be. That shit terrifies me.
*  Diseases and artificially created diseases. That shit's terrifying or even artificially
*  cold. And the crazy thing anybody can be that anybody can make that happen. Well, some people
*  can. They definitely did for a while during the cold war. It's just we're lucky that I'm talking
*  about anybody can make a disease. Damn near now. If you would with technology and just learning
*  off the internet, you can teach yourself how to do some. You can, but we went to the Center
*  for Disease Control once for this TV show that I was working at. We talked to these guys that are
*  working every day in these spacesuits with incredibly toxic viruses. They have it in Galveston,
*  Texas. So we went back and we saw these labs and everything like that. And we were asking them
*  about engineered diseases and they go, listen, fuck engineered diseases. You got to worry about
*  real ones, just regular diseases. Every now and then a pandemic comes across, a flu you can't fix.
*  There's some new Ebola, you know, there's some new things. There's new flus out this bitch.
*  Yeah. It's always new strains. That's why the flu shot doesn't always work correctly on everybody.
*  I've never had a flu shot. Good for you. I've never had a flu shot. Yeah. I have all the other shots,
*  but I don't get a shot every year. I just don't know if that's the best way to do it. I think
*  the body is made so perfect. Like long as you don't abuse it, abuse it, like it's going to heal itself.
*  But you need penicillin, you need drugs, you need a lot of shit. You need antibiotics,
*  you need that shit. You want to stay alive, you get an infection. We can have both things. We can have
*  science and we can have reason. You get the acceptance of nature. Don't get it twisted. When
*  I get sick, I do use like certain shit, but I don't like to rely on it. Like I don't know how to swallow
*  pills. Good for you. I don't know how to swallow pills. I have never swallowed a pill before in my
*  life. Do you ever take vitamins? I use BC powders. Okay. Like when I get a headache, I need to have
*  to take a BC powder, but as far as that, that's as much as I do. Like if I have a headache.
*  Yeah, they make vitamins. You can mix in your drinks. I do vitamins. Like I take a vitamin
*  like them two a days or some shit like that. How do you take it? You smash it up or something?
*  Gummy bears. Oh, gummy bears. That's a good move. Gummy bears make kids take CBD. Gummy bears are
*  great. Yeah, gummy bears. Those gummy bear CBDs are great. Are they? Yeah, very relaxing. No,
*  I don't, man. We'll get some. If you're going to be around. I want to sell some CBDs to make my
*  own brand of CBD gummy bears because like I used to give my man that had cancer that died, the one
*  I was telling you about, he used to love them CBD things. So I think that would be dope.
*  Well, people that have arthritis, it's a life changer. For real? Yeah. A lot of my friend Dave
*  had these really locked up fingers. His fingers were fucked up. He just couldn't bend them,
*  couldn't straighten them out. Started doing CBD and his hands just slowly but surely relaxed and
*  now they were perfect. I mean, that was something that was fucking with him for a while. I don't
*  know if it's because over time I haven't yet did it, but like when I drive my old school car,
*  the steering wheel is hard to hold. My hands lock up. And I wonder is that because over time
*  by using the regular, by the steering wheel getting bigger, has my hand evolved to where
*  it can't even do that no more? It can't grab ahold of a skinny wheel? Yeah. What is your old school
*  kind of steering wheel you got on? It's the little skinny old school, old school shit. What kind of
*  car is it again? Chevy Caprice. And you said it was 70s? 72. Oh wow. 72. Let me see if I can find
*  it. You got it all built out? Yeah with rims, you know, Florida style. Florida style. Florida
*  style is giant wheels, right? Isn't that what Florida style is? Yeah, we like big wheels,
*  old school, Chevy's. What is that? There's a name for that. Which one? When I posted on Instagram,
*  we landed in Miami once. A dunk? What's it called? Yes. A dunk. Yeah, I got a dunk. That's what I'm
*  going to show you right now. Yeah, there you have dunks. So I was in Miami and this guy had, it was
*  a really nice car too with these ridiculous huge wagon wheels. Here you go right here. Mine got 20,
*  I think these 24s, it might be 26s. Oh my Jesus. Look at the size of those wheels. That's outrageous.
*  Yeah. That's a good looking car though. Beautiful. Appreciate it. I love old cars man. Killer Mike
*  got all the old cars. Oh shit, look at that one like that. Look at that one, that purple one. Yeah.
*  That's beautiful. Yeah. Wheels are just ridiculous. That's not necessary. I got a burp like that.
*  It's just a culture, part of the culture thing. That is ridiculous man. Go back to that purple one
*  though. That purple one is beautiful. Just fuck, get rid of those wheels and that thing's perfect.
*  Look at the beauty in that thing. God, that's perfect. Go back a little bit. I'm going to
*  show you like my type of style. Dude, that car right there. Like that blue one, go up to that blue.
*  Oh. Like that's sitting right. That's sitting right with those wheels. You know what I'm talking
*  about? It's sitting right like that. Oh leaning back a little bit. Like it's sitting right. I
*  like that. That's how my, I got a verde in the, it sits like that. Oh. See, I grew up driving
*  muscle cars. Where you originally from? Well, I was born in New Jersey, but I grew up in Boston.
*  Okay. But I lived everywhere man. I lived out here for a little while when I was a kid in San
*  Francisco. I lived in Florida for a little while in Gainesville. Yeah. And then I lived. You went
*  to Florida? Yeah, we were in Florida. We were in Gainesville for like three years. And then I lived
*  in Jamaica Plain. And then I lived in Newton, which is a suburb of Boston. Then I moved to New York
*  and then I was here. You started doing stand up where? Boston. Oh, okay. What about you? I started
*  in Atlanta. Oh. Land's got a scene. I started. The Laughing Skull is a fucking great little club.
*  I've never done it. Oh, you got to go there, man. You got to go there. It's a perfect club.
*  It's like, I don't know how many it seats. I don't even think it seats a hundred. I mean,
*  I've heard of it, but I've never been over there. I've never done it. It's above this killer burger
*  place. They have a killer burger place downstairs. But it's just a cool vibe. I'm going to go over
*  there. It's a cool vibe. How many? 74 seats. 74 seats. 74 seats, man. I try to do that when I'm
*  in Atlanta. I've done it a few times. I'm going to go up there. But it's one of those ones is like,
*  it's just a perfect little spot. I started at Uptown Comedy Corner in Atlanta in 99. I've been
*  doing 20 years now. Wow. Yeah. Shit, why I quit. How long you been doing? 30. 30? Yeah. What is it
*  now? 88. I started. So 31. 31 years. I started in 88. I started in 99. 31 years. That's so crazy.
*  That's how I feel. It feels long, but it don't feel long. It's like, damn, I'm here. Yeah.
*  It doesn't. It doesn't. It does in that it has been a long time, like a lot of times around the sun.
*  But it doesn't in that it's still exciting. It's still fun as shit, man. When I'm about to go up
*  at the store, we're all hanging out and look at my phone, check out my new shit. I get more kick out
*  of the crowd just doing that than I do the stand up part of it. I mean, the socializing stand up part
*  with people. Unless I really fuck with them as a person. You know what I'm saying? I just like,
*  I like the stage more so. Yeah. I know what you're saying. Than the comedy, just chilling and
*  I ain't like that part of that shit. You don't like chilling? I do. But I ain't like the part,
*  just the energy around that part of it. Oh, okay. I see what you're saying. Well,
*  different places have different vibes. Yeah. You know, we're real lucky in LA. Everyone's
*  real friendly, real supportive. It's like very family out here. Everybody's all huggy. Everybody's
*  like real supportive. It's no like, it's never been a time in my career where I remember less
*  bitchiness. Yeah. Less squabbling. When you're dealing at the bottom, it's a lot more scrambling.
*  It's a lot more dog eat dog world. So people cut, do this, do that a little more. So I remember
*  that. It's a little different. Oh yeah. No, I remember. Than the, come on, you make it,
*  I make it. That's how I used to think. And then I realized these motherfuckers ain't shit.
*  That is a problem. You can get one of those, these motherfuckers ain't shit guys
*  deeply in your machine. There's plenty of them out there. Oh yeah. There's no way you're going
*  to get around that. That's a test of life. Life is throwing you another extra puzzle.
*  Yeah, but you can get to a point where you can make your own ecosystem. That's true. In
*  your own circle. It's like, all right, you come in here, if I won't lie with you, come in this,
*  if I see if you, if you're genuine enough, you know. Yeah, for sure. And then if you can't,
*  you do your thing over there. The problem with those ecosystems, if you get somebody who's not
*  doing their best and is annoying and doesn't want to change. Sometimes people do get those. You get
*  haters. You get people who try to sabotage your fun. It's real unfortunate when you run into
*  people like that, but they do exist. They do, but I can kind of, I'm a good judgment of character.
*  I kind of read off vibes and I don't go by how you treat me. I go by how you treat other people.
*  As you can really see, because if they treat them like there's a matter of time,
*  treat people that can't do shit for you. You know, do you get a lot of people asking you to do shit
*  all the time? And I have no problem saying no. I'm not that nigga.
*  It gets a little crazy though, right? Because I do stuff genuine out my heart too, for real. So when
*  people want me to do stuff, I do what I want to do. I don't do what you want me to do, you know.
*  And I know I do enough to where you can't make me feel bad for not doing that. So I don't trip. I
*  know what I do. I wouldn't be where I'm at now if I wasn't doing right.
*  You get dudes like want to open up businesses with you and shit?
*  Oh, all the time. Everybody knows what I'm doing. Hey man, I got this little idea, right?
*  Whenever a person, especially when they want to do shows and shit, I'm trying to put something
*  together. When you hear that, you're like, you ain't even got to do it with me. Put nothing together.
*  When you hear that word, I'm trying to put something together.
*  I'm producing this little thing.
*  Yeah, I'm producing this little thing. I got these.
*  If I could attach you to it.
*  Yeah, yeah. Like, no. I'm not that gal. I hate that.
*  But that's always part of the whole hustles. There's always going to be those guys that try
*  to glom on and try to sell something attaching you to it.
*  And I get it. That's what they do.
*  Yeah, that's their hustle.
*  I don't mind you even trying me, but don't be mad at me for saying no.
*  You do get mad though. In their eyes, it's the best project of all time.
*  And it's going to be amazing. Trust me, it's going to be for your own benefit if you come along on
*  this. This is what I say. If you mad at me for that, stop fucking with me.
*  Stop fucking with me, shit. You made this easy for me.
*  I'm going to be all right.
*  Yeah, it's just important to find people that aren't like that. People that are supporting
*  each other. Seeing your friends support your other friends.
*  This tastes good too.
*  It's good weed, right? That's a sativa. That stuff's going to make you think about space.
*  Shit, we already talked about that shit. I was there. I had to bring myself back because
*  I didn't want to go too far left on the show.
*  Too far left?
*  Too far out. Like this nigga Duval tripping there.
*  And plus I can't articulate it enough. I'm still learning it.
*  In the Bahamas, they probably have very little light pollution.
*  Huh. That's why I say it looks like you out of space.
*  He came to my house. Asked him. That shit looks like out of space. It feels like you're in a snow
*  globe. You see every star. When you're out there, you realize this is why people thought about
*  out there more. Because before technology at night, that shit probably was ... You
*  ain't have no choice but to look up there.
*  Yeah. That's what people need to see, right?
*  Yes. When you look up there, you be like, man, they up there. Something going on.
*  You see shit going on. I think they already up there chilling. It's a club up there.
*  A club of who?
*  Just people like ...
*  Illuminati?
*  Nah.
*  No?
*  Kennedy's?
*  Motherfuckers just chilling. Like on District 9 and shit. You seen that movie? I think that was
*  the movie where they had another little space up there and they was up there chilling.
*  That was that movie.
*  You know they bring a tourism.
*  Where those aliens came down.
*  They're probably having tourism up there now. They're trying to do that too.
*  Tourism in space?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. That's going to happen.
*  Yeah. Hotel are going to open up soon.
*  Oh, Jesus. How the fuck would you be able to sleep when you're hovering over the earth?
*  I wonder how many likes I ever get.
*  A lot. That would be like the ultimate Instagram influencer big booty girl.
*  That would be her ultimate pick. Sticking her ass out and behind her, you see the earth.
*  You know, like life is all about being happy.
*  I don't buy this. This is NASA.
*  Talk about positivity.
*  2020, you can go to the ISS.
*  You sow the seeds.
*  She's going to be selling tummy tea.
*  You reap what you sow and tummy tea.
*  Tummy tea. I've been drinking this juice and look at my stomach.
*  It is amazing for your hair. I mean, amazing.
*  What'd you say? What is it?
*  The International Space Station. It said this article here on NBC said that
*  there's plans to have people going there, not to stay there, but to go there next year.
*  And then a hotel for four people by 2022.
*  Whoa. Who's going to be the first to fuck on that hotel?
*  I'm going to try. I'm going to try. I'm going to try. I'm going to be the first one.
*  Imagine if they had rules.
*  If I ever did, that would be the first point I do because I'm going viral that night.
*  I'm going Instagram live and fucking.
*  Oh my God.
*  And the nut just skeet and just go out.
*  Fly through the sky.
*  You can blow on it. You can make nut rings.
*  Now I don't know if I'm going to make nut rings. I think that might be going to.
*  You playing with your nut.
*  Tighten up in a bow. Oh my God.
*  You should be the first to skeet into the air.
*  Skeet in the air.
*  Just skeet skeet.
*  Just that skeet skeet.
*  He's watching.
*  He's watching.
*  Now I know them astronauts that done that before.
*  There's no way they was that boy up there.
*  Didn't start jacking off and just let that shit skeet off.
*  I don't think they ever get a moment where they're not on the camera.
*  That's what I was saying.
*  Who gives a fuck if you've been up there for months.
*  You think you're going to give a fuck. What they going to do to you?
*  You know what? You got to come back down here.
*  All right.
*  The fuck.
*  So what? Just because I got laid?
*  I guarantee they done jacked off and let that shit.
*  There's footage somewhere.
*  I promise you we got to find a cool astronaut to tell us the truth.
*  Ah.
*  He's like yeah I was skeet off.
*  You're probably right.
*  Skeet off.
*  Oh shit.
*  Flying through the air like a cloud.
*  Oh we still on air.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh my God.
*  Oh shit.
*  That is funny as fuck.
*  That's a good joke too.
*  Have people ever had sex?
*  Has anybody had sex in space?
*  Come on man.
*  But I want to know if it's been documented.
*  They ain't going to say it but I don't.
*  Come on.
*  But people write books.
*  Wouldn't you?
*  Yeah.
*  You'd be up there like what you trying to do?
*  You want to be the first motherfuckers out of space?
*  Man I definitely would.
*  Shit.
*  You kind of have to.
*  Not officially.
*  No officially?
*  Not officially yet.
*  Nothing officially.
*  Correct.
*  But maybe someone has?
*  Maybe the Russians.
*  I was going to say we're not the only ones that go to space.
*  Russians probably drink vodka and bone.
*  They probably have orgies up there.
*  Man I'm telling you man.
*  Disco music.
*  They're in an EDM.
*  They've been fucking on the moon and everything.
*  I'm telling you it's not all on the moon.
*  Imagine you put one of those black lights.
*  Black lights.
*  Oh my God.
*  What the fuck happened before we got here?
*  Oh shit.
*  Do you think we've ever been visited by aliens?
*  Yeah.
*  I think aliens walk amongst us now.
*  They come in here, come in there, see how stupid we are and go back and tell their stories and shit.
*  You think so?
*  I mean I can only see why.
*  I mean if you thought there's no way we the only people in this whole universe.
*  There's no way this only happened one time in this one part.
*  So it's got to be somewhere else and I'm pretty sure they way ahead as far as technology and
*  what's the other word?
*  Progress.
*  Innovation.
*  Yeah.
*  All that.
*  So they gotta know.
*  They gotta be.
*  They gotta look at this.
*  It only makes sense.
*  Yeah.
*  If we could stay alive for a few thousand years longer than we are now.
*  I mean imagine how much technology we would have by then.
*  And who knows what they've done.
*  You know they might have created a technology based entirely on their atmosphere and their planet.
*  It might be just a different way of propulsion, a different way of organisms,
*  different way of everything.
*  There's so many possibilities in the universe.
*  It could be some drips.
*  That's the power.
*  Like drips.
*  Like those are humans.
*  I read something somewhere about the possibility of there being living creatures
*  in other parts of the universe that are made out of light.
*  That's what I mean.
*  Yeah.
*  They're trying to theorize what are the parameters for something being alive
*  given all the different possible environments in the universe.
*  All we know about life is what life we've ever discovered on Earth.
*  Maybe life can exist in bizarre, crazy environments.
*  Just a different kind of life.
*  Like cocoon?
*  It's a different kind of life.
*  I mean like that movie, Cocoon.
*  Cocoon was like old people and then they got young.
*  Yeah but the thing was it came in that little cocoon.
*  In a spirit, like a light.
*  It came like a light.
*  I don't remember that enough.
*  Cocoon.
*  I do remember it though.
*  I remember it was old people and they'd turn young and start fucking.
*  Yeah.
*  That was a big part of it.
*  Yeah but when you look at it from a cocoon.
*  But if there is like other kinds of life forms out there.
*  I mean it's almost never ending.
*  It's like a light.
*  Look at this cocoon.
*  Oh they're all light.
*  Yeah that's why I'm saying it's a light.
*  I'm telling you.
*  I forgot about this.
*  They thought about this a long time ago man.
*  Wow.
*  Cocoon was way ahead of its time.
*  Man they was just on shrooms back then.
*  Oh for sure.
*  That's what you see when you're high as fuck.
*  Come on.
*  I'm telling you.
*  That's what I'm telling you.
*  We got to watch that again.
*  The ice is melting.
*  That thing.
*  Give me that photo.
*  Give me that photo.
*  Man Charlamagne just made me realize.
*  The earth is getting too warm.
*  Sexual diseases are ravaging your population.
*  You have to stop.
*  You have to slow down.
*  You're headed to the edge of the cliff.
*  Humanity is in great danger.
*  You're pulling all the fish out of the ocean.
*  You're heating up the sky and filling it with particulates.
*  The very air you breathe.
*  There's not much time left.
*  Now see the boy with it.
*  Look at that thing.
*  Fuck that.
*  Whatever that thing is.
*  I don't want it in me.
*  In you?
*  It takes a little bit of skin doesn't it?
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  That movie there was like 30 years.
*  Wasn't that like 30 years ago?
*  Long time ago.
*  If that was 30 years ago, that means they been knew.
*  About what we just putting two and two together.
*  I think the light thing was just a physicist was speculating about the possibility of different forms.
*  Well he was right.
*  He was right like a motherfucker.
*  So just thinking that might be like what you said that theory was with the light.
*  We might just be little lights of.
*  Also.
*  How hard would it be for aliens to make fake people to move amongst us?
*  They could travel here from other planets.
*  Why can't they make fake people that can wander around?
*  They are.
*  Shit.
*  How many people do you think you know that are aliens?
*  Donald Trump.
*  He gotta be an alien.
*  He don't give no fucks about humanity down here.
*  He don't give no fucks.
*  Maybe he just knows the spaceships are coming.
*  If you were president and they told you spaceships are coming.
*  What the fuck do you tell people?
*  Hey it's over.
*  Nah you get a droid like you and you be on that spaceship.
*  And let people do what they do and piss them off.
*  Let them get mad at each other and kill each other by being mad.
*  I think if aliens did show their face if there was like a real bona fide alien invasion or
*  at least alien landing it would be real similar to how we change in terms of the way we look at
*  ourselves and humanity.
*  Real similar to a natural disaster.
*  You would be humbled.
*  We would all be like oh shit.
*  Like if a real spaceship landed and real aliens were on board the spaceship.
*  I don't know we would still thank the government.
*  Motherfuckers would swear the government doing something.
*  That's true.
*  That's true too.
*  Some people.
*  You giving humans way too much credit.
*  We stupid for the most part as a whole.
*  Yeah some people would definitely think it was fake.
*  They would swear it was fake.
*  It would be real hard to convince someone that it wasn't fake.
*  Man people.
*  God could come down here and say hey it's me it's God.
*  We wouldn't believe it.
*  Like we wouldn't believe it.
*  Like we don't believe nothing that we ain't really seen before.
*  Yeah.
*  Like that's just how humans are.
*  We stupid.
*  Well that's where the whole flat earth thing comes from right?
*  Right.
*  I've never seen it.
*  Yeah I ain't never seen it.
*  It's like and you know what's so stupid about that.
*  It's like if you really felt like that why don't you just get in a boat and go to the end.
*  Like wouldn't that make sense.
*  Like you would be the Christopher Columbus of this shit.
*  If you want to be so sure and tell everybody they wrong.
*  Get your ass in a boat and go to the end.
*  Yeah.
*  If you really feel that motherfucking smart.
*  That is just stupid.
*  Like it's the dumbest shit ever.
*  Well it's weird too because they dismiss all of the evidence that the earth is round.
*  But yet they show no evidence.
*  That's why I said so prove me.
*  That's why whoever listen to this get in the boat and just ride.
*  Ride ride ride.
*  Ride until you get to the end and when you get to the end take a picture.
*  And put it on Instagram and send it to me.
*  But the thing is there's enough people out there in the world.
*  If you say that there's someone like you don't understand you've never done flat earth research.
*  There are those photographs.
*  They have been definitely.
*  Doing video live.
*  Do it live.
*  Do it live.
*  You do it live so we can know for facts.
*  And I'm gonna be up in Instagram headquarters so I can make sure this is really VIA at the edge.
*  Just an ice wall.
*  Very tough to get through.
*  Whatever is there go there.
*  Go to the ice wall.
*  Just give me one picture.
*  Send me one good picture what it looks like.
*  Thanks.
*  That's all we ask and do that.
*  But you see if you go further with this they think that stars are fake.
*  They do.
*  They think that the sun is way closer than we've been told.
*  How do they explain the sun actually going from sun up to sun down curving like that?
*  How do they explain that?
*  There's a very logical explanation used to understand the science.
*  Explain that bullshit flat earth science.
*  You can't.
*  They're stupid.
*  If you talk to people there's gonna be people who tell you that something's not real no matter what
*  it is.
*  It doesn't matter if it's people have water in their bodies.
*  There's gonna be a guy out there.
*  Well actually there's no water in human bodies.
*  The water that you drink is immediately evaporates through the surface of your skin
*  at an incredible pace.
*  So reason why you're so warm.
*  You're at 96.5 degrees.
*  Instantaneously the mist starts forming and you disappear.
*  You don't actually drink water.
*  There's someone out there that'll tell you that.
*  There's someone out there that'll tell you that human beings can live off of air.
*  There's dudes that think that their guru lives off air and he hasn't had food or water for years.
*  There's people that are just dumb man.
*  That's because we bored.
*  When you bored you start thinking the stupid shit and thinking you know what you're talking about.
*  And poor genetics and they might be on their first couple of rides.
*  Must be the first couple times around as a person.
*  That's what it is.
*  That's what it is.
*  They on their first ride.
*  That's what it is.
*  We on our fourth one.
*  They still retarded.
*  Yeah I think you've been on a hundred at least.
*  Yeah you've been on a lot of rides.
*  So if I've been on a hundred you had to be on the same amount or even more than me.
*  Yeah I think we've all been on this a bunch of times.
*  And I think if that's real.
*  I mean that would be a weird way to look at it.
*  But see you had to be a little more up because you white.
*  So you had to be a little more up.
*  So you might have been like one.
*  If I'm one hundred I'm gonna give you one up because in this generation in America
*  y'all got one up on us right now but wait till we come up.
*  We on y'all ass.
*  We on y'all ass.
*  But we ain't gonna do y'all like that.
*  I ain't.
*  Not if I can help it.
*  That's why I want to instill the humanity and before the money and all that take over all the humanity.
*  We gotta be careful of anything that separates people.
*  We definitely do man.
*  Any unnecessary thing that doesn't really mean anything to separate people.
*  You know what I do for real and the people always ask me about them trip.
*  I don't know why.
*  That's one of the reasons why I don't use colored emojis.
*  All my emojis I use be yellow for the most part.
*  Unless it's a joke I'm trying to do because I feel like that's still pushing the separation.
*  You know what I'm saying.
*  So it's like to me I don't feel like this like it's no reason the yellow is
*  and then you're like why you ain't using this.
*  I'm using yellow.
*  I ain't using white or black.
*  I ain't using nothing.
*  I'm using yellow.
*  Right.
*  Ain't nothing yellow.
*  Fake people.
*  Yeah it's yellow.
*  Big fake circles.
*  It's still giving the same exact thing.
*  It's just yellow.
*  Yes it's just laughter.
*  Yeah it's laughter.
*  It's a smiley face crying laughing.
*  Yeah they don't have to be a black laughter unless I'm telling a joke or something.
*  I mean I'm just like black man don't cheat.
*  That's all right I need the black fist.
*  I don't give a fuck.
*  Jamie had a good point once about emojis that they're like the new hieroglyphics.
*  Yep they are.
*  And what if language eventually becomes a series of emojis.
*  That's all it is.
*  We ain't got to talk no more.
*  Totally possible.
*  We don't really have to talk.
*  We own our phones.
*  If we could text and all that stuff there you can send feelings.
*  You can push like little things and give a feeling.
*  We don't have to use none of that shit.
*  We barely using any of that now.
*  We barely use our arms all this shit.
*  We gonna be like this pretty soon.
*  It would be hard to convey like hey did you go to the movie at seven o'clock or eight?
*  It would be hard to convey things like that through just emojis.
*  There's clock emojis.
*  Yes you can.
*  Do it all the time.
*  You can do like.
*  You change the.
*  Yep.
*  Maybe.
*  But then you say you'd have to go movie and then the at sign and then seven o'clock
*  and then you would go question mark eight o'clock question mark.
*  I guess you could right there.
*  You could just do movie seven eight question.
*  Yeah but seven eight is weird.
*  Seven question mark eight question mark.
*  That's two possibilities.
*  All right.
*  Seven eight like that's how you'd say it to someone.
*  You wouldn't say seven eight.
*  They're like what the fuck are you saying 78?
*  What are you saying?
*  See what I'm saying.
*  I know what you're saying but like it would be a clock.
*  It wouldn't be a number.
*  I had lost by the second.
*  I'm just saying I was like man.
*  Whoever I'm communicating with.
*  I was really about to be over here.
*  I don't know what this motherfucker said.
*  If they came up with a language that was all emojis that kids just learned really early.
*  It's like that now.
*  My daughter when she talks to me it's mostly in emojis.
*  Like even when we put that FaceTime face she like to put that on like they do that now.
*  Like that game.
*  What's that game she be playing?
*  Roadblocks.
*  Yes.
*  They all play roadblocks.
*  They don't even talk to each other.
*  I don't know what they'd be doing in there but ain't no voices.
*  They're learning how to connect with machines.
*  They're learning how to connect through energy and feelings and whatever you draw
*  or whatever your creativity.
*  It's like we're evolving out of our human bodies slowly but surely.
*  I couldn't agree more.
*  It's happening whether people recognize it or not and it's going to be real weird when it takes hold.
*  And I don't know what form it's going to be.
*  It's going to be a wearable device I think.
*  I'm willing to go with it.
*  I didn't think we would be right where we are now so I'm cool with it.
*  You just got to go with it.
*  That's how you enjoy it.
*  Man if you ain't laughing at life you're missing the whole point of this shit.
*  Like this shit fun.
*  This shit funny as hell just watching how stupid this shit evolve.
*  It is fun.
*  It's weird.
*  It's a weird time.
*  It's a great time.
*  It's not a great time for everybody right now listening to this.
*  It's a spoof.
*  Everything that was in living color or where we grew up or everything a comedian said 20
*  years ago that we didn't say it's like really life now.
*  It's like this shit is really crazy.
*  So it's like just laugh at this shit.
*  This shit funny as a motherfucker.
*  It's very strange.
*  It ain't strange it's funny.
*  It's funny too.
*  It's funny.
*  Strange is funny.
*  And I like it.
*  Strange just the way she is.
*  What's in the little container?
*  What kind of joints are those?
*  These are the ones that burn the shit.
*  Cookies.
*  Cookies?
*  Yeah.
*  Is that from the stash?
*  Yeah those are good.
*  Those are speed weed.
*  Speed weed.
*  Yeah.
*  Telling you it's a must.
*  Shit.
*  What happened?
*  I just hit my knee on the goddamn.
*  Oh the metal thing?
*  Yeah I'm high.
*  Yeah.
*  You just feel that I just hit my knee.
*  This table is sturdy as fuck.
*  And that bitch ain't moved.
*  This goddamn bridge material.
*  It's all made with steel girders.
*  Y'all made this what they made the Matthew Bridge off in Jacksonville.
*  Yeah but this like there's no move.
*  Oh man y'all hood as shit.
*  Y'all got roast.
*  We got roaches in there?
*  No I'm telling y'all I got roast traps out this bitch.
*  Oh we do we get roaches.
*  This the hood.
*  We in the trap.
*  Sometimes we find them dead in the bathroom like what in the fuck.
*  Big ones too.
*  You can't get rid of roaches.
*  You can't get rid of rats.
*  I ain't know roaches came from.
*  I ain't even know Cali head roaches.
*  I thought that was a south thing.
*  No they have roaches.
*  They're a different kind of roach though.
*  They're like chill California roaches.
*  Yeah they're not fast.
*  You know them roaches like even I've watched in my time of living like even like roaches evolve and
*  do certain things or flies be slower.
*  I've seen in certain places they quicker now.
*  And it's just you see even insects evolve.
*  Everything evolves.
*  Somebody was telling me about this.
*  I think my wife told me this.
*  There's different kinds of roaches.
*  There's an outside roach and an inside roach.
*  There's roaches that are more they live more in like fields and they're slower.
*  Less reactive and then you got roaches most likely that probably evolved in cities.
*  You got to imagine if people laying out roast traps and people are stomping you every time
*  they see you get faster and you get faster.
*  Those roaches in the East Coast like if you go to like a New York City roach that's a fast roach.
*  New York City rat.
*  Those are terrifying.
*  You ever see that Netflix documentary on rats.
*  Oh man if you ever want to freak out there's a great documentary on Netflix just called rats.
*  And they take these rats and they test them for diseases and they fucking all have something.
*  They have giant like parasites and it's one had a bot fly in its cheek.
*  Like I mean enormous like a fourth how big a third of his head.
*  How big.
*  What did they eat?
*  It's like on the side of his neck right.
*  That's where it was.
*  It was in his neck.
*  Bro it was nasty.
*  And then they were just saying like look there's there's as many of these fucking things as there
*  are people.
*  I mean and they did they get rid of them.
*  No they got out here.
*  What that rat.
*  I mean like rats like that.
*  Well there's definitely rats like that.
*  Yeah I thought they.
*  No man they haven't done shit to get rid of rats.
*  They can't.
*  But they found them all over the country.
*  They can't.
*  They can't if that hurricane hit that motherfucking nature.
*  Nature can get rid of that bitch.
*  Soon I think I just read this the other day that like one percent of the rats in LA are
*  going to have some like bubonic plague.
*  Of course.
*  I think it's very sooner if they don't already have it.
*  It's one percent.
*  Rats eat shit.
*  OK.
*  They dog shit.
*  Famously.
*  They eat our shit.
*  Animal shit and they eat our shit.
*  So if you're a junkie and you're just shooting heroin into your asshole and then you take
*  shits and these rats eat this shit.
*  Some homeless people have turned up with what was it typhoid typhus.
*  That's a medieval disease.
*  That's why you need to get closer to the country.
*  So rats get a hold of that.
*  Rats get shit eat their shit.
*  They all get sick.
*  Everyone gets sick.
*  That's why I say get closer to the country.
*  It's away from that city shit.
*  Yes.
*  Boy when it come it's going to go from there and spread.
*  But by the time it get to you you'd be in through your own your own shit.
*  I'm glad you brought that up because I want to find out what what is the definition between
*  city girl and country girl.
*  The thing you're doing back and forth.
*  City boys and hot girl.
*  Yeah.
*  City boys and hot girls.
*  Well that was something like well city boys.
*  That's always been like a Florida thing from Tampa.
*  That's actually from Tampa.
*  A song that's from Tampa called called City Boy by Tom G.
*  It's always been like a little vibe and like we jook and whoop in Florida.
*  And it's just something I just a song I want to bring back for everybody in Florida.
*  And I did it at the hip hop awards and everything.
*  So it was really just like a culture thing.
*  That's just like a vibe we do.
*  We jook and vibe and everything down there.
*  And it just it just it was good for the culture in Florida.
*  Like it was real big for Florida.
*  Just that song.
*  Really.
*  Yeah it was.
*  Yeah I was wondering what it was.
*  It's a dance.
*  Oh okay.
*  It's a dance.
*  Yeah that the city boy is a dance.
*  City boy with it.
*  City boy with it.
*  Yeah it's a dance.
*  It was dope too though because when I did the hip hop awards everybody from Florida
*  was tuned in to that because it was it was representing everybody in Florida.
*  You know that was a real dope moment for the culture.
*  Well Florida can use some of that right.
*  Florida always takes jokes.
*  People including me.
*  People always shit on Florida.
*  I shit on it too.
*  But we are crazy.
*  But there's there's a lot of good things about us too.
*  And that's the good thing through all that bullshit we know how to have a good time.
*  And that's what our music shows.
*  The good times and the vibes that we that we do.
*  Yeah.
*  A lot of the vibes come from us because shit that's all we do is party down there.
*  That come from the Caribbean's too.
*  Well the south of Florida might as well be another country.
*  I mean south Florida might as well be some Latin American.
*  Yeah Latin.
*  Some Latin American country that's protected by the constitution.
*  Yeah it might as well be like Puerto Rico.
*  Like Puerto Rico is kind of America right.
*  Not quite.
*  Not quite.
*  But kind of.
*  They say you don't make it to America to like to like where's Paul.
*  True.
*  That's what Donald Trump's Donald Trump's border.
*  That's what it is.
*  Marla.
*  The wall right there.
*  That's the border of South South North America.
*  They should call it.
*  They should call Florida as a new country.
*  It's called South South North America.
*  Call it motherfuckers.
*  Hold up.
*  Call it bitch.
*  South.
*  South USA.
*  Yeah.
*  South USA.
*  But the rest of the South would be pissed.
*  But if you called it South South North America it's so stupid.
*  The rest of the country would be like yeah you could have that.
*  Yeah go ahead.
*  Yeah.
*  You're trying to call it South of America.
*  They want to call it what.
*  North America.
*  South.
*  No.
*  Run with that.
*  Yeah.
*  Everybody in Tennessee and you know the real South would be like fuck you man.
*  You can't have that.
*  You can't have the South.
*  But South South North America keep that.
*  Florida.
*  How many people did I mean.
*  It would be crazy if someone did decide to branch off.
*  Like if Texas was like enough.
*  We're done.
*  We got it.
*  They do honestly.
*  And you go to Montana and all that they don't really go by these laws.
*  They do what they want.
*  You get shot out there.
*  You shot in North Dakota or South Dakota.
*  Well for the longest time Montana.
*  Montana too.
*  They wouldn't make a speeding limit.
*  They're like no.
*  I don't blame them.
*  That's their world.
*  Like you know it ain't that much to do out there motherfucking no ways.
*  Let them do what they do.
*  There's a lot of places like that in the country.
*  We just they just do what they do.
*  But it's also Montana.
*  The people that live there value freedom.
*  It's very important.
*  That is freedom.
*  Yeah that is freedom.
*  They value freedom.
*  So they're like no we don't want.
*  And the rest of America don't fuck.
*  I mean like they don't fuck with them.
*  Like America let them do what they do.
*  This is not that many people.
*  What's up Jamie.
*  Speed limit sign that says reasonable and prudent.
*  I don't know like is that how long.
*  Reasonable and prudent.
*  Truck 65 night all vehicle 65.
*  That's interesting.
*  Is that in Montana.
*  Is that now or is that.
*  I just typed in Montana speed limit.
*  And it said they're raising the limit again.
*  Reasonable and prudent.
*  What year is that.
*  What year is that.
*  I don't know.
*  Well see if you have a Corvette.
*  And you're going 95 miles an hour.
*  That's kind of reasonable and prudent.
*  If there's no one on the road.
*  If you know how to drive.
*  And you got a car that handles really well and drives really fast.
*  Most people in the country know how to drive.
*  They do it all the time.
*  They race.
*  That's well that's why all the races be in the country.
*  In the country country.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  So they know how to race.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what they do.
*  That's what you do as a teenager.
*  You learn.
*  Yeah if you're in Montana.
*  Definitely.
*  I'm pretty sure they out there race.
*  They probably living their best life out there for real.
*  It's a good place to live if you could take the winter.
*  I heard what was the place in.
*  Was it South Dakota.
*  Where's the mining.
*  They have mining in South Dakota.
*  They say that's where.
*  Strippers make the most money.
*  Oh really.
*  Oh where did I read this crazy story about the mine life.
*  About what it's like there.
*  Because these mine.
*  There was crazy towns right that.
*  The ice.
*  Yes.
*  That's what it was vice had a documentary on it.
*  And it was these crazy towns that pop up right next to these mines because all these dudes
*  work in these mines and they make money and they need somewhere to blow it off.
*  And so it develops like this sort of community around mines mining towns.
*  And it's really like what it was in the old west.
*  We think about those old westy towns with saloon and fucking shoot them up in the street.
*  What was that.
*  Wild west.
*  That's the same thing.
*  It's miners and thieves.
*  It's people mining gold and people who are thieves and people bringing in cattle to feed
*  the miners and people feeding ranches all that shit.
*  I mean it's kind of what happens whenever you get this thing that people are trying to
*  resource people trying to pull out of the ground.
*  And then you build some sort of ramshackle civilization around it.
*  Is there still stuff.
*  Is there still stuff to mine in.
*  What are they mining.
*  What are they mining in.
*  Finding on the.
*  I think they're mining some.
*  I don't remember what it was.
*  The vice one.
*  Like fracking oil.
*  Oh fracking.
*  Yeah.
*  See those jobs are dangerous.
*  You know like any kind of mining job no matter what you're mining.
*  I mean you're dealing with heavy equipment and shit.
*  It's hard to get people to do those jobs.
*  It's hard to get people to do that job.
*  What's that job where they go get crabs.
*  Oh that's a hard job.
*  You watch that shit.
*  Yeah.
*  I'll be watching that shit man.
*  Devil is catch.
*  Yeah.
*  Our king crab.
*  They be getting them king crabs up there in Alaska.
*  That's crazy.
*  That's not worth it.
*  Those guys go over.
*  It might do be.
*  I mean.
*  Maybe.
*  Shit.
*  They get like that getting them tunas.
*  Like I think they'd be going for like 250.
*  Yeah.
*  For the good tunas.
*  So it might be.
*  What's up.
*  That's what your way of life is.
*  You get a lot of gold out of there apparently still.
*  Really.
*  Yeah.
*  Whoa.
*  The home stake mine is what it's called.
*  In South Dakota.
*  Wow.
*  So there's all kinds of different mining going on down there.
*  Yeah.
*  This but this one article that we read is just about this one town where everything got real crazy.
*  Because you just got a bunch of men.
*  Men making a lot of money but they don't have anything to do.
*  And they start getting fucked up.
*  That sounds like America in a few years.
*  Well that's what America used to be right.
*  I mean that's when the miners came across the country.
*  That's exactly what happened.
*  Every fucking old west movie is the same thing right.
*  It's all like there's a saloon.
*  People are getting fucked up.
*  Someone gets out of line.
*  Someone gets shot.
*  People are gun fights in the street.
*  It's always that shit.
*  That's what it is now.
*  That's what is kind of in I think in our culture now like young people getting money now.
*  So they got nothing else to do.
*  That's why they just fucking it up.
*  It's like it's nothing to do.
*  It's like where we at now is probably like where I guess in the 80s where whites was
*  when they started getting money with the Wall Street and all that shit there.
*  They was spending it like a motherfucker.
*  So now it's new though.
*  So it's like shit we don't know what to do.
*  We just fucking it up.
*  Getting stupid beefs and doing.
*  Ain't nothing else to do.
*  What else you do?
*  Even if you do everything.
*  I'm going to put my mom in this.
*  Put my mom in.
*  And that's going to happen in society.
*  Like if they technology take over where ain't no jobs.
*  They don't have to get something.
*  You're going to be living off of stifing or some shit like that.
*  Yeah.
*  They're thinking universal basic income.
*  Yeah.
*  But then what's going to do is like you ain't going to have nothing to do.
*  That's the hardest thing to do in life is like when you once you got financial freedom
*  and that's time to live.
*  That's where people go crazy.
*  They don't know how to just live.
*  That's true.
*  Because it ain't nothing to do.
*  You just got to find hobbies.
*  I do.
*  I mean I understand and I don't put that much emphasis on big things to entertain me.
*  Okay.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  I keep it simple.
*  Like if I could be entertained by just sitting here chilling.
*  Anything else is a bonus.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  So that's how I keep the mindset of that.
*  I just lost my train of thought.
*  Oh.
*  This is why marijuana is illegal ladies and gentlemen.
*  You can't have this in a board meeting.
*  This kind of thinking.
*  This is where all my best thoughts come out of.
*  So how long are you in town for?
*  I'm leaving tonight.
*  I just came to fuck with you.
*  Oh man.
*  I'm honored.
*  Thank you.
*  No problem man.
*  I've been wanting to do this man.
*  Especially just I see how I have brought a lot of people together in one.
*  It's bigger than us.
*  I always feel like it's bigger than me.
*  I always feel like it's alive.
*  And I just come in to sort of hit the switch and the podcast sort of takes itself.
*  I just try to do my very best to get out of my own way.
*  Sometimes I achieve it.
*  Sometimes.
*  But you happy though?
*  Yeah.
*  It's fun man.
*  It's fun.
*  Tell me life as a whole.
*  Yeah.
*  It's dope.
*  Life is fascinating.
*  I mean I have just incredible fortune and great luck and I do things that I enjoy doing.
*  That's the number one key.
*  You can find a way to do something you actually enjoy.
*  It's just a different kind of life.
*  You know who else good at that?
*  Snoop.
*  Oh of course.
*  He lives his best life for real too.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  He's himself.
*  He told me how to live my best life.
*  Because I was always living my best life but on my own shit.
*  But in the industry he told me how to enjoy it.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Did you ever see Snoop spar?
*  Snoop who?
*  Spar.
*  Snoop.
*  You ever see him spar?
*  Dude Snoop trains at a real MMA gym.
*  No bullshit.
*  And he was sparring with Daniel Seraphian.
*  Daniel Seraphian is this UFC fighter who's he's built like a fucking brick shithouse.
*  He's a tank.
*  He's a legit fighter.
*  Very dangerous guy.
*  And he's not like trying to hurt Snoop.
*  He's keeping his hands up and moving.
*  But dude I'm telling you Snoop can throw some hands.
*  He's got good hand technique.
*  He'll be keeping humble with his hands.
*  Look you see the video.
*  We'll show it to you.
*  Look.
*  There it is.
*  Look look look.
*  It's the video.
*  Look that dude with the yellow on his gloves that's Daniel Seraphian.
*  That guy is a professional fighter.
*  Really dangerous guy.
*  And Snoop's in there sparring with the guy.
*  Look at this.
*  Look at this.
*  Look at this.
*  Is dude playing with Snoop though?
*  Oh well look.
*  I mean he's not trying to hurt him.
*  He's just being defensive.
*  But Snoop is swinging at a world class fighter.
*  I mean Seraphian's obviously not letting him hit him.
*  He knows what's coming and he moves out of the way.
*  But the fact that Snoop is getting in there with a guy like him.
*  That's impressive shit.
*  And he looks good man.
*  It looks good.
*  Look at OG.
*  OG doing it.
*  That's dope man.
*  Yeah.
*  Staying healthy.
*  But that's one motherfucker.
*  He does what he want to do.
*  When he want to do it.
*  He moves in the same energy.
*  Like he got that real energy.
*  Like he's really that genuine.
*  Well that's why he's still here.
*  That's why he's still relevant after all these years.
*  People still love him.
*  He got that spirit.
*  Yeah.
*  But listen man.
*  We just did three hours.
*  Let's wrap this thing up.
*  Thank you sir.
*  Thanks for being here man.
