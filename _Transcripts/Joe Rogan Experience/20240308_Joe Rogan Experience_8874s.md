# Joe Rogan Experience #2116 - Kevin James
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [March 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syatvaQkcyg)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Shrain by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.
*  Let's go, Shimey.
*  Let's go, Shimmer.
*  Shimey, Shimey, Shimey.
*  Most people don't know about Shimey.
*  They don't know about your alter ego.
*  No. Well, yeah, you were the one who brought it out of me.
*  You were, right?
*  Well, we would do shows.
*  We would do shows in New York, and you would go full Shimey.
*  I'd be on the side of the stage yelling out, Shimey.
*  Well, when we first started, by the way, we did the Joe Rogan Experience 30 years ago.
*  Yeah. Just hanging out.
*  Exactly. Just playing pool.
*  I remember Sussman brought you into town.
*  You started at Nix. Was it Nix?
*  I started at Stitches in Boston.
*  Stitches.
*  And then I was like two years in when I met you, and then I think we met at Eastside, which was awesome.
*  What a great club.
*  What a great club.
*  I was just there.
*  Shout out to Richie Manorvini.
*  Yes, my man. It was the greatest. The greatest place to go.
*  I remember it would be a line around the block, two shows on a Wednesday night.
*  It was insane comedy then.
*  The golden age of comedy at the time. 1990?
*  Yes.
*  Oh my God, it was incredible back then. 91-ish.
*  I started at 89. I think I met you in, what is it, 90?
*  91 maybe? 90?
*  Yeah, somewhere in there.
*  And I was following everybody. That was my thing.
*  I was being the stand-up comedian with the jacket sleeves pushed up and the bolo tie.
*  Do you know what I'm talking about?
*  I was just that straight thing.
*  And you came into town and we were like, who is this dude?
*  You just didn't care about anything.
*  And it was like, you always remain the same.
*  And it was just incredible to watch.
*  We were like, whoa, he just doesn't care.
*  And that's what you were, you would work with me on that.
*  You would be like, brother, you can't be like you're handing out a platter of food for these people.
*  Like do what you want to do.
*  And I was like, I just got to get going. Yeah, I got to wrap my head around that. You're right.
*  You know, I would just try to make the audience so happy.
*  You're like, stop it. Stop it.
*  And you got to let go.
*  And you'd get me going crazy.
*  I'd get all fired up there.
*  I'd be like yelling at people.
*  They'd be like, whoa.
*  It's like, why don't we bring it back a little bit.
*  But it was different, man.
*  It really was.
*  It was it really taught me to most of all to be comfortable in front of audience and not care about them.
*  You know, I still I literally battle with it to this day.
*  That anxiety of, oh gosh, I get nervous and I start overthinking things.
*  So but it really helped me to say, like, just do what you do.
*  And it's almost like the audience is like a dog.
*  They sense fear.
*  You know, 100 percent.
*  Yeah. They're animals.
*  Just like we are.
*  We're all animals.
*  That's right.
*  And it's like they know when you know, and if you're comfortable, even if you're faking it, they'll go with you.
*  You do a joke and you're confident.
*  They'll laugh just because they think it's funny.
*  They look around and everybody's like, oh, it must be funny because he's just got confidence.
*  And you had that confidence always.
*  You're always insanely intense and just never look back.
*  And way to go, man.
*  Way to go for you, too.
*  You just always needed a hype man.
*  You just need someone to like let you go.
*  Like give him the green light.
*  Give him the green light.
*  It's so funny.
*  You're right. You're right.
*  You just needed a hype man.
*  You were the one who did it for me in Montreal, too.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you remember that?
*  Go in this place.
*  By the way, do you remember the beer we would drink?
*  There were two kinds of this.
*  I can't remember this Canadian beer.
*  I've been racking my brain to think about it.
*  It was like there was like a gold version of it and like an amber.
*  And it was just the greatest stuff.
*  We get fired up up there and I loved it, man.
*  I loved going to that Montreal comedy festival.
*  Oh, it was the best.
*  Back when it was, I think it's gone under.
*  I think they did just announce they're going bankrupt.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah, unfortunately.
*  See, she'd tell people what it was.
*  So what it was during our time when we were young was the Montreal
*  Comedy Festival was where young comedians would go up and you could
*  kind of get a deal.
*  And that's where you got the deal to do the King and Queens.
*  Well, I got the deal to do NBC.
*  Right.
*  And then once that failed, that went into CBS.
*  But once you get in, the thing about people should know, like in the
*  90s, there was this thing that was happening where everybody looked at a
*  comedian like this could be the next Roseanne.
*  This could be the next Tim Allen.
*  This could be the next Seinfeld.
*  So every time they looked at you, they're like, what do you got?
*  What do you got for me?
*  And the agents would try to put it together as a sitcom.
*  Yes.
*  And they had this showcase called the Montreal Comedy Festival, the
*  Just For Laughs Comedy Festival.
*  And it was the most insane thing.
*  You would go there and it would change your life.
*  You could have one set, one 15-minute set, and all of a sudden you got a
*  half a million dollars.
*  100%.
*  You have one set that pops and people talking about, there's a buzz.
*  And it's like you're in.
*  You're set.
*  And they have bidding wars.
*  Yes.
*  So like CBS, Fox would be, they would all be throwing in.
*  And there's guys that walk.
*  Do you remember Chicken?
*  Chicken was the crazy guy?
*  Yes.
*  Chicken got the deal that killed the deal.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  He got like 800,000 or something.
*  It was some crazy money or I don't know what it was.
*  Some nutty amount of money.
*  But he had no act, right?
*  It was after that they thought he was.
*  He just tricked everybody.
*  He did.
*  And I don't know how he did it.
*  And I wonder if he had a hype, man.
*  If he could have kept tricking people.
*  Maybe he just went off the rails with anxiety when success starts.
*  Because that's one of the things that does happen.
*  And I've talked about it.
*  I think everybody admits it.
*  When it first starts happening, you think it's going to go away.
*  You get super anxiety ridden.
*  You feel like an imposter.
*  And you like, you can't, like you'd show up on the set and you're like, are they kicking me out?
*  Like, I'm still here?
*  My bud, I'm telling you, I still deal with that.
*  I'm not even kidding.
*  You obviously don't and you haven't.
*  I do though.
*  Do you really?
*  Yeah, I do.
*  I just ignore it.
*  I tell it to shut the fuck up.
*  Well, that's what you got to do, I guess.
*  And that's what I don't do enough because I start thinking and I get thinking and I start overthinking both sides.
*  I'm like, oh gosh, what if this happens or this that this means something to this day?
*  Yeah.
*  Like if I'm doing like a theater and it's my people, you know, and I know that they're coming to pay to see me, I I'm pretty confident.
*  I feel like I'm going to do well.
*  But if I do a club that they don't know me, oh, yeah, yeah, like I did a corporate gig like a month ago, like in Miami.
*  And I was like, you know, I was like, oh, boy, because corporate gigs, you know, they can go either way and it's horrible.
*  Well, I get there.
*  It's in Miami.
*  Really good looking people.
*  Everybody it's in a lobby of a hotel and I'm I thought this was in the theater.
*  I'm there and it's a good and I'm now I'm getting worried.
*  I'm like, I got to do how much?
*  And they're like, you got to do an hour.
*  And then I find out nobody there wants to see me.
*  The woman who is the like CEO of this company was it was her birthday and she liked me.
*  So she brought me in to for all her friends to see, dude, I'm sitting in the lobby and I'm finding all this information out as I'm sitting there.
*  And I started I'm not kidding.
*  I started I've never had a panic attack.
*  I start going, what do you mean?
*  She nobody else knows I'm here or this or that or they don't know.
*  They go, no, no, no, they don't know.
*  You know, this is a company and, you know, and I'm looking in the room.
*  It's in the lobby.
*  I can see through like a little glass window and they're drinking.
*  They're having they're talking at tape.
*  We're set up for comedy, too, just like round tables, booths, like not even facing you.
*  And I'm on I see a postage stamp of a stage that I got to stand on.
*  And I'm like, oh, my gosh, I start hyperventilating.
*  I go, which I was so I start going, I can't I can't do this.
*  I'm talking to Skylar, my assistant buddy.
*  You know, he's helping me out here.
*  And I'm like, hey, just tell them we can't do it.
*  He said, what are you talking about?
*  I go, just tell them we're going to give them the money back.
*  We're just not going to do it. We don't need to do this.
*  I don't want to do it. It's not going to go well.
*  I started really panicking.
*  And then they started going up.
*  She's up on stage now introducing me and I go, oh, my gosh, we're going.
*  Oh, my gosh.
*  So I start freaking out.
*  Oh, exactly.
*  I've been doing comedy for 30 years.
*  I've been doing stand up. I go, I don't need this.
*  I'm ready to call Susie and go, I don't want to do this anymore.
*  I don't want to do it.
*  I get up there and go, I go, just get him with that first joke.
*  If you do, you settle it.
*  Because if you don't, you know, if they don't buy you on that first joke, you're gone.
*  You're gone for an hour.
*  For an hour, you're gone.
*  Oh, gosh.
*  And they're not even listening.
*  They're loud when they bring me up.
*  And when I came up, it wasn't even like they all turned and went nuts.
*  But I got him. I don't know what I said.
*  I just said one joke about the lady thanking me, thanking for bringing me up.
*  And I just won them over in one little sweet way.
*  And they turned and they clapped and they laughed at one thing.
*  And then I went into another joke very gingerly, just kind of going this, that.
*  And they laughed at that. And I go, OK, I just settled in.
*  I go, I got him. And they were great.
*  They were great. They were really great.
*  And I was sweating the whole time. I really feel in the sweat.
*  You know what I'm saying? It was like it was it was it was rough.
*  But that's so nerve wracking.
*  Oh, glad it worked out great. But I hate it.
*  But I just ran into Sandler when I missed you at the airport.
*  I ran into Sandler.
*  He was just telling me about the fucking worst corporate gig that he just had to do.
*  Yeah, I called him about he had the same thing.
*  He had the same thing. So it's nice to see somebody like that as too.
*  Yeah, a guy like him can still eat dick.
*  I talked to Billy Joel and he says he literally he was like, I've gone through those.
*  I'm like, you. But when you play music, it's different.
*  They'll throw that Saudi money. Yeah.
*  He threw crazy money at him.
*  And he did a corporate gig or whatever it was.
*  And he says they weren't even listening. They turned away.
*  And it's like just you and the band and you just go, let's go, boys.
*  You know, and they play.
*  Dana White had a 40th birthday party and Stone Temple Pilots played.
*  And it was insane.
*  These dudes played like it was a packed arena. Where?
*  It was at a fucking conference room in a hotel somewhere.
*  They didn't care. They didn't give a fuck.
*  They had a beautiful stage set up.
*  The stage was set up nice.
*  But like, you know, all of a sudden they were like, hey, everybody, Stone Temple Pilots.
*  And then they fucking.
*  Davis went. Yeah, I was so impressed by his ability to perform.
*  I mean, there's like it took a while for people to even filter to the dance floor in front of them and watch the show.
*  This dude did it like there was 50,000 people out there.
*  It was incredible.
*  I mean, he didn't back off at all.
*  He who cares less has more power.
*  It's literally like that's it.
*  I'm going around with a tray of like, you guys think this is funny?
*  He's like, I don't care.
*  He didn't give a fuck.
*  And everybody jumps in.
*  Full commitment.
*  You know, when someone just fully commits to something like that, it's very inspiring.
*  And you'll never forget that.
*  Because if you never see anybody fully commit, that's why you never see great comics ever that exists where there's no other great comics.
*  The best comic in the world never comes out of Tallahassee.
*  Right out of nowhere.
*  No scene.
*  We all need to see other people do something special.
*  And if you're lucky, you live in New York or you live in L.A.
*  or now you live in Texas and you get to see these killers all the time.
*  Yeah. And then you get a sense of it.
*  So you know, like where the watermark is.
*  Right. Until you see a guy jump in front of a fucking 40th birthday party who's a platinum selling artist in this insane band.
*  It's iconic and perform like they're performing in front of a really had the bullhorn and everything.
*  It was incredible. It was incredible.
*  The show was amazing.
*  Wow. It was so good.
*  But it was like that fucking guy worked for his money.
*  Like he he he doesn't he didn't have like I'll give him a seven tonight.
*  I give him an eight every night.
*  He's done. Yeah.
*  The area we were playing.
*  It's like guns blazing.
*  That's the way you got to be.
*  Man, I got it.
*  I got to do it.
*  You know, I mean, I need a hype man.
*  I'm doing two different guys.
*  I am.
*  You know, you know, you know, you know, if I'm left to my own devices, I go into a little hole.
*  I do. It's my whole life.
*  Everything.
*  Sports, everything.
*  But this is the thing.
*  Like I have I'm playing a first my first arena coming up and I'm freaking out.
*  I've never done that.
*  Are you doing it in the round?
*  No.
*  That's the way to do it.
*  You know why?
*  This is late for that.
*  This is that's OK.
*  You'll still have a great time.
*  They're still great.
*  The arenas are great.
*  They're fun.
*  It's a wild experience.
*  But the round is the best because it's actually intimate in the strangest way.
*  I don't know.
*  The music fair.
*  Yeah.
*  Facing everybody.
*  Yes.
*  So all the people see each other and they're all in it together.
*  I love that.
*  I love that idea.
*  But does the stage does it turn?
*  No, you walk around.
*  I used to do the one.
*  You know, the Westbury Music Fair.
*  Oh, it walks.
*  It's been for you and you wouldn't even know where the hell you are.
*  And then you have to walk off.
*  It's an awkward walk off.
*  You don't know where the stairs are.
*  You don't know where they are.
*  It moved and everybody shifted.
*  You don't know who you're looking at.
*  You have to get to find some distinctive person in the audience.
*  Mark it.
*  That big guy is my marker.
*  Yeah.
*  The one in Phoenix spins around too.
*  What's that?
*  The Celebrity Theater?
*  You can turn it on or off.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a good one too.
*  Because it's a comedy club, but it's in the round.
*  It's like a 2000 seat comedy club in the round.
*  That's what it's like.
*  I would feel guilty.
*  Like half the crowd is looking.
*  I'd be thinking now I've got another thing to think about.
*  They've seen my ass for the last 40 minutes.
*  I've got to spend it.
*  Yeah.
*  And do you set up a joke over here and deliver the punchline there?
*  Or how do you break it up?
*  Well, you have giant screens.
*  So the thing about the arena is they have massive screens.
*  So if for some reason, like we did these ones in Ohio and Chappelle came down and it was very interesting to watch.
*  Because they didn't know he was supposed to be there.
*  And it was my show.
*  And Tony didn't know whether he's going to bring Dave up or me because Dave hadn't gotten there yet.
*  Oh, wow.
*  And so it's like Tony's on stage and he's got like five minutes before he should go on stage.
*  And also Dave rolls up.
*  Posse fucking limo.
*  This is a guy who doesn't overthink things.
*  You don't need the hype man.
*  He just strolled in.
*  Yeah.
*  And he just came to say hi.
*  And he's always like, should I go up?
*  I go, what do you mean should you go up?
*  I go, go up.
*  Let's go.
*  He goes, when?
*  I go, you'll be up in five minutes.
*  He goes, well, let's have a drink.
*  So we had a drink.
*  And then we're sitting in the green room.
*  I go, dude, he's got about one minute to go.
*  I go, I'll walk out there with you.
*  Because he needs to know that it's not me, that he's bringing up Dave.
*  So he starts bringing me up.
*  This is one of my best friends, one of my favorite people.
*  And then I'm like flashing the light and he sees Dave.
*  And the crowd slowly starts to realize it's Dave when they see me and Dave walk to the stage.
*  And by the time he says Ohio zone, Dave Chappelle, it is one full minute of a standing ovation.
*  One full minute.
*  So he takes this victory lap around the stage for like one, I mean, a full minute, man.
*  It was, I filmed it.
*  I put it up on my Instagram.
*  It's insane.
*  It's inspiring.
*  I mean, Tony, we're just looking at each other and looking around going, wow.
*  It just felt special.
*  It felt like special that you could be there.
*  Like, wow.
*  And then he goes, oh, and he puts the mic down.
*  Even bigger.
*  It was insane.
*  It was insane.
*  It was so fucking cool because he's from Ohio.
*  Right.
*  You know, he lives in Yellow Springs, which is like right outside of Dayton.
*  So it's like for him to go there like that, but to be in the round.
*  See, the round is everybody sees everybody.
*  It's not just you facing this crowd and then you're in the crowd and they're there in the round.
*  It seems like everyone's all in this together.
*  It's so much better.
*  Yeah.
*  And the screens are giant.
*  So you just walk around.
*  But like when Dave was facing that way, I'd see his face on the screen.
*  It's not bad.
*  It's like it's still awesome because you're there and everybody just kind of walks around.
*  You just get used to walking around.
*  Nobody really stands still.
*  Right.
*  And points in one direction.
*  Right.
*  In an arena in the round.
*  That would be rude.
*  Well, the screens help.
*  I mean, that is true.
*  Oh, it's massive.
*  Yeah.
*  They're everywhere.
*  They're giant.
*  Yeah.
*  50 feet wide.
*  They're fucking everywhere.
*  So that's it makes it easy.
*  It's an experience.
*  I would love to be in there.
*  I think I'm in Denver and Salt Lake City where I'm worried about this.
*  My first arena is in it.
*  You're going to have fun.
*  It's going to be fun.
*  You just.
*  It's going to be fun.
*  Now this is Dave.
*  Here it is.
*  Listen to this.
*  It's like a fight.
*  Oh my God.
*  I mean, you literally can't even hear him.
*  Bring up Dave Chappelle.
*  Look at this.
*  Look at this.
*  That's insane.
*  No.
*  No.
*  It's like, that's the sickest thing I've ever seen.
*  It was like, I felt like we were seeing the Beatles.
*  I felt like it was like Hendrix got on stage.
*  Well done for you bringing him up before.
*  I mean, that's insane.
*  It was awesome.
*  That's incredible.
*  It was so fun.
*  It was so.
*  But that's the thing.
*  It's like, but I do that all the time.
*  You know, when I'm at the club, I'll have five, six guys are going on in front of me.
*  They're all headliners.
*  I'm going on stage an hour and a half into the show.
*  I would, again, my thing is I'm going to be on stage for a week.
*  I'm going to be on stage for a week.
*  I'm going to be on stage for a week.
*  I'm going to be on stage for a week.
*  I'm going to be on stage for a week.
*  I would, again, my thing is I'm going to be on stage for a week.
*  I'm going to be on stage for a week.
*  I'm going to be on stage for a week.
*  I'm going to be on stage for a week.

*  I'm going to be on stage for a week.
*  I'm going to be on stage for a week.
*  I'm going to be on stage for a week.
*  I'm going to be on stage for a week.
*  It's all a bunch of different...
*  But for me, it's like to have a...
*  I want the audience to see the best possible show they could see.
*  So they're going to see Ron White.
*  They're going to see Shane Gillis and Tony Hinchcliffe and Brian Simpson.
*  That's insane.
*  And all these monsters that come into town.
*  In any given week, it's Christa Stefano or fucking Dave Smith.
*  It's like there's so many killers.
*  How often during the week are you there and how often are guys working out their stuff
*  there?
*  Seven nights a week.
*  Seven nights a week.
*  Seven nights a week.
*  Two shows each night in each room, except for Mondays and Sundays, which are open mic
*  nights.
*  So open mic night, there's a show in the small room.
*  There's only one show.
*  But then there's at least one show in the main room that's a regular show, like regular
*  comedians.
*  Wow.
*  That's incredible.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's two shows a night in each room.
*  So four shows a night.
*  How big are each room?
*  One's 250 and one's about 110 to 120.
*  Do you feel a difference?
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  The little one's super intimate.
*  The little one is like, if you remember the belly room at the comic store, it's like the
*  belly room in the original room had a baby.
*  And that's the little one.
*  Wow.
*  It's like medium sized little.
*  And then the big room is like the original room and the main room at the comic store
*  had a baby.
*  That's what it's like.
*  And when you're trying out stuff, people going up there with like notepads and stuff like
*  that.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Christina Positzky does it all the time.
*  She goes up with a notepad.
*  Yeah, it's like if you got some new shit, you're working on cigars.
*  He goes over with no pads if you have new shit.
*  Right.
*  Because you want to be able to remember.
*  You don't want to fuck up the bit.
*  And the audience kind of appreciates like, oh, this is so new.
*  They feel that it's.
*  They have to look at it.
*  Yeah, it's not polished.
*  And then Brian Simpson hosts this show called Bottom of the Barrel.
*  And that's a really fun show where you go up there and you have no material and you
*  just reach into this whiskey barrel.
*  And there's a bunch of different premises that the audience members have written down.
*  And you pull it out, you open it up.
*  And you do a bit on that.
*  Yeah, you just start talking shit.
*  Yeah.
*  But the audience knows that's what you're doing.
*  So because they know what you're doing, it's really fun.
*  Yeah, they're not expecting polished material.
*  Everybody knows what the show is.
*  The show is fucking around.
*  And maybe if I was to go there and do my act, I would pretend like I pulled that out of
*  the whiskey bottle first, the barrel.
*  Did you ever notice?
*  Yeah. But you can like if you have a bit on a subject and you just tell them, I actually
*  have a bit on the subject and then you can do it.
*  Right. You know, and there's also like sometimes there's like there's the other night, there's
*  something that I've been writing that I've never done on stage before.
*  And just by sheer coincidence, the same subject was something that I pulled out of the piece
*  of paper. Are you kidding? Yeah.
*  So I was like, oh, robot fuck dolls.
*  Right. Which is like, you know, I have a whole chunk on that.
*  Now I'm going to throw it away because you're working on it.
*  I don't want to. But it was one of those moments where I like, oh, I was like last night.
*  I spent two hours writing stuff on this.
*  Right. So let's just run with it here.
*  See what happens. Have you ever had a dip?
*  Because they must go nuts when they see you. Right.
*  Yeah. And then because back on Long Island, I'll work out of a little club like Governor's,
*  you know, you know, I don't know if you remember that.
*  Oh, yeah. Governor's Levittown.
*  Yeah. And I'll go out there and I'm hometown boy.
*  And I go up there and they go nuts for like a minute or so.
*  Not like that. But like they go crazy.
*  It's fun to see you. And then within two minutes, if I don't like they're ordering sausage rolls.
*  And it's like they're they're they're they're talking and it's it's it's like putting weight on the bar.
*  Yeah. I'm like, whoa. Yeah.
*  Well, New York audiences, too.
*  They just they don't have much patience for bullshit.
*  It's a good place to start comedy.
*  New York and Boston, both good places to start comedy because people don't have any patience for bullshit.
*  Right. Yeah. Yeah.
*  We're happy to see you. But come with the jokes.
*  Exactly. Let's go. Come on.
*  I mean, I'm here to laugh. Yeah.
*  I do a lot of writing while I have a tour, like if I have a tour in the theaters, you know,
*  where I'll try to if I have a set theme set, I'll try to add some stuff in there for the next one.
*  Have you done that? Do you ever? Yeah.
*  Yeah. When you do a lot of shows, it's great.
*  Yeah. Because you kind of get a sense of where you could stick stuff in and you always have the safety net of I can go here.
*  If it's going nowhere. Yeah.
*  That's my problem. That's what I do, too.
*  I'll write a huge chunk on something and won't know when to bail on it if it's not going.
*  Well, you know, it's dependent on this.
*  I got to follow through with it now. And if you're not in, they don't buy in right away.
*  I'm like, wow, I got three more minutes of this stuff.
*  Oftentimes, I realize it's because I didn't buy in. Right.
*  That's what it is. Mostly with me.
*  If I'm entering a bit committed, I don't want to be talking about this.
*  I wish I shouldn't didn't bring this one up.
*  Like, if I ever get to that place, like you just have to fight off that thought.
*  There's this thought that comes into your mind like, oh, why did I bring this up?
*  I don't want to do this bit. You can't.
*  But you can't say, you know what? Fuck that bit.
*  Yes. Then the audience would be like, what? Yes. Yes.
*  So you just have to never let yourself get to the mindset where you're like, I don't want to do this.
*  You got to remember there was something, whatever the subject is, there was something about that subject
*  that when you initially started writing a joke about it, it was resonating with you.
*  And you were like, what the fuck is this? Right.
*  But if you hear it too many times, it's like anything else.
*  You get tired of it. It loses its luster. But that's just a mental weakness.
*  You just have to realize, get your head wrapped around that you can't allow yourself to think that way.
*  And surely this thought originally was valid because that's why you're so excited about it.
*  That's why you wrote a bit about it.
*  The audience doesn't know that you've said it a hundred times over the last year or more.
*  They just want to hear it. Right.
*  So they want to hear it from fresh eyes.
*  So you have to put yourself in fresh eyes. Right.
*  You have to be able to do that. And that's the trick.
*  And it's not like you're faking it either.
*  You have to actually really be thinking about it like you think about it.
*  If you want it to work at the best, you know, like when a bit is really sharp.
*  Yeah. You have to be thinking about it as you're like enthusiastically.
*  As it's coming to you. Yeah.
*  You have to be actually engaged with each part of it while it's happening.
*  Well, when I write a new bit and if I write a big chunk and it's too much,
*  I'll go up with too much stuff.
*  And I didn't rehearse it like because words are so efficient.
*  You'd say one word or you're repeating a word.
*  It stumbles you up and then you're like, you know, and then it kind of blows it for this.
*  The next part of the bit.
*  So it's like, I got to work more at like really rehearsing my bits, you know,
*  just really getting through how I'm going to speak, how I'm going to, you know,
*  because I stumble all the time.
*  Well, that's the problem is then you start thinking about it.
*  Right. You know, and with new bits,
*  they're just not etched into your brain yet.
*  So as you go up with them, you know, they're like little Bambi walking on ice.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Steadily. Yeah.
*  That's yeah.
*  But that's what like small shows are good for.
*  That's what fucking around is good for. Right.
*  And that's what also is like, that's when it's really important
*  that you're inspired by whatever this idea is.
*  If I'm inspired by the idea, I can always talk about it. Right.
*  Like if there's a thing that I can get behind where I go,
*  so you explain this to me and then if I'm in that mindset, I can make it happen.
*  But I just can never let myself not be interested in what I'm talking about.
*  Right. That's just that's a problem that people have and that I've had.
*  And it's it's just but you have to recognize that it's like
*  throwing a toaster in a bathtub.
*  Well, what I'm trying to do now is because I really I used to write just
*  every it was just separate jokes, joke, joke, joke, joke here.
*  And every time I would bring up a new subject, it was like
*  the audience is starting from scratch again to try to catch up.
*  And it's exhausting to try to understand.
*  So if I if I try to put it in a story or like a theme to my set,
*  at least they kind of know what's happening before.
*  You know, so they know, oh, this is this is, you know, you tend to do these type
*  of things and then you talk about something like that.
*  They go with you. It's like you're not starting a, you know, it's easy to.
*  What does it push a moving car?
*  Momentum, exactly.
*  And that's been working better for me because, you know, I saw everything was like
*  just isolated bits of jokes that I would put, you know, and I'd go,
*  I just put them in anywhere, put a lazy connective tissue to it, you know,
*  and it would be like it would work.
*  You get the laugh, but it's like there's no, you know, building.
*  That's why I always admired guys like Steven Wright.
*  Oh, man. Non sequiturs.
*  I'm like, how do you do that?
*  And how do you write?
*  Right. That's going to be so hard to write.
*  Who's the guy? Die.
*  Is it? Edbert? Yes. Same thing.
*  Yeah. Same thing.
*  Non sequiturs. Yeah. Amazing.
*  And you were with him.
*  And that's what made it even funnier.
*  You know, it's like who does that now?
*  Are there any non sequitur guys that just go joked?
*  I guess Jimmy Carr is kind of non sequitur.
*  But some guys just they're just one bit to the next.
*  Yeah. One subject to the next.
*  And with Mitch Hedberg, it was always like super ridiculous.
*  And Steven Wright, same thing.
*  Everything was really ridiculous.
*  And that became something that actually elevated it.
*  Like, right. Yeah.
*  I mean, like it was the they weren't storytellers.
*  You know, right.
*  It was part it was part of the fun.
*  So out of it. Yeah.
*  This guy was like, I don't know where somebody asked me,
*  do I want a frozen banana?
*  I said no, but I want a regular banana later.
*  So, yes.
*  He's the fucking he's the best.
*  He was amazing, man.
*  That was a guy like that.
*  He just didn't want to kick heroin.
*  They were trying to get him to kick heroin.
*  He's like, uh, I like it.
*  Is that what it was? He just he liked it.
*  He just wasn't going to kick it.
*  He was hospitalized while we were on the man show.
*  And Doug Stanhope and he and Mitch were very close.
*  And I, you know, I admired him deeply as comedian.
*  He said he was a great comic man.
*  And that was when he was I think he was hospitalized with gangrene.
*  Yeah, because he was shooting it, you know.
*  Allegedly. It's heroin is a scary one
*  because it seems to touch this part of people
*  that makes them very creative and like it resonates with people.
*  Like so much music that's great. It's made on heroin.
*  But what a curse. What a curse.
*  When you watch someone who gets caught in the opiate web, it's so terrifying.
*  It's so sad to see. Yeah.
*  And when you have someone who's just like this, I mean, imagine
*  the kind of bits that Mitch Hedberg could have come up with
*  over all these decades after that. What a talent.
*  Yeah. And he was all non sequitur.
*  It was all one bit leads into the next bit. Double tree hotel.
*  I love it. I love it. Yeah.
*  I love that humor, man. Just he was amazing.
*  Yeah, he was. He was.
*  It's just, you know, that guy had a hard time in the beginning
*  because people didn't know what he was doing.
*  So he would go on after like these high energy, like music acts. Yeah.
*  Guys would sing songs and shit and they'd have like a dirty rap
*  and just bring up. Yeah.
*  And it'd be different like that in death.
*  And you're in the middle of Ohio or whatever.
*  And so they're not used to that.
*  And they want the song and they don't know who you are.
*  You're just the headliner.
*  Oh, he's on evening at the improv. OK.
*  And then they go to see you.
*  They really didn't know.
*  They just said, oh, look, MTV, half hour comedy.
*  Are you must be good?
*  And then they go to the local comedy club because it's a thing to do on a Friday night.
*  But when they don't know you, like that's one thing
*  that is, you know, made it a little bit easier is when people are coming to see you
*  and they know you as opposed to who's this next guy.
*  And it's kind of like just make me way, way, way easier.
*  But also comes with a trap because the laugh at stuff that's not that good.
*  Right. Like we've all seen guys who only perform for their crowds
*  only, like in big places, like they only do theaters, only do their crowds only.
*  Like that can get soft.
*  Yeah, it can get soft and still work. Right.
*  Because they're not being tested.
*  They're not performed with other comics all the time.
*  Well, you see a lot of these guys now that are developing an act
*  because they did something on like Instagram or whatever.
*  They develop these audiences that, you know, they get popular.
*  Yeah. And then they put together an act, they go and the clubs are like,
*  well, let's put this guy up.
*  You know. Yeah. And they sell out like crazy because, you know,
*  they got a big following. Yeah.
*  But it's not like working your stand up, man. It's a different game.
*  Well, there's also a lot of guys who do crowd control.
*  Like they do crowd work stuff like it's like just fucking around with the crowd.
*  And that's most of these clips.
*  You've seen a lot of guys who put up clips of cloud work,
*  because that way they don't have to crowd work because you don't have to burn
*  your material. Just talking to the crowd. Right. Talk to them.
*  It's fine. I can go bad. It can go bad.
*  But if you do it enough and you get to get good at it moments. Right.
*  Like you show there's a lot of great moments.
*  He's really good at it.
*  And you take those clips and that way you're putting shit up,
*  but you're not burning any of your jokes.
*  The problem is some of those guys can only do that.
*  Schultz is a great comic. Like he could do great bits.
*  He could do great. I mean, he can do anything. Right.
*  Some of these guys are only good at talking to the audience.
*  And then when they have to do, did you ever notice? Right.
*  Everybody's like, whoa.
*  The audience can feel the shift when I go back to my own material.
*  You wrote this.
*  Yeah. What is this? You whack ass bullshit.
*  Yeah. But thinking about all day.
*  You know, you're better off responding like there's there's certain guys
*  that like their thing is really just talking to the crowd.
*  And that's that's a different thing.
*  It's a great thing.
*  It's really great when someone's funny at it.
*  But it's also a different thing than the actual jokes.
*  See, I I I fear that.
*  Like, I don't like doing that.
*  Like, so I've built my act with the the the the speed of it that it like
*  no one has the chance to get in and ask a question or heckle or whatever.
*  You know, you build this shell around you.
*  So like, it's just not enough time. You can't even get it in.
*  So if someone says something, it's like you're off them.
*  You know, because I don't want to have to depend on doing that.
*  Going what? And stopping and then trying to get back to the bit
*  that you were, you know, doing.
*  Yeah, that you don't need that.
*  Some people like it.
*  Some people like to interact with the crowd.
*  It just it's also it's extra juice.
*  Right. The audience realizes it's happening.
*  It's real. It is. Yeah. Yeah.
*  This is crazy.
*  And then if you get a good one liners, you know, in the moment,
*  it's a great tool to have.
*  I wish I could, you know, depend on what do you talk to the crowd at all?
*  I do. Occasionally you have to.
*  And then at the Comedy Store, you had to the Comedy Store.
*  You had to the Comedy Store for the longest time at zero crowd control.
*  They do a good job now of policing the room.
*  But back then there was it was comics that were the door people.
*  It was comics that seeded people, the comics that took the
*  the money at the cash register, comics work in there.
*  And they were all like, they didn't want to do that job.
*  So they were the worst bouncers.
*  And nobody ever quieted the audience.
*  It was just you need to learn how to do it in the fire.
*  Toughen up that way.
*  Like you build a you you understand how to go with the flow. Right.
*  You know, and some but some people don't do that.
*  And they did not like the Comedy Store for that reason.
*  Like they just go up there and they like to have a slow pace
*  and do their bits and build. That's me. That's more me.
*  I would have been I was always afraid of the Comedy Store.
*  It's just when you go up, like if if, you know,
*  someone like Adam Eaget is who's brilliant at scheduling
*  and really understands talent and where people go,
*  you just want to put them in the right place.
*  You don't want to put them after a music act. Right.
*  You know, like that's the death that is absolute.
*  Death is the guy who has the funny songs. Right.
*  You're not following.
*  You just see the guitar in the back and the guys
*  tuning it up and you're like, oh, no, when is he on?
*  And he's like, he's on next.
*  Then you're up. Then, you know, no, no.
*  The guy with the guitar always ruined the show.
*  They always killed.
*  They would kill and you couldn't follow him.
*  Yep. Yeah.
*  I use a galax rap.
*  Anybody could do a rap. Remember, Red Johnny and the Round Guy?
*  Oh, yeah. Those guys would do that rap. You're done.
*  It was the show was over.
*  You see them go. You get in my car. I'm leaving.
*  I'll see you later.
*  I go, I'm not. There's no need for me to be here.
*  It's crazy how like a like a song or a stick, a funny song.
*  It just tops everything. Yeah.
*  Who is that guy that used to be on Dr. Demento?
*  There was that guy that used to have dirty songs back in the day.
*  And he was famous.
*  He would tour around with dirty songs.
*  John Balby. Yes.
*  Thank you. Yes. That guy.
*  Remember that guy? Dr. Dirty. Dr. Dirty.
*  Yeah, that's right. He would light up a room.
*  He would light up a room. Yeah.
*  You're not going on. No, it's over.
*  And everybody knew who he was.
*  And you would hear songs on like Dr. Demento.
*  Remember like late night on the radio?
*  You hear his songs. Yeah.
*  He would tour and do just dirty blowjob songs and everybody go.
*  Yeah, I had a business man.
*  And I'm going up there talking about puppies afterwards.
*  Hey, you guys ever.
*  Ever lose your key?
*  And you're searching like this guy's talking about getting a blowjob
*  where you're taking a shit.
*  It's he was just like, but he had that following of people
*  that would just come to see just those songs.
*  So they would hear the same songs over and over again.
*  Right. Right. Yes.
*  That's another thing. Yes. Like Dice had that.
*  Like Dice could always do the rhymes and the audience wanted to hear those rhymes.
*  What's in the bow, bitch? Oh, you don't have to write as much.
*  It's great. Right. You can, you know.
*  But you're going to get bored.
*  Like, you know, is it ever see that Kinnison song about the Beach Boys?
*  Kinnison bit Kinnison had a bit about the Beach Boys, about like,
*  you know, imagine them 35 years later singing the song.
*  Same fucking song, like not wanting to be there anymore.
*  Yeah. That is just not the same experience.
*  That's tough. Yeah.
*  Yeah. You want you want to be able to do new stuff.
*  The new stuff is scary, but it's so exciting.
*  I mean, I've found like it's
*  I never really worked my act like when I started doing the show and
*  and getting involved with that, my stand up, the writing and all that,
*  I would still go to like Vegas with Ray to do it on a weekend.
*  But I wasn't working my stuff.
*  I wasn't a comedian. You know what I'm saying? Right.
*  You got to really, you know, and I felt that, you know,
*  you're delivering the same act year after year, kind of changing here
*  a little bit here and there.
*  And then you're going out and doing it.
*  And it was like, it was bothering me so much.
*  I hated my act. I couldn't stand doing it anymore.
*  And didn't have time to write that much.
*  So like a few years back, I just stopped and said, I love stand up so much.
*  Like, I just want to start and really get into it.
*  And I tell you, it's it's how much time did you take off of it?
*  I wasn't really off.
*  It was just like I would keep it going, but just doing shows, no writing.
*  Like I really wasn't writing for years.
*  Just do it. Yeah. Yeah.
*  I mean, if something funny hit me, I would write it down, but not not working it.
*  Not writing. It's so hard when you're doing a television show, you know,
*  and when I was doing news radio, I fell into a real
*  like a spot over a period, at least a year where I wasn't writing at all.
*  I didn't do any new jokes.
*  I had the same tired ass jokes.
*  You were we I remember jumping in your Supra
*  and heading to the comedy store.
*  Like you would go up a lot.
*  You would still do things there. No. Yeah.
*  But that maybe that was a different time.
*  That was when I saw out of it. OK.
*  So there was a period.
*  It was a there was a period when I first moved there in like 94
*  where we were working like 16 hours a day.
*  And I was tired all the time.
*  And I would just show up at the club and do my set and then go.
*  And I was just doing it because I was still a comic. Yeah.
*  I was like, you know, that's what I felt like I was doing.
*  I had I was always like, they're going to realize I'm not an actor.
*  I'm going to get fired.
*  This is this is the last TV show I ever work.
*  I almost got fired from the first show I ever got was on. Right.
*  Where I was the star of the show. Hardball.
*  Yeah, I almost got fired from.
*  I remember that one because I was I was getting in an argument with the producer.
*  They hired some new producer and he wrote these terrible lines.
*  I was like, this is insane.
*  Like, this is so bad. It's insane.
*  And they were going to fire me. You didn't stop.
*  I get mad. I was like, this is great.
*  Well, the thing is, the guys who wrote the original show were brilliant.
*  They wrote for Married with Children.
*  They wrote for the Simpsons. Right.
*  And Jeff Martin and Kevin Curran.
*  And when they had their show, the pilot was their show.
*  Like Jim Brewer was the mascot. I remember that.
*  It was fun. Yeah. Mike Star from Goodfellas was in it.
*  I mean, it was Bruce Greenwood, the guy that went on to be
*  in the Star Trek movies.
*  These guys have been in everything. He was in Hardball.
*  I remember. I go to your tapings. It was so much fun.
*  They were going to fire me because I was like, this is terrible.
*  I love so they hired a new producer.
*  The new producer came in and took over and turned it into like
*  the sloppiest, most obvious, terrible sitcom.
*  Like that prototypical sitcom where you watch and you go, oh,
*  he's got to get out of the room. The jokes are so goddamn obvious. Right.
*  And they want to fire him.
*  But it was between me and him.
*  And so it literally got down to this thing where my, you know,
*  they're calling my agent saying this kid is ruining his career.
*  And I was like, oh, no, I'm ruining my career.
*  So I always thought that eventually they were going to figure out, right,
*  that I've not built for this. This is not my thing.
*  And so when I would show up on on the set of a news radio, it was like,
*  it's like at any moment in time, they're going to figure out
*  that I'm not supposed to be here.
*  But we were working because you didn't want to, though.
*  I thought you were funny as hell in that stuff.
*  Yeah, I was like, you just didn't like it. You didn't.
*  You're insecure.
*  Didn't have any experience about actors.
*  Didn't know how to hang around with them.
*  I was so used to comics. Right.
*  So for me, it was like fighters and then comics. Right.
*  So just crazy people.
*  It was just only around crazy people.
*  So I was around normal people or people that were like really sensitive,
*  like really, really sensitive, like sensitive on purpose.
*  Like what they're trying to be offended by.
*  That's sitcom people. And, you know, when we get into that,
*  oh, it's exhausting.
*  That's hilarious. It was exhausting.
*  And you would always hear about tyrants.
*  You'd always hear about like the Brett Butler's and the people
*  that would scream and throw coffee in the face of the writers.
*  News radio was that bad? Like those guys were.
*  Oh, there's none of that. Right.
*  No, no, there was a party.
*  The writers were great.
*  It was a totally different kind of experience. Right.
*  But what was my point? My point was that what was my point?
*  You were saying that thought I was going to get fired.
*  Yeah, you wasn't.
*  It wasn't for you. You thought they're going to find you out.
*  Oh, so I had to just do stand up just to prove that I was still a comic.
*  Because I remember one point in time, the producer of News Radio said to me,
*  it was like, why are you still doing stand up?
*  You're an actor now. Oh, no.
*  I would take that. I was like, oh, no.
*  I got to get out of here.
*  I was like, I was literally thinking like, oh, this is like a changing you.
*  It's a trap. And then
*  I had one really bad set one night in front of one of the producers
*  and one of the writers, fucking eight, shit, whatever the store.
*  Like late at night at like one a.m.
*  in the main room and just had a terrible set, just bombed.
*  And then I really got to work after that.
*  Then I realized like, oh, I've been slacking off.
*  That's what I felt, man.
*  I've been slacking off because I've been working 16 hour days
*  and I use it as an excuse to not write.
*  And then from then on, like everything got way better, like way better.
*  My stand up, I dialed it in much more.
*  How do you write? How do you do?
*  Are you the guy sitting down?
*  I mean, I sit down in front of a computer and I just write.
*  I just I don't write like this is exactly how I'm going to say it.
*  I just like spill my thoughts out because I feel like it takes me a lot longer
*  to write the words that it does for me to think about things.
*  So the more time that I'm actually just writing the words,
*  it's extra time thinking about the things you speak into.
*  You talk it. No, I just type. Really? Yeah, I type.
*  And I just whatever the subject is, I like there's this one subject
*  that I'm doing right now where I've written it,
*  written about the subject four times.
*  So I start a whole new Microsoft Word file four times
*  and just completely revisit it just one more time.
*  What program are you using? Because I'm not just word.
*  I just use word word and I go into there's focus mode.
*  Have you seen focus mode?
*  Yeah, so you see everything else out.
*  Yeah, I used to use right room. I'll still use right room.
*  I did Scrivener. I like I use Scrivener. Yeah.
*  But I'll find one thing about it and then I'll go, I don't like this,
*  that it does sets my bits up this way or I can't do this or can't transfer that.
*  And then I'll spend the whole day looking up for apps for the perfect app.
*  And I'm not and I'm not right. Yeah, you distract yourself.
*  Of course. Of course. Yeah.
*  Yeah, I try to avoid that.
*  But Scrivener, what I do at Scrivener is I make each individual bit.
*  Once I have it kind of boiled down, then I put it in the columns.
*  So the way Scrivener set up, you know, whatever the subject is.
*  I love Scrivener. The only thing it didn't do, it didn't transfer
*  transfer to my phone or the other, you know, like when I'm at a gig
*  and I want to look it up quick, you have to go to like a Dropbox.
*  I like that, you know, and it was like it was annoying.
*  I go, I can't I needed right away.
*  Yeah, that's where notes on iPhone is the best.
*  The best. The problem with notes. You ready for this?
*  I got them all. Yeah.
*  You can't categorize you can't it either goes alphabetical.
*  So if you have your bits, I like seeing my bits on the side
*  where I go, OK, I'm working on this and be able to move them anywhere.
*  You can't write because it'll fall into that.
*  That kind of screws me up.
*  That's true that you can't keep it in order.
*  That's the only thing about it.
*  Then I'm off that one.
*  Then I'm looking five more hours. I'm looking for other.
*  Right. Because if you have a folder in your notes
*  and then you open up that folder and edit any one of those things,
*  any one of those subjects, it'll move to the top.
*  Yes, because that's the newest one now. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Yeah, that's not that's that should be an option.
*  Somebody should make a
*  just stand up for one of those things.
*  I would love it. I would love.
*  Yeah, but most comics don't use them.
*  Most comics just write things down like you ever see Mark Norman stack.
*  No, it's crazy.
*  He's got a stack like a fucking like a phone book,
*  like that thick of index cards and napkins that he keeps in his pocket.
*  And he's so crazy.
*  Like you try to read it.
*  You like it's literally like an insane person. Yeah.
*  Because he's already illegible. Yeah.
*  And there's no order to them.
*  There's just stacks.
*  I mean, he might.
*  How many how many do you have in his pocket?
*  One hundred fifty.
*  Easy, easy, way more than easy.
*  Two hundred, two hundred index cards.
*  Where do you get his pocket?
*  How do you go?
*  Here's what I'm going to do tonight.
*  Card 167 to one.
*  No, it's a it's a window into the madness.
*  Yeah. The brilliance of his comedy.
*  It's just I remember Richard Lewis would would throw out.
*  I mean, like there'd be a piano up there and he threw out like a scroll of like
*  it was like just, you know, legal pads of paper and like crazy stuff all over.
*  Set it all up. And it's like he was a little nuts.
*  He was nuts with that. Yeah.
*  That was also part of his thing. Right.
*  There's Norman's look at Norman Stack.
*  Look at that. Look at that.
*  What? Yeah.
*  I can't believe you carry this around.
*  Ninety percent of that get a bad back.
*  I'm worried about his back.
*  But you can get a bad back from that.
*  It's like sitting on a fat wallet.
*  Exactly. Taxi drivers, if they have too much shit in their wallet,
*  you'll you'll have a little bit of a lean.
*  You'll get a bulge in your back.
*  I could never do it. I can never.
*  I don't even know what I need to have it organized.
*  Yeah, it's just yeah, you were always an organized guy,
*  like even back in the day.
*  I admire that.
*  I think that's a very important thing that some comics feel like they don't have to do.
*  And you don't have to do it.
*  Some of the greats don't write anything down.
*  Don't get me wrong.
*  But I feel like when I write, if I just physically write,
*  there's jokes that I will get that I won't get if I don't physically write.
*  And not a few of them, like a lot of them, like some of my best bits ever
*  came from sitting down and writing.
*  Do you find if you write the bit out, physically write it out,
*  that you will remember it better, too?
*  Or by hand? Yeah.
*  If you write it by hand, you remember it better.
*  That's proven.
*  So if I do an arena, I got this from you, by the way.
*  I got this from you because I'm not doing it.
*  No, no, no.
*  No, this is this is what I got from you because I didn't have a writer because I'm lazy.
*  So when I would go do theaters, they would just use Kevin James Ryder.
*  So when I would because we're the same manager.
*  Yes, we're the same manager.
*  I was like, what's Jimmy eating?
*  Did you see that? Yeah, it was like all normal stuff and like whatever.
*  Like maybe I added whiskey to it or whatever it was.
*  But one thing you had was index cards and Sharpies.
*  I was like, oh, that's a great idea.
*  So every time I do an arena now, I set up index cards and I will get there an hour
*  early and write out all my bits, write out all like the key points of the bits,
*  all the things I want to talk about and set that there and then next bit, set that there.
*  And so I have this coffee table and I've got all these things that index.
*  Why don't you do a prom later or something like that?
*  You don't want to do it. No, no, no, no, I don't need that.
*  I'm fine. Once I once I write it all out, I'm doing it every night.
*  I know every night.
*  It's like I just like to do that as an extra little detail, just an extra little
*  just just really dotting all your eyes and crossing all your teeth.
*  I feel good when I I don't know if it's I'm losing my memory or whatever.
*  But it's like I need a I need bullet points up there.
*  It's let me get you some of this.
*  Do you take any more you have topics?
*  I take nothing. OK, this is what you're going to get.
*  I'm going to give you this.
*  Just take this one and I'll get you some more.
*  I'll send you some more. That's Alphabrain.
*  That's on it. Really?
*  So the black label Alphabrain, that is the the top of the food chain.
*  Alphabrain, the strongest one.
*  Am I going to see unicorns? No, no, no, no, no, no.
*  It's just it helps memory.
*  It's really good for memory and it's really good for focus.
*  It just it gives you like a little extra juice mentally.
*  Now, if you're a moron, you're not going to notice it like you.
*  I try fucking shit bullshit snake oil.
*  Trust me, as someone who makes a living using his brain,
*  there are certain things that you can take that are not bad for you,
*  that are just nutrients that enhance brain function.
*  You know, another one is creatine.
*  Creatine is OK. Yeah, it's OK to do that.
*  Oh, yeah. Creatine is very safe.
*  Creatine is one of the safest supplements.
*  It's also what does that do, though?
*  It gives you it's well, it adds water to your body.
*  Your body has more water.
*  And that's one of the functions of it.
*  And it's one of the reasons why it makes your muscles look bigger.
*  It makes you stronger.
*  It really does work as a like a fitness supplement.
*  Like is it like if you're training and lifting weights,
*  creatine is one of the very best things you can take creatine.
*  And I would say beta alanine. That's another one.
*  But I got to I got to give you this thing that wide man gave me.
*  These herbal pills, completely natural.
*  He gave me we were playing golf in I forget,
*  we're in Atlanta or whatever it was with DC.
*  Cormier was there was just the three of us went out and I was, you know,
*  I get up in the morning, my back is killing me, my everything.
*  My joints are hurting.
*  I I get to the course, you know, you walk around hills up and down all day.
*  You know, I'm like, I'm going to be so gone on this thing.
*  And Wybin says, take a couple of these, you know, pills.
*  You got these things that completely herbal.
*  And what is it? It's ashwagandha.
*  Like it's I don't know.
*  But it's with the key with this stuff is I said, well, why?
*  You know, because he gave it to me and he says, just do me a favor.
*  Mark right now where you feel how you feel, how you're doing.
*  I feel horrible. My knees are killing my ankle.
*  Everything. I feel everything.
*  My back, you're swinging a golf club. That's it's brutal.
*  So he goes and just take three and tell me how you feel in like,
*  you know, in a few hours or whatever it was.
*  And I forgot about it.
*  And around the ninth hole, I swear I'm around the turn.
*  I'm it's a couple of hours later.
*  I'm going, I feel amazing for somebody like all the joints, you know, like,
*  like the jujitsu finger thing when you get your first come back.
*  And it's like, oh, that pain.
*  I had all that joint pain. And and and it was gone.
*  I was literally pummeling with DC. I'm like, come on, let's go.
*  I feel amazing. I go, I go, it's the pills.
*  I go, this is insane.
*  I go, can you give me and DC tried them to and DC said,
*  I haven't wrestled in a long time because he tried them.
*  He goes, I love it. Like, I want to know. I know nothing.
*  I go, I'm trying to figure out this is a placebo effect or what it was.
*  He gave it to me again. Same thing. Felt amazing.
*  So Wiedman have those on his Instagram.
*  Can we find out what that stuff is?
*  I'm I want to literally I don't go into business, but I want to.
*  I want in on this thing.
*  Whatever it is, dude, I'm going to give you. I have some try.
*  Yes, just try it. Just mark how you feel if you have any pain.
*  Because if you go, I felt nothing.
*  It might be the case. But these things it I did a few times.
*  And they ran out of him.
*  He couldn't get him. And then he got him again.
*  Everybody is going to for they make that illegal.
*  Whatever I know.
*  They just made BPC one five seven.
*  I know it's it's the way I'm telling you.
*  I'm I'm I'm out of shape now.
*  It is literally the only thing that gets me up.
*  And I'm like, well, I could I could work out. I could do it.
*  Really? I took on my again.
*  I want to know what's in there.
*  Yeah, I'll find out from him.
*  It's all natural stuff.
*  But the thing about it is natural to, you know, I don't know.
*  It's all coming from my earth.
*  I know. But these natural the key, what they said in these things
*  like the guy throws out like because when you get even if you get ashwagandha,
*  the active ingredient in it will, you know, it like once it's got people
*  sell it anyway and it's like dust, it's like crap in there.
*  He doesn't he throws out like 70 percent of the stuff he said.
*  And I was like, I don't know. I don't care what it is.
*  I just want it. I want to give it to my family because I want to feel better.
*  You know, I'm just an older guy. I feel, you know, yeah, I'm
*  you got to help me with that work.
*  And I'm telling you, I am literally right now.
*  I feel like I am on the cusp of either, you know, being that athletic guy,
*  you know, go back into where, you know, I get in shape like crazy
*  or I'm wearing cardigan sweaters and literally, you know, Grandpa.
*  And we'll do well. Just get a trainer.
*  OK, I'm doing a documentary right now. Yeah.
*  And I started it in January.
*  I'm assembling the best guys like I got Dolce.
*  He's going to help me out with this thing. He's awesome.
*  We already did one. We already did a documentary.
*  I did it on. It was called Cheat Day, where I thought you could work out
*  like six days a week and just have one day to eat what you want
*  and just do it that way.
*  And I had Dolce come in and be on be in it with me and and work me out and do it.
*  And he kept going, you know, you're not going to be able to do this.
*  And I go, why? Because you're one day is going to destroy everything.
*  He said, and I remember this, he goes, you can't outwork a bad diet.
*  And he was right.
*  It was like, I would crush it so hard, like
*  people don't know what I can eat.
*  Like, you know, I'm saying, you know, like when people go, I'm a foodie,
*  you know, like it's like you have no idea how much I can crush food.
*  And that one day would just destroy it for the rest.
*  Yeah. The food thing is you can't outrun a bad diet.
*  You just you can't. You can't.
*  It's the best phrase. It's real.
*  That's that's where it all comes from.
*  Comes from food.
*  And we're all addicted to food.
*  And it's the craziest thing if you're addicted to food because you have to eat it.
*  It's not like heroin.
*  That's right. Addicted to heroin.
*  Like, oh, I've got a heroin problem and I'm going to take a little bit of heroin.
*  Right. No, you're going to go full bore again.
*  You're going to be fucked.
*  It's like it's one of the very few things where you're addicted to it
*  and you got to not be addicted to it anymore, but yet you still need to eat it.
*  Well, what? That's crazy.
*  That's a crazy conundrum.
*  And most people's minds can't really process that.
*  That's right. And I can't I just
*  I can't because he he's given me the diet,
*  it's all just this, this and this and this, you know, it's formula.
*  It's very simple.
*  I mean, by the way, does every who needs some another grown man to tell you
*  what to eat, you know, by right, you know, seriously, you know,
*  it's anything we're working out.
*  You don't know. Move your body, whatever it is.
*  You know what to do.
*  You may not know the intricate stuff of like split squats and this and that.
*  Work this thing. But general health, you know,
*  I got to move my body more, eat better foods, less processed.
*  We know it. Yeah.
*  But yet, man, I can't. That's what this documentary I'm doing about.
*  It's like why I have access to the greatest guys.
*  Why can't I still do it?
*  It's like and part of it is I need the Goggins, you know.
*  Yeah, you need a hype man. You do.
*  You need someone around you is also doing it.
*  Well, that's it. It's community. I don't have that.
*  It's like when I'm with Dolce, if we're on a movie together
*  or who does he's got me in shape. He's giving me the meals.
*  And, you know, it makes it when I'm my own captain. Yeah.
*  Homeboy, I'm gone. I'm just gone.
*  You know, one thing that you can try
*  that I guarantee will help you lose weight is the carnivore diet.
*  Because if you do it, the one thing that you're going to not eat
*  is any carbohydrates.
*  You're only going to eat meat.
*  And if you cut out all bread, all pasta, all sugar, all bullshit,
*  I'm not saying this is a great diet.
*  I'm not saying this is the way to live.
*  I'm saying this is the best way for me to eat.
*  I've done every other kind of diet.
*  This one works the best for me.
*  And it's the one that keeps me lean.
*  Because when you eat and just protein, your body hits a satiety level.
*  If you're just eating steak, just steak, your body will hit a level.
*  And you know, this is all I need.
*  And then you won't want to eat more.
*  But if I'm in that same mind space and there's a steak there,
*  but it's next to mashed potatoes,
*  with gravy, a bowl of pasta, ice cream, then I'm going to keep going.
*  And I'm going to get another seven thousand calories.
*  I'm going to keep going.
*  But if I just eat the steak, then my body starts processing ketones.
*  I start instead of using carbohydrates.
*  I'm only eating protein and fats.
*  Your body goes into like a ketogenic state.
*  You think better, gives you an extra gear with thinking.
*  The ketogenic thing is, I mean, that for me is worked.
*  It's because Dolce will hate me for saying like, he's like, you know,
*  when they say blueberry, you know, carbs, he's he's like carbs are fine for you.
*  Like the right carbs.
*  There's nothing wrong with carbs.
*  Right. A fuel for your body. Right.
*  What I'm saying is, if you're trying to lose weight,
*  one of the best ways to regulate your appetite is a carnivore diet
*  because you don't overeat with it.
*  But I think it's deeper than that for me.
*  I think it's mental.
*  I think it's like anything will work.
*  I fasted that work.
*  You know, like I've done everything, you know, it all works for a while.
*  But why am I this size now?
*  You know, I'm you know, every time I'm like, you know,
*  just recently, I started stop comparing myself to other people
*  and trying to like just say, get better than yourself.
*  Yes, literally that that concept for me works.
*  It's like when I'm in there because he'll give me workouts, Dolce to do too.
*  And I can't do I don't do them.
*  I can't do the reps for sets of 16.
*  I get so bored by myself, like I start doing my own stuff.
*  I'll do eclectic stuff.
*  Great stuff on a treadmill or movement stuff.
*  Like I love it. Just throwing punches, doing things.
*  But I walk around and then there's no way to measure it, though,
*  because the next day I'm not doing that.
*  I'm you know, so it's like I'm the guy who walks up to the bag,
*  hits the bag a couple of times, then walks over this thing.
*  I got I have every piece of equipment in my gym.
*  I do. If you if you saw my gym, you go, the rock live here.
*  You know, it's like literally it's like they see me and they're like,
*  what are you doing?
*  It's like I buy everything because I buy into it.
*  I'm like, right. Because it's a little piece of hope.
*  Yeah, that's what it is.
*  Right. Right. A treadmill is a little piece.
*  It's a hope, a new thing.
*  Like I got the Jacobs ladder.
*  I go, oh, it's great.
*  It's jujitsu. You're grabbing the wings. This is great. Functional.
*  Yeah, it's collecting dust is what it's really like because I don't use it.
*  So I need something.
*  That's what this thing is.
*  What can get me because I am like most people I'm telling you,
*  you don't need a lot of stuff, but you need something to engage yourself every day.
*  There's got to be a bridge between what the Goggins way and people who do nothing.
*  Like, like, yeah, you got to get that.
*  Like you I saw you were doing this with the other comedians, which I love.
*  You know, it's like where you go, I just want them to walk or just get it done.
*  They get that is so important, man, because it's like if you can get
*  into that groove, you do feel better.
*  Like, that's what blows my mind.
*  I've gotten in shape a couple of times and I'm like, I don't need to eat any more crap.
*  I don't I love the working. I love the way I feel.
*  And then it slides right back. What happens?
*  Well, it's and it's one of the things about you that makes you really funny
*  is your indulgent.
*  You're just you're a wild dude is like trying to stay buttoned up.
*  It's like part of what's really funny about you. Right.
*  And that indulgence, it goes into other things.
*  And for you, it's food. Right.
*  You know, luckily, it's not gambling or something really crazy. Right.
*  But I don't I quit things, too.
*  Like, like, like, I feel like I have the same
*  almost intensity that you have, but I'm not a finisher.
*  Like, I don't get really into things.
*  We started Jiu Jitsu.
*  Did we start at the same time? Yeah.
*  Beverly Hills Jiu Jitsu.
*  You were the one brought me down there. Yeah.
*  I'm a blue belt.
*  And barely 30.
*  It's like, you know, saying it's like as I start, stop, I don't.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  And that's in my head.
*  I'm like, if I would have done what Joe did, man, look where I could have been.
*  And I, you know, I'm trying to, you know, why?
*  And then I start comparing like, you can do it now.
*  You do that. And if if I play that game, I'm done
*  because I can never catch up to other people.
*  Well, a lot of it's like learned behavior patterns.
*  You just have you get stuck in.
*  And if you're unlucky, you can get a bad behavior pattern
*  or constantly quitting things. Right.
*  But if you're lucky, you could look.
*  I got very lucky that when I was 15, I got obsessed with martial arts. Right.
*  Because that was the first thing I ever did in my life
*  where I didn't think I was a loser anymore.
*  I was like, I realized that if you work really hard at something
*  and you're completely obsessed with something, it could transform your life.
*  So my my life from the time I was 15 to the time I was 18,
*  I was a different human from 14, 15.
*  I was insecure. I get bad social anxiety.
*  We moved around a lot.
*  I get picked on a lot.
*  And I went from that to being completely confident
*  and being just a different human being.
*  I was fighting all the time.
*  It wasn't like to me, the the fear of like conflict was pretty much gone
*  because I was just engaging in conflict all over the country.
*  I was flying around my whole high school all my time.
*  So I got in my head that the way to feel better and to get life to improve
*  is to just fucking dig in and keep going.
*  And don't ever quit. Don't fucking quit.
*  That's so great.
*  But I got lucky that that's something that I fell into when I was 15.
*  I often think about, you know, there was one day, dude, one day
*  when I was coming home from a baseball game where I walked up the stairs
*  we're getting ready to ride the T, which is like the Boston subway.
*  And we're getting ready to ride the T.
*  But the line after the baseball game was like really long.
*  There's so many people that were on the T.
*  So we just for a goof walked up the stairs to see this Taekwondo school.
*  And as we were walking up the stairs, this guy, John Lee,
*  who was a national champion at the time, is preparing for the World Cup.
*  And he was like 28 years old.
*  He was in his prime and he was kicking this bag.
*  And as I was going up the stairs, I was hearing a whoop
*  and then the sound of a chain like shushing, whoop shushing.
*  And I went up and watched this guy kick the bag and I was like,
*  it's like what the fuck is that?
*  Yeah, he's kicking the pole. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And I was I was just I was like, I want to learn how to do that. Right.
*  And I was there the next day. I signed up.
*  I had enough money to pay for the class.
*  I signed up and I was there every day.
*  From then on, I was there every day.
*  I mean, every day I worked out every day of the week.
*  I worked out Sunday. I worked out every day.
*  I never took time off. I was there for hours every day.
*  I just eat food, go there and be starving by the time I left
*  and then head home and go back again.
*  That's your blessed brother, because you have something that
*  most people don't have that they don't have that.
*  Like you have everybody who has the intensity in the beginning,
*  you know, when they see something like, I want to do this, I want to say, I do.
*  Like every I get all pumped up.
*  I'm like, this is it. This is all I want to do.
*  And then it's like you don't want to suffer.
*  You don't want to put the, you know, the work.
*  That's the difference between we we both love Jiu Jitsu.
*  Well, to love something, you got to you.
*  You got to know it. You have to know it.
*  Right. You can't love something you don't know.
*  Well, I love it. But you know what I don't love?
*  Obviously, I don't love the mornings getting the cold gi on.
*  You know, there's things about getting in with, you know,
*  I'm saying getting on the mats, they're sweaty.
*  They've been there since like five o'clock in the morning.
*  I got to travel to do it.
*  It's going to hurt. These guys are coming after me.
*  You know, it's like, you know, you're in there and it's I'm nervous.
*  And so I start like I get back into it.
*  You know, I'll let it go for a while. You do.
*  You go through that and you become, you know, you overcome those little things.
*  And it's like, that's how you grow.
*  It's like I get right up to the edge of it.
*  And then I'm like, I just so I don't love it as much as it's like.
*  You have to you have to you commit.
*  You have to suffer. You have to.
*  You know, that's the only way you're going to show your love for anything is you.
*  You got to suffer for it.
*  There's got to be that you've overcome that.
*  Otherwise, you don't you.
*  You died. You know, you have to be.
*  Everybody has two people inside of them.
*  Everybody has the person inside of them that wants to go to sleep.
*  Right. The person inside of them that wants to quit.
*  That guy's winning, by the way.
*  That's the guy who's you see before you right now.
*  And the other guy that's like, no, this is what you need to do.
*  The problem is with a lot of people, that other guy that's like, no,
*  that's what you need to do. That person's really timid.
*  And that person, they just well, maybe it'd be better if we just went for a run.
*  I shut the fuck up. I'm going to eat chips. Right.
*  And that that timid version of you is what you need to cultivate
*  and to be like the boss. Right. That's the boss.
*  So I have a boss. My boss is that voice.
*  I let that voice win every time. I love it.
*  That voice says, shut the fuck up and get in the cold water.
*  That's dying to yourself, man.
*  That's literally saying, I'm not going to go where I'm comfortable.
*  I'm going to I'd much rather do this.
*  I'm sure you'd much rather do something than jump in a cold plunge every
*  get a cup of coffee and go hang out and talk.
*  You know, you do that.
*  And that's something I need to do more and more like we all do.
*  It's like that's the only way you're going to embrace it.
*  And get better at things.
*  I'm trying literally with flying like I said, I drive everywhere these gigs.
*  And it was getting so much that I'm like, I'm afraid of flying.
*  But I'm like, I kind of just die to myself.
*  Just do this. Have faith. You're going to be fine.
*  Just do it. And each time you do it, you're like, all right, we did it.
*  Yeah. And you have a bad fight.
*  You're like, I'm not going to do it again.
*  You know, but it's like, you know, it's you just got to give the boss some strength.
*  Yes. Yeah. And the boss, the boss has to win a bunch of battles.
*  And when the boss wins a bunch of battles and he wins them every day,
*  then eventually the boss becomes a louder voice.
*  And then you get to get it to the point where the boss gets to tell you
*  what to do and you don't deviate.
*  And even though you have all those feelings, every time I lift the lid
*  on the cold plunge, I'm like, let's not do this every time.
*  But the boss is like, shut the fuck up.
*  The boss gets mad if those voices pop up.
*  So I'll make you do an extra minute, bitch. Right.
*  Get the fuck in there. I love it.
*  And, you know, there's two pieces of advice I always give comics
*  or just young men in general.
*  Aspire to be the person you pretend to be when you're trying to get laid.
*  Yes. Just be that person.
*  Instead of pretending to be that person, become that person. Right.
*  Become a person that you would admire.
*  You can do it's possible to do if you can pretend to be that person.
*  You can actually be that person. Right. Aspire to be that person.
*  And then the second one is live your life like a documentary crew
*  is following you around.
*  Live your life like is if you wanted the whole world to go, wow,
*  that guy's really killing it.
*  Like, I love the way that guy handles things.
*  And then you're not going to you're going to fail.
*  You're going to fuck up. You're going to be you're a human.
*  Everyone's going to fall into like, oh, what a loser I am. Right.
*  Just go back with the same ethic.
*  Get back into it with the same mindset.
*  Live your life like a documentary crew is following you around everywhere.
*  How would you want to be seen?
*  Well, be that person.
*  Actually be that person.
*  Become that person. You can become that person.
*  That's fine. We're doing that now.
*  And it's like we started in January and I've I've
*  I think I might have went up four pounds.
*  I don't even know.
*  Like, it's like, you know, because I've go down and then it's like,
*  but you're right. You're right.
*  And we want to I'm going to show it all, you know, because that's what it is.
*  It's the struggle. It's the process.
*  Dude, you just need a hype man.
*  If we're neighbors. Oh, but by the way, I love Austin.
*  I'm coming here. I want I would be here every day.
*  Fucking move here. Move here.
*  The club's always very available.
*  You'll have fun. Great place to work out.
*  Come here to my gym. You can work out together.
*  I mean, we got a beautiful gym here.
*  I think I'm just going to rip my kids out of school.
*  We're going. Let's just do it.
*  It's great here, man. It is really great here.
*  The people are so friendly.
*  You got the way they treat like freedom here is like a religion.
*  Freedom is a different thing in Texas.
*  They they are not interested in controlling your, you know,
*  what you buy and where you go and what you do in your land.
*  You can own a zebra.
*  They don't give a fuck.
*  There's more wild tigers or there's more tigers, actual tigers in captivity,
*  in private collections in Texas
*  than there are of all of the wild of the world.
*  That's insane.
*  Well, you just showed me I need people, I need zebras and tigers.
*  I drove by a place the other day that had giraffes.
*  People have giraffes.
*  It's you can have whatever the fuck you want.
*  If it's your land, they just leave you alone.
*  This is your land. You do whatever you want. You know, and they love and and
*  the the comedy here, they love it's booming.
*  It's fun. I got my beard trimmed at a place just yesterday
*  and they were talking about the mothership like they go and it's great.
*  This the it's a whole different vibe here and everybody's great.
*  And I'm like, really? And he was like, oh, yeah.
*  Well, this is the first time in our lives where a scene emerged.
*  There was kind of a little bit of a scene here in Austin.
*  There was a few clubs, a few comics, some good comics came out of Austin, for sure.
*  But there was no real scene where a bunch of assassins lived in town.
*  And now there's like Shane Gillis lives here.
*  Duncan Trussell lives here.
*  Tom Segura lives here.
*  Christina Pazitzky lives here.
*  Tony Hinchcliffe lives here. David Lucas lives here.
*  It's like, holy shit.
*  Brian Simpson lives here. Tim Dillon lives here.
*  He's got a house. He's got multiple houses. He lives everywhere.
*  But there's so many killers here.
*  It's just every night you go to that club and it's just packed with great comedy.
*  You know what it is? I'm telling you, it's community.
*  I don't have that.
*  Like, like when I'm I have it in, you know,
*  little bursts when I'm with people on a movie set or whatever it is.
*  But it's like I don't have that in my everyday life.
*  I need that. I think I really think that's a big thing.
*  I really because I need the hype man I need.
*  But I need, you know, to be in that group where you just start doing it.
*  I did one one training camp.
*  With Wyman and those guys, you know, earlier on and with Aljoe and these guys.
*  And, you know, I just jumped in with them.
*  And it's like I was with them for a few weeks, three weeks, you know.
*  And then I had to go out.
*  But it was like you develop this brotherhood.
*  Yes, it was so much fun.
*  It was, you know, going through everything, you eat together,
*  you're running sprints together.
*  And I was like, whoa, this is really, really cool.
*  That's one of the great things about fight teams, especially like Sarah Longo.
*  It's like those guys are so tight.
*  They're all friends. Always such a tight group.
*  And they got so many killers there.
*  Oh, my gosh. Aljoe, Marab, Marab.
*  This is the funniest thing ever.
*  I came my first day on the camp, whatever.
*  And they were sparring in the octagon and I had my head gear on.
*  And everybody's pairing off with everybody, you know, just in Wyman.
*  You know, and Longo setting it up.
*  Just you guys go with you guys, everybody and switching around this net.
*  And I was like, word, Chris, I don't want to go in with, you know,
*  he's getting that getting this mix it up.
*  And I'm going, I'm not even a fighter.
*  I can't do this. You know, whatever I got in there.
*  Everybody else, Aljoe knows me, you know, you know, these guys know me.
*  Marab thinks I'm a fat old fighter like he thinks he doesn't know.
*  I get the head gear on. He doesn't recognize me as an actor.
*  And he starts going, he starts dancing around.
*  I'm going, whoa, I know right away he doesn't.
*  He doesn't know I'm not, you know, I'm an outside guy.
*  He thinks I'm a guy in the camp.
*  And he just starts going crazy.
*  And I go, oh, my God. And I'm
*  punches. And this guy's moving around like crazy on me.
*  And I'm looking for why.
*  And it was it was amazing.
*  He was the sweetest guy ever.
*  But I got lit up by him in two.
*  So I go, I take it off. I go, I'm an actor, man.
*  That guy does not get tired.
*  Nothing. He's wild to watch.
*  Do you see him with Henry Cejudo?
*  He's got Henry Cejudo picked up over his shoulders and he's talking.
*  And he walks him over towards Mark Zuckerberg.
*  He's Henry Cejudo.
*  That's an Olympic gold medalist.
*  And you're carrying him around like he's a kid on a schoolyard fucked up.
*  It's a different breed.
*  Oh, man. He's an animal.
*  Merab is an animal.
*  And the sweetest guy once, you know.
*  The best. Yeah, he was really good.
*  I love that dude.
*  And everybody loves him.
*  Like the response he gets from the audience.
*  Yeah. People love him.
*  His last speech was so ridiculous.
*  Oh, my God. He wins.
*  He just gets so fired up.
*  He's amazing.
*  Then they fucking love Merab, man.
*  They love. Look at that.
*  Look at him. That's Henry Cejudo.
*  That is crazy.
*  You have to understand how crazy it is that he's carrying around that guy on his back.
*  Like that guy with a smile.
*  Yeah. I mean, two division UFC champion.
*  He won the flyweight medal or the flyweight belt and he won the bantamweight belt.
*  And Merab is literally toying with him.
*  He's smiling and carrying him.
*  I mean, that's that is so wild to see.
*  That was one of the most shocking things.
*  I mean, I've seen a lot of shocking things.
*  People getting knocked out.
*  I've seen a lot of things, but to see someone treat Henry Cejudo like that,
*  carrying around like that, laughing with a smile on his face was like, oh,
*  now I can say I sparred with that guy.
*  There you go.
*  But yeah, that camaraderie, we needed as comics.
*  Like, that's why we opened up the club.
*  We opened up the club because we realized that one of the functions
*  that the Comedy Store had for all of us, it was home base.
*  Yeah, we had a home base and it was a great old club with this amazing history.
*  And we were proud to be a part of it.
*  And so we'd all get together and we were proud.
*  We were Comedy Store Comics. It was fun.
*  You go out on the road and you come back home and you see family.
*  Yeah. And some of the best shows that we would have all year would be like
*  Tuesday night, Wednesday night shows at the store.
*  We'd go there and it was just so fun.
*  And everybody's just so happy to be around each other.
*  Other comedians just have fun and talk about jokes and talk about stand up.
*  And then when we came out here, I was like, well, there's no home base.
*  There's no home base. We did the Vulcan, but it's not set up good for a green room.
*  I was like, we need a real home base.
*  And then I started looking.
*  I started looking right away.
*  And the first place I bought was a cult theater.
*  It was owned by a cult that fell apart.
*  And then we got this opportunity to get that place on Sixth Street.
*  And I was like, all right, this is it.
*  And then we just started building.
*  And it's better than I ever could have hoped.
*  It's a real community now.
*  Like you go into that green room and there's like fucking 20 dudes in there
*  just talking, laughing, having fun.
*  I miss Sodor's there and Lewis is there.
*  It's like people from the road, guys from New York, guys from L.A.
*  People are coming in out of town every week.
*  It's fun. I miss that man, because I don't have I have it when
*  Sandler goes on tour and he'll bring me out and I go with him.
*  And it's just so much fun.
*  It's so much fun, man.
*  It's you know, that's what we're missing.
*  You know, if you're the guy who just does the theaters
*  and, you know, you're with your family all week
*  and then you have your opening act, you go on the road.
*  It's not the same experience.
*  It's not. I've been that for years.
*  That's the guy. Yeah. You know, I miss it, man.
*  I really do come to Texas, Jimmy.
*  I know. Come on, buddy. I got you.
*  You got to once I take this good place to live.
*  The alpha brain, man, it's going to change everything.
*  I want to take those white men pills.
*  But do we find out what the fuck they are?
*  I'm going to bring them into. I have some just try them and be.
*  You're going to be honest. I'm going to try them right away.
*  I can't wait to try them in my mind.
*  I've already tried it.
*  They had me rest from D.C. That's ridiculous.
*  Wrestling D.C. or playing golf. That was the fun.
*  I go in the pummel, him just messing around
*  while he's holding the golf club.
*  And you just feel you like, oh, my God, bear. Oh, my gosh.
*  Yeah. DC's bear.
*  Two division champion, man.
*  You get you almost like you're playing with him,
*  but you get scared.
*  It was like I was with with boss when you you introduce me.
*  You got me the boss.
*  When I met boss, I remember I first had it was just the king and queen started.
*  And I was like, we could have this guy come and train us.
*  This guy that we used to watch.
*  You know, yeah.
*  What was it on?
*  Pancrase. Pancrase. Yeah.
*  And he had the high boots and stuff like that. Yeah.
*  And then I was like, whoa, man, we can get this guy to the, you know,
*  to our dressing room and we could work out with him.
*  I had a little space on the set where, you know, we would train.
*  And I brought him in that first day and he couldn't even speak English.
*  It was me and Rock, you know, and I think my brother was there.
*  And they were talking to him and trying to keep the conversation going.
*  You know, like that.
*  He's just sitting here like he doesn't even know what's going on, really.
*  Just looking at me.
*  And then those guys left the room.
*  And I felt like I was in the room with like a leopard, you know, like where you go,
*  where your feet, as long as you're feeding a conversation, it's OK.
*  Keeps eating it. Yeah.
*  Looks at you again.
*  He was just looking at me and I ran out of conversation.
*  I ran out of conversation.
*  I'm like, all right. So
*  and he's just looking at me.
*  And I'm like, this is a different human in front of me, you know,
*  especially back then.
*  Oh, gosh. Things could go bad.
*  Boss was a scary dude.
*  It's fighting days.
*  He was the first guy that the UFC hired
*  that I got excited about, right, because he was a guy that I knew who he was
*  because I had seen him fight in pancreas.
*  And he was one of the very first high level strikers that made it into MMA.
*  That Dutch kicks, kickboxing style.
*  With this here. Oh, yeah.
*  In pancreas, they'd have to hit with the palms.
*  And Boss figured out that instead of bitch slapping people,
*  you just spear them with your palm like a punch. Spear him.
*  And he would say he would hit this part of the wrist.
*  Yeah. Say as opposed to even the palm.
*  He did the bone. His bone.
*  And he was wearing the bag.
*  Yeah. He worked the bag with his palms to develop that power.
*  And he had this crazy ability to pull his hand back.
*  Like his hand, like my hand doesn't really go much back further than that.
*  But Boss's hand goes way back like this.
*  He's got freaky long fingers. Crazy hands.
*  He's a weird. He's a real freak.
*  Every injury I have to this day from turf toe and it came from him.
*  You know, because when I he's the greatest guy in the world, by the way,
*  once we got to know each other and he's awesome.
*  He's one of my best friends.
*  And he's he's we threw mats in my garage in Encino.
*  And I remember and he would come over and train me.
*  And, you know, we would start on our knees and stuff like that.
*  And I remember one time
*  we would just start on our knees and we were locked up.
*  And I remember I outmuscled him and I pulled him to the side.
*  And then two seconds later, he reversed me and I was like, whoa.
*  But I got him right there. It was pretty sick.
*  I, you know, and the next go we had it.
*  He pushed because, you know, like he he rolled me back and I heard a pop.
*  And I thought it was my knee, but it was my toe, my big toe.
*  Oh, no. For still here. Still. Really? Yeah.
*  Yeah. Never get rid of it.
*  So these pills help. These pills help.
*  That's everything I'm telling you.
*  Pills should be the back of a wagon, dude.
*  I'm this is for everything.
*  I got to find a way to.
*  Diarrhea, gonorrhea.
*  I just want to make sure.
*  Because you nobody's you're going to be like, dude, they do nothing.
*  I love that. I bet they do something.
*  I guarantee if you're having that kind of experience with them, they do something.
*  I wish I knew what they were.
*  It's the audience.
*  Well, I'll find it out for you.
*  I don't want to do it now when we don't have it.
*  Why don't you go grab them?
*  Go grab them and bring them in here.
*  I want to know what they are.
*  Otherwise, we'll be in.
*  How are you going to know? You look at it and know what they are? Yeah.
*  Well, is it just the pill by themselves?
*  It's a pill by themselves.
*  Oh, no bottle.
*  No, no, no.
*  Sketch. No, no, no.
*  It's not sketchy.
*  It's not sketchy.
*  I promise you it's not sketchy.
*  No, no, no, because it was a I'm telling you, we will figure it out.
*  OK, just you.
*  You're going to love this stuff.
*  Yeah. And then.
*  No, I think you will.
*  You and I will sit down with this stuff with why, man.
*  And we'll we're going to I'm telling you, we're going to save the world with this stuff.
*  It's if an old man is telling you this, I am, you know, yeah, I'm telling you,
*  it's the one thing it's like we're both old now.
*  And then while remember your kids never thought you're going to be an old man.
*  Never. How am I going to be an old man?
*  How is that possible? I'm a young guy.
*  I'm always a young still young guy.
*  Yeah, that's exactly it.
*  Also, you never got beaten down by life, right?
*  Because you have a great job. Right.
*  If you if you have a job that sucks, you can get beaten down by life.
*  Oh, yeah. If you have a job like we have, we enjoy our job.
*  It's like a thing.
*  It is what we do for work, but it's also what we enjoy. Right.
*  And it is work, but it's fun.
*  It's great. There's nothing.
*  You know, the stress is the stress and work is different.
*  Yeah. But they say you're only as happy as your least happy kid. Right.
*  I mean, that's all that's true.
*  So it's like when you got that going on, it always bounces that out.
*  We like, man, the greatest life here ever.
*  And then it's like, oh, my gosh, I got to deal with this.
*  Yeah. And, you know, it's not easy for kids.
*  No. Like especially today with social media and just the weirdness of the world.
*  And I mean, if you're a fucking kid today, you're a 15 year old kid
*  and you're in high school and you see what what the president is, you're like,
*  what? Right. That's the guy running the world.
*  Like, oh, what is happening?
*  Yeah. How crazy is this?
*  And then you've just gone through covid.
*  So everyone's confused. Like, what happened?
*  It's a very, why was that locked up for two years?
*  What happened?
*  And then here you are about to make it out there in the world.
*  And you're on social media all the time. Right.
*  It's a tough ride for kids today.
*  It is a very, very, very tough ride with new challenges
*  that we never had to experience.
*  Dude, my oldest daughter is on the spectrum.
*  And, you know, so we started seeing,
*  you know, this anxiety and this disconnection.
*  And it was she developed, you know, these ticks, you know,
*  I mean, like really bad where she started like hitting herself, you know,
*  like couldn't uncontrollable.
*  She's a big strong girl.
*  You know, she was about, I think, 16, 15 at the time.
*  And, you know, I remember, I mean, it was so scary for me
*  that I had to lay on her at night and hold her down.
*  And, you know, I'm pretty sure she was hitting so hard and she's apologizing.
*  She's like, I'm sorry. You know, like I'm like, what are you kidding?
*  It was just it broke my heart.
*  So we brought her to the hospital.
*  We went to the hospital to find out what we didn't even know what this was.
*  And, you know, we where it was coming from.
*  So they they got her to calm down and she was still ticking and stuff.
*  And I talked to the neurologist. Is that what it is?
*  I guess I don't know the doctor, you know, and I go, what is this?
*  What can we do? And and he said, he basically said,
*  she's developed these ticks. It's like, you know, this is something
*  you're just going to have to learn to deal with.
*  You know, you're going to have a child like this.
*  You have to prepare yourself that you and your wife are going to have to,
*  you know, deal with this for the rest of your life this way.
*  And I was like, there's got to be a different way.
*  He's like, there's no way of really we don't know.
*  You know, and I just I went, oh, man, it crushed me.
*  So it was like me and my wife were like, what do we do?
*  And my wife read this book.
*  She was just doing all this crazy research and she found this book,
*  Disconnected Kids, and it was by Dr. Robert Malillo.
*  So, you know, I got involved with him.
*  I called him and he literally took my daughter.
*  He goes, I know what this is. He was OK.
*  He says, I can work with her.
*  And we were just like we were lost. We didn't know what to do.
*  I mean, I mean, I mean, violent.
*  You know, it was like, who?
*  So we took it to this doctor and within two weeks, no drugs, anything.
*  Two weeks ticks were gone.
*  And he said they're going to still be there.
*  They're going to come up every once in a while.
*  But he fixed her, man.
*  And I'm like, whoa, it blew my mind, man.
*  It's like so I was like, I just want to give other parents hope.
*  And I knew another guy who had a daughter who's severely autistic.
*  And, you know, she was nonverbal and, you know, you know, violent, too.
*  And he said he he goes, I will.
*  And he worked with them.
*  And she's getting so much better.
*  And now and speaking.
*  And it's an amazing thing. This guy does.
*  He's great. What is he doing?
*  I don't know at all.
*  You know, he's he works with the brainwaves and again, not a doctor.
*  But there's no medication in there involved, which was very important
*  because that's what they were recommending the hospital.
*  I just put her on some medication. I'm like, turn her into a zombie.
*  Exactly. I can't do that.
*  And she's so much better.
*  And she still has the tics every once in a while, you know, but she's great.
*  She's connected. He gets her connected.
*  He does all these like brain things and he works with the you know,
*  and how it all ties into the the the motor, you know, whatever that is.
*  So fascinating. It's it is.
*  And he's another guy who's like, I really.
*  Is this it? I've been told via your assistant, this is what it is.
*  OK, no name for it. No name for it.
*  Yeah. What do you mean?
*  There's no name. What do you mean? There's no name.
*  OK, so it has ashwagandha, Shav, shot, shot of Ari, shot of Ari, shot of Ari,
*  Kavach seed, fun, fun, new Greek seed,
*  papali, Guaducchi, Shajalit.
*  Oh, Shalajit, Shalajit.
*  I've heard of that stuff before.
*  I've heard of Shalajit, Gokshura and Sunthi.
*  Oh, boy. Well, but that's a mouthful, isn't it?
*  I think this it's not that the ingredients are that unique.
*  I think it's the fact that the way they do it is, I don't know,
*  that he says he doesn't use anything that's been like he throws out
*  a majority of it, which is that's why it's hard to come by.
*  And it's like active ingredients for everything.
*  You know, they could sell you all this stuff.
*  But if you don't get it from the right place,
*  you know, it's it's just not going to do anything.
*  Whatever it is, I give it to you.
*  Really? OK, I'm interested.
*  I've never tried ashwagandha.
*  Here's something that has the same.
*  I'm not saying this is it.
*  This just has in the 650 herbal supplement,
*  so it's the same ingredients.
*  Healthy skeletal muscular response,
*  maintain healthy skeletal skeletal muscular system. OK.
*  Interesting. Give it a shot.
*  That's also that, Jamie.
*  That is the same ingredients.
*  I mean, I literally copied and pasted and Googled.
*  They're showing the same thing. Same dosage.
*  That looked like a bullshit.
*  It could be low.
*  Red. Try company.
*  That's right. Try it.
*  OK, I know nothing. I'm going to try.
*  Thank you. I'm excited.
*  I'm excited to try this. Give it to everybody.
*  I need this. Anybody who's like I just for me, I want it for me.
*  Yeah. And I know I'm not going to, you know, if it does,
*  if I sense to be like I'm like if it's not working, it's not.
*  Actually, here you go. What's up?
*  If it works for me, it has it. Yes. OK.
*  That might be it. It must be.
*  If it's on his website, that's it. Infa 650. OK.
*  But yeah, it's it was it works.
*  Herbs work. There's a lot of them that work. Yeah.
*  Some of them are really good.
*  It's that's what's interesting about pharmaceutical drugs
*  is the vast majority of them are sourced originally from plants,
*  a lot of them from the Amazon.
*  They've come up with a bunch of different pharmaceutical drugs
*  just based on compounds they found on the Amazon.
*  Yeah, I don't even know. Yeah.
*  I know nothing about this stuff.
*  So when you started doing this documentary, what was the purpose?
*  To find out the the process, because it's like I've I'm going to do a movie right now.
*  Like every time I'm I try to get in shape, it's always like I always have to get in shape.
*  It's almost like, you know, a fighter who fights and then gets so out of shape.
*  And it's like, well, that's it.
*  I mean, I shot a movie two years ago where I play an exorcist priest.
*  Like and I wanted it to be like it was really crazy, like a legit story.
*  So I wanted to be look a little different, be, you know,
*  right in the part and just have a different character.
*  So I got down to 230.
*  I really worked hard, you know, like that's low for me.
*  And I shot it and thought we were done with it.
*  And I got to pick up a couple of scenes.
*  I'm 280. No, dude, I'm going to have to look like either right in that
*  this priest got stung by a bee and just swelled up or I got to get in shape for it.
*  So I got to get I got to get back down to that again.
*  How much time do you have?
*  I have as much as I, you know, I will shoot it when I'm ready.
*  But it's like it's waiting there to do a couple scenes where it takes you for you.
*  I can lose it really quick. I can fast and lose it.
*  Seriously, I can lose it and I could I could lose it quick.
*  Like how many weeks for 50?
*  I could do it in a month.
*  What? That sounds so less than a month.
*  I could do it. Yeah. 50 pounds.
*  Um. That's amazing.
*  I can do it fast fasting, just not, you know, but that's even nothing.
*  I must feel like shit, though.
*  No, no, no. When I fast, I didn't, you know.
*  How many days do you fast in a row?
*  You know, you don't want to know how many days.
*  Forty one and a half.
*  What? Forty one and a half.
*  You went 41 days with no food, water.
*  And a little salt in the water, like electrolytes.
*  And I lost. Wow. Yeah.
*  See, when I lock on, I can do something.
*  Oh, I know that. But that's a crazy lock on.
*  Forty one days.
*  Well, that was I was fasting for it was mental.
*  It was like I felt so bad for my daughter.
*  I said, I'm going to do this for you is something that I could do, you know,
*  and apply it to.
*  And it was like so emotionally tied into me.
*  And I started fasting and I go, I didn't I didn't say I'm going to do 40 days.
*  I just said I'm going to do whatever I can.
*  I'm going to start fasting right now.
*  And I was praying for it like I was worried.
*  And I did like four or five days and I was getting through it.
*  But I was like, I was wanting to get off it then.
*  I was like, well, I got to start to eat because I'm really hungry.
*  And I went and I talked to my daughter.
*  I go, how are you feeling? She goes, I've been feeling good.
*  She goes, have you been fasting for me?
*  And I go, yeah.
*  And she goes, thank you so much.
*  And I literally went, OK, I got to keep going.
*  I couldn't stop then.
*  So I just kept going day at a day at a time, you know, just do it.
*  But it's amazing how your body, you don't need it.
*  You don't need as long as you have fat on you like that.
*  Yeah, like I lost, I think, like 60 pounds.
*  Wow. Yeah.
*  Yeah, there's that guy that was in the 1960s, right, Jamie?
*  That one dude, he fasted for three hundred.
*  Yeah. 60. He was really big, right?
*  Yeah. Yeah. You can do is just take IV vitamins.
*  Yeah. Water and vitamins.
*  I didn't even take vitamins.
*  Like you don't need anything, you know.
*  And I felt you took no vitamins, nothing.
*  Wow. But, you know, it was
*  it cleansed everything out of me.
*  Like, I'm not saying it's a way to go for everybody.
*  You know, like I don't I don't know.
*  Again, not as there's definitely some health benefits to fasting.
*  Yeah. Especially short term fasting.
*  Well, they but if you're big and you can do it, why not?
*  That's it. It's like, well, how are you going to survive?
*  Well, your body eats fat. That's it.
*  That's what it was doing. It was probably had good energy.
*  I was pretty good for, you know, a while.
*  And then you'd have these dips and, you know, you feel like, wow, I feel miserable.
*  I'm going to I'm off. I'm done.
*  And then you fight through it and you're like the next day you wake up, you're like,
*  I'm OK. And, you know, it's like, keep going.
*  Just keep going. Your body just says, all right, this is what we're dealing with.
*  We're eating fat.
*  I literally wrapped up the 41 and a half days at you're going to crack up.
*  I went to Pizzeria University, which is a university to learn how to make pizzas.
*  And I didn't even eat. I forgot I had booked it.
*  And I'm like, oh, my gosh.
*  And I go, I'm not going to kill it while I'm there.
*  It was a three day course where you get like a little diploma.
*  I wanted to know how to make the dough and everything like that.
*  And I went, oh, no, this falls within my diet.
*  And she wanted to make it patch 40 days.
*  And I went down there and I did the whole thing and I never ate a bite.
*  Yeah. So it was it was crazy.
*  But then you blow back up to this.
*  You know, it's like it's so it's like that's what the documentary is about.
*  The documentary is about the process and finding something where you can help
*  people with their health, with, you know, it is what you were talking about.
*  It's just get up and do something, walk, do it a little bit more each day is the key.
*  You know, it's like when you don't even notice it's happening and all of a sudden
*  you're this active and a big part of the keys.
*  I have another people to do it with.
*  That's one of the great things about like you were saying, training with wide
*  bin and those guys like you're you're in a group where everybody else is working hard to.
*  And it's contagious. Right.
*  It's you get caught up in the momentum and it's great.
*  And everybody comes out there feeling better.
*  And you all went through something together. Yes.
*  Yeah, that helps. It's very hard to do it by yourself.
*  It's very hard. It not only helps. It's like we need it.
*  I think we're we're built for that. We're made for that community.
*  You know, yep. 100 percent.
*  You know, 100 percent. You don't have it.
*  It's it's hard. Yeah, it's not a good life if you don't have it.
*  It's just not. You don't want to be by yourself. Right.
*  You know, like that's what you always hear about those like Howard Hughes type characters
*  that by themselves are scared of germs.
*  They're fucking hiding from everybody.
*  The world gets smaller and smaller and smaller.
*  Yeah. The bigger you get, the world gets smaller.
*  And it's not good. Not good for you. No.
*  Yeah. You could lose your marbles.
*  Come to Texas. I'm coming.
*  I think I'm coming. I think my wife's hearing this.
*  She's going to hear this for the first time.
*  But I think this is it. Yeah. It's a great place to live.
*  I look here in Florida and, you know, yeah, this is a great place to live.
*  It's fantastic. Again, I've never spent time here in Austin.
*  This was the first I was here for a few days writing and
*  I felt immediately at home.
*  Like the moment I moved here, I was like, this is where I was supposed to be.
*  Like it made sense. It made sense.
*  It's like, of course, I thought you'd never leave L.A. too.
*  I'm sorry. Yeah. That's so cool.
*  Well, I've been wanting to leave for a while.
*  You know, I tried Colorado. You moved out a little bit.
*  You moved out even from L.A.
*  further out in the state, right? In the hills.
*  Yeah, I was out in the hills. Yeah.
*  I was always trying to be.
*  Look, I when I bought my first house, I bought my first house out in the hills
*  on like four acres. Right.
*  Because I was like, I don't want to be around people.
*  Right. I want quiet.
*  I want animals.
*  I want I want to look out my window, see a hawk fly.
*  Right. That's what I want. Yeah.
*  That's what I like. You got that here. Yeah.
*  But that's what I like.
*  I don't like I don't want to be overwhelmed by people.
*  I don't think that's healthy for you.
*  And with me, L.A. just got sketchy during covid.
*  It just got the George Floyd riots.
*  I was like, this is sketchy.
*  I was watching a bunch of looting.
*  I saw these kids break into a clothes store.
*  I was like, God damn it.
*  This is sketchy. These cops can't do anything.
*  They're overwhelmed.
*  And then there's all this defund the police shit going on.
*  And everywhere I would go, I would go like you'd see tents.
*  And I was like, this is a society that's falling apart.
*  And if you don't get out now, you're going to get stuck in something unrecognizable.
*  This is not what you signed up for.
*  When I lived in L.A. in the 90s, L.A. was great.
*  It was great.
*  It's kind of a lot of traffic.
*  But other than that, it was cool.
*  Great place to live.
*  All these comedians and artists and fun.
*  Sunny out all the time.
*  Yay. We're in the right spot.
*  But after covid, after the George Floyd riots, I was like,
*  I'm getting the fuck out of here.
*  And then it's just the lockdowns and all the ridiculousness and hypocrisy
*  and just realizing you have to pay attention to how fucking stupid the mayor is.
*  I never paid attention to the mayor.
*  I didn't give a fuck who the mayor was.
*  And then when covid comes along, oh, that guy's a real problem.
*  Like these people can become a real problem.
*  They can tell you you have to close your family business.
*  You've had a business for 30 years.
*  This fucking dipshit who shouldn't be managing a fucking Taco Bell, right?
*  Is managing the entire city's economy.
*  Like, oh, my God.
*  And then they went after him, too, which is even great.
*  Like Black Lives Matter was protesting in front of his house like 30 days in a row.
*  Like, that's what you get, bitch.
*  That's what you get.
*  It just turns on itself.
*  Yeah. And then you you brought it here and you planted these seeds.
*  And look what's growing, man. It's just so amazing.
*  Luckily, a lot of other comics decided to move out here.
*  That was the big one. Ron White was the king.
*  He was always here. Ron White was here before covid.
*  He knew Ron White. I remember calling Ron White up.
*  I go, why are you living in Austin?
*  He goes, he goes, I'll still come to the comics store, but I fucking love it.
*  He goes, I love Texas. I love being here.
*  I love living in Austin. It's a good city.
*  And I was like, damn, it sounds like a good fucking city.
*  And so when the pandemic came around and we were looking for places to live,
*  we had some friends that were coming to look in Austin.
*  I was like, let's look in Austin.
*  And we came and we saw this house on the lake.
*  I was like, let's go.
*  My buddy, I have my buddy, Scott Voss.
*  He lived in New York, like most of us, like in the city.
*  And then he just abruptly moved to New Brunfels, you know, New Brunfels.
*  And he's always like a bow hunter and all this stuff.
*  And he loved that stuff.
*  Those were bosses.
*  Bosses? Yeah, they're great friends.
*  Yeah, Voss lives down here too now.
*  Yeah, I know, I know. I know the whole thing.
*  Yeah, he's they're amazing.
*  And he loves it.
*  I'm always like, how is it?
*  You know, like, are you, you know, missing New York?
*  And he's like, not a stitch.
*  You know, it's like you can always visit New York.
*  Yeah, I love New York. I love to go back and visit.
*  I love to visit and eat. Yeah.
*  Well, I'm on the island.
*  So it's like it's not in the craziness. Right.
*  But it's it's yeah, it's it's the island is a different state.
*  Yes, it really is. It's a different 100 percent.
*  It really is. Yeah.
*  It's a different state.
*  It's not New York City. No, no, no, no.
*  I'm on, you know, it's it's it's it's it's very right wing.
*  Yeah, it's different.
*  Yeah, it's most more families.
*  Mm hmm. Yeah, much more normal, which is what I need.
*  You know, you know, but here I used to love working on the island.
*  That was my favorite place to work.
*  Governors. Yes.
*  So I can't go. Do you remember?
*  Yes.
*  Is that miniola?
*  Is that miniola miniola? That's right.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Eastside was great.
*  That was a sad day with Eastside. Closed.
*  And then they opened another one, Richie, and it just got away from him.
*  And it was just not a great.
*  You know, he took on a massive like store,
*  like a massive warehouse and started rebuilding it and just got, you know,
*  in over his head with stuff and the, you know,
*  the boom was slowing down a little bit.
*  You know, it just got tough.
*  Yeah. Long Island has always been a good place for comedy.
*  Best. Always real good comics coming out of Long Island.
*  There's always like a Long Island attitude.
*  Like you get guys who come into the city from Long Island.
*  I was always afraid of that.
*  That was another move like, oh, my God, making that move to the city.
*  People like you're going to go to the city.
*  I'm like, I'm not going to the city yet. I'm not ready. I'm not ready.
*  I was so scared the first time I performed in the city.
*  I was so the seller. Where'd you go?
*  Boston, comedy? No, Catcher Rising Star. Yes. Me too.
*  Louis for him. Yes. Yes. I was so terrified.
*  I thought I was going to bomb. I was so nervous.
*  I've never been more nervous for a show in my life because all the greats
*  went through there. You know, I remember I watched a video that was online
*  of Richard Pryor.
*  I guess back then I must have watched a tape because this is we're talking about
*  like the early 90s.
*  It must have been a tape, but I watched a VHS tape of Richard Pryor
*  on stage at Catch and I was like, oh, my God,
*  I'm going to perform in the same place.
*  And I knew Richard Belzer had performed there.
*  I knew it was just a legendary club.
*  I couldn't believe I was there.
*  I couldn't believe I was allowed to be on the stage.
*  Me too, man. Yeah.
*  But when it went OK, it went good.
*  You know, I was like, OK.
*  And then the next show I did, the city, I was like, loose.
*  I was like, this is just a crowd. These are just people. That's it.
*  And then I just got loose.
*  But the the the allure of the city was always like, you can't trick them.
*  They're going to be the smart people.
*  Like you can trick all those losers that come to see you at a bar
*  in the middle of Massachusetts.
*  But if you're going to go to New York fucking city,
*  you better have your act together.
*  You know, and yet your act has to be tight.
*  Stand up, New York, the comic strip, comic strip.
*  Remember Eddie Murphy?
*  Yeah, that was a tough one. Oh, my gosh. Eddie was here.
*  Yeah. And you see that Chris Rock and these guys like, well, yeah.
*  Well, the the clubs in New York, there were so many of them.
*  Boston Comedy Club. Yeah.
*  Dangerfields, Dangerfields.
*  I played, I played in front of probably three people.
*  Right. One o'clock in the morning.
*  Yep. At Dangerfields. Yeah.
*  I was there once, Dangerfields, and my spot was at nine thirty.
*  And I got there at nine o'clock and everyone was by the bar.
*  I'm like, what's going on? Like, there's no crowd.
*  And while we were there, two people showed up.
*  And remember Bobby? Oh, he put the show on. Yeah.
*  Yeah. He goes, Bobby, welcome to Dangerfields.
*  And he just brought them in.
*  You started the show.
*  And then the show started. Yes.
*  And we all did stand up for two people.
*  I love it. They were like held hostage.
*  How could they leave? We're going to get out of here.
*  This sucks. Like what?
*  There's five more guys coming.
*  There was something about back then that I mean, I miss so much that
*  I guess it's the community again, but that whole drive to, you know,
*  the newness of being in these clubs, the comedy cellar, you know.
*  Also, we didn't know if we were going to make it. That's it.
*  You know, you back then, you were like, am I going to be a real professional
*  or is this just bullshit?
*  Should I think about getting a job job? Right.
*  You know, I quit my last job way early.
*  Yeah, I was working at a place called Granger in the in the warehouse,
*  just pulling orders.
*  It was like an industrial equipment company.
*  And I hated it. It was so hot.
*  And I'm like miserable.
*  And I'm doing like one like I'm doing an improv class and like
*  a couple of dates I have here and there.
*  And I was like, I think I'm going to turn into comedy.
*  I think I could make a living of this stuff.
*  And it's like pulled out way to it.
*  Living at home, my folks.
*  And it's like I might have pulled that a little early. But, you know.
*  But that's the way you do it. Yeah.
*  You'll find jobs and things to do to make money while you're struggling. Right.
*  But it's if you if you have a net, you'll fall. Right.
*  You're right. That's you got to do.
*  You have to be 100 percent all in because in the beginning,
*  like in the first days when you and I knew each other,
*  we were just like kind of opening acts. Right.
*  Which is like, you're not really making much money. Right.
*  Maybe you could headline some little scrub room in the middle of nowhere. Right.
*  Make a couple hundred bucks that night and drive to Connecticut.
*  You know, so it was precarious.
*  Like, who knows what's going to happen?
*  I could fall. But we all knew guys who fell apart.
*  It was guys who were like headliners, big comics, and they just fell apart.
*  They fell apart. They couldn't they couldn't handle it. Right.
*  For whatever reason. It's weird.
*  Fear of success or just like whatever it is, it just didn't know how to go
*  to the next level or.
*  I think for them, it's a lot of that they didn't have community.
*  I think back then, even more so than it's a problem now.
*  It was way more of a problem back then because everybody was in competition
*  with each other. Right.
*  Nobody looked at other people like other people that are just like me
*  that are out there doing great. And so that's awesome for everybody. Right.
*  Back then, like if you and I were friends
*  and there was a tonight show host spot available
*  and they were going to talk to you and they were going to talk to me,
*  we couldn't be friends. Right.
*  Then like the people would like turn on each other.
*  They would they would backstab each other, like the famous David Letterman
*  and Jay Leno things. Right.
*  But Leno's like hiding in the closet. Yeah. Listening to.
*  Yeah. It was like they were in competition with each other.
*  It was. Did you have a group of guys in Boston around you?
*  Like when you first started or no, was it just you?
*  Me and Fitzsimmons were always tight. Right.
*  And we started out literally a week apart from each other in open mics. Right.
*  And so and then Chris McGuire, I was always tight with Chris.
*  And there was a few guys from that era that I stayed friends with
*  that we did a lot of road gigs together and we were tight.
*  And that was real fun.
*  Mostly Fitzsimmons, because Fitzsimmons was he was a good buddy.
*  And we we did a lot of gigs together when we were starting out.
*  We drive to Rhode Island for free. Yeah.
*  And just do open mics.
*  I drove to Allen, Pennsylvania for, I mean, like 20 bucks or something.
*  I remember like I go, this cost me more in tolls. Yeah.
*  I was like, but I'm when? Yeah. But that's the only way to do it.
*  You know, you have to you have to put in those hours and that time.
*  And you have to be.
*  And if you're with someone else is also doing it, it makes it way easier.
*  So, yeah, it made it easier for sure to be friends with Fitzsimmons
*  because we were both doing the same thing at the same time. Yeah.
*  But there wasn't a group like we had in L.A.
*  and L.A. that was that was the different that was a different thing.
*  That was a real brother and sisterhood.
*  Like it was like everybody was like so tight and everyone was so supportive
*  because it coincided with the Internet.
*  When the Internet came along, then instead of everybody being competition
*  with each other for a sitcom or, you know, a TV show,
*  now everybody was on each other's podcasts. Right.
*  So now it was only beneficial. Yes.
*  It was like if I go to Schultz's podcast, that would make my Netflix special.
*  Get more people to watch. Right.
*  If I could go do this, it would do that.
*  If I could do all these different things, it would actually promote stuff
*  and it would make it bigger and better.
*  And then it was like everybody's podcast grew because they were on
*  other people's podcasts and no one suffered.
*  No one said there was no negative.
*  Like of all the people that I ever had on my podcast,
*  they went on to do podcasts and tour and do arenas.
*  It only helps. It only helps. It never hurts.
*  It only helps. It helps them. It helps me.
*  It helps the audience. It helps everybody.
*  Helping them is insane.
*  I mean, look at the careers you've built from this.
*  You know, I didn't.
*  I just exposed people to talented people that already existed.
*  And that benefits me. Absolutely.
*  100 percent. But it's like you're given this platform and it does.
*  It grows because then they're able to do it and bring up other people.
*  And, you know, and then other people are seeing that.
*  And they're applying that in their own lives.
*  Yeah, it definitely wasn't the case.
*  The back of the day, I felt like I had my brother, Gary and Rock and,
*  you know, Adam Ferrara and Richie Minerva.
*  Like we had this tight group that we would look out for each other.
*  Those guys, you know, we would try to do that.
*  But other than that, it was backstage.
*  It was like they were just trying to get in the way.
*  And don't tell this guy about this audition.
*  It's like, you know, I hated that.
*  I hated that.
*  Well, that's why I loved hanging out with you and Ferrara.
*  And, you know, it's like you could find good dudes
*  and you all hang together and all enjoy each other's success and and do shows
*  together, too. That was the most fun thing when you and I got to do shows together.
*  Wasn't that the best? It was the best.
*  Oh, I loved it so much. We had so many fun gigs.
*  It was such a good time.
*  And just to be on the sideline, because you're one of those guys that if
*  I'm laughing hard in the room, you go crazy.
*  Oh, you get me nuts.
*  You build me up. You are.
*  You are the hype man. You'd fire me up.
*  Well, I always knew you at your best.
*  Right. I always knew who you were.
*  Like if we were just at a bar and you just start going off about something
*  and we're crying, laughing. Yeah.
*  You had this ability to get fucking furious about something in the most
*  hilarious way. And I was like, you got to bring Shimi out.
*  I know. You got to bring Shimi out on that stage.
*  You were like one of the few guys.
*  I'm telling you and Sandler are guys that believe in me more than I believe in me.
*  You know what I'm saying? Really?
*  I mean, it's sometimes amazing.
*  You're special quality is to be comfortable around your friends.
*  And then that's where you show your full potential. Right.
*  And then it's up to your friends to say, you got to just carry that
*  with you on the stage, because that's you.
*  Like the bit that you do about pulling up to the curb and the lock
*  cancels out with a girl.
*  That is that's it.
*  That's a full Shimi bit. Yes.
*  That got me. You built it with me.
*  You were like, you got to go nuts.
*  And I was like more and more and adding and going, I literally jumped in the audience
*  during because you got me like that was when we were up at Montreal.
*  You like you got to go Shimi.
*  And I like went nuts. I literally jumped on some guy in the crowd.
*  I've never done that before ever.
*  I freak. This was like, you know, but that got me my deal.
*  That's literally being that nuts.
*  You know, yeah, it was awesome. It was awesome.
*  But that's that's you at your best.
*  But sometimes like that's, you know, sometimes we need a coach. Right.
*  He's one of those you need, you know, you need a hype man.
*  But my friends do that all the time.
*  But we do it for each other. They do it to me.
*  They'll say, like Tony, last night we were going over a bit.
*  He's like, I really think that when you're saying this, maybe say that first.
*  Right. I was like, damn, maybe you're right. Right.
*  And every now and then someone will see things with fresh eyes
*  and they got to pull your side and go, I think you should do it this way.
*  And you're like, oh, I like it. Let me try it.
*  And I'll try it the next show. And like, oh, my God, you're right.
*  That's it. You're that.
*  That's the it's a comfort level.
*  It's a comfort level when you're when you're comfortable with somebody.
*  And you, you know, you you get past that.
*  You just you open up and you try to and you know each other.
*  That's exactly what it was. Like I said,
*  we would go out and do these and that would be it.
*  You would give me these things and get me all hyped up.
*  And it changed who I was.
*  It changed what I again, that comedian that were the, you know,
*  standing up there in the middle with the mic standing like you were just that guy
*  to me, you were that guy that was just like you didn't care.
*  And I was like, I want to be that, you know.
*  I remember one time we were at one of the improvs, the brand improv
*  and one of those improvs.
*  And one of the fucking guys who's working the sound booth goes,
*  what did you do to him?
*  I go, that's him. That's him.
*  That's the real shimmy.
*  That's when he when it comes out, because you were just going nuts.
*  You're just going nuts.
*  You're like, I do. He goes so crazy when you're here.
*  Oh, that's that's him.
*  I need you in my life that way.
*  Like, I need you to do that with everything.
*  I'm telling you, that's what I miss when I'm on my.
*  Because again, my own captain, I go off the rails.
*  I'll start overthinking things.
*  And it's like, you know, you know, that happens with fighters, too.
*  I'm sure. Yeah.
*  Fighters decide that they're the boss and then they don't have a guy like
*  that happen with Tyson.
*  Like Tyson was with custom auto custom auto died.
*  And now he doesn't have a boss anymore.
*  He doesn't have the alpha.
*  He doesn't have this this this this this wise person
*  who's overseeing all of it going, no, no, no, no, not this.
*  This is why this is why you have to approach it this way.
*  Like, yeah, this is why.
*  Sometimes people need a coach.
*  You need you need you need someone around you who knows exactly what's going on.
*  I don't care if it's you. If you were like, I need it.
*  And like if I'm writing a movie or writing, doing whatever it is,
*  I need people to say, hey, you got to see it because you're in your own head.
*  Everything has that same flavor.
*  Like, I'm always like, we're writing the same type of movies in this.
*  That because I'm controlling everything.
*  And sometimes I got to relinquish that control and say,
*  let's say I'll say, you know, believe me, trust them.
*  Just go with it. You know?
*  And I struggle with that because I'm like, no, no, no, no.
*  You know, right. Right. And that's that's the key to it.
*  And I could see that in the fight game.
*  It must be like, you know, where I take over and I know better.
*  And I got to switch camps and do all this stuff.
*  Or especially if you're the champ. Right.
*  If you're beating everybody and you think like, I'm fucking everybody up
*  because I'm the best.
*  And then your manager is like looking at Clover Lang and Rocky. Right.
*  Like, no, this fucking guy is doing the real thing. Right.
*  You you're to watch out. You're in trouble.
*  You don't see this coming. Yeah.
*  You have to have that guy around you, otherwise you'll be delusional.
*  And you wind up like with a flashlight in your face.
*  That's right. That's right.
*  And, you know, they're wheeling you around a stretcher. That's
*  that's the thing with success.
*  Like, and also the part of success is to get successful.
*  You have to get really uncomfortable.
*  And once you get to a certain level of comfort, you're you're like,
*  I don't want to be uncomfortable anymore. Right.
*  I did all that in the but that's over. I'm done.
*  But the only way you keep getting better is to be uncomfortable.
*  That's it. That's the ice bath every morning.
*  That's literally going.
*  Why do you you don't have to do this?
*  And, you know, it's like, but why?
*  So you got to build up the boss in your head.
*  Like I made my own coach because I realize there's not going to be enough coaches
*  around me like I had coaches when I was doing martial arts.
*  I mean, there was a giant factor for me that I went to that.
*  J. Hun Kim, Taekwondo Institute, Boston, which was like one of the best,
*  best gyms in the country.
*  I just got just dumb luck happened to be there at the right time.
*  But once I realized what you're not going to have a coach everywhere, like
*  you got to be able to coach yourself.
*  Like I write out my training routines all myself.
*  I write them out.
*  So I know what I have to do and I just do it.
*  I found an old journal like when I was literally doing.
*  I did karate for four years.
*  It was when I got to like a brown belt, you know, when I was
*  in high school and stuff like that, or a little just as
*  I guess it was ending then maybe it was just going to college.
*  I was by a brown belt by then.
*  But I never felt that we had a guy named Al Wilson
*  in our school who was a boxer.
*  And I was learning all the karate stuff and I was really good and crazy.
*  You know, I was I had these, you know, the the moves and stuff like that.
*  And the katas down like crazy crank them out, like rip them,
*  you know, like really powerful.
*  And this guy was just different.
*  You know, it was boxing, you know, like I didn't have that.
*  So I never had that confidence even then, like in as a brown belt.
*  I was like, I need to know something like I got to learn.
*  Yeah. And it really, you know, boxing's an eye opener.
*  Oh, my gosh. And wrestling.
*  You know, it's like all these things.
*  That's what I'm saying. As far as that stuff, it's like
*  there's a two big eye openers, especially if you think that you know how to fight
*  because you know how to do karate and then you box with somebody.
*  Yeah. Oh, this is a totally different thing.
*  I got to learn this now.
*  Learn it like I learned everything else.
*  I remember when you took me to when we went to Beverly Hills Jiu Jitsu.
*  I remember my one of probably the first class.
*  A guy grabbed me and held me just against his chest
*  and my face was in his chest in his gi and I couldn't breathe.
*  I didn't know what to do.
*  So I reached up and I was like grabbing his throat, which you know,
*  but I was panicking.
*  And he was like, whoa, you know, whatever.
*  I was like, well, I didn't know.
*  I just played it off.
*  But I was gone. I was gone.
*  He was like I was going to tap from a chest.
*  Yeah, people do that in black belt.
*  I do it all the time. It's a smothered smother choke.
*  Yeah, I can't. I can't do that.
*  People smother tap people like big guys would get on top of people
*  and tuck them in between their pecs.
*  Oh, my God. Yeah, I'm out.
*  I feel like I'm drowning.
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
*  It's scary. It is scary.
*  But if you can learn defense of that, then you're always going to be safe.
*  That's the thing.
*  It's like if you can just figure out how to defend yourself
*  in those positions, just to stay alive.
*  And it's the worst feeling in the world to be trapped under someone for five
*  minutes where they're trying to kill you.
*  But if you can if you can develop enough confidence
*  that you're safe no matter what, that's when Hicks and Gracie always said, right.
*  He was I am always safe.
*  He was always defense.
*  My defense is perfect.
*  I am always safe.
*  So he never worried about being tapped because he was always putting himself
*  in these terrible positions.
*  He would have black belt start on his back with a fully locked in real naked choke.
*  That's who you have them start.
*  That's yeah. Then you're not afraid of anything.
*  You've been there before.
*  You got defense. Yes. Yeah. You got your defense.
*  I if I if I applied what I think about all day long to actually practicing it.
*  Yeah, I don't.
*  But I think about it all the time.
*  We got to build that coach up in your mind, dude.
*  You got to I would literally look up things and I go,
*  I would watch everything and be like, I saw Eddie Bravo once say
*  or I heard that he said, I won't even teach anybody until you can do the butterfly.
*  You can get it to the, you know, to your knees to the mat.
*  And he said he can't get a black belt.
*  Oh, is that what it was?
*  You can't get a black belt until you get your knees to the mat.
*  Oh, OK. I thought he was like, I thought he was.
*  Oh, I took it that way.
*  And I'm like, I started pushing, you know, but then I faded.
*  I got it. I don't. He gave up on that, by the way.
*  Oh, did it? Yeah, he gave up on that because he realized you could be a black belt
*  without putting your knees to the mat.
*  Yeah, because I can't move.
*  Like, you know, it's just Eddie has a very specific style
*  and it's super effective and it's very dangerous.
*  He's one of the most dangerous guys ever off his back.
*  And so he developed this style based on flexibility and movement.
*  And I could always do that because I was very lucky that I you've always done
*  flexible because I did talk when I was really young and I always stretched.
*  So I didn't have any problem adopting his techniques.
*  But a lot of people did just because of the dexterity issues.
*  I would I would think like because that was like the rubber guard
*  and stuff like that, right.
*  And it was like I was always a big guy.
*  So I didn't know whether in my head I would go,
*  I shouldn't train this way because it's not my style of fighting or whatever.
*  Or should I be a big guy that can do that?
*  And I would go back and forth, go out there.
*  And, you know, some trainers would be like,
*  you know, you shouldn't do this.
*  You know, don't waste your time doing that.
*  You'll never do that.
*  And I'm like, well, what if I'm nothing scarier than a heavyweight
*  that can move around and be like that?
*  You know, anyway, they can fight off his back is one of the most dangerous guys.
*  I can't. I got to.
*  That was always no Gara's like big thing. Right.
*  Because Minotauro back in the day when Minotauro was the pride champion,
*  no Gara was a lethal black belt off his back.
*  So these guys are so used to wrestling guys and taking them down.
*  But you get taken down. You're in no Gara's guard.
*  You're right. You're in trouble.
*  Fabricio Ver Doom, he tapped all the greats back.
*  Yeah. Fabricio Doom.
*  He tapped Fador from his back.
*  I mean, come on, man.
*  Fador from his back.
*  There was he was the first guy to beat Fador and everybody was like, holy shit.
*  And the way he did it with just pure jiu jitsu,
*  he got him an armbar triangle combination.
*  He's like, this is checkmate motherfucker.
*  Just slap that down like, boy, Fabricio Ver Doom had the most wicked of all guards.
*  He tapped all the greats.
*  He tapped Cain Velasquez. He tapped Minotauro.
*  He tapped Fador.
*  He tapped like some of the greatest of all time.
*  That guy tapped off his back.
*  That's crazy. That's what I have.
*  I literally I have to get back to it.
*  I really got to get back to it because
*  that fear of those positions that you just don't want to ever get in.
*  It's the suffocation. It's just that.
*  And even every time I start up again, I hate the warmups, the warmups.
*  I'm like dizzy, like, you know, I'm doing these like crab walks and stuff like that.
*  I'm like already out, like, you know.
*  But it's like I have a guy that
*  Weidman hooked me up with, you know, I was going to go to Sarah because Sarah's out there.
*  It's great to Jitsu.
*  But for some reason, Wyman goes, go to this guy.
*  He's he's he'll be great with you. His name is Derek Mangy.
*  He does monster Jiu Jitsu out, but it was like an hour away from me.
*  But he's the greatest guy and he comes to my house and he trains me and stuff.
*  And he's just a beast.
*  But it's like I've got to get past
*  literally out of my head and go to get in these positions.
*  But when I train with him, he's so big, like I get on his back or whatever it is.
*  And he just gets up. It's like an apartment building just coming up.
*  Like, I can't even hold, you know, I don't.
*  And it's so frustrating to me.
*  And he's flexible and big and he can move around.
*  And it's like, I this is where I don't finish.
*  I quit. I'm like, I get frustrated and I don't, you know.
*  Honestly, the thing about training with someone who's really good,
*  the problem is you're never going to get good enough to tap them
*  because they're always going to be ahead of you.
*  You really should train with people that are OK.
*  That's the best way to train.
*  The best way to get really good at jujitsu, I always said, and Eddie Bravo
*  used to always say this, is strangle blue belts.
*  Really? Find people that can resist a little bit, but they're not really on your level.
*  Right. Just drill on them. Right.
*  You drill on them. And that way, then when you get to brown belts
*  and you get the black belts, you're you're you're sharp
*  and you have all these reps of finishing the technique.
*  Reps. All these reps.
*  That's the other thing. Closing the technique.
*  Do you recommend just drilling, drilling, drilling?
*  100 percent. Drilling is almost more important than anything. Really?
*  Yeah, because it solidifies the move in your head.
*  When I got really good, the best I got at jujitsu,
*  when I went from blue belt to purple belt, was when I was training with Eddie.
*  And we were drilling all the time.
*  We were drilling multiple times a week. Right.
*  So we get together and we would for an hour and a half, we would just drill.
*  And it sucks. You don't want to. You want to roll.
*  Rolling is fun. Sparring is fun. Right. Right.
*  You know, it's like you're playing a video game. Right.
*  But if you can just force yourself to do the work
*  and do a lot of drilling, your technique will get really sharp.
*  All the best guys drill. They drill all the time.
*  They do. They do either live drills where you all start from a certain position
*  or they'll do drills where they'll go over a specific path.
*  Like Eddie was big on going over paths.
*  Like, I want you to do this.
*  You pass the guard. He goes to block.
*  You set this up and then you counter with that.
*  And then we would drill that very position over.
*  So then when that would come up in training,
*  when you would go to pass and someone would block
*  and then you would take their back, it's like, oh, it just it's all synced in.
*  Right. To your nervous system.
*  So when you're and that enables you to when you're in a position. Yeah.
*  To think two or three moves ahead and you're not going to get that
*  if you're training with some big black belt, you're not going to get that.
*  You're never going to get to the point where you could do that to him.
*  It's not he's great. It's not him.
*  No, it's not. It's me.
*  But it's getting because he'll he'll he brings guys.
*  He lets you do it. Yeah. It's not the same. Right.
*  You got to be able to do it to someone who's not letting you do it
*  and someone who you don't know.
*  You know, well, that's the key.
*  Once you start learning someone and you're kind of.
*  Yeah. You don't want to know them. Right.
*  You want you want to be able to like solve a human puzzle. Right.
*  Some person is pulling on your shit and he's kind of freaking out.
*  Not only that, it's the fear that I hate that I don't.
*  I love it. I hate going to a class where I don't know.
*  First of all, I hate the gay.
*  I hate everything. I suffocate in that thing.
*  That thing is hard. Go no.
*  I because then I feel like you're not learning the techniques.
*  And then you are. You are. You are.
*  Yeah, 100 percent.
*  At this, I have a black belt and I have a black belt. No, I can do both of them.
*  I've done both of them.
*  But I'm both of them at the same time.
*  But one of the things that I did from learning from Eddie was
*  because I was training so much, no, but I was also training.
*  I would go in and do the key, but I wouldn't use it.
*  I would let them use it on me.
*  But I was just concentrating on overhooks and underhooks.
*  And I was concentrating on all the same grips that I would use
*  so that I would never be deficient.
*  Because if you get used to grabbing collars and sleeves
*  and you get used to adjusting people with butterfly sweeps
*  and stuff like that based on grips, the problem with that is all those grips
*  go away when everyone's slippery and it's just bare chest.
*  So you have. So I was all about clinching and I was all about a tight game.
*  Right. It's all about learning what Eddie's moves were.
*  And Eddie's moves were all overhooks and underhooks.
*  It was all wrestling based.
*  And it was all because of Jean-Jacques Machado.
*  So our instructor, Jean-Jacques, his left hand, he only has a thumb.
*  Yeah, he trained me a couple of days in Encino.
*  He came to my house. He was such a great guy.
*  He really is.
*  It's when I look at these videos of, you know,
*  where they take the gi belt or whatever it is and underneath
*  and wrap it around this thing, it's like I always go.
*  It's not that it can't work or whatever,
*  but I always look for things that are applicable, like, you know,
*  I want to be able to, you know, and it's like that to me, I can't do that.
*  I can't, you know.
*  So but I always heard that for you to get better at no gi.
*  You want to train gi because it's like taking a bat
*  and, you know, swinging with the donut on it.
*  Yeah, that doesn't make any sense.
*  OK. No, no, you want to train.
*  It's like to get really good at racquetball.
*  You need to play tennis. It doesn't make any sense.
*  Well, I got four massive geese.
*  If you want to use them for something, you could throw them over your couch
*  or whatever you feel like doing, because I'm happy to get rid of them.
*  There's nothing wrong with the gi.
*  The gi is still great.
*  And what the gi does do is it forces you to be very technical
*  because you can't muscle out of things.
*  It's you can't just pull out of stuff because you're trapped.
*  So you have to learn how to use the proper defense
*  and also never let you get to get yourself into a position
*  where someone's completely cinched up on you like you.
*  Like if someone has like like there's certain chokes, like a clock choke.
*  Like if they reach into your collar and they grab a hold your collar like this
*  and then they get this arm wrapped around here, you're in a bad spot.
*  Right. Then I'm going to spin.
*  Oh, gosh. I'm going to go.
*  Oh, yeah. And it's like a tourniquet. Right.
*  And it's terrible. It's a tourniquet.
*  Oh, it's death. It's death.
*  It's such a horrible choke to get stuck in.
*  So you just got to in those situations, the gi can be like if you're in a street
*  fight with a guy who's got a winter jacket on, some guys got a leather jacket on
*  and he grabs you and you grab a hold of that collar and you pull to the side
*  and you fish that arm underneath his shoulder.
*  That's a dead man. Right.
*  Like, you know, he's dead. Yeah, he's a dead man.
*  Yeah. Like if you get a hold of someone's leather jacket
*  and then you get your arm under there. Right.
*  And you get this like this. You're like, oh, son, you got him.
*  You're going for a right. Right. Right. Right.
*  I love that. Yeah.
*  So this like a judo player who fighting someone with a winter jacket.
*  You're fucked. That guy's going to hit you with the world.
*  He's going to spike you on your fucking head on the concrete.
*  And you're not even going to be able to stop it.
*  You're not going to be able to do a goddamn thing.
*  So it's good to learn the key because most people wearing clothes.
*  Yeah, I'm just going to go out chairless for now on.
*  Like, just you could not even wear anything.
*  You'll choke someone with a with a hoodie. Right.
*  You get on top of someone with a hoodie and you get up in here and you fucking.
*  This is different level.
*  This is not what I'm literally I need to. Yeah.
*  I've got to start.
*  I really do. I got to I got to do something because it's like it's.
*  There's nothing wrong with the key. The key is great.
*  The key is great. I still love the key.
*  It also slows it down when you it does slow the game down for older guys, too.
*  That's the one thing that's where they keep saying,
*  you don't want to go no, because it's going to be.
*  But it's like it'll be a lot quicker.
*  But I don't mind. I like that.
*  You know, as long as it's a guy, it does slow the game down.
*  But also to me, I just feel suffocate.
*  Like everybody's always grabbing me and I'm like, I'm out.
*  I'm like tapping like crazy. I'm like, you know,
*  plus my grip strength. I ripped.
*  I first of all, tore this bicep when I was.
*  Did you get it repaired?
*  Or does it just like this one happened?
*  This one happened
*  about five, six years ago.
*  I was hired a personal trainer
*  and she came to my house like I didn't know.
*  She just she was like almost like the CrossFit person.
*  And she's like, we're going to work on strength.
*  And I never deadlifted or did anything.
*  And I started doing deadlifts.
*  And she was like, just I didn't even literally know how to do it.
*  She was like showing me.
*  And she was getting so excited.
*  She goes, that's pretty good weight.
*  Let's can we bump it up a little bit?
*  And it was like 135, 225, 275.
*  And then she goes, can we go a little bit more?
*  She put 315 on it.
*  And then I go and I got it.
*  And she was like, can we go 405?
*  Like whatever. She bumped up.
*  And I'm going and I'm starting to feel like a little tired.
*  And I go, I don't know.
*  I don't know if we should do this.
*  I don't know what this is getting me.
*  But she was so happy.
*  This is really good.
*  It was like a personal bet.
*  And I go, I've never done.
*  I did 405 and I felt a little something.
*  I got it. I just got it.
*  And she was like, this is amazing.
*  And then she said, can we go like 450?
*  And she put.
*  Yes. And I went pop
*  it right away.
*  I got it up for a little bit.
*  And I just went, I felt I go, oh, my gosh.
*  But it didn't it was such a bad it.
*  It didn't tear away from the bone.
*  It just it was like it was like chop meat.
*  And there was a it ripped a hole in the middle of it.
*  Oh, so it was weird.
*  It was like the guy looked at it and he goes,
*  we can't even do anything with it.
*  So it's like you just got to let it heal.
*  Does it still have a hole?
*  Like when you flex?
*  Well, you can't see this one as much.
*  You can see a little divot.
*  You see a little divot here.
*  But then just recently I did a movie with Joey Diaz.
*  I did that movie.
*  I did a movie with him.
*  And there was a lot of fighting in it.
*  And I'm fight training with the guys.
*  And we're rehearsing all the the choreography
*  and going through the moves.
*  And we did it like a lot.
*  And it was the end of the time.
*  He's like, do you want to run it one more time?
*  And I was like, all right.
*  He was just running slow just to get it because I was getting tired.
*  And I had to go in and double leg the guy or whatever it was.
*  And I wanted to double leg him.
*  And it was very slow.
*  And he moved to the side and he went this way and it stretched my arm.
*  And it went, think I go and they go, oh, it's looked awesome.
*  Awesome, guys. And I go, no, no, no, no.
*  I literally have a recorder.
*  I go, something's wrong.
*  I go, something's wrong.
*  And this one, this one's bad.
*  I it's it's nasty.
*  It's like it's it's the Matt Sarah one.
*  It rolled up on me.
*  And it was I got it checked out and they go, it's completely torn.
*  And, you know, the guy was doing PT on me.
*  You know, this guy, Amato, he's awesome.
*  Johnny, he's awesome guy to do PT.
*  And he was telling me, he's like, well, the good thing about it is
*  it's torn completely because it's not, you know, you're going to be able
*  to do everything with it.
*  And I had to go into the movie.
*  So they go, do you want to get it fixed?
*  You should get it fixed.
*  And he's you know, it was like one of those things where it's like,
*  you don't lose, you don't gain that much strength.
*  Believe it or not, the bicep doesn't do that much.
*  The bicep itself is kind of like a turning a key.
*  And it's like that's where it'll be affected a lot, which it's,
*  you know, that's actually not that bad.
*  Did you get it fixed or no? I didn't.
*  I couldn't because I had to go into the movie and shoot the movie.
*  Because if you do that, you get it fixed.
*  It's the rehab is like it's long, you know.
*  So I go, I can't do it.
*  So they said, I go, can I get it done after the movie?
*  And they go, you can't because it's a window of the muscle.
*  Like if you don't attach it right away, it's like it won't take. Yeah.
*  So I did it. I didn't do it.
*  And it's bad.
*  And it still hurts. It cramps every time.
*  Like, I don't feel like I can do anything.
*  I've lost so much strength on this thing now.
*  That's the wish you'd gotten the surgery.
*  I do. I do. Sucks.
*  I always wondered about Matt's arm.
*  He's strong as hell. Like, it doesn't affect him, though.
*  He says, you know, I think he says it's it's fine.
*  Why don't you guys get that one? That's a real common one.
*  It's a lot. It's common with a lot of times when people throw a punch.
*  Like the punch gets blocked.
*  The bicep will pop and curl up.
*  I've seen that a couple of times. Yeah. Yeah.
*  It's this is ugly and it's bad.
*  Remember, Kyle Parizian had that with your hamstring?
*  Yeah. Oh, my gosh. Did he?
*  Yeah. He had a hole in his hamstring.
*  His hamstring just ripped apart and it shriveled up.
*  And it always fucked with him like the rest of his career.
*  Oh, it's in your head.
*  Well, also, his one leg just was not as strong. Right.
*  So his one leg was like always compromised.
*  He should have had surgery on it, like right from the beginning.
*  Yeah. Yeah. But guys try to rehab stuff.
*  There's like that fine window, that small window between fixing something
*  and not being able to ever fix it.
*  Like T.J. Dillashaw went through that with his shoulders.
*  He tried to just rehab his shoulders and his shoulders wind up becoming chronic.
*  And now they ruined his career. Right.
*  Yeah. Any kind of injury to a joint, I always say, gets to get this surgery.
*  If you can. If if it's that bad, get the surgery.
*  But also, it depends on what it is.
*  Like if it's a bicep, yeah, get the surgery.
*  But there's certain things like
*  stem cells might be able to fix that better than surgery.
*  So it's like knowing where to go and who to talk to and what doctors
*  have actually gone through this before.
*  But you can't do that now.
*  Too late. What? With stems.
*  Oh, no. With this with the bicep.
*  No, once it's shriveled up, it's shriveled up.
*  Yeah. You have a very small window.
*  I think a bicep, the windows just a couple of weeks.
*  Yeah. Yes. Get it repaired like really quickly.
*  I should have done it because I really.
*  That sucks. It does.
*  That's a bummer.
*  It's, you know, slowing me down for sure.
*  I tore my MCL getting on stage once. What?
*  Yes, at Stubbs, it's Stubbs in Texas.
*  I was walking up the stage.
*  Stubbs is this outdoor amphitheater.
*  And as you're turning the corner, it's these concrete stairs,
*  but they're spaced differently.
*  And so I was like, check.
*  I was turning my recorder on on my phone and walking up the stairs,
*  being called up to the stage.
*  And I misstepped and twisted my foot and it popped my knee bad.
*  Or when I went on stage, my leg was shaking like I was nervous.
*  I didn't stop. I was in agony.
*  I was in agony. I just did my set. Oh, my God.
*  Yeah, I just power through it.
*  But I was like, my leg is shaking so bad.
*  It looks like I'm so nervous.
*  Everyone can see this. Oh, no. It was just pain.
*  I was I should have addressed it.
*  I should have said I just blew my knee out.
*  I should have said that.
*  So like the people know why my knee is shaking.
*  Yeah, because otherwise I was like, God, how do I stop my knee from shaking?
*  Like this guy's nervous.
*  Yeah, it shook for like the first fuck.
*  Ten minutes, at least. Did you sit down?
*  No, no. This year did my set.
*  Yeah, it was still went great.
*  The show still shows fun.
*  But then my knee was fucked up for a year after that.
*  I had to get a bunch of stem cells.
*  I got stem cells in it like three times before it finally got to the point
*  where it doesn't bother me. How is it now? It's great.
*  Yeah, now it's great. Now I can kick the bag. No problems. Wow.
*  Yeah, I did a lot of knee over toe stuff, too.
*  That that Ben Patrick. Yeah, that's stuff.
*  Yeah, that's great stuff.
*  That's it's a big game changer.
*  I've strengthened my legs quite a bit more since I did that,
*  since I had that injury.
*  The Nordic curls and, you know, the slant board squads,
*  I got that squads that sled to on the wheels, whatever it's called.
*  The Torque Sled. Yes, it's just I just I just push it light
*  and then just walk back with it slow, you know, and just keep going, digging in.
*  Yeah, I feel it my legs and it's great.
*  The walking back is huge.
*  That's such a crazy way to strengthen your legs, to pull a sled backwards.
*  Such a good way to strengthen your knees. Right.
*  Yeah, it just keeps everything strong and firm.
*  Yeah, it's like and as long as you stay flexible as well and you're strong,
*  like you have stability, you have range of motion, but you also have stability.
*  That's that's giant. That's key.
*  I got it. I'm doing this movie now where it's me and it's an action movie.
*  I'm going to literally leaving tonight to Vancouver to to to.
*  It's like a crazy action movie with and I wanted to get in shape for it.
*  And it didn't happen.
*  So I'm like, I don't know, with I'm next to this beast to Alan Richen.
*  Oh, that guy for the region is huge.
*  That guy's huge. Oh, my gosh.
*  I was like, I got a train to get, you know, ready.
*  I'm like, nothing happened.
*  And I'm like, oh, boy, we're going to die.
*  Is the perfect guy for that show because, you know, they did that movie with Tom Cruise.
*  And it was like the character was never that small. Right.
*  No, in the book, the character was this monster.
*  The character in the book was Alan Richman.
*  Yeah. Rich and he's a rich.
*  He's a rich son. Yeah. Really good.
*  Look at that. He's ridiculous.
*  He's amazing. He's a house.
*  That guy's a house. Great dude, too.
*  Yeah. He seems like a really nice, unbelievable.
*  I've seen him in interviews. He seems like a really nice guy.
*  Yeah. He's the perfect guy for that series. Yeah.
*  They just you know, Tom Cruise is the blockbuster boy.
*  So like, let's just do it with Tom Cruise.
*  But he's five.
*  Like, this is this guy's got to be a gorilla.
*  He's going to be a fucking linebacker.
*  He's a linebacker with a genius brain. Yeah.
*  Kill people. This guy's this guy's.
*  Yeah, he's perfect for it. He is.
*  But so you have to do an action movie with him. Yeah. Oh, no.
*  And just start fasting.
*  I just don't.
*  How much time do you have before the camera rolls?
*  I just suck it out.
*  I mean, it's it's crazy, man.
*  It's like fighting that age.
*  But it's like you're right. You look at you doing it, man.
*  It's like such a difference
*  how you are with what you do and what you've implemented.
*  You're you're we're a different species.
*  You and I'm telling you, I just stayed on it. Yeah.
*  I just never let off the gas. Yeah. That's the key. Yep.
*  But also being careful, like knowing like what's fucked up
*  and what's not knowing not to try to work through injuries,
*  but to heal them and making sure they don't happen anymore
*  by increasing range of motion and strengthening things
*  and just making sure your your whole system is strong. Right.
*  I do a lot of like non sexy exercises like Turkish get ups
*  and things like that. Right.
*  Strengthen the whole body windmills. Yeah.
*  Those are the things that I like.
*  No one likes to do them.
*  And those are the things I when I walk around the gym
*  and do a couple of it, it's like that's where I have to change my mindset
*  to go go into the places where it where does it hurt when you bend?
*  Where did you know the ankle strength foot?
*  You know, all this stuff to get, you know, comfortable in that.
*  And it's like, that's the stuff that's so important.
*  Turkish get ups. I hate that.
*  Everybody hates those. I don't like to do it.
*  I don't, you know, there's no like bench press is cool.
*  You know, you bang out ten reps like, yeah, we did it.
*  Turkish get ups. You never feel like you're done.
*  It's always no exactly.
*  Well, it's hard and everything's working.
*  Your legs are working, your core is working.
*  Do you do a specific sets and or do are you more like on your own?
*  Just do like, do you go, I just going to work this area
*  and I'm going to do as many as I just want to drill it.
*  Or do you have like a set? I have sets.
*  You do. Yeah. Yeah.
*  I'll do like, you know, I do my warm up.
*  My warm up after the cold plunge is always 100 push ups and 100 bodyweight squats.
*  So that's the warm up. So that gets you going.
*  That gets you warm after you've done the cold.
*  So now you're heated up again.
*  And then I do. Wait a second.
*  100 push ups and 100 bodyweight squats.
*  That that's more than my week.
*  Like, like I even this is your warm up.
*  That's the warm up every day.
*  Yeah, that's 15 minutes.
*  So 15 minutes it takes to do 100 push ups and 100 bodyweight squats.
*  I do those. And then I do swings.
*  So depending upon whether or not I'm feeling good or whether I need more warm up,
*  I either go with 50 or 70 pounds.
*  So if I go to 70 pounds, that means I'm ready to go.
*  And so I do three sets of 10 swings with each arm with 70 pounds.
*  And then I do clean press three sets of 10 with each arm clean press.
*  And then I do three sets of windmills with each arm.
*  And then I do three sets of renegade rows.
*  You know, renegade rows where you're like doing a push up on the kettlebell.
*  So you got the kettlebells to on the ground, same distance apart as your shoulders.
*  And you do a push up.
*  And then in the lock push up position, you do a row with one side.
*  Boom. And then a row with the other side.
*  Boom. Back down for a push up. Back up.
*  Row with one side. Boom.
*  So your core is totally engaged the entire time.
*  You're in a plank the entire time and the entire time you're either going down
*  to do a push up, you lock up and then you're stabilizing yourself
*  as you pull the one kettlebell up.
*  Core that's boom. Everything.
*  Yeah. Boom.
*  And you do that. You do that with 70 pounds, three sets of 10 on each side.
*  And you get worn the fuck out.
*  You know, so you're doing 20 reps every time I'm doing this.
*  I'm doing 10 reps with each hand.
*  So I'm doing that with 70 pounds.
*  And so I do three sets of those.
*  And then once I get done with that, then I usually either do the sled
*  or I'll do something else.
*  I'll do like rounds on the bag. I'll do like something else.
*  And is that is that time then all that stuff too?
*  Or is it no, you just know, I like to give myself time in between sets
*  because I want to be fully recovered before I get into the set again.
*  I don't believe in I follow this Russian principle, this
*  power, this strong first principle, which is you.
*  The most important thing is how much weight are you pushing in for how many reps?
*  And it doesn't matter if those reps come over five minutes
*  or they come over 20 minutes.
*  And it's probably better if they come over 20 minutes and over five minutes
*  because you have a lot of time.
*  I'll take five, maybe even 10 minutes in between sets.
*  So I'm fully ready to go.
*  And then when I'm doing the clean press with 70 pounds,
*  I'm doing 10 reps each side.
*  I'm no problem doing that.
*  I'm not fatigued.
*  I got fatigued.
*  It's it's difficult, but it's not where I'm like at the point of failure ever.
*  If my point of failure was 10 reps, I would do five. Right.
*  And then I would wait a long time.
*  And then I do another five. That makes sense.
*  Yeah. So I'm getting to never.
*  You're never getting to that point where you're pushing yourself
*  to the point where you're can hurt yourself or never.
*  Never, never.
*  That's all I do.
*  I don't lift anything heavier than 70 pounds.
*  You don't need to, right?
*  And you don't need to.
*  People think you do.
*  I mean, it's one thing.
*  Depends what you want to do.
*  Exactly. If you're a power athlete and you need to do cleans
*  and squats and deadlifts, that's great.
*  But I don't need to do that.
*  I just keep my body strong.
*  And then I do my endurance work.
*  My endurance work is either sled pulling or it's
*  Tabata's on the air bike or it's rounds on the back.
*  And then I get in the sauna.
*  And the sauna is that's that's see going there right when you're tired
*  and you just step in at one hundred ninety five degrees.
*  One hundred and ninety five.
*  Sitting there for 20 minutes.
*  What's your cold plunge at?
*  Thirty four degrees.
*  I would have a heart attack.
*  It's instantly I would be gone.
*  I have mine ready.
*  I have one. And it's 50.
*  It was 52 degrees.
*  It was 52, which was I was shaking, man.
*  But I would like I would I would just go in there.
*  I was in there for 15 minutes, though.
*  I would do that. You don't need to go that long.
*  You don't need to. But you can do that if it's 50.
*  Yeah. You can.
*  I mean, it's probably giving you the same result if you do 15 minutes
*  at 50 as you do in three minutes at thirty four.
*  That's probably giving you the same result or similar result.
*  The whole idea is that you freak your body out and produces cold
*  shock proteins. And how does that compare to the
*  the chamber one where you get the air?
*  Is it just like a does that get you?
*  You know, the one where you just and they're both they're both brutal.
*  They're both brutal. I think I've never done the cold water is a different animal, though.
*  It's it gets in your bones more. Right.
*  You feel colder.
*  Like when you get out of that, the the cryotherapy machine,
*  when you get out of there and then a couple of minutes, you're like, whoa,
*  you're OK. You get out of that cold water for a half an hour.
*  You're like, Jesus Christ.
*  But that was the way I would warm up.
*  I would just go right into the body weight squats and the push ups.
*  So that was my way of heating my body back up after the cold.
*  But don't your joints feel just frozen?
*  No, no, you're all right.
*  You're all right.
*  It's body weight, so it's not much weight.
*  So you're just kind of pushing.
*  You know, you could easily do 20 push ups.
*  You just do the 20 push ups.
*  Take a break. Do the 20 body weight squats. Take a break.
*  Heart rate drops back down.
*  Next set, 20 body weight squats, 20 push ups.
*  Next set. Do it. Do it five times.
*  You've got 100.
*  And then by that time, I'm warm.
*  And so then I'll do whatever the other workout is.
*  Maybe I'll jump rope.
*  It depends on what I'm doing that. Right.
*  But I always write it out.
*  You write it. Yeah, because if you write it out,
*  you don't give yourself any room for fuckery,
*  because you know this is what you have to do.
*  It's all written out.
*  Like that's the boss.
*  The boss gets in there and writes it all out before the ego steps in.
*  And they're like, let's go eat.
*  I'm hungry. Once it's there, it's like you get a better workout.
*  If you have some fruit first, let's go have some fruit.
*  You get a better workout if you eat.
*  Yeah. You know what?
*  I have a window between three and four.
*  Third, I've got a really good workout then.
*  And then right now, I just go watch TV.
*  That's me. Yeah, that's everybody.
*  But you just got to have that boss in your brain.
*  It has to be in control.
*  And once you get it subdued like that much, it becomes it's not that hard.
*  Right. The whole thing is momentum.
*  The whole thing is doing is everybody that has ever had a good day.
*  You have a good day where you really get you should do
*  you start feeling good about yourself.
*  And you go, the key is just carry that forward and keep going.
*  And don't let yourself fuck off.
*  And if you do give yourself a day off, recognize that just like an alcoholic
*  that starts drinking again, this could be a slippery slope.
*  So if you give yourself that day off, be real aware of what you're doing.
*  I'm like I self sabotage.
*  Like if I go, I'm such a I'll start Monday again or I'll start tomorrow.
*  That that hope of starting the next day.
*  I have it so much.
*  I remember like when I was training and Wyman said this to me, he goes,
*  when you, you know, you're training and you, you know, get a flat,
*  you know, you don't get out and fix the flat.
*  You get out and pop the other three tires like you literally do.
*  And I do. It's like once I go off, I go, ah, all right, I'm off.
*  I'll start, you know, Monday.
*  Yeah, I do. I crush it. Yeah, I do. Yeah.
*  Oh, man, I would love to eat with you.
*  You know that, you know, but I'm saying like, yeah, but you're right.
*  And you can eat and do it in the right way.
*  And I'm sure you enjoy food.
*  And it's just you got to the boss has to be fully in control before you get a day off.
*  Yes. And it is almost like sobriety in that way.
*  Like you just you have to get so much momentum
*  that you're fully confident that you could take a day off and just eat ice cream.
*  And there's nothing wrong with that if you do have a hold of it.
*  But even if that's that's got to be tempered, though, like you can't.
*  Like I notice I can't I can't do it day off where I'm just crushing myself.
*  It's like there's no coming back the day the next day.
*  You feel like shit. 100 percent. Yeah. You know.
*  But the thing is, you have gone on schedule and gotten in shape before.
*  Yes. You have done it.
*  So, you know, you can do it.
*  So it's maybe even more frustrating than someone who's never done it.
*  That's right. Because you have like dropped 60 pounds.
*  You have gotten in shape again.
*  And I remember when you were training mitts with Delegate,
*  I was watching you hit the pass like you fuck.
*  When you got in shape for Here Comes the Boom, you got in fucking shape.
*  And you were training hard.
*  And I was watching some of those sessions.
*  It's like, so I know you can get to that spot. Right.
*  It's just like maintaining. I know. That's the thing is.
*  And now as I go, it's like God takes a little thing away from me.
*  The bicep pull now.
*  It's like, you know, another new reason. It's a little. Yeah.
*  It's like, I got to fight it, man.
*  And like I said, I'm teetering, teetering between that.
*  You know, I got to go back. I got to go back.
*  And you're right, man. It's just got to decide.
*  And one of the best ways to decide is to write things down.
*  It's so easy to just keep a thought in your head
*  and you don't really give it the the what it deserves.
*  You got to write things down occasionally.
*  You have to really do. And I write down my workouts.
*  I have a whiteboard in my gym to just put it up there, write it up.
*  Just write it down before you do it and give yourself a realistic goal.
*  Don't don't be nutty. Right.
*  Well, the next day you're going to be a dead man.
*  Give yourself a realistic goal.
*  Dolce has he was going to go for a walk.
*  Just go for a walk for 40 minutes, you know, whatever.
*  And it really what happens is when I start walking, I'll start moving around.
*  I feel good. I go, you know, whatever.
*  And I start adding more, you know, and it's like, my goodness.
*  Then I start, you know, wanting to throw.
*  I'll get the egg weights and I'll just start throwing with those and just.
*  I love it. I really, you know, it's it's something that is really addictive
*  in a good way that like you can, you know, once you start doing it
*  and it's a little bit, it's the pressure of you don't have to do so much.
*  Just do this. Yep. And then.
*  Yeah. If your pressure is OK, now you have to lift weights for an hour
*  and then go to a 90 minute yoga class, right?
*  Right. Right. Right. Right. A marathon like fuck that. Right.
*  You know, it needs to be very realistic.
*  Like, you know, we're going to start off today.
*  You're going to do 20 push ups, 20 body weight squats, 10 cleans, 10 presses.
*  You know, a couple of chin ups and then you're done.
*  That's a wrap. That's a 20 minutes, 20 minutes and never be exhausted.
*  And then take the next day, you're going to do something different, but equally light.
*  And you do that for a couple of weeks.
*  And if you write it all out, it shouldn't take you more than even 20 minutes
*  to work out. And you can get through 20 minutes.
*  Just write it all out.
*  Make sure you follow it.
*  And, you know, one of the best things for me is I have a TV in the gym
*  and I'll put fights on.
*  So I'll be watching fights. That's right.
