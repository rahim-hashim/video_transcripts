# Joe Rogan Experience #2199 - Chris Harris
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [September 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Kx0S2Y6hJI)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Showing my day, Joe Rogan podcast my night, all day.
*  So before you play the chord, I have, I'll go most places and I'm here because I want
*  to tell people the truth about the last eight, I've had a pretty shit two years because Top
*  Gear ended in a way that most Americans won't know but my colleague nearly died in a crash.
*  And then they left us in limbo a bit. I've never told anyone anything about it.
*  Largely because my friend and colleague who was nearly killed in the accident called Andrew
*  Flintoff, who was a presenter on the show. Again, no Americans will know who he is, but he's a
*  massive sports hero in the UK. He plays that weird game called cricket. He was like our best cricket
*  player. Can we use this? Yeah, no, we can. I just want to give you a quick foretaste of it.
*  I'm here to, I'll say some things that people won't have heard before and they'll make them
*  gasp a bit. Because we're recording now? Yeah, that's fine. What's that?
*  Okay, that's fine. Are we on me? I'm gonna go into it all. Okay. But it might be that what seems
*  quite revelatory to me. Since we're rolling. Cheers. Ten years. Yeah, it's been a while.
*  And you know what? I don't ever listen to what I say or watch what I record. I don't watch my
*  own shows. Good for you. You probably don't either, do you? I don't, no. It's good for the soul. Once
*  it's done, it's buried. Exactly. But I think I came to see you about a month before I received
*  a phone call saying, do you want to do this television show called Top Gear? Yeah, it was
*  before Top Gear for sure. Yeah. And I think it was then. And I think at that point, I'd been
*  fielding a lot of questions about, well, why would you follow Jeremy Clarkson on Top Gear?
*  And I'd go on air, no one would do that. They'd be an idiot to do that. And then I looked at the
*  monthly payments I needed to live my life. And I got offered a bit of not much money, but some money.
*  I thought, I'll give it a go. But most importantly, I thought the 17 year old me,
*  if he saw me say no to this job, but punch me in the face, right? Because it's my dream job.
*  Right. And I know that Top Gear is a weird thing in the US because I think many US people are aware
*  of it that it exists, but they've never really seen it because it never was put on a big network
*  here. Yeah, but it became very popular on YouTube. It did. Yeah. I mean, it's a great, it was a great
*  show. Yeah. I mean, I whether my era of Top Gear will be considered great, I don't know. I had
*  lots of fun making it, but following in Jeremy's footsteps was on reflection of decision. I made
*  the wrong call. I shouldn't have done it. Really? Yeah. I had a great time. But you try following
*  him in the UK. Just because of how much he's loved and yeah. Yeah. I just, I didn't realize how
*  deep rooted it was. I still get hate mail now. I still get hate mail. Yeah. You could have had
*  the exact same show under a different name and people would have loved it. Yeah. Yeah. And I
*  think we made some good films and I love what I did, but even if we made a good film, it was
*  always shit because it wasn't Jeremy. I really enjoyed it though. I enjoyed you being on it.
*  You know, you're great. You're my favorite automotive journalist. Well, that's very kind of
*  you. And I've just seen what you've arrived in as well. And I thoroughly approve your taste in
*  motor vehicles. Am I allowed to say what it is or not? Yeah. Yeah. It's a Raptor R that John Hennessy
*  jumps up to a thousand horsepower. It's fucking ridiculous. I think, I think I'm often asked if
*  you lived in America, what car would you drive? And it would always be a Raptor comes under the
*  heading of always drink the local beer. You know, we go to a city, don't order a Heineken or a bud,
*  drink the local beer. Yeah. And the F 150 Raptor is your local beer. Yep. That's about as American
*  as it gets Dodge Rams and Ford F 150s. Yeah. Those are the most American thousand horsepower
*  in a truck. It's ridiculous. We never thought it'd be possible. No, zero to 60 in three seconds
*  for a giant pickup truck. It's awesome. And it sounds great too. Just has this beautiful rumble.
*  Do you think you'll be allowed to drive that in 10 years time? No state, maybe in this date. Yeah.
*  But if you leave, they'll like have people at the border waiting in the bushes to arrest you the
*  moment you cross over if you don't have an EV. And, you know, in California, they have a mandate in
*  2035. You know, after 2035, no internal combustion engine vehicles are allowed to be sold in the
*  state. Same in the UK, although they know that it was 2035. Then the last administration moved it
*  back to 2030. Good luck. So they're not even ready. They're not ready. The grid's not ready.
*  I'm so torn on this because everyone looks to me as the ultimate petrolhead and I'll sit there and
*  go, they're all shit. They're not all shit. They have a place. And the most sophisticated assessment
*  of this that I've come across was just a very normal person I was talking to one day in an
*  airport. He said, surely the solution is that you just use what's pertinent to the energy that's
*  easiest where you live. And I think it's the best way of explaining it. You know, if you live here,
*  you drill a hole in the ground. There's oil around here. Yeah. If you live in Iceland,
*  you drill a hole in the ground. There's loads of geothermal. So why wouldn't you have an EV there?
*  It's brilliant. It's everywhere. It's quite a small country. I don't need to travel large distances.
*  But Iceland's cold and the battery capacity, when it gets really cold, diminishes pretty rapidly.
*  But also if you live there and you've got loads of batteries and you have a cartridge system,
*  we can slot them in and out. It's doable, isn't it? I just think we need to be a bit cleverer
*  about it. But at the moment, the subject's approached with this is good, this is evil.
*  At the moment, we live in a Star Wars reality. So effectively, you're either the rebellion or
*  you're Darth Vader and his crew. And I've been, and you will have, I've been pushed into the corner
*  of being Darth Vader. I just don't think I am. You know, when I can, I use the train. If I'm in a city,
*  I quite like riding a bicycle because it suits me. I like it. It works. But when I want to go out on
*  an open road and enjoy a 911, I want to enjoy a 911. Why can't I? I find it very difficult when
*  I'm told to do things that I don't think are rational or reasonable. No. And there's this
*  religious ideology that's attached to climate change. That's it. It has that sort of fever
*  pitched religious aspect to it. And most people, when you corner them, if they're even the real
*  zealots, most people really don't understand how much data there is on the impact that human beings
*  have on climate change, how much is being done in China and India that will not change at all,
*  and is only going to get more extreme? And like what little impact you have. Yeah, that's a really
*  interesting point because on the one when you took, it's like being a parent on the one hand,
*  you can respond to that by saying, well, yeah, I'm going to make no difference. I'll just carry
*  on driving around in my Raptor. But then it could be suggested that that means that you should make
*  a difference. But I find it really difficult that we can't understand that if that if it has to
*  ultimately be a change at some point, if it's rational, I don't know if it's now or it's
*  certainly not 2035. That's not reasonable. No, we need to prepare ourselves to make logical and
*  progressive changes. Yeah, I don't think you can mandate those changes. No, you first of all, we
*  have a long history of internal combustion engines as recreation vehicles, and we love them. And
*  we're not I don't I think it's completely unfair. If you're still running coal plants that power
*  electric vehicles, which is a fact in America, they have coal plants that power electric vehicles,
*  they do far more damage to the environment. And if you tell me I can't have an internal combustion
*  engine while you're doing that to power electric vehicles, I'm going to say fuck you. Because fuck
*  you is the right thing to say because that doesn't make any sense. Yeah, there's also this weird thing
*  that is attached to this. This is a business, the green energy business. And these people that are
*  involved in the green energy business have done a tremendous job in pushing these politicians to
*  promote this very specific propaganda about what you can and what you can't do, and what we need
*  to do and where we need to get to and what bills we need to pass in order to get to this position.
*  And they're all profitable. And that's the problem that nobody wants to talk about. This is all
*  business and like most businesses like the business of vaccines or the businesses of
*  infrastructure, there's or military, there's a lot of money being exchanged. And that's why
*  it's being promoted. It's not this isn't some completely altruistic, we need to save the world,
*  and this is what's wrong. That's not true. It's not true. I think I think I agree. And I know there
*  are some basic tests you can apply to it. If you gave most people that love the internal combustion
*  engine and electric vehicle that could do exactly the same thing as well, but be electric, they take
*  it. But they can't, we cannot, the technology doesn't work at the moment. It just doesn't sound
*  the same. It doesn't feel the same. But that's the non-enthusiast, the non-enthusiast, people like you
*  and I that don't care about that. If you gave them an electric vehicle that did exactly the same job
*  that could do it as well, and could be as flexible to their needs, they take it because this is good.
*  But no one can do that at the moment. They don't exist. They don't exist. It takes too long to
*  charge. You can't just pull over and charge. It takes hours. And also there are so many other
*  industries that pollute so heavily. Why aren't they the subject of so much sort of pernicious
*  legislation? I mean, we talk about shipping. If you start to look into cargo ships, what they
*  emit is extraordinary. Absolutely extraordinary. Well, do you know that they, I believe it was the
*  UN, passed some sort of regulations on cargo ships? And because of these regulations to make them more
*  pollute less, the side effect, the unintended consequences were the ocean got warmer. The
*  surface of the ocean where it was measured got warmer because there's no longer a pollution layer
*  over the ocean where these things are traveling, which is so crazy.
*  So I know. Do you know that there's more green on earth today than there was in the last 100 years?
*  No, I didn't know that. It's because of the carbon dioxide because trees eat carbon dioxide.
*  I have to say I'm completely torn on it all because I, some days, but you don't have some
*  many diesel vehicles here, but some days I drive around in the UK and I see a diesel throwing some
*  shit out the back of it. And I'm like, that's not good. If I can see it, I don't like it. We have a
*  lot of diesel trucks here. Yeah. And I don't like it on the highway and you see black smoke. And I
*  do want, I want things to be different over time. And I can see that that that that's the way that
*  we might be heading, but I hate, I hate the fact that the timeline is determined by politicians
*  rather than scientists. Exactly. And even the scientists are all bought and paid for. That's
*  part of the problem too. Scientists aren't just scientists. They're scientists that are influenced
*  by the university. They're influenced by whatever research group they're a part of. There's a lot of
*  shenanigans going on. And the internal combustion engine has ironically reached a point where it's
*  really quite efficient. It's quite a clever thing. If you were to invite an alien down in that
*  vehicle there and try and show off what we're capable of, you might show them a Raptor R and
*  go, we did that. Yeah. We're quite clever. But I think they'd be like, you're not using gravity.
*  Why don't you guys just go use gravity? Minimum gravity. This is so stupid. I have a Tesla. I
*  have a model S Plaid and it's fantastic. It is so fast. It's like a time machine. Has it got the
*  not real steering wheel? Yes. I don't like that. I don't like the yoke. I ordered a new one. I get
*  it in October. No yoke, regular wheel. Yeah. Wheel's better. I like a wheel better, but I get it.
*  There's some benefits to the yoke. It's like you get a clearer view of the dash. You basically put
*  your hands on there and he's moving towards like completely automated. You can press, you press
*  the button and it'll drive you just based on the navigation. Where do you stand on that? I don't
*  trust it. No, nor do I. I mean, it just doesn't feel right. But the few times I've been in one of
*  those things with the most advanced, they've all got levels now, haven't they? And I've let it
*  drive me. I'm there thinking I'm hovering. I don't like it. It's the exact same feeling that I got
*  when Joe Biden was the president. Like, is this okay? I have to say I don't. And in this city,
*  there are a lot of Jaguars with sort of radar-y things on them. Yes. And I presume they're
*  driverless. Yes, they're driverless. I don't know what they're called. Wayvo? Waymo? Waymo?
*  So I view those like I do that sort of bloke in the corner of the bar that's just a bit shuffly,
*  gets up, does the one-legged walk, comes back from the urinal with a bit of piss down his leg. I'm
*  giving you a wide berth, mate. Well, there was a bunch of them. They got into a sort of a situation
*  where they created a traffic jam because they all came into an intersection together and no one
*  wanted to move. And there was a bunch of them because there's quite a few of them in the city.
*  You'll see. I've seen several today. Yes, they caused a traffic jam. Yeah, I don't. I mean,
*  probably one day it's going to be the way to do it, the way to get around. But I think you can't
*  deny people the joy of driving just like you can't deny people their ability to ride horses. If
*  someone wants to ride a horse, they should be able to ride a horse. People have a long history of
*  enjoying horse riding. Okay, let them ride horses. And I have a 1993 RS America.
*  And that's a rare car. Oh, I love it. It's so beautiful. Because that was the car they made
*  because you weren't allowed the real 94 RS, were you? They did a special one. Yes. So this one,
*  I had a sent it to Shark Works and they juiced it up to somewhere around 300 horsepower. Nothing crazy.
*  But oh my god, it's so tactile and it's alive. And it just when I drive it, I just I'm smiling.
*  And I have this big smile on my face like I'm on a fucking ride. I was going to bring my Gunther
*  works here today, but it's raining. Have you got one of those? Is it got a roof or not? Yeah,
*  it's got a roof. I mean, so where do we stand on the resto mod scene? Do we think it's gone too far
*  or or do we believe this the way forward? Well, I like the ones that look old but drive new.
*  Yeah, because they're less dangerous. That's the help. That's the whole idea. Really,
*  but I don't think there's anything dangerous in that 993 the 964. That's mine. That's beautiful.
*  It's so good. How much power has that got? 460. And it's, you know, 2000. I've also got to raise
*  my hand here and say that I work for singer. So I love those two. But I actually have a little
*  contract with them. So I've got I've actually professionally got to say I ignore that vehicle.
*  But actually, I think I love the rest of mod thing. I think it it might be at peak resto mod.
*  Yeah, so much of it going on. But it does. It segues into a point I wanted to make about the
*  the way we're traveling. One of the ways I find to appease myself if I do wake up some days and
*  think I'm pretty wasteful individual or whatever it is, even I have moments where I think,
*  just have a look at yourself in the mirror. Just buy a used car, then you don't you're not
*  having another one built. There are so many great old cars out there. Right. I just go out and buy
*  some and it's 10 years old. Go and look at a 10 year old AMG. What a machine. Yeah. And if you do,
*  that's a vehicle that's already been built. Right. It's it's it's wastefulness has already
*  been absorbed into this weird world we live in. Go and buy it. Yeah, it's there for you with its
*  500 horsepower. It's ready to go. Yeah, that's the greenest thing you can do is to go and buy an
*  old Ferrari. Right. You'll do no miles in it. Because you'll never use it because it might work
*  now and again. It's the greenest thing you can do in your life is buy a used Ferrari or Lamborghini.
*  Right. It's just best thing. So but no one seems to express it this way. And the other way is to
*  resto mod is to you know, buy something and make it make the car that you wish new car makers built
*  now but they can't because they've all been drawn into this need to spend billions on on these
*  electric SUVs. There's the other thing that's ironic. They're all SUVs. So you're telling me
*  we've got to have these efficient new EVs, but you're going to make them three tons. Shouldn't
*  they be that big? Not only that, there's a problem with guardrails. Jesus, they're too heavy. They go
*  right through the guardrails like butter. I saw that. I saw that on Instagram, too. It just goes
*  straight through it. Right through. Yeah. They're twice as weight. But I do think that people love
*  cars. Just look to old stuff. Yeah. There's so much of it out there. Yeah. And they're so good.
*  I have a 2005 M3. So an E46. Peak car. Peak car. Such a great car. I know. It's not too powerful,
*  but it's so delightful. Like as it doesn't have a radio, it's got cloth seats. I fucking love it.
*  Cloth seats. That is rare. Yeah. Yeah. Cloth seats. I just bought the V10. So you had the E60 V10 M5
*  over here. Crazy machine. Yes. We had the Touring in the UK. They built a Touring, which is a
*  state car. Or, sorry, a station wagon. And I've got one of those that I bought earlier in the year.
*  And I'm just, do you know what? I paid £27,000 for it. I probably spent more than that on it already
*  just making it right. But actually the journey of just reconditioning and renewing something like
*  that to use for the next five years, I find more interesting than most new performance cars now.
*  Is that a sad statement or not? No. No, because there's something about like seeing the improvement
*  on a vehicle. Like getting a vehicle and going, yeah, you know, this suspension is okay, but these
*  shocks are like, I could adjust this and maybe this and maybe I can get a little wider wheel in this.
*  You remind me so much of one of my favorite colleagues, Mr. LeBlanc, because Matt is a much
*  bigger car guy than anyone realizes. We actually grew up in the same town. Did you? Yeah. I had
*  friends that knew him, but I never met him. I've still never met him. He's a wonderful man and he's
*  brilliant car guy. He would agree with you. He's like that. He can never quite leave something alone.
*  Yeah. And with motorcycles as well. Motorcycles. He had a bizarre... Working with him was wonderful,
*  by the way. I loved him to bits. I'd like to make another TV show with him. I got one of these gangs
*  that steals motorcycles in the UK got me. So I was doing a voiceover in the center of London.
*  I probably told... I might have written this story. I don't know if I told it or not.
*  And I had a new Ducati I'd bought. I like bikes. I'm not very good on them, but I like bikes. And
*  I was trying to get better. And Matt's a very good rider. And I had this Ducati Panigale
*  anniversary with all the... It's the kind of shit you buy when you've just got a TV job,
*  you know, and you think you're the dog's bollocks. Looking back, it's fucking embarrassing. So I've
*  parked it up in Soho in right in the center of London by the... Where the voiceover studio was.
*  And I was a bit early. So I was milling about wearing my leathers still. And I saw this bike
*  moving past me and I thought, that's a nice bike. Oh shit, that's my bike. And I saw these guys all
*  in black with stuff, sort of tinted visors, black everything. What they do is they basically angle
*  grind off the steering lock, the male part that goes into the headstock, the angle off,
*  break the steering. And then they have a moped behind or something quite powerful with a leg out
*  and another guy and push your bike away in neutral. And they get it around the corner into a van and
*  away it goes. And they did it right in front of me. And so I walked up and I was like, this is my
*  bike. I'm small, not a very big guy. I don't present any kind of a threat. And there was
*  three of them. And I challenged them and I said, this is not on. And I started swearing and one of
*  them had a hammer, claw hammer. And we had a tussle and the bike fell over. And as the bike fell over,
*  I'm like, well, that's wrecked that then, hasn't it? Because I could just see the fairing squashed.
*  And then the guy tried to hit me with the hammer. And I was like, I remember screaming,
*  you're trying to steal my bike and now you're trying to hit me with the hammer. And then they
*  were like... And then they left. And I was really shocked. I'd never had anything like that happen
*  to me. So I picked the bike up and I walked it down to the voiceover studio and I rolled it up
*  and I walked in and Matt was there. It's a long story. And I said, well, how are you? I said,
*  someone's just tried to steal my bike and they tried to hit me with a hammer. And he came outside
*  and he looked at the bike. He's got the most lovely deadpan voice. And he goes,
*  you want to get those Ducati performance levers? Those are too long.
*  He was trying to mod it. He didn't even care. You almost got killed by a hammer.
*  Because he's like you. He's like, obviously, you know, tough. He's a big boy. And he's like,
*  he's fine. But those levers are too long. They don't suit that bike. Those levers are too long.
*  Yeah. I think the mod thing is really important to me. I love it. I cannot leave stuff alone.
*  Yeah. I enjoy messing around with stuff too. It's part of the fun of the older cars.
*  You know, particularly like I have a Nissan GTR and that is 35. Yeah. That is the ultimate
*  mod car because they've been around for so long in exactly the same form. And there's such an
*  aftermarket and everybody just goes crazy. Find me a standard one that don't exist.
*  Yeah. It's very hard to find. A stock R35, the unicorn.
*  Yeah. Very hard to find. How much power does yours have?
*  Well, I got a Nismo. I got last year's model, the Nismo. So I got it new. It was still laying
*  around. But I got it because I know you can fuck around with them. So I'm never going to get rid
*  of it. I'm going to keep it forever. And I'm going to juice it up to probably a thousand horsepower,
*  something stupid. And if they make another one, it'll have to be a hybrid. It'll have to be.
*  Yeah. Yeah. It'll never be the same. They're about to do that to Porsches probably. They're
*  about to do that. They're already doing that with the M5, right? The new M5 is a hybrid.
*  I've driven that. The new one? Yeah. Yeah. I'm not sure whether I can say I've driven it or not.
*  Say it. I'll probably get, I think I signed a piece of paper saying I'd get sued for 60,000
*  euros if I said nothing. It's, yeah. There's a point in this process where you have to acknowledge
*  that the main criticism of hybridity in cars is mass, is weight. Right. So everyone says it's too
*  heavy. But for me, mass is just a number unless you can feel it. Okay. Right. It's really important.
*  You can't just criticize something because it's heavy. Right. You can't. Because actually,
*  it might affect the way the car drives, but you have to drive it to tell that first. That's where
*  I have a job. So that's, and I won't talk about the M5 because I think I might get sued.
*  But I can tell you now, the BMW M2 is a small performance car that came out, 1750 kilograms.
*  My friend, Tom Segura, had one of those that he sent off to get juiced up. I forget,
*  Dynan did it? Or I forget who did it. Well, the new one came out and it was 300 kilograms
*  heavier than the last one. And the whole, the internet had a massive collective baby and went,
*  oh, it's fucking ruined. I ran one for six months. It was better than the last M2. Of course it was.
*  Really? Yes. Because someone German with a massive forehead and a white coat made it that way.
*  Because these are really clever people. Right. And actually mass only matters if you can feel it.
*  So if you drive a car and you can feel it's too heavy, fine, I'm with you. But that's,
*  and that's the clearest to what I think about the new M5. Judge it, get in it and judge it before
*  you, before you actually, or drive it before you judge it. And that's what it looks like. Yeah.
*  It looks good. It's a 700 and something horsepower sedan with a BMW badge. Look at 727. When is that
*  coming out? The launch is at the end of this year. It is. It's a beast. I could only imagine.
*  I had an M5. I miss it. Was it a V10 or the V8 one? It was V8. E39. Yeah. I had it in,
*  what year was it? 2015 or something. What was that? Which, which one would that be?
*  That would have been the V10. It wasn't a V10. Was it not? It was the one after the V10. Oh,
*  that would be the F10. Yeah. The F10M. Yeah. I'm a real nerd. I loved it. It's a good car.
*  It was great. And actually an M car should be, and your E46 is the definition of this. An M car
*  should be a car that the non-car nerd can't spot it from the normal one, but the car nerd can spot
*  it just for the camber, a little bit of right height, a little bit of shoulder. You can see an M car.
*  You and I can see an M car from a mile. Little hips. But a civilian cannot see an M car from a
*  mile away. Especially in E46 because it's such a plain looking car. That's a gorgeous car. We
*  actually had someone reach out to Jamie. That's how I bought it. Cause we were talking about how
*  great there are. I was like, I'd love to find a low mile one. And this one is super low miles.
*  I forget what it is, but it's really low miles. M tech cloth is rare. Yeah. I look at the cars I
*  missed out on. There was a white manual M tech on 18 inch wheels, E46 M3. And I, why I didn't buy it,
*  I don't know. But then I suppose I could say that about a thousand cars that I wish I'd bought or
*  I hadn't sold. I wish you never sold that green Porsche. Do you know what? I know who owns it.
*  Yeah. It appears in the UK now and again. And I see it. It was a cool thing. And, but I had to
*  realize early on that I couldn't afford to keep all these things. But that thing was a masterpiece.
*  It was lovely. But look where that was done by Tuttle. Yeah. Right. And look where they are now.
*  They just come back from Pebble Beach with this GT1 amazing looking thing, which you might have
*  seen. You Google GT1. Doesn't he have a car that goes to 10,000, 11, 11,000 RPMs? That's so nuts.
*  Yeah. It's a, it's a lovely thing that he developed with a friend of ours called Philip Kudori, who
*  obviously runs the Quail and it's okay. So Kay has, it's a very good name, isn't it? It's a 911 K
*  developed by a guy called Kudori K for Kudori. And it revs to 11,000, 11,000 RPM, 911 K. It's my
*  favorite car name ever. I've driven it. There's a video online of that in this gold thing. How is it?
*  You need to sit down after driving it because it's just, it's just so visceral. You're, it's one of
*  the few cars that you're aware of just how fast that crank is spinning and you have to keep it
*  revving and it just keeps going. And your eye says it's gone to eight. You've got to stop now. I'm
*  going to have bits of metal coming out the side of the engine, but it never does. And it's so light.
*  Everything's carbon. So it's, it's about 900 kilograms. Wow. Yeah. You'd love that. That's
*  really, that's very basic intravenous performance. That is how light did you get your green card
*  down to? Is that it? No, that's, that's what they've just done. So Tuttall did the GT. He's just
*  launched that at Pebble Beach. Look at that. That looks, I hate the wheels, but again, I work for
*  singer. I love singer. I love singer. Amazing. But that's my friend. Richard's just done that.
*  Can you get me a picture of a singer? Why are the wheels so gross?
*  Um, because they're supposed to look like eighties wheels from Lamont. Yeah, let that go. Yeah. I
*  think you might be right, but, um, 100% right. Disgusting. Yeah. The 911 K is, it's an amazing
*  thing. And maybe if I was Porsche or another car maker, I'd be starting to cry foul because
*  what's happened is the rest of thing is actually a movement that reminds car makers
*  that they're not being given or being offered a fair crack at the whip now. Cause they, cause
*  you can come along, you and I could establish the monkey and Joe car company tomorrow.
*  Right. And we could find a car. We could say, right, we're going to make an E 46 M three.
*  We're going to get, we're going to buy a hundred good E 46 M threes and we're going to turn them
*  into the Joe and monkey M three. And we're going to sell them for $300,000. They're going to have
*  a nice new interior. They're not going to stray too far from the original philosophy of the car.
*  Everyone's going to love them. And we wouldn't have to meet any kind of crash legislation.
*  Smog would be according to the vehicle age in the, in Europe is even less to do. It comes under
*  very low volume approval. You don't have to do anything. We don't have to meet any emissions
*  regs really in Europe. You can do what you want, but if you're a car, if you're called, if you're
*  called BMW, you cannot make that car. Right. And I'm not sure that's fair. Right. Like what rough
*  does. Yeah. So they don't even, that's not even really a Porsche. Well, it has its own chassis
*  plate. It's, it's a really gray area, but I think it's unfair on the car companies in many ways
*  because they can't go out and do that. Right. They can't make a resto mod. They can't.
*  Porsche could not make a singer. They could, but they could, they'd have to establish a new co
*  or they'd have to buy a company. But could Porsche make resto mods of their vehicles?
*  I think they potentially could, but they'd be terrified. I suspect of the potential litigation,
*  right? You know, cause if one of them went into a wall, right, you know, you'll suddenly, you get
*  to Sue Porsche. Right. Also, especially if you're selling something like one of those old widow makers
*  and people don't understand that if I mean, I have a 2007 GT3 RS and it's still like around
*  corners, you let off off the gas, it'll whip around on you. Yeah. The new ones don't really
*  do that that much. The new ones are much better. They've got, well, they've got this rear steer on
*  them, which definitely helps, but they'll still rotate. Yeah. Just the engine out the back.
*  You add that to an old like design. It's less prominent now cause tire technology's moved on
*  so much. Right. Remember the first time I got to drive a lot of these things, I didn't quite
*  understand the widow maker tag because they had new tires. They had these new tires. Tires are
*  everything. I'll tell you a Top Gear story. It's fairly interesting. My colleague who called
*  Paddy McGinnis, who was one of the co-hosts who's claimed to fame for me in America is
*  he had to be subtitled in America for Top Gear because his accent is so broad from the North
*  of England he had subtitles. It's like watching Peaky Blinders. Yeah. No, it's worse than that.
*  Anyhow, he crashed a Lamborghini when we were filming and it was all over the press in the UK.
*  It helped it was red, like proper dog knob red Lamborghini goes off the road. Anyhow, at the end
*  of it all, the cars on a low loader and I look at the tires, they're 20 years old. Oh God. Yeah.
*  Well, that's the- It had been borrowed for the job. Old tire technology matched with age as well.
*  It's terrible. That's the story with the guy from Fast and the Furious. What's his name? Paul Walker.
*  Paul Walker. That's the story with him. They had old tires on that car. So Paddy gets eviscerated
*  in the press cause he can't drive and everything else. I could have been in that car. I'd have
*  crashed it. I can drive a bit. Anyone, you cannot. And that's that if you get in these old cars
*  with old tires on them, they have nothing. Yeah. Absolutely nothing. It's incredible how much the
*  technology has come along in that regard. I'd say Michelin at its best is, you know, some of it's
*  like witchcraft. If you go, if you get in a new Porsche GT3 RS now, the tire they've developed for
*  that probably has four compounds across it. You know, so the high wear stuff where it needs the
*  grip, they're so clever. They really are. The performance they add to the vehicle, no one knows.
*  How come no one can figure out how to make a tire without air?
*  So it's a really, really interesting point. They must have done. It must, for me, it comes
*  under the same heading as someone must have made a light bulb that you never need to replace. But
*  why would they make it? Well, the tire without air thing for safety purposes. There's a lot of
*  reasons why you would want a tire that I mean, I know they did bake them. They do have this tire
*  that looks like a looks like a sort of spring, you know, that Adidas shoe that has the sort of
*  lattice. Yeah, it looks a bit like that. Yeah, I have seen those, but I suppose you're still
*  dealing with a, at that point, it's a sprung mass, which would interfere with suspension.
*  I don't have an answer. Do you think that's what it is? It's like it's heavier. I don't know,
*  because there's no air in it. That makes sense. You'd have so much more rubber, but I think they
*  tried to mitigate that by having it clear. So you see through it. There was some shots of one
*  recently. I have to assume the any reason you would there's any two reasons you wouldn't make it.
*  One, it doesn't work to it. It gets in the way of your ability to make money. Right. Normally the
*  latter. Yeah, I don't know. It's probably a performance issue too, because by manipulating
*  the tire pressure, you can get it just right. Whereas you're not going to be able to manipulate
*  anything once the compound is exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Tires are the more you get into cars,
*  tires are a fascinating subject. That's, that's a good opener when you meet some of the opposite
*  sex. But I, it's never worked for me, but actually they are because they're the only contact you have
*  with the, with the ground. So it stands to reason that the most important part of the performance
*  package, F1 commentators, and I'm actually slightly less so in the U S but in Formula One,
*  the commentators spend most of the time talking about tires because it's what it's the main factor,
*  but they're not sexy tires are not sexy definition. So, you know, car makers will tell you I've got,
*  we've got a new damper system that's got eight settings and we've got this and this and this.
*  They can't tell you that they've spent five years developing a tire. Right. That's revolutionary.
*  Nobody cares. Cause it just looks like a tire. Yeah. Just looks terrible. What are you showing me?
*  And when they come to replace that tire, they'll just, just give me the cheap one.
*  I don't, I don't want to spend that money on that one. Right. Right. Right. So, um,
*  your experience at Top Gear. Yeah, that's interesting. So I've, I've never really spoken
*  about it because I'm, I keep my mouth shut. I like to, uh, remain dignified. It's been,
*  it's quite a journey. It's come to an end now. I really feel it's a full stop.
*  The show has been, uh, put on hold in the UK indefinitely is the, is the terminology from
*  the BBC. That means it's an end, but strangely it exists in other formats around the world. So
*  there's been an American one. There's one in Finland. There's one in Australia, there's one
*  in France. So the, the, the license and the brand exists elsewhere, but not at its home in the UK.
*  And it came to an end for me one day in December, uh, 2022, uh, in a way that
*  I'd like to say I hadn't expected, but, but I had, and I think that's the bit that I've found very
*  difficult to deal with over the last, uh, couple of years. Fundamentally, I'm quite happy go lucky
*  person. I'm very privileged with the life I've had. And I love the fact that I earn a living doing
*  what I love. You must have the same thing to wake up. What a joy. I don't push a desk. I get to,
*  I get to wreck other people's tires. And also my subject is one that is surrounded by joy. No one
*  wants to hear the last person you want to hear from is the miserable car road tester. Right. He
*  can fuck off. Cause he, you know, he can, and I don't want to be that guy. I hate those guys.
*  Yeah. But actually I, that is, I'll be lying if I said I've, you know, I'm feel good today.
*  I've had a good few months, but the last 18 months I've been bad because I just didn't,
*  I didn't know what to do because, because I'd like to sit here and say, I never saw it coming,
*  but I did. So what happened? Um, the, the accident that, that my friend Andrew had known as Fred,
*  I won't go into too much because it's, it's sort of out there. What happened? He rolled a
*  Morgan three wheeler. Um, uh, he wasn't wearing a crash helmet. And if you do that at even at 25,
*  30 miles an hour, the injuries that you sustain are profound. Uh, I was there on the day. I was
*  the only presenter with Fred that day. I wasn't actually right by him. Um, but I was close by.
*  I remember the radio message that I heard. I always used to have a radio in my little room
*  at the test track where I was sitting inside. So I could hear what was going on. Uh, and I heard
*  someone say, this has been a real accident here. The car's upside down. Um, so I ran to the window,
*  looked out and he wasn't moving. So I thought he was, I thought he was dead. I assumed he was,
*  then he moved. Um, I can tell you now that he, unless he, he's a physical specimen, Fred,
*  he's a big guy, six foot five, six foot six strong. And if he, if he wasn't so strong,
*  he wouldn't have survived. He's a, he's a great advert for, um, physical strength and conditioning
*  because if he hadn't been that strong, he would have just snapped his neck. He'd be dead. So I
*  can't believe he's, I couldn't believe he survived. And that sort of that, that moment of realization
*  that he'd survived has kind of defined my thoughts on the subject since. Cause I believe that
*  anything after that is a bit of a bonus, you know, he should be dead really. Um, and the
*  fact that he survived it is remarkable and it's given him and his family a chance to move on
*  under very difficult circumstances. So that day was very difficult, um, made even more difficult
*  by the fact that the buildup to that particular shoot, I knew that we were at the last minute,
*  I knew we were using a Morgan three wheeler. It's a very, it's a difficult car. You know,
*  it's by just the name tells you it's physics is complicated. It doesn't mean it's inherently
*  dangerous. You just drive it according to what it is. You have to be aware of its limitations.
*  And I think that, that really was difficult. There were, and you need experience. There were
*  two people that had driven a Morgan three wheeler before present that day, me and someone else,
*  a pro driver. And we were sitting inside at that time. No one had asked us anything about the car.
*  They just gone on and shot it without us. And I think, um, if I'm looking in the mirror,
*  I find it very difficult. Even now that Andrew, who I, who I loved a bit of lovely man,
*  he, um, he was a pro cricket player. He wasn't a automotive guy. Uh, and he, but he was a real
*  enthusiast. He was great, much like you. He loved cars and he, he would always come up to me
*  before a shoot and say, tell me how it is. And I've, I've, I've got all the advice,
*  give me the last bit of advice and what I should do, what I should expect.
*  And that was the first, because of the call times that day, that was the first time we'd never had
*  the chance to talk about how he might approach a difficult vehicle. And that was the one day that
*  it went wrong. I find that very difficult to live with. And I feel partly responsible because I
*  didn't get the chance to talk to him. Um, but, but my situation, nothing compared to his, anyhow,
*  um, the bit that I find really difficult is that in the aftermath of that accident, the show was
*  put on hold. Andrew had to recover from frankly, awful injuries and has done so. Um, but, uh,
*  profound injuries. We all kept quiet. We said nothing. And I, I said nothing because I wanted
*  to look after him. It wasn't my story, was it? I was, I was caught up in the collateral damage.
*  I lost my job immediately because, um, they canceled the show and my contract was up. So
*  suddenly I haven't got a job. But again, you look in the mirror and I think I'm alive. I've got three
*  beautiful children. I'm not in Fred's position. Andrew and Fred are the same person. Sorry,
*  that's his nickname. Um, and I just sort of got my head down, but I had seen this coming.
*  There was a big, there was a big inquiry, a lot of soul searching. The BBC is good at that.
*  But what was never spoken about was that three months before the accident,
*  I'd gone to the BBC and said, um, unless you change something, someone's going to die
*  on this show. So I went to them. I went to the BBC and I told them of my concerns from what I'd
*  seen as someone, as the most experienced driver on the show by a mile. I said, if we carry on
*  at the very least, we're going to have a serious injury. The very worst, we're going to have fatality.
*  Let's explain to people that aren't aware of what Top Gear is and how Top Gear works,
*  because I know there's a lot of Americans that never watched the show. You guys do a lot of really
*  crazy stunts with automobiles, not necessarily just cars, but big trucks and all kinds of crazy
*  things. And some of them are quite ridiculous. Yeah. There was a bit of a arms race between us
*  and maybe the other big car show, the grand tour at the time to go ever more stupid. And we did
*  some, we did do some big stunts and a lot of the time and the grand tour is the original cast
*  Top Gear, Jeremy Kaufs and Richard May in their Amazon show. Yeah. It's happy they've just ended
*  great show. So, and also I'm James Mayer. Yeah, I'm not of the health and safety world. I'm not risk
*  averse. I love a bit of risk. And I also absolutely believe that if you enter into a show like Top Gear,
*  you know what you're taking on, you know, I believe that there is no such thing as great
*  risk-free television like that. You just got to, you know, I just turn up and I assess what I see
*  and I do what I'm comfortable with and I want to make great television. That's it. And if sometimes
*  it got a bit sketchy, so be it. We've all done that. You know, that's the way the world lives.
*  And I think what happened with Top Gear was I saw repeatedly too many times my two co-hosts who
*  didn't have the experience I had in cars. This is the critical thing. I'm qualified to make those
*  decisions because I've done it a long time. They weren't. One of them is an actor comedian. The
*  other guy is a pro cricket player. Brilliant entertainers. They were great hosts, but their
*  roles were to make people laugh. And my role was to tell people what cars were like. And all too
*  often towards the last year, I saw situations where it got too dangerous and it culminated actually
*  enough being in Thailand. Myself and Paddy were in Thailand and we went, we did a go-kart race down
*  a hill in just compacted mud on wooden go-karts with no engines. And I just looked at them and I
*  said, this is just, this, so it's not a question of whether we get injured. It's how injured we get.
*  So just have an ambulance at the bottom because something's going to go wrong. Sure enough, I
*  broke something in my hand, broke a finger or what have you. And I just thought, which sounds
*  ridiculous from your background because you're, you know, you're super tough guys, but it hurt.
*  I don't want to break my fingers. I didn't, I also, it was a shit piece of television. So I,
*  I always said, I don't mind breaking my hand if we get a BAFTA for it, but, or an award, but this
*  was just the shit skit. And I ended up damaged and it went on too much. So anyhow, I went to the BBC
*  and I said, I want to have a meeting with the head of health and safety because this is not good.
*  And what, what's, what's really killed me is that no one's ever really acknowledged the fact that I
*  called it beforehand. And I, it's very difficult to live with that initially for me when I knew,
*  I thought I'd done the right thing. I'm not very good at that. I normally just go with the flow,
*  but I saw this coming. I thought I did the right thing. I went to the BBC and I found out really
*  that no one had taken me very seriously. You know, I did a bit of digging afterwards.
*  The conversation I had with those people was sort of acknowledged. Then they tried to sort of shut
*  me down a bit and then they didn't look after me at all. They just sort of left me to rot.
*  And I, even now I'm totally perplexed by the whole thing. It's, I took to, to actually say
*  to an organization, this is going to go wrong and then be there. The day that it goes wrong
*  is, is a position I never expected to be in. And I never want to be in again.
*  It's, it's strange and, and pretty heartbreaking in many ways. I love that show.
*  So did the conversation between you and the network completely stop after the accident?
*  They just sort of left me to, to sweat really. I just didn't really, I just sat in my,
*  where I live and drank whiskey. I didn't have much contact with them at all. Everything went quiet.
*  They had two inquiries into the accident commissioned, neither of which I had access
*  to. I pushed very hard to have access to the second one and saw some of it. And I had this,
*  this is one of the most bizarre interactions I've had. I sat down with someone from the BBC
*  who, who, who was going to talk me through bits of the second inquiry into the accident.
*  And I'd already been told that I no longer had a job. So I'd been told that Top Gear was done.
*  And at the beginning of it, he said to me, I won't name him. He said,
*  want to thank you so much for taking part in this because it's really going to help us as an
*  organization going forwards. So it doesn't really help me. I've lost my job.
*  And I'm always reminded of that old adage from a very brilliant BBC comedy show, which was never
*  committed an inquiry that you don't know the outcome of in the first place. So I don't know
*  the whole thing. The whole situation was ridiculous. And I've never told anyone that,
*  you know, I think, and I want to tell people that I did because I, a bit of me thought as the
*  experienced driver, do members of the public think that I didn't do enough to protect Andrew?
*  But I, and, and Paddy as well, they both had, they both experienced other incidents on that
*  show that I think were unacceptable. And that's coming as someone who loves a bit of risk. You
*  know, if you and I went outside now and there were two quad bikes, I'd happily roll it for a laugh
*  with you. I'm that guy. And even me as that guy thought it had gone too far, which I think is
*  important to say. Right. Well, there's the problem with those shows is they always want to keep
*  pushing the limit. And it's generally the producers who don't quite understand the
*  limitations of the vehicles. And not, yes, they don't have the experience of,
*  of what it's like to actually be in control of that vehicle or what is possible. Right. Right.
*  So all too often it's, can you just do that? Right. And then you want to be a crowd pleaser.
*  You know, you, you want to be the guy that can do it. We had that on fear factor. Yeah. When I was
*  hosting fear factor, there was a couple of times where I was like, what the fuck are we doing?
*  Especially the second seat, like fear factor started in 2001 and went to 2007. And then we
*  came back again in 2011 and we only did six episodes and they tried to make it just really
*  ramped up. And when it was canceled, it was actually canceled because people had to drink
*  donkey sperm. Yeah. Which was pretty minor and consider, I mean, it's disgusting, but it wasn't
*  anything that was going to risk anyone's lives. But I was really feeling like if this keeps going
*  the stunts are so spectacular and so big, we're launching cars through moving trains. There was a
*  moving train and then the train had all these like cardboard boxes in it. We launch a car off a ramp
*  like sideways and it goes through the train. You have to time it just right. So you don't hit the
*  car into one of the big metal someone in the car driving it. Yeah. Oh yeah. My, my experience of
*  that now is that if you establish really big stunts that have big vision and are ambitious,
*  they tend to come with them a level of rigor. That means they are executed well.
*  The difficult area is the kind of just being at a test track with a smaller crew and someone says,
*  give that a go. That's when it goes wrong because no one's really thought about it. They're saying,
*  well, we've done that. We've done the risk assessment, but just give that a go while you're
*  here. I think that goes wrong. And also my, my experience, and this is why I'm like everyone
*  that's shot with me will be, will be, have been reminded of this now and again, close a play end
*  of the day. That's when it goes wrong. If you're a test track, it's just, you know, the lights coming
*  down, there's 10 minutes to go. And the director says, just do that. I go, no, cause everyone's
*  tired. Someone's going to have ignored the lockdown on the circuit. There'll be someone coming,
*  driving the other way with the coffee cups over the, or it's the end of the day. Right. I, if
*  it's six o'clock, five 30, I'm gone. I'm not because I'm workshop. I'll stay around and pick
*  stuff up, but don't the end of the day when you start rushing. And I think there was an element
*  of that day at Dunsfold. That was a shoot that was rushed for me. That was, I know that that was a,
*  we need to use this day shoot. That's another one. That's another red flag for me. We've got a day
*  at a track. We need to fill it. Well, that's you've reversed engineered that, you know,
*  your priorities are already to fill something up. And I look back, some of the stuff that we did on
*  top of your look back, that was dangerous, visually dangerous and, and definitely was in, in
*  practical terms. I'm very proud of cause we executed it well. Like Andrew Fred Flintoff went off
*  a dam in a, in a Metro and did a car bungee. It was extraordinary piece of footage. You can see it.
*  It was just amazing film, but it was rigorous. It was done properly. That has amazing stunt crew
*  that did it. I'm not, I couldn't have done it. It was, it was brave and it was a really memorable
*  piece of television that what a legend. And he's got me in his ear. He sat like that for 45 minutes.
*  Look how far down that goes. And I think I'm very proud of what the team did there. And Andrew was
*  magnificent to fuck that. Can you imagine? Cause if it goes wrong, you're dead. Yeah. And he's got
*  that chirpy little shit in his ear as well. I think, and there was, there's other stuff that
*  we did that I can't understand what we were doing. So we also did, and you won't find this. I think
*  they've removed it from you. But there's a, Oh my God. How about that? That's so insane. How about
*  that? Look at it. It goes over itself like that. Oh my God. That is so ridiculous. And then the yank.
*  Oh, but that, do you know, when I said to you earlier, I've bit of me regrets doing it. I look at
*  that and I think, what a, what a thing to have been part of. It's ridiculous. Yeah. And I'm proud of
*  that stuff. One thing we did do, which again on reflection was just madness. We, there's this,
*  there are these guys that go to motorcycle meets and shows in the UK that have these titanium
*  skid plates on their boots and they hold onto the back of the bike. You might've seen them and they
*  go really fast and the sparks go out the back. And they would be, it's decided we'd be good if
*  we did this. So each of us had a vehicle we were using or, you know, you were the person that was
*  pushing that vehicle. You're an advocate for that car in the film. And I think I had the new Land Rover
*  Defender. You've seen those. I had a short wheelbase Defender and I had to hang off the back of it,
*  wearing these, we had to wear these shoes. The big problem with some of these ones is Andrew
*  was so brave. He would go first and set such a high benchmark. You'd have to go,
*  shit, I need to really go here. So he went out and did like, I thought he'd do 40 miles now. I think
*  he did 75 miles now. Hang on the back, wearing these titanium shoes. Anyhow, Paddy gets in and
*  tries to go really fast and he falls off and he's okay. But he's, he could, someone goes, Paddy's over.
*  I looked left, the ambulance driver was having a cigarette at our end of the runway and he was two
*  miles down there. And that was one of those moments where I thought, this has got a bit loose, you know?
*  If you're going to do these things, that guy should have been running parallel. And I didn't like that.
*  Two minutes of two miles, it's a long time. I know. Although the end of that was quite,
*  I can give you some levity there. I did my run, I didn't get quite as close as Paddy. I did
*  nearly 80 miles now or something. And I fell off at the end and it hurt a bit. And I got in the back
*  of the crew car, which I think was another Land Rover. And I was sitting there thinking, this smells
*  terrible. Have I done something wrong here? A really acrid smell. Not from the colon, but definitely,
*  I thought this is not a good smell. Like a chemical smell? Yeah. And I, and then I was told to get out.
*  What happened was the shoes were red hot and I'd got in the car and they just melted straight through
*  the mat, straight through the carpet. And it was just smoldering on fire. I looked like a shit Marvel
*  superhero. Yeah, I think I'm, I'm very happy and proud to have done Top Gear, but I, I'm so sad at
*  the way it ended. Yeah. And no one, that's the ultimate, no one had control of that that day.
*  That's what the insurance industry calls an act of God, whether you believe in him or not.
*  But what happened afterwards was really sad because I've arrived here, you've got your crew,
*  you've got your people. They were my people. And from that day, I've never really spoken to them.
*  The producers, everyone else, no one really. It just, it just went like that, bang, done. And that
*  was, that was very hard because I just couldn't believe it had happened. So I was, they're just
*  gone. And you spend five, six years of your life more in daily contact with people and it just stops.
*  I was always torn on those type of moments on Top Gear because I just wanted to watch car reviews.
*  I wanted to watch people have fun with cars, but then for the casual people, you have to do something
*  stupid like bungee jump off with a car off the side of a dam. And it's like, I don't, I'm not
*  interested. Maybe it's because I hosted fear factor for so long. I've seen so many things like that.
*  They're not interesting to me. I want, I want to hear a car enthusiast rave about the fun they're
*  having while they're driving an automobile. Maybe you should produce a car show. I've got an idea.
*  I'll pitch it to you afterwards, but you're quite right. There's plenty of market for that. There
*  is. And actually this is the country for it. Maybe in Europe it's less, but I know that when
*  we did geeky car stuff that was very, you know, for you and I, the numbers did that. At the moment
*  you did something hyperbolic and ridiculous, the numbers did that. But what about online?
*  Online is totally different. Yes, right. So that's where it belongs. Like where I found about you is
*  online. Yeah. You know, and I don't remember what was the first video that I watched of you, but I
*  do remember that green Porsche. Yeah. I remember that's a long time ago. Oh my God. And that's
*  where I started out and I suspect I'll return there. You know, I've got plans to, to relaunch
*  the YouTube channel in the next month or two and there's content coming. And I'm, YouTube's a very
*  different place to when I left it. And it's pretty surprising. There's so much motoring content out
*  there. It's almost saturated. It's very, very saturated. And there's so many different types
*  of markets now too. Yeah. And the algorithm, I, the idea of being at the behest of an algorithm
*  is terrifying. If you, if you've just received, you know, check from a network for six years of
*  your life, suddenly going, Oh, I'll go in with the algorithm. That's quite scary. It is, but all you
*  need is one thing to take off. And then all of a sudden you're being suggested to millions and
*  millions of people, which is interesting about the algorithm. And if you just look at one type of
*  vehicle, then you're like, um, I really just got interested really recently in the Ineos Grenadier.
*  Yeah. I was like, what a fascinating idea. Take the, I mean, what a limited market by the way,
*  too. That actually ironically is the only example of a brand new resto mod, isn't it? Yes. Yes.
*  Similar. I mean, it's essentially a new vehicle, but if you, for the casual, it looks like a
*  defender. Yeah. It really does, but it kind of better kind of quite a bit better. Yeah. And,
*  you know, really interesting BMW six cylinder supercharged engine. And so now when I open up
*  YouTube, it's like all Grenadiers, it's all Ineos. It's just constantly all these off-roading Australia
*  dudes and all these different people like sending me these things. I, I think you're right. It does
*  belong on YouTube. I mean, linear tele, I joined a TV show when linear television still survived.
*  Well, you know, you know, I understand destination television. Sure. It's gone now. It's gone. It's,
*  the world's changed completely. Top Gear still has a place in it. You know, many of my previous
*  colleagues make a lot of online content for Top Gear. They do a great job. There's some really good
*  films, but there was a, there's something quite romantic for me about the sit down, squidge onto
*  the sofa with you, with you as a family and watch eight o'clock Sunday night. It was, it was a,
*  it was a quasi religious experience, really. But it was in a time where people didn't have smartphones.
*  You're quite right. That, that's gone. That's that waiting for a very specific time to watch a
*  program. No one is interested in that anymore. I know it's strange, isn't it? Cause it's logical
*  that they wouldn't because no one has any patience because of the immediacy of these things. Yes.
*  But there's equally something quite lovely about what we used to do. Right. I, I, I can't really
*  reconcile it. I, I, I totally acknowledge the excitement of the new, but I'm slightly wistful
*  for the past. Is that fair enough? I see what you're saying. The only thing that still exists
*  that you have to wait for is live sports. Yeah. So live sports, when you're watching a game,
*  the game starts at 8 p.m. You have to be there at 8 p.m. It's not going to wait for you. There it is.
*  The podcast is a, as a concept is amazing as well. I've got to be a bit cheesy. I have got a
*  podcast, which, which I didn't, when is this going to go out? Is this going out a day after
*  we record this? Yeah, pretty soon. Well, the day after that, my new podcast launches, I didn't
*  realize that. So it's a really, really interesting name. Chris Harris on cars, Chris Harris and
*  friends car podcast is what it's called. Cause I just thought, well, he's perfect. Heinz tomato
*  ketchup. Yeah. So that, and that really is a nerd product. So one of the things I did as by way of
*  therapy was I did a car podcast in the immediate aftermath of this accident. Cause I realized I
*  wanted to have contact with this world. I think that the moment your life gets difficult,
*  you regress to what is your comfort food. My comfort food is cars. Right. And I, and I love
*  cars. They make me happy. Well, I would much prefer you without producers and network executives and
*  all these different people telling you what to do. I like, I like what I like about podcasts. What
*  I like about YouTube content from people like Matt Farah is I know it's one human being. This is their
*  perspective. This is what they enjoy. They really do love these vehicles and they talk about it
*  without any influence of other human beings. So you're getting this singular viewpoint,
*  which I think is the most attractive thing about it. And the thing you pointed out there, this idea
*  of, of having to alter things or add sort of ancillary comedy to them, to the, make them appeal
*  to the masses is, is what I found very difficult on Top Gear. Cause I came there as I arrived as
*  the rigorous car tester. You put me with some comedians, put me with whoever, I don't need to
*  do that. They, they'll do the heavy lifting. They'll make people laugh. But if you want to know whether
*  the new M2 is any good or not, please give it to me and I'll tell you. Right. And the M2 is a good
*  example. When the first M2 came out, I was giving it to review for Top Gear and I just said, well,
*  I'd like to just do a review of the car. We've got a test track. I'll slide it around and tell
*  you what it's like. Then move on. Someone else can make them laugh. But that wasn't enough. They had,
*  they had a section of this where I, I had to, I was given this sort of
*  piece of testing equipment called the pantometer 3000 or something just made up. I had to put on
*  these underpants, which were going to tell people, you know, whether my sphincter was moving faster
*  in this vehicle. I don't know what it was, but it was, I looked back and I should have just said,
*  fuck off. Yeah. I don't do that. You know, it's just an embarrassing moment in my life. But that
*  was exactly, it was, they had to, they felt the need to augment the test with something stupid
*  to draw in the casual viewer. And that's where YouTube is brilliant. Cause YouTube doesn't feel
*  the need to that. It can just, to do that. It could just cater for us nerds. Yeah. You know,
*  whatever you're into, YouTube can, can deliver it without someone from a network messing with it.
*  What's really spectacular about YouTube is there's only one YouTube. You think about how big the
*  internet is. There is in China though. Well, that's different. I'll tell you a good story about that.
*  I don't know. Eight years ago or so I was at the Geneva motor show, the biggest car event in my
*  world. And this Chinese guy comes up to me and he's like, really, really grateful. It's like,
*  so glad to meet you. I want to say thank you. I went, why don't you say thank you? He said,
*  because you've made such a difference to my life. I'm not the second coming. I don't know what I've
*  done to you guys because you know, I host all of your videos on a channel in China and it made me
*  loads of money. Sorry. Yeah. So I did a bit of research. He has, he's made lots of, he just,
*  he just took, you just rip them all off YouTube and host them. Wow. There's no regulation. Wow.
*  So he's just telling you, he ripped you off. But, but he had, but he thought he had no,
*  it wasn't like he had no shame. He couldn't even see what he'd done wrong. Right. Right. Thanks.
*  Well, China has Apple stores that aren't even Apple. Does it? Yes. China has full Apple stores
*  where they're selling counterfeit laptops, phones, everything. None of it is really out. I don't even
*  know if they do phones anymore, but it was all, they had Apple stores that Apple found out about
*  that weren't even, nothing was Apple. It's, it's creating content in the last 10 years has become a
*  really fascinating situation because I'm sure you felt the same when you started out. If you produce
*  something, you own it by definition. It doesn't matter whether you're within a network or have
*  you the international property in your head is that's mine. Right. And content producers over the
*  last five years have had to accept the fact that that is no longer the proposition. People can do
*  what they want. You cannot, you can't hunt them down. Right. And it's shameless. And I still get,
*  occasionally get engaged. I don't look at the Instagram message thing very often, but sometimes
*  I'll just see someone saying, I'm just going to post this. Do you mind? And sometimes I'll go,
*  well, yes, I do. I went out there at three in the morning. Right. I nearly crashed that car. I paid
*  for those rear tires. Right. Why should you get the chance to monetize that for your channel?
*  Exactly. What are you offering me? Right. Nothing. I just find it really odd. It's very odd.
*  Yeah. And it's also, they feel like they could just say a few things, you know, like, hey,
*  look at Chris Harris doing this. And that's enough. And also that's enough of an alteration
*  in their professional world. Can you imagine if one of them was an accountant and I walked in and
*  said, right, I've got my books. I can't add up. I'm really disnumerable. I'm an idiot. Just do those
*  for free with you because just do them. Yeah. Well, no, he'll say, I want some money for that. No,
*  no, no. I just, just do them. Just shut the fuck up and do them. So how does that know where the
*  world works like that? No, the content world is very strange. It's very strange where people can
*  use your stuff and do entire shows based entirely on your stuff. Oh, it's just extraordinary. But
*  the Chinese example was the best for me though. I love that. Well, the best is that he had no shame
*  about it. But actually he was doing nothing wrong. Culturally, they don't think there's anything
*  wrong with that at all. I mean, do you remember? I mean, you have to take the Chinese car industry
*  seriously now, but 15 years ago there used to be a sort of underground recess of the Detroit motor
*  show where the Chinese car companies would be. And it was a, it was a sort of, it was a grim
*  catacomb of, of imitation. So you'd go underneath and there'd be like their version of a BMW X5,
*  which was literally like someone had gone with a BMW X5 to draw one and done their own version of
*  it. They would just shamelessly copy stuff because there was no, there were no IP laws over there.
*  Culturally, they didn't acknowledge imitation. You just do what you want. I've, I reacted terribly
*  at the time. I sort of understand now that if you don't get that from the, from the age of one,
*  you can't learn it afterwards. Right. But they were shameless. And I can remember being again,
*  the Geneva motor show, you'd go to the, particularly the Japanese cars, and you'd
*  want to sit in the back of a new one. You couldn't, because there'd be Chinese engineers from car
*  companies measuring them there. Wow. It'd be like 20 minutes. They'd have these laser rules out going
*  just getting all the measurements of the interiors and of the engines and stuff. You could kind of
*  look at that. No, they'd be there for 20 minutes shamelessly just copying, scanning the car. Wow.
*  In broad daylight. It's amazing. They make incredible electric cars now though. Oh, they've,
*  they've stolen a march on everyone. China has made, they, they make some unbelievable cars.
*  I've watched some of them reviewed online. You can't even get them in America, but I watched
*  some of them reviewed online and they're just fucking fantastic. They are, they've definitely
*  had an advantage over Europe. I can't say for America, cause you have Tesla, which is, you know,
*  the only other global leader in that area, but the European car industry has been caught napping.
*  And it's a bit of a worry for someone like me that, you know, I'm very fond of a lot of the
*  European brands, but they're struggling. They're struggling to respond to this. There are boats
*  full of very impressive, very good value electric cars that have landed in Europe in the last six
*  months. There's also a problem with European cars in that European cars are always known
*  for having a great resale value. Yeah. Like particularly like Lamborghini and Porsche and
*  like Ferrari, you can actually make more money off of them in a few years than, but not electric
*  ones. No, that's the problem. Like electric Taycans, you know, those things are gorgeous.
*  That's an incredible vehicle. Good luck trying to sell that thing. Nobody, I saw Lucid airs,
*  which is a fantastic. Have you been in one of those? No, I haven't. Wow. I've heard the,
*  the heard the Sapphire is magnificent. It's extraordinary. You can't, you, you, you're going
*  to get like half the price of that thing. Yeah. In a year. Yeah. Fucking nuts. I know the Taycan
*  in America and industry in the UK early one, 30,000 pounds. Unbelievable. Someone paid 120 for that
*  three years ago. Crazy. It's still really good. It is. It's a very, again,
*  for particular people. Maybe the thing I, the point I didn't make earlier,
*  I have to excuse myself a bit jet lag for my confused thoughts sometimes is that the electric
*  car has one unspoken fact about it. It's for rich people. That's what I find quite difficult.
*  There's a meritocracy about the motor car that I find appealing is that you can have a
*  Bugatti Veyron or Chiron, or you could be some guy that lives in India. That's got a little thing
*  that costs a hundred quid or a hundred dollars. You ultimately getting the same thing. You have
*  the, you have the freedom to travel, to choose where you're going. And I think in a, in a,
*  I like you, I like to, I don't want to be told what to do. And I think it's really important
*  that that vehicle can take you where you want to go. But the electric vehicle is for rich people,
*  isn't it? You think about it. You show me the electric vehicle for normal people.
*  Well, it's terrible for people that live in apartment complexes. It doesn't exist.
*  Unless you have some sort of a charging station where you park your car and everybody has one,
*  so you could leave it charged overnight. It's rough. But look at the cost of them. Yeah.
*  Very expensive, terrible resale value. Yeah. It's, it's a very flawed concept at the moment,
*  but, but as you say, the performance of them can be your, your plaid is a great example.
*  It's a time machine. Yeah. It's a time machine. It really is. It merges the traffic silently.
*  Like it goes faster than anything. It doesn't seem real. It's incredible. And I'm sent the new one
*  that I'm getting, I'm sending to war. It's already sent to unplug performance. Are you aware of those
*  guys? So they tuned them to the, because it needs to be faster, doesn't it? No, well, they, they
*  changed the suspension. It does not any faster. Okay. They use the same powertrain, but they
*  change the suspension. They widen the front and rear and they just, they upgrade the brakes. They
*  make it much more just agile. I think the main thing it needs is some sort of a jet washable
*  pressure washable floor. Cause I think passengers will eventually shit kidneys out.
*  They're so fast. Yeah. Well, they're shocking roadster, which is going to be insane,
*  which is basically vaporware now. Didn't people like pay full price for those things like five
*  years ago? He's fascinating. I know he's been on your show. I don't know what to make of him. I
*  just love the fact that he's, he is the ultimate disruptor. Yes. He's come along. He's just,
*  he's seen an industry he's gone, that's ready for a shakeup. And he's had a go. And I,
*  with multiple industries. Yeah. That's what's crazy. But the one that's pertinent to me,
*  I'm the two questions I'm asked most are, you know, what do you think of the electric car
*  revolution and its effect on, you know, the environment, but also what do you think about
*  Mr. Musk? I almost don't really have an opinion on him. I just love, I just let him do what he does.
*  What I, what I do know is I'm always fascinated what he's going to do next. And that's, that's
*  all you need to know. And the stuff that he's produced 10 years ago, there were not many
*  Teslas on the road in the UK. Now they're everywhere. I don't know any other vertical
*  that's witnessed penetration like that. You know, if I walk into a white goods store, I'm not seeing
*  fridges made by companies I didn't even heard of 10 years ago, but there's the second most expensive
*  thing you'll ever buy as a civilian. And he's managed to have that level of penetration.
*  That will go down in the history books. Yeah. It's undeniable. Yeah, it's undeniable. And it's also,
*  he's doing that with rockets. And he's also doing that with the internet. Sorry, he bought X or
*  Twitter and turn it into X. And that's a massive disruptor. Do you do Twitter? Do you, whatever
*  it's called now? Yeah. See, I left it because I got so much abuse initially when I did Top Gear.
*  That's when I got, you know, you can't read comments. No, you can't. But then you'd, then
*  you'd get drawn into conversations. Oh shit. I was, and I actually leaving it was the best thing I
*  ever did at that time. And I haven't gone back because I didn't really need it to promote
*  anything. And it was the toxicity was long before he bought it for me. The toxicity is just an
*  inherent quality of people being able to post anonymously. You're never going to get away from
*  that. Yeah. But you just don't read it. That's the most important thing. Like people are always
*  going to, if you're a public figure, people are always going to have opinions of you. And there's
*  a lot of shady people out there and they're the most vocal and they're the most persistent.
*  Let them talk. Do you think in 50 years time, you won't be able to post or comment without your
*  identity being revealed? I hope that's not the case, but probably. Yeah. I think they would like
*  to do that in America. Yeah. You know, but I think it's important for whistleblowers. It's important
*  for, you know, people that work in an organization and they want to expose corruption. They want to
*  expose something. They want to expose some illegal thing they're doing in regards to the environment.
*  It's very important. You have to have people. They want to expose the government. It's very important
*  to allow people to be anonymous. When you're, when you're in a dark place, as I was 18 months ago,
*  you can feel that very pertinently. There was a lot of very unkind things said about Andrew's
*  accident and Top Gear afterwards. And I did want, I thought to myself, all those anonymous keyboard
*  worries, fuck you. I was, and you know this, I was almost at that state, which is the ultimate low,
*  the Kelvin of, of, of human behavior, which is I'll meet you in that car park so we can have a fight.
*  You know, you know how bad that is. I couldn't do it as well as you, but when you step back from it.
*  Yeah, but I'm, I don't engage in any of that stuff. I don't read negative things and I don't engage
*  in it. It just, I, I'm not afraid of it. I just, I know what it is and I don't like it. I don't
*  think it's necessary. I don't think it's good for you. I don't think anybody gets any benefit out of
*  it. I don't think the person gets benefit out of you calling them a cocksucker. I don't think you
*  get any benefit out of calling them a cocksucker. I don't think it helps. And I just look at it. I
*  do what I call post and ghost. I post things and I go away and I don't care what happens in the
*  comments. And, and also I'm very aware of bots. I'm very aware because we've done a lot of research
*  and research. We've done a lot of, we'd have a lot of conversations and done a lot of reading
*  about the amount of content that's on, especially Twitter, that's not organic. And it's an
*  extraordinary amount. It's there's an FBI analyst that estimated it to be in the range of 80%.
*  80% of all the accounts he thinks are bullshit and they're used to promote specific narratives.
*  They used to argue and shame people. They're used to attack certain political figures and
*  public figures. And, and then that conversation becomes completely changed because there's a swarm
*  of people that have a very specific narrative. And then the casual person read that, well, maybe
*  they're right. Okay, this guy is a piece of shit. I always thought I was a nice guy. And then it,
*  everything changes and just don't engage. Don't it's, I'm interested in reading people
*  when they're toxic opinions sometimes, but oftentimes I'll go, that doesn't seem real.
*  And then I'll go to their account and sure enough, they have 39 followers and it looks like
*  they're probably in, you know, fucking Russia somewhere and a troll farm. And it's not a real,
*  the pernicious side to it is like all the aspects of life that we know are bad and we shouldn't go
*  there. Be they alcohol or, you know, relationships, whatever it is. If you're, if you're in a bad
*  place, you're susceptible. And that's what, that's what I, I find very difficult about
*  that side of the internet. Sure. If you're in a bad place, especially you after that accident,
*  it's a magnet. It's like, it's just there. It's the crab with its claw open. You're like,
*  I'm everything's saying, don't put your finger there, but you do. I don't. I, I, and I did very
*  briefly. I'm very glad actually I'd actually left Twitter before then, but I was very,
*  I couldn't believe some of the heartless comments that were made afterwards.
*  It's cause they're not there. It's like, it's a very inhuman way to communicate. We're communicating
*  in text to a person that you're not, you don't see their face. You don't look in their eyes.
*  You don't feel the pain of what you're saying to them. It's not the way human beings are meant to
*  communicate with each other. We were meant to communicate with each other like this. I know
*  that's one of the reasons why podcasts are so successful. And one of the reasons why I only do
*  them with people in the room also, it's cause the only person I've done without that recent
*  and recent times, Edward Snowden for obvious reasons, but you don't want to, that's, that's
*  not a good way to communicate. It's not even a good way to communicate with your friends through
*  text message. You want to be there talking. So the person says something and go, Oh, okay, I get it.
*  So you, so how, why did you think that?
*  And then it's the cadence of conversation and also the quality of silence and the way that
*  you respond. And actually I'm now going to say something terrible. My podcast is done over zoom,
*  but it's the same voices every week. So people become used to the cadence of conversation and
*  they can actually, they can, I do believe relate to it for the comments. Confirm that.
*  Well, there's nothing wrong with doing podcasts over zoom. The problem is with guests.
*  Exactly. It doesn't work with guests.
*  Yeah. It doesn't work with you can do it, but I know people that do it with guests and they're
*  fine. They just, they adjust and they're very good podcasts. I listened. My friend Duncan does a lot
*  of people through zoom and they're great. They're great conversations. But if you had, if you had to
*  sit down and speak to a room full of young people about how to manage third party opinions of you
*  on the internet, what would you say to them? Just ignore. Yes. Yeah. Well, you have to be
*  self-assessing though. You can't be a person that is clueless about how other people see you.
*  Yes. Because that's not good either. So you have to be a person who's objective and introspective
*  and you have, you have to be able to honestly assess whether or not what you've done is good
*  or bad. And we've all done good things and we've all had bad work. And when you put out bad work
*  and you know, it's bad, just, just accept the fact that it's bad, feel that pain grow because of it,
*  use it as fuel to be better in the next thing that you do. And that's it. But don't wallow in
*  other people telling you, you suck or other people attacking you. There's no benefit.
*  There's another side to that that I've, I had to teach my other co-hosts on this podcast. You
*  weren't from a media background at all. I've, I personally believe that to ignore the negativity,
*  you can't wallow in the positivity either. I just think you don't have the right to just pick and
*  choose what people say about you. You can't just absorb the nice stuff and ignore the bad stuff.
*  That's just as bad for you because then you're like, oh, I'm pretty fucking amazing. Like,
*  you know, that's bad for everybody too. That's not good. Nobody benefits from being told they're
*  amazing. You know, if you did something that's good, so congratulations, you worked hard,
*  you put out something that's good, leave it alone. Keep moving. Keep moving. Yeah. Don't,
*  don't read all that positive shit and blow your head up. And that happens to a lot of people.
*  They get like enamored. It's called audience capture. And you see it. One of the things that
*  happens, particularly with comedians, you see, especially if they start getting involved in
*  political comment, commentary, they, they start getting audience capture. Like you see a lot with
*  people who lean right because there's not as many right wing voices on the internet. You get
*  a tremendous amount of support. All these people say, you're, you're the only one out there
*  speaking the truth. And like, and they are speaking the truth. And you start believing that
*  bullshit. And then you change your perspective. Yes. Audience capture. Yes. Yeah. That's dangerous
*  too. Yeah. When you're, when you, you're becoming conditioned by the environment you're in without
*  realizing it. Exactly. With an output on, with a segue back to the BBC, I've seen that with,
*  with that network I work with, I think there's a lot of high quality people that work at the BBC
*  and I, and at the moment they're under a lot of pressure and everyone's took everyone's judging
*  them as individuals within the organization. I think the organization is that environment is,
*  is almost impossible to work in now and it's changing them. They almost have nowhere to go.
*  Well, they're also, it's like, it's an unhealthy relationship in the first place,
*  because you have executives and producers who want to make a thing, but they're not the talent.
*  And so they're also not the experts. So they have their own ideas and they have to have some sort
*  of an impact on it to justify their position. So you see people having ridiculous suggestions
*  that everybody has to entertain because Bob is an executive. Okay. Bob is the fucking co-producer.
*  We've got to listen to Bob and Bob's got some stupid fucking idea that you have to hear out.
*  And if you say, Bob, it's not going to work because of this. Now you're in an argument with
*  Bob and Bob's mad at you. And would you ever make television again? No, no done. I've just finished
*  something for the BBC, which this podcast is going to be, he's going to put the catamount
*  to the pigeons. So I've got one thing I've just done with the BBC, which is not car related,
*  which will be my last thing I've done for the BBC. Probably. I did it with Paddy. I loved it. It was
*  actually about wellness and trying to, you know, which is a word I fucking hate. It's not even a
*  word. It's like mindfulness. I can't believe I just said it. So I apologize to you. Wellness and
*  mindfulness have both been captured spirituality as well. Basically it's about, it's about me being
*  having let myself go. I'm a shit. I let myself go. I'm a bit better now, but you should have seen me
*  a year ago. Oh, and I, and we've gone off and done three one hour shows about, you know,
*  was that in as a response to, yeah, yeah, yeah. I just, I sat, I sat and I drank
*  world-class quantities of single malt. I had made, I had, I like, I like a single malt and I had
*  built up a nice little collection, you know, a really nice little collection. I was quite,
*  I was quite disciplined. I'd pour myself, you know, a beautiful Glenn Farkless 25 and I'd,
*  I'd enjoy it. And I put it away. I did that collection in the first month after the top
*  gear incident, the whole lot gone. Oh wow. And then I, then I slipped into the full, you know,
*  it was terrible. Alcoholism. Yeah. And I, and I, and I, I don't look back on it as being, I now
*  realize how bad it was, but I'm a bit of a box ticker. Like you have to, you can't talk about it
*  unless you've done it. I've done it. So that was the box you wanted to tick. Let's try being an
*  alcoholic. I didn't want to, but now I've done it. I get it. I get it. And I, you know, and I also,
*  I was doing a weekly podcast. My, my sort of decline was quite publicly documented and some
*  people saw it. Some people didn't, but I'd sometimes, someone would, I'd see someone say,
*  is he all right? And I'm like, no, he really fucking isn't. Where was I with that? But, but,
*  but I do think that the, yeah, that the, the, if you start going down that route, it's a problem.
*  It really is a problem. Yeah. It's a real problem. I should say mindfulness wellness. What are the
*  words that wellness is worse than mindfulness? They're both the same to me. We went to, so this
*  show we did, all right, and this is, I'm not promoting it. It's just, it was interesting
*  because I like cars and the BBC had me, all I wanted to do was present stuff about cars.
*  And this organization decided to send me off to go to Sweden to see what it's like, why they have
*  a good quality of life. I know they do. I've got a lot of Swedish friends. I've been to Sweden. It's
*  a fucking great place. It was, it was an amazing experience. I loved it, but it didn't involve cars.
*  I want to be making shows about cars. That's what I love doing. I'm getting anything else.
*  That's the difference between being hired and doing your own thing.
*  There you go. And I'm grateful for it. And I think there's some really entertaining television,
*  although we missed out one bit. You talk about having to drink donkey semen.
*  Yeah. There's a, there's a clip from this show that's, that doesn't make it, but I'm given this
*  substance to drink by this guy who's got an impish grin. I'm like, and I'll do,
*  I'm that guy that'll eat most things. You know, if you've filmed Top Gear and you've been around the
*  world, you've eaten stuff you shouldn't have eaten. And as long as you've survived, isn't that the box
*  ticked? You know, I never thought I'd eat a sheep's rectum. I, but it's fine. It's a bit chewy.
*  But I was given this, this vial of liquid and I drank it and it tasted a bit like a really
*  peaty single malt. Imagine an Ardbeg that's like really peaty. I was like, cool. And on the label
*  it said beaver. I was like, okay, what's that? And I, and I, this Swedish guy said it's a, yeah,
*  it's a essence of a beaver that we make liquid alcohol with. So you flavor like a shine with
*  beaver because it was strong. And he went, he sort of fudged it and moved on. I was like,
*  it was strong. It was, the flavor was in my mouth. I couldn't get rid of it.
*  Transpires. This is a secretion from the anal gland of the beaver. So I ate beaver ass. I drank it.
*  I was, I, so someone milked a beaver. Oh boy. I drank it. Wasn't that bad. What's the benefit
*  of this? Supposedly it has some quality. It does. And you know, if you see the average Swedish guy
*  walking around, you'd all have some of that beaver juice. If I look at it, I don't think they're all
*  drinking it, but I think some of them drinking. I think so. Really it's popular over there.
*  It was, it's for sale. It's fresh. I tell you what happens if you get a tainted one. Here it is.
*  Tales from the fringe beaver gland vodka. Wow. So that's the beaver's butt right there. And it's a
*  gland in the vodka. 10 days later, I was in Japan doing some other work and I, I remember my host
*  saying, what do you think to that food? And what I wanted to say to them was I can just taste beaver
*  ass. 10 days later, my olfactory system such as it is, was only registering beaver. For 10 days?
*  Every food I ate tasted of beaver. Did you try to like wash it out with alcohol? I tried everything.
*  Wow. It's an incredibly pungent. What about fire spinning? Uh, I didn't do that.
*  I must try that. I was thinking, how did you burn it off? I don't know. You'd have to just get a new
*  head. Wow. So it eventually just dissipated. It did disappear. After 10 days you still had it. It was
*  still there. You know, when it's just there as a sort of residual taste. I would have been so upset.
*  Yeah. You motherfucker, you ruined 10 days worth of meals. But also when I found out it hadn't made
*  the cut, I was like, come on. That's not, I went through the voiceover and it's not in. That's so
*  crazy. But I, I wellness as a concept is, is something that I, as a word, I hate and I'm,
*  I'm proud of the show that will come out at some point, but I, but I'm, I like cars. I want to make
*  shows about cars and I will go, of course I will go back to the internet. Um, and I will. That's
*  where you belong. You belong doing your own thing. Chris Harris on cars was awesome. We might bring
*  it back. Yeah. I've got some, we've, we've made some films and I'm going to give it another month
*  and then we'll give it another go. Well, a bunch of people were trying all these different things.
*  Like they were trying to monetize it. So you had to subscribe online or to access the content.
*  We did that. This doesn't work. Doesn't work. You lose 99.9% of people. There's too much good stuff
*  for free. Yeah. People have, that's another thing. We come back to that idea of this Chinese guy
*  going, thanks for educating my children or whatever I'd done. There is no monetary value
*  placed on content. Now there's a few firewall systems that work. I think New York times and
*  the times in the London times works. I pay for that. And I think they make money works barely,
*  but it's, they've had to work so hard. They have been diminished greatly by the,
*  the lack of people wanting to buy paper newspapers. Yeah. It's been a big impact on them. It also
*  changes the way they do journalism because now everything's very click baiting,
*  which is a real problem as well. But the expectation is that content is now free.
*  Right. Yeah. How many listeners would you lose? Do you think if you put a paywall up for this?
*  Well, I lost 50% when I went over to Spotify. Did you? Yeah. Initially. Yeah. We lost like half,
*  but we got it back pretty quickly. Yeah. Yeah. I think the way that we relate and interact with
*  content is fascinating. It is. There's an ever bigger appetite. These devices mean that the
*  immediacy means that there's, there can never be too much content. I was pointing that out when I
*  first saw you here, that you have the tiniest little iPhone, the little baby mini that they don't
*  even, my friend Yoni has one of those too. I admire it. I admire that you didn't even have a
*  case on yours, which is even crazier. Well, the iPhone's a funny thing because it's, it's a bit
*  like a steering wheel in a car. That's your contact point. Right. It was designed to feel
*  brilliant. And the iPhone with that metal ridge is one of the most pleasing objects you'll ever
*  pick up. So why put a condom on it? I don't, I want it to break. I want it. It's made out of glass.
*  It's still working. And I want an unsheathed phone. Also, mine has a nice little kickstand.
*  Look at this. Oh, what's that? Yeah. Oh, so you could, yeah, okay. Yeah. When I'm sitting
*  at the kitchen table. But when I sit down, when I get in a car, I don't want something on my steering
*  wheel. I judge people so harshly when I get in their car and they have some stupid fucking thing
*  on their steering wheel. I'm like, what is wrong with you? Who are you? Do you wear mittens on top
*  of that? You fucking idiot. What are you doing? I've come here briefly for two reasons. One,
*  because I want to be on this podcast, see you. The other thing I've come to do in this state,
*  and I'm going to need some help with this. I'm not here for much longer is I saw a bumper sticker
*  advertise that I think is the greatest bumper sticker ever created. And it simply says,
*  Texas is bigger than France. That's it. The statement. And it's for sale online. I've got
*  eight hours now to go and find it before I fly back. But I have to get this bumper sticker.
*  Oh, we get you one. It says, it literally just says it's a statement. It is the greatest statement
*  made by any state or county. It's quite a bit bigger than France, isn't it? Where is it? Yeah.
*  Yeah. Okay. I just love it. Look at that there. Yeah, it's kind of funny. It's brilliant. And I
*  want that. I haven't, I have a- But really, we were talking about this at the beginning before
*  we got rolling, but it really is its own country. Yeah. It's very different than the rest of the
*  country. Yeah. It's very independent. And one of the reasons is the history of this place. Like,
*  for the longest time, the Comanche dominated this territory and you couldn't get across the land.
*  And so the people that eventually figured out how to fight off the Comanche and settle down,
*  they're the craziest, most rugged individuals ever. It's the Texas Rangers. They figured out
*  how to cold camp. And there's a photograph of Jack Hayes, who's the original Texas Ranger,
*  out in the lobby. And that's why he's there. Like, without those psychopaths that figured out a way
*  to fight off the most ferocious band of Indians that ever existed in the plains, no one would be
*  here. So they were very reluctant to join this whole union thing. Like, what the fuck are you
*  talking about? Also, they've been conditioned to become animals, you know, to be extreme fighters.
*  Once they've, once their battle's finished, they don't stop being fighters. Right. Well,
*  it just flavors the independence of the entire state and the pride of the state. It's very-
*  How does Austin fit into that? Because I think it's viewed as this center of cosmopolitan life
*  within a state that's known to be a bit different. So how does that work?
*  It's good. It's a balance. So Austin is this preposterous, progressive blue city that's
*  surrounded by ranchers with guns. So there's a saying, keep Austin weird and surrounded.
*  And I think that's accurate because you've got a lot of, you have universities here,
*  you have some really intelligent, interesting people here, great restaurants, great nightlife.
*  But also you're surrounded by Texas, Texas, the real Texas, the majority of Texas is like
*  ranchers and small town people and they're heavily armed.
*  That's the thing about being an English person, sorry, a British person.
*  The gun thing is totally foreign to us. I'm not going to offer any opinion at all other than say
*  that it's just foreign. It really is. And at times, I'm sure people in the UK would quite like to feel
*  the security of having that about them. But it's amazing driving around here as a British person
*  thinking that person in that car has almost certainly got a gun. Yeah, almost certainly.
*  We don't have that. Well, we also have the First Amendment and you see the consequences of not
*  having the Second Amendment in the UK because they can tell you we're going to lock you in jail for
*  a Facebook post. And you can't really do that here. You can't just force people to go to jail.
*  That was an issue also in Australia. In Australia, they took everyone's guns away after one mass
*  shooting, I think in the 1990s. And they were able to round people up and put them in camps when they
*  found out they had a cold. It was crazy. You can't do that in America. The Second Amendment
*  protects the First Amendment. Maybe what's transpired for me, having traveled here so
*  many times and worked here so often in the last 25 years, is that because we speak the same language
*  and we all look quite similar, we assume our countries are really, really similar, but they're
*  not. They're really quite different. We have a real caste system over there. You have a class
*  system over there. And actually, they're both wonderful places. I love coming here. There's
*  something about all of the states I've visited that I love. And I have no strong opinions. Maybe
*  the older you get, I no longer have strong opinions really about the way other people live their lives.
*  That's what you do. I don't have any opinion about that at all really. It's what you do. It works for
*  you. And in the UK, we're different as well. The older I get, the more emoliant I become, I think,
*  about that. When I was younger, I would have had stronger opinions about that. But the way that
*  Texas operates is Texas' stuff. It's the way you do things. I have to be here a long time to fully
*  understand the layers of it, the nuances of it. And if you came to North Somerset, where I live,
*  there's aspects of it that look, because we speak the same language, that look like they're
*  straightforward, but they're not. Everything has subtleties, doesn't it? That's why I see it.
*  I think maybe to come back to some of the comments, it's when people become partisan
*  without any real information that we have problems. People always giving me their
*  fucking opinion about stuff when they haven't stopped to consider it. I'm not trying to dodge
*  issues here. You can probably tell I'm completely apolitical. I just don't like politicians. I
*  don't care what side of the fence they sit on. I'm deeply suspicious of people that go into a career
*  of politics. As you should be. I don't profess to be on one side or the other. All of them
*  tend to be inexpert. I think the idea that we've created a system where you get promoted because
*  you're inexpert is ridiculous. And in my world, that manifests itself in transport. I've never
*  come across a transport minister in the UK that really has any idea what's going on or any interest
*  or even uses fucking transport other than being driven around. They're just bureaucrats. It's
*  ridiculous. So that's my position on it is I just sit there bewildered by what's going on. And maybe
*  maybe where I am a total soft cock is I don't have the spine to stand up and shout about it. But I
*  it's bizarre for me that we have inexpert people making decisions for us, hence our discussion
*  about electric cars. But also we have people that have the right to say whatever they want online
*  without having stopped to think of anything that they were talking about or to research what they're
*  saying. It's remarkable. But there's also this because of that because of there's these shitty
*  opinions and nasty people and all this information flowing around in bots and all this other stuff.
*  It makes you consider the nature of speech and it makes you consider like what it gives you a
*  choice. Do I choose to engage in this kind of stuff? Do I choose to read this kind of stuff?
*  Or do I just recognize it for what it is? Like I don't drink moonshine. If I don't go to the
*  if I go to the supermarket and there's a jug of moonshine, I'll go, well, I need to buy that and
*  start drinking it. No, I don't drink. I don't want it. I know it's there. I don't drink it. Right. So
*  you can choose to avoid the things that suck in life. You can. But through the prism of parenthood,
*  I've got three kids. I do as well. Yeah. I that's where it gets tricky. Yes. Yeah. And I don't know
*  whether you've you've probably experienced this as well. But when I was first on Top Gear,
*  there was a lot of hate flying around. And, you know, I was just hated because I wasn't Jeremy,
*  which is odd because Jeremy's one of my heroes. I think he's one of the greatest broadcasters out
*  there. I love Top Gear. And to suddenly be the enemy was really weird. I love what he did. I loved
*  his Top Gear. I was just trying to do my own Top Gear. And I just got shot on for it. But when my
*  children started taking heat for what I was doing for a living was very difficult. Yes, I found that
*  very difficult. Yeah. It's crazy that people go after someone's kids for a television show about
*  cars. Like what kind of a piece of shit if I was a political broadcaster or someone that was talking
*  about the NRA. I can understand it. I'm talking about the motor car. Yeah, exactly. Not the
*  football debt. It's a tote. It's ridiculous. But it doesn't matter. It's just shitty human beings
*  with bad lives. They want to go over your kids. Yeah. I tell you something. How about this?
*  Never said this publicly. I had a phone call one day from the from family home,
*  saying that my youngest child had been out skateboarding. It's a farmhouse. But now he's
*  me skateboarding on some little lane. When I heard that, I thought, why would he skateboard
*  there? It's really rough. He just fall over. But two people in a car had approached him
*  and said and tried to coax him into the car. It turned out it was two tabloid journalists that
*  were trying to get some dirt on me. But they tried to coax my child into the back of the car. Oh,
*  my God. And I agree with you that I want to be have a sensible view of this world we live in.
*  But when you've when you've experienced those things, or when you've had to sit down and speak
*  to your kids teachers about the awful things that are being said to them, just because their dad
*  happens to present a TV show, it does change you a bit. You don't come back from it completely.
*  Well, you recognize the real shit nature of some human beings. Yeah. And when you're confronted
*  with it, we're kind of always aware there's bad people in the world. But when you're confronted
*  with it over such a superficial thing, you're so right. So refreshing to hear you say that.
*  It's just a car. Yeah. Ideal in the least serious subject on the planet. Yeah. It's a motor car.
*  It's just being attached to that iconic name. That's all it is. And then also the way that
*  show was canceled because Jeremy punched a producer. Did you have to work with the same
*  producer Jeremy punched? No, he that guy had left. I met him once, shook his hand. I never
*  didn't know he was. Come on team Jeremy. Yeah. He's, he's, he's brilliant at what he does.
*  If he punched the guy, the guy probably sucks. Jesus, I'm not coming to you on that. I'm going
*  to get in trouble. But I, but I do. I've always, if no one's ever really asked me what I think of
*  Jeremy, he's just the best. He's quite a fucking character. And I shouldn't, I shouldn't have,
*  maybe I shouldn't have tried to follow him, but I wasn't trying to follow him. I think what I,
*  what I, I now realize I was trying to do is I was trying to be part of the solution.
*  I knew I could do the driving bit, but I thought the other people could, could carry off
*  the Jeremy bit. Right. And I now realize that's very difficult. Yeah. It's difficult to follow.
*  Yeah. You're not going to follow that. You're just going to be different. He's a completely unique
*  person. I think they did Elon dirtier than anybody ever did. Oh, they were naughty with that. They
*  did a terrible thing. They were naughty. They did a terrible thing. And I talked to him about it and
*  he was furious. They pretended that his car died and they did it for a sketch. And this is the early
*  days of Tesla when Tesla had just that little tiny car. That was basically a Lotus with an
*  electric engine. Yeah. All right. So that was called the roadster. That was the original roadster.
*  Yeah. The original one, which is a cool looking little car. And, um, they pretended that it died
*  on them and they did it for a sketch and they got away with it because it's entertainment.
*  And they were allowed to create a script. And apparently someone had got ahold of the script
*  and read in the script before they even filmed it. Then the car dies. And then we have to figure out
*  why the car died. So what kind of an impact do you think that had on the sales of his car? I mean,
*  how to be extraordinary. You're watching the most popular automobile show in the world and they say
*  your car sucks so bad that it died when they were testing it, when it didn't die. I'll be careful
*  what I say here, but without wanting to shatter anyone's illusions, that's the way those car shows
*  are made. That's the way a lot of reality shows are made. So ultimately you reverse engineer an
*  outcome. So you're being told this is what you're going to find. This is what's going to happen.
*  All we need to do is you got to help us get there. Now in reality TV, I can understand it,
*  but if you're reviewing a product, as you say, that tens of thousands of people make and they rely on
*  that thing selling for their livelihood, it's not- And you're just lying. You're lying. You're lying
*  about this car breaking. It did not break. One of the biggest problems on Top Gear for me was when
*  things didn't break. So often the producers, and I understand why, they'd want stuff to break. That
*  was the joy, particularly normally with the older cars we'd buy and mess around with. But actually
*  older cars are quite reliable now. You buy something and expect the engine to blow up. It won't.
*  Well, how many of those 1988 Toyota Land Cruisers are still on the road with hundreds of thousands
*  of miles? You try- Well, they did a brilliant film about that and they're trying to kill a
*  Land Cruiser and they just couldn't. Ended up dropping off a building and it drove away.
*  It's the cockroach of the car world. They're incredible. I have a 200 series Land Cruiser V8
*  diesel, 157,000 miles on it. I have an 80 series. They're brilliant vehicles. And actually I lobbed
*  a bomb on Instagram the other day by saying, I drive around in my Land Cruiser feeling sorry for
*  Range Rover drivers and I just got a whole lot of- I didn't read it. But I do think that
*  I have some sympathy for people that make television because they say don't work with
*  children and animals, but working with cars can be difficult. And one side of Top Gear that I found
*  unpalatable, not just the silly comedy bit, which I didn't like, was quite often you'd be given a
*  script. I'd be given a script and my review was in it. And I'd be like, well, I haven't driven it yet.
*  So this is the part where you say, it's great. But what if I think it's shit?
*  But I can understand why the producer and the director's thinking, well, we've got to get all
*  this packaged together. That's our hour there. That's our hour there. But we haven't stopped
*  to actually evaluate this thing we're supposed to be evaluating. And I have some sympathy
*  with people that make television because actually that bit's just- they don't care about that.
*  But for me, that's all that matters. I want to give an honest opinion of the car.
*  Well, that's where you shine and that's why you should only be doing things on your own.
*  I think I will after this.
*  Yeah. You know, fuck that wellness show too.
*  That's it. I have to take a leak. Let's come back. We'll take a little quick break.
*  Dogs in cars is a good subject. I love having my dog in the car.
*  My dog loves going in the car. He knows we're going to go do something fun.
*  The dog. So is it sensible to suggest that the dog is the ultimate car companion?
*  Sure. Because they're never upset.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. They're like, yay, we're in the car. It must mean we're going somewhere.
*  I love- so I've got a GT3 Touring 991.
*  You bring the dog in that? What kind of dog?
*  He's an English Bull Terrier.
*  How big is he?
*  Quite a size. But you know, he's on with the shark face. It just looks like he's going to kill you.
*  But all he'd do is lick you to death. He's a gorgeous animal.
*  And from the very- from as a pup, all dogs have access to all cars.
*  It's really important for me. If you've got-
*  Really?
*  If you have a car that's a million dollars, the dog's going in there.
*  Really?
*  For me, it's a sucker. It's close to religion for me. I love it.
*  Because for me, it's a demonstration of who I am. I want my things, I love the most,
*  to share the things I love the most. Right? So the dog goes in it. And I love patination on cars.
*  So my cars are known for being not that clean, let's say. They just live in them.
*  And you know the handle on a GT3 under the bucket seat, that lovely handle that you move,
*  it falls backwards. On mine, they're all chewed, where he chewed them as a puppy.
*  And I leave them like that. So when people get in, they go,
*  fuck, what was that? And I go, I don't chew that.
*  But the only time I've come to grief is that I now I'm very suspicious of switch gear that's
*  laid on the horizontal. Because I was on a slip road in an M3 of mine last year. No, sorry. No,
*  it'd be the GT3. And I came off a slip road and I accelerated, it was wet. And I thought I'd lean
*  on the systems, you know, when you just get that, you lean on the traction or the ABS.
*  And the car went fully sideways on a slip road in the middle of the day. And it looked outrageous.
*  I mean, that's what I'm quite good at. So I went, well, there you go, that's sideways,
*  wound it off again. The dog had put his paw on the ESP button. Oh, no. He had turned all the systems
*  off without me knowing. Oh, no. So now I'm aware of that. He's not allowed to do that.
*  Yeah, they shouldn't be right there. But I suddenly thought that's there. Oh, what a cutie.
*  That's in the back of the M5, the V10 M5. That's Pip Dog. Oh, that's nice. He's an absolute legend.
*  He is. But he's a great dog companion. No dog sickness. I just love going base with him.
*  As long as they're accustomed to it. That's the thing. When I have had dogs in the past that I
*  didn't take in cars often, you take them in the car, they're kind of freaking out. Why are we
*  moving? They start throwing up. But it's awful. I don't want to see a dog like that. No one's
*  seen animals stressed. And I have rejected cars because my dogs didn't like them. I had a thing
*  called a golf R estate. I'm not sure you got them over here, but they did a combi sort of station
*  wagon. There's a theme here. I love station wagons. Why do you like station wagons? I think long
*  roofs and curtailed asses look better. Really? Yeah. The three box thing doesn't do as much for
*  me. I like long down. I think they look gross. Yeah, I love them. I see them. I'm like, what did
*  you do to that fucking thing? So this is the new one. That's actually good looking. I bought the
*  old one. So you type in the click in 2015 golf R estate there. And I, any one of those. Yeah,
*  so I went and bought one of these. So that'll be good. And that's not, it's not too showy and
*  it'll do the job. And at that point I had my old dog boss, Vimarana, and I put him in the back
*  and he just got out again. I was like, he hasn't done that before. Put him in the back again.
*  And it was quite evident he did not like the car. I don't know why.
*  I didn't like the car because he didn't like the car. So I took the car back and the guy,
*  he saw it and said, what's the problem? I said, dog doesn't like it. And he went,
*  what? The dog, what do you mean? I said, well, the dog doesn't like it. I can't live with it
*  because the dog lives with me. So it goes. Absolutely. Yeah. No, the dogs are. What could
*  it possibly have been? Who knows? Dogs, dogs are, as we know, the most incredible things. We don't
*  deserve them. They are wonderful, but they see and they perceive things differently to us. He knew,
*  it could be that he didn't like the cologne that the German guy that assembled the boot
*  interior with, you know, dogs dogs offer opera level of perception. We can't even understand.
*  Right. So I, yeah, your fascination with bears, you know, could have, could a man
*  beat be beaten up by, could a man defeat a bear? I always love that. It's like, well,
*  what are you thinking of? I love, I often like walking around trying to think what my dog's
*  saying of a situation smelling. Oh, they must be smelling just so many different things. I know
*  they apparently can, if you have a hamburger that has like, um, cheese, pickles, onions,
*  ketchup, they can smell all the individual items in the hamburger. They smell everything. They have
*  like a reference of discernibility. Yeah. It's just very different than ours. So do they have
*  like terminate division? Is that red code going across and they're like,
*  because they have no language too. Right. So it's all on instincts, which is fascinating because,
*  you know, nobody taught my dog to pee on things. He just knows that you step, what's this peas on
*  it. You know, when I like take them on trails and he finds out where all the other dogs have peed,
*  like, Oh, I got to pee there too. But my, there's an emotional sensitivity to these animals as well.
*  That thing there, you just seen a picture of, I mean, it was bred to fight bulls and bears. That
*  was what it's bred to do. But if, um, let's just say that certain times in the month,
*  if my girlfriend is feeling down, my dog will go and cuddle her and sit with her all night
*  and provide heat to the part of her body that's in pain. He will do that consistently every single
*  time. He knows he just knows. He knows she's uncomfortable. Yeah. They're empaths,
*  especially when they really love you. There's something about them. Like my dog understands
*  language. Like he, he doesn't know just like, sit, give me your paw, lie down, stay. I bet
*  he knows tone. Yeah. He knows things like, like we could be going towards the house. I go, no,
*  let's go around the back. And he's like, okay, we're going around the back. Like he knows what
*  I'm saying. He's, it's like real subtle. I wonder if we over project on them. Cause when we were
*  discussing earlier about some of the, this sense of being just so disappointed about our fellow
*  homo sapiens, I over project onto my dog. The more I get disappointed by human beings,
*  the more I revel in dogs. Well, they're like human beings though, in that it depends on the life of
*  the dog. Like people get killed by wild dogs. Yeah. Like in Georgia, some couple recently was
*  attacked and someone was killed by wild dogs because the dogs are fending for themselves.
*  They live horrible lives. Now people that live horrible lives are shit people, right? They're
*  dangerous shit people. Whereas a dog like Marshall that said nothing but love and he's a gold
*  and retriever. He's bred that way. He's just a genuine joy. Yeah. Everyone he meets like,
*  you're my new friend. Everybody just assumes, you know, but you've met dogs are like, they see
*  people, they're sketchy. They're scared of men. They're, you know, those, maybe they were beaten.
*  They're a reflection of the environment. Exactly. Exactly. Those dogs are just like us. They're
*  just like us. You get a dog like Carl, Carl thinks everybody loves them and he just wants, everybody
*  wants to play. And that's what he does. He just runs up to you and tries to play because that's
*  his whole life. That's all he's ever experienced is being taken care of. I want some bear chat. So I
*  have, I'm slightly fascinated by these really large bears, big gritties. And I do find myself
*  sometimes at four in the morning when I can't sleep, Googling just the size of them, their
*  potential power, the potential statistics of what they can and can't do. Are they as inspiring as
*  I should think they are? Oh yeah. And beyond. Yeah. There's a great story that you can find
*  that's on YouTube. There's a clip of my friend, Steve Rinella, and he was on a Fog Nack Island
*  and they were elk hunting and they had shot an elk. And a Fog Nack Island is an incredibly
*  difficult place to traverse. The bush is dense and thick and the bears are enormous. A Fog Nack is
*  connected to Kodiak by a small land strip, I believe. It's certainly like right next to Kodiak.
*  I might be wrong about the one. I think it maybe used to be. I'm not sure. But the point is
*  they are coastal brown bears and coastal brown bears are the same thing as a grizzly bear,
*  but their diet is very different. So their diet is so rich in protein from salmon. They're enormous.
*  They could be 1800 pounds. They could be 11 feet tall. They're fucking huge. They're
*  preposterously big. And you can't imagine how big they are unless you really encounter them.
*  So my friend Steve, he was with a group of friends. They had shot this elk and he was filming it for
*  a television show called Meat Eater. They shot this elk and they put most of it up in the tree
*  and they carry some of it back to camp. And camp is six hours of trekking through the train.
*  So then they come back the next day. They trek six hours. They find the spot. They sit down and they
*  start eating lunch. They don't realize that a bear has claimed that meat. And so the bear
*  charged through the camp and one of the guys winds up on top of the bear. The bear barrels
*  through the people and this guy is literally riding the back of the bear for about 30 yards
*  before he falls off of it. One of my friends, my friend Yannis, it is gnashing its teeth about 18
*  inches from his face as it runs by. Now imagine a head this big. I mean the head is like this.
*  Like this. Enorm. I mean so big. Just impossibly big. And it's gnashing its teeth 18 inches away
*  from his head as it runs by. He hits it with a trekking pole. Like whacks it with a trekking
*  pole. The way Steve described it, he said the most reptilian part of your brain is ignited.
*  Where you no longer have like what should I do? There's no thinking in terms of, there's no
*  language. So in the flight, right. Full chaos. Terrifying chaos. No one had their gun in front
*  of them. No one knew what to do. They were all, like pistols were in the packs. Rifles were sitting
*  down over there. No one was prepared. No one thought the bear was there. They didn't understand
*  that it was there. Yeah. I think as a northern European, we're always fascinated by the shit we
*  haven't got. Right. And grizzly bears are up there with Chevy Suburbans. Most muscle cars. Honestly,
*  the idea of the other, the foreign, is really fascinating for any person that doesn't have that.
*  Sure. And same with Australia. You know, you go to Australia, it's a very different thing.
*  They have little shit that will kill you. Right. Spiders. You go there and someone will casually go,
*  yeah mate, that bites you. You're fucked. You're like, what do you mean? It's a spider. No mate.
*  Jesus. It's not like a big furry thing. Right. But in South America, it's big and furry.
*  It's whole presentation is, I'll kill you. Right. These ones are not quite like that. Right. So I do
*  have this fascination with this stuff. And again, that's why YouTube's great. Because as a kid
*  growing up, if you wanted to find out about this stuff, you couldn't really. You had to go get a
*  book or there was no VHS. You went to Blockbuster. You couldn't buy the documentary of grizzly bears,
*  could you? Right. You didn't get it. Right. Now it's all over there. But even a documentary is
*  not going to do it. You have to experience them. You have to actually be around one and see it.
*  So you have been up close with these things. I've only seen one grizzly bear in the wild and it
*  wasn't big. It was about six feet, but it looked at me so much different than any other animal that
*  I've ever seen. It looks right through you. Like, am I going to eat you? Yeah. So you were a food
*  source. Yeah. Are you a food source? Am I going to eat you? What are you? One of the best things
*  I've done with Top Gear was with Matt LeBlanc, who, as you can tell, I'm very fond of. He's just
*  great fun. But he had this idea around Bigfoot. So he's a believer in his own way. He's not a
*  believer, but he presents a really strong argument. I like people that, as you can tell, I shoot that
*  argument full of holes. But I like to apply tests to things. He's not a believer, but he likes to
*  apply tests. He said, stand in the Washington State forest and tell me that we know everything
*  that's in there. And if you come from a little island off Europe, the size of your forests are
*  awe-inspiring. And the idea there's so much stuff that we might not know about does interest me.
*  There probably at one point in time was something. That's what it really is. And there's an actual
*  animal called Gigantopithecus that existed alongside human beings that was an eight to
*  ten foot tall bipedal ape that lived in Asia and could have come across the Bering land bridge.
*  Yeah, it's possible. So there's also Native Americans have some enormous number of names
*  for these creatures, different tribes. So they don't have fake animals. They don't have a bunch
*  of dragons and stuff that doesn't exist. It's not a mythical creature. So I don't want to pitch
*  Matt into something. He's not some crazy believer. And actually the premise of the whole film was
*  fun. He was there going, I think there's something here. Let's go have a look for it.
*  And I was just acutely aware as we were in, we shot it in Northern California, so North San Francisco.
*  The forest at night is a sketchy place. It really reminds you of just how insignificant we are and
*  how vulnerable we are without our man-made objects to defend ourselves. And I, in the
*  context of that, a bear for me was terrifying actually. I just thought they were creatures I'd
*  seen on nature programs. There was something out there that viewed me as food. If you live in
*  England, we don't have that. We simply don't. We don't have mountain lions. I'm not going to eat
*  by a badger. I think the largest carnivore in the UK is probably a fox or a badger. We don't have
*  these things that you have. Difficult for you to understand. There's nothing that views me as a
*  food source. California killed all the bears, all the grizzlies. They used to have, well the
*  California state flag is a grizzly bear. And their bears were similar, I believe, in size to
*  coastal brown bears, the grizzlies, the brown bears that used to live there. And there's a place
*  in California called Leveque, there's a town called Leveque that was named after, I believe his name
*  was Steven Leveque. He was the last man to get killed by a brown bear in California before they
*  eradicated them. So this is in the 1800s, I guess. So they just started killing them all. They just
*  killed them. Fuck these things. They're killing everybody. Let's just kill them. You can sort of
*  see why. Oh yeah. A polar bear is even more madness again, isn't it? Oh yeah. Have you ever seen that
*  BBC show where they put the guy in the glass cube? Oh my god. I mean what was going on there?
*  That is so terrifying. The thing is just smelling meat inside that cube and trying to get through it
*  to get to him. It's biting it and you see its massive jaws and they don't eat anything but meat.
*  So they're the most dangerous of all polar bears and ironically they're the ones that we make seem
*  to be the cutest. This. Fuck that thing. How do you know that's going to work by the way? Did you try
*  that out on a bear? It looks like a shit X-wing fighter doesn't it from the inside? And this bear
*  just gets to it. It's like oh there's meat in there. How do I get to that meat? And we make those things
*  out to be our friends. You know, that's the, you know, what would you do for a Klondike bar? You
*  know they sell Coca-Cola, they sell Klondike bars and this bear is just a fucking super predator.
*  Baloo. Baloo was a bear. It's system. What's Baloo? Baloo? Jungle book. Oh yeah. The friendliest.
*  It's amazing isn't it that we anthropomorphize bears more than just about any other creature.
*  Yogi. Paddington bear. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Friendly, cuddly. I think because they do look quite
*  appealing and they are dog-like aren't they? They're slightly dog-like. Snout. Sure. Shape of head.
*  Well we put hats on them and shit. Only you could prevent forest fires.
*  And they want to eat you. Yeah they want to eat you. They want to eat anything that's slow. I mean
*  that's what they're there for. They're nature's cleanup crew. A friend of mine walked to the
*  North Pole for some reason. I don't know why. And he was and he had a lot of training before. And
*  this is a long time ago. But the polar bear training was that he talked about was quite
*  difficult to absorb really. Effectively it was that there was no there was no gun that you could
*  carry on an expedition like that if you're just on your own or with three other people with sleds.
*  Right. Nothing you could carry that you could immediately produce that would stop a polar bear
*  and add on a polar bear. So the best thing they had was a short shotgun that had a solid bolt,
*  just a solid bolt in it. And if you could get that one thing off you could stop it. But there's no
*  gauge of shotgun that was going to stop one of these things it was coming at you.
*  So they carried this thing. They carried this thing that had a solid bolt in it. That's all
*  he had. I don't know much about guns but that's what they said they were given.
*  There's some pistols that you can effectively unload into a bear and stop them. A 50 cal would
*  stop it would it? Yeah well sure a 50 cal. I don't have a 50 cal pistol but they have 40
*  magnums. 44 magnums. That would stop a bear. You have to shoot it multiple times.
*  Yeah not one and you know and like if you have a 38 or a 9 millimeter good luck
*  good luck. Is that just a like a bounce right off its head. Their heads are so thick.
*  You could literally shoot it in the forehead and it'd probably bounce off its forehead.
*  I mean they bite each other. You've seen them go to war with each other when they bite each other.
*  They have insane amounts of power and bite force and they're just clamping down each other's face
*  and they'll do it for half an hour walk away like it was nothing. Okay that versus a big gorilla.
*  That's a good question. We've had that question many times. What is it? I think the gorilla
*  is at a severe disadvantage because it doesn't really kill anything. Yeah so the gorilla just
*  gnashes its teeth at other gorillas and makes like he's a badass and they have incredible power but
*  they don't even eat meat. Whereas the bear all it does is run around killing things.
*  It's all it does. Kills things and eats dead things and that's what it wants to do.
*  I got my money on the bear. I love it. I love it. What I know about is cars and I'm here asking
*  questions about bears but well they're fascinating. It's a fascinating part of our world and it's all
*  the anthropomorphizing is a really fascinating aspect of it and I think in America it happened
*  with Teddy Roosevelt with the teddy bear. I think that's the beginning of the end and then
*  Disney movies were a huge problem. Disney movies are a huge problem because all the bears are your
*  friend. They all talk to everybody and hey and say why would you kill the bear? Like that is a giant
*  forest dog. That's an evil animal that it doesn't give a fuck about. You or your kids. It'll pull
*  you out of your tent. It'll eat you 100 percent and they're wonderful and they're beautiful. We
*  should definitely keep a healthy population of them. I'm not saying we should eradicate them
*  but know what they are and don't be influenced by these goddamn cartoons. Cartoons and movies
*  which have fucked people's heads up. Yeah it's as a parent you realize it as well particularly
*  in the UK we have you know we don't have dangerous species of animals like that but we do
*  through anthropomorphizing them in films and cartoons. We make things cute that might not be
*  cute. Sure. You know we have a real urban fox population in the UK and they actually started
*  in my hometown of Bristol. The fox is a clever creature and it worked out that it was much
*  easier to come into town and raid bins than it was to stay out there trying to find rabbits
*  in the countryside and these nighttime foxes would they were very clever. No one really knew
*  where they were they were there. The BBC made a fantastic documentary I think again Attenborough
*  in the early 80s about urban foxes and they've spread throughout the UK and the fox is this you
*  know in most cartoons it's a lovely cuddly thing with the bushy tail it's a beautiful colour
*  but they're you know they're predators. They're a real problem for farmers and they eat a lot
*  of poultry. I'm not even going into fox hunting that's not my world but there's been a few
*  stories recently of foxes going into people's houses and you know attacking babies and you know
*  stuff like that and you and then then you see on Instagram people feeding the foxes in their
*  back gardens and you think this that's not a domesticated animal. Yeah you can't do that.
*  You can't you know you've got to make it you've got to decide one or the other. Also if you feed
*  them then they become accustomed to getting food from that particular area and then you you kind
*  of fuck them up because then they lose their ability to hunt. Yeah. If you do it too often if
*  you provide them with food every day you're going to fuck them up. I've been I've just had my
*  holiday down in Newquay on the new north coast of Cornwall which is just one of the most beautiful
*  places on the planet and when you buy fish and chips from the fish and chips outlets they all
*  have a seagull warning now on the shop front saying when you buy your fish and chips protect
*  it because all the seagulls just dive bomb people. Wow. So you're it's it's like that scene in the
*  that Jurassic Park film where the pterodactyls are coming down. You've ever seen a seagull eat a rat?
*  Yeah. Hole. Hole. Just throw it down. They'll do it to pigeons. They'll do it to everything they can
*  catch. There's a wonderful Instagram clip and I'm admitting too much with my search history here.
*  I think it's a cormorant just being given like a black oily thing just being given fish and it eats
*  like five. Yeah I've seen that. You think that the volume of fish you've eaten there is greater than
*  the mass of your body. 100%. There's no way that I didn't think you could eat that. No there's so
*  many videos of like different birds throwing down a whole large mouth bass and it's like how is it
*  even getting in your mouth. It doesn't they have these skinny little necks and they swell up
*  and they have the fins popping out of the tails popping out of their mouth. Yeah they're pretty
*  extraordinary creatures and they're essentially dinosaurs. And actually to come back to the content
*  discussion YouTube whatever it is I do love the fact it's all out there. Yeah. I love the fact
*  it's being recorded. I had never seen this stuff. I've got a particular phobia and it is a phobia.
*  I hate crabs and I'm not talking about the STD style. I'm talking about crustacean. Why?
*  I think they're horrid to look at. I think I don't eat I won't eat them. I'll eat all other seafood.
*  I'll eat all other seafood but I won't eat a crab. You'll eat lobster? Yeah. How weird is that? So
*  insight into the the addled brain. I hate the crab. I also think it's a totally unnecessary
*  looking creature. They're so delicious though. You love them. Everyone I know loves them. My
*  children adore them but if there's a big brown crab on a plate I can't even sit in a room with it.
*  Really? Fuck off. Just an awful thing. Also and this is a good example right in the pantheon in
*  the pantheon of hateful aesthetics right. Right. You have a you have an exoskeleton. So you so
*  you're inside out. You this thing or someone or something has decided that's going to be inside
*  out. So it has it has a shell to protect its soft right cuddly and as you described delicious innards.
*  Why would you make that exoskeleton hairy? That's unnecessary. It's also disgusting. This thing has
*  hairs growing out of a shell. What? That's the worst aesthetic of anything. Well very lucky they're
*  small. It's also interesting that people they catch them and snap their claws off and throw them back
*  in the water because their claws will regenerate and they'll grow another claw. That's from a film.
*  That's not real. No it's real. No it shouldn't be allowed. In other words it should be fiction.
*  Right. That's from a horror movie. Type in coconut crab. Oh yeah those are crazy. They're huge.
*  Like anything that you're scared or you're fascinated by it. Someone did a someone did
*  some research into the claw bite force of these things and they were absolutely shocked at the
*  torque and power they could generate. Look at that guy holding one. You get a perspective. What is that?
*  Size of that thing. What is that? Come on that's unnecessary isn't it? Well um. So type in type in
*  claw strength of coconut crab and you will be absolutely horrified at what they found. Wow
*  look at the size of that thing. They are freakish. Where do they live? They live on a couple of islands.
*  3,300 newtons.
*  That's so nuts. That could take your hand off. Oh yeah. Wow. The bite of mo- it's stronger than
*  the bite of most land animals including leopards, bears and wild dogs. And it looks like something
*  from a horror movie. Do you know there's some speculation that that's what the fate of Amelia
*  Earhart was? Yes. So when I read that I just. Yeah. That she crashed, got on this island and the coconut
*  crabs ate her. That's insane. I mean luckily I think they clamp slowly. They don't. Yeah but more
*  than a leopard. What the fuck man. So what is that thing biting through? Is that metal? Oh they're
*  just horrendous. There's that lovely guy on Instagram who's a fisherman who does the experiments
*  with the lobsters and he gets the lobster crushing claw and he puts stuff in the claw and works out
*  what they can chop in half. I find that thoroughly addictive. But crustacea like that, that's my
*  ultimate nightmare. It's a hard life. It's a hard life for them you know. Yeah. Like and you can't
*  make them pets. No. That's how they're wired. But the stats of that, so stronger than a leopard bite.
*  That's so- I would have never imagined that. I would have never guessed. No and I stay up at
*  night worrying about this sometimes. There's something called the Japanese with a giant spider
*  crab. So when I used to go on holiday as a kid was this lovely old sort of Victorian style hotel in
*  Cornwall. It was run a bit like 40 Towers. In fact it was like 40 Towers. Had the guy that run it that
*  was the curious guy that made lots of jokes that people found a bit rude but he was wonderful.
*  And they only had about three magazines in their very smelly lounge area where all the old people
*  would sit. And one of them was a National Geographic magazine from about 1975. But I'd always
*  sit and read when my parents were doing other stuff. And it had an article about Japanese
*  giants, these giant spider crabs. And there was just one picture of one in a tank with with its
*  legs like seven feet apart or something. Well let me see this. It stayed with me. It stayed with me
*  for years. I was reading about these crabs. I walked into the crabs. Giant spider crab. Okay.
*  Spider crab. Japanese spider crab. That's where these are from too. Giant spider crab. Oh the
*  coconut crabs are from Japan as well? Giant spider crab. I can't believe I'm sharing all this.
*  Crabs are a huge problem for me. They really are. My children know. Look at this. What's that? Wow.
*  Are those things, do they taste good? Look at that. Are the coconut crabs delicious?
*  I don't think, I've never heard of anyone eating a coconut crab. I wonder why.
*  Look at that one in the pool. Jesus Christ. That's insane. That's so big. I had no idea that
*  there was a crab that's longer than a human being. Absolutely disgraceful thing. Can you eat a Japanese
*  spider crab? Oh I think you do. It looks like they got them on ice. So it looks like they're
*  preparing a Japanese spider crab is no easy task. You gotta find a big pot. Yeah right. You gotta
*  break it up I guess. Wow. Now what about, find out about the coconut crab. Can you eat coconut
*  crabs? I might want to eat one. I'm gonna send you a picture if I get one. I'll be glad to see
*  that it's no longer moving. I just cannot get my head. Can you eat them? I won't. Yes. It says
*  above that. An aphrodisiac. Oh but look it says, yes coconut crabs are eaten as a delicacy on some
*  islands and are considered an aphrodisiac in other places. Some say they're tasty and don't need any
*  extra seasoning or cooking and can be eaten after boiling for about 10 to 15 minutes. However,
*  the species is threatened by intensive hunting. Oh poor babies. They ate a mili-airheart. Who's
*  fucking side are you on? I was reading they don't have shells. That's why their claws are like
*  their protection. Oh. And they mostly on one island only eat other crabs. Oh wow they're
*  cannibals? Yeah. Like they eat red crabs I guess. Oh they eat other crab. Well we mostly eat other
*  animals and we're animals. Dearie me. Well I've shared too much there so that's my ultimate fear.
*  Crabs. I can remember several times we'd be asked on Top Gear when we were going away, you know,
*  are you okay with everything? And I'd be thinking I'll do anything. I'll eat my own feces but if
*  there's crabs there I've got problems. And only once did we go somewhere where there was,
*  we had to go there, we were just in Cuba filming the opening for this film and we were in Bay of
*  Pigs. So we were actually there. We were right there with a Maserati and an old Camaro filming
*  this intro to a film. Totally random. What is it like being in Cuba? I'll give you that in a minute.
*  Okay. And I was so punch-drunk with just travel and filming that I'm working so hard
*  I would almost just wake up and go it's another mad place. I were in Kazakhstan today.
*  Right. Okay I will get on with it. And looking back I was in Kazakhstan for 10 days with Matt
*  LeBlanc from Friends. That's a mad thing to do. That's pretty mad. You know? But at the time it
*  was just like work. And I was in Bay of Pigs and I looked at my phone I thought this is the Bay of
*  Pigs. Fucking hell. You know this is where you know this is where it all went a bit wrong for
*  America. This is historically quite a significant place. It's gonna be a real problem. Yeah.
*  Anyhow and I look I'm looking around and there's lots going on and I look left. I'm filming the
*  opening piece to camera which was typically bad for me. But the reason why it was really bad was
*  I looked left there was a crab down there shuffling around and I'm like I need that
*  gone. But I can't admit to people that that that big is worrying me. That's really worrying me.
*  I'm thinking that's going to crawl up my leg. Something totally irrational. I think we all have
*  a creature maybe. A bogey man or a bogey woman whatever it is that maybe we fear. Do you have one
*  or not? No but I think where that comes from I have a feeling it's genetic memory. I think that's
*  where aphidiophobia comes from and arachnophobia fear of snakes and spiders. I think because some
*  people we've experienced we experienced that on Fear Factor as well. Some people have a real it
*  seems like a genetic irrational fear of certain things. And I really feel like that is some memory
*  from either an ancestor getting bit or seeing someone get bit and die. I think there's something
*  to that. There's a reason why it exists in some people and not in others. Because it can't be
*  completely irrational. Right. No I think it's I think it's completely a genetic memory. That's my
*  number one guess. Cuba was fascinating because I suppose as American citizen you can't go there
*  can you? Can you go there now? I think you used to be able to go there. I think during the Obama
*  administration they made it so you can go there. It's an amazing place because it's one of the few
*  which is kind of crazy your government can tell you can't go somewhere like five. Yes
*  and someone that's so close to you as well. Exactly you can go there on a rowboat. It's a
*  museum is what it is. It's a fully functioning museum. For automobiles. For life in many ways.
*  You know it's not something that's been allowed to develop the way that a country should have
*  developed over the last 40-50 years. Right. So you have a society that has limited technology
*  and has evolved the way that it does. And then you see how resourceful human beings can be
*  with reference to the automobile. Yes it's fascinating because there's really
*  it's a strange mashup of weird Soviet intervention and Americana from the 50s and well up to 50s.
*  So they kept these American cars going that should have died. They've also got a whole
*  load of Soviet era ladders that came in when the Russians wanted to help them out. And also that's
*  where their power stations come from. Their power station they have a coal-fired power station on the
*  north side of the island that when it's operating has a plume of smoke that goes as far as the eye
*  can see. I mean it's an amazing thing. I couldn't believe it. It's sort of slightly hidden from all
*  the tourists. Yes it's a country that hasn't been allowed to develop at the same speed as the rest
*  of the world. And it's what 100 miles from the coast of the US or something. I mean it's 90.
*  It's amazing. It's well worth visiting if you can go just to see it. It just shows you what happens
*  when human beings act absurdly. Did you feel safe over there? Totally. Yeah totally safe.
*  In many ways I loved it. In many ways I wouldn't want to go again. It's one of those curious
*  places where I thought I've seen the right side of it. Have I scratched too deeply? Am I going to
*  see something I don't want to see? Maybe that was it. Well you certainly will. I mean there's a
*  reason why people are escaping there. Yeah of course. They're trapped. They're trapped in a
*  communist dictatorship. It's not good. But as a tourist you obviously presented something
*  completely contorted aren't you? That's what happens when you're making a tv show. It's also
*  a communist dictatorship that's in a very unusual predicament because they're not allowed to trade.
*  Right? So China is a communist dictatorship but we buy everything from China. They're arguably worse
*  than Cuba but we're not allowed to trade with Cuba because some shit that happened in the 60s.
*  But Cuba can sell stuff to other countries other than America. So you know we're full of their
*  cigars and their rum. But not America. I think you can get them now in limited quantities but
*  it used to be if you got a hold of Cuban cigars you would I would get them. I'm going to tell
*  you a thing I did that was illegal. I used to get them from England and I used to get Cuban cigars.
*  I had a friend who lived in England and he would send me Cuban cigars and then later he would send
*  me the labels. So he would send me the cigars with no labels like in a like a ziplock bag.
*  Send me a few cigars and then he would send me the labels in an envelope a couple days later.
*  The pollution in Havana was the worst I've ever experienced of a city. I think when the wind
*  changed that power station just blew straight over. Well there's a place was it in Indiana
*  where there's three coal fired power plants and if you go outside you can run your finger over
*  someone's windshield and you have black coal dust on your finger. And all these people in that area
*  have all sorts of weird fucking diseases because they're just breathing in particulates every day.
*  We went to one of the best things I did with Top Gear again a repeat phrase maybe only to reconsider
*  my negativity was the Kazakhstan thing with Matt. So we went there and Rory was there as well and we
*  ended up at Baikonur which is the Cosmodrome where the Russian space program is based.
*  And it's an incredible area. I mean it's just mind-bendingly brilliant.
*  The vastness of that part of the world the Soviet Union, we think that the United States of America
*  is big, the Soviet Union was on a scale that you cannot comprehend. Kazakhstan was just a small
*  bolt-on to Russia but in itself has I think the fourth longest border of any country with Russia.
*  It's enormous and this area called Baikonur the way that the Russians worked was once they'd
*  used the launch site they'd just go somewhere else because it was so big they'd just abandon
*  that one move on to another one. It's a bit like rabbit warrens you know just move on and they
*  plotted all of it in a map. Anyhow we went there and we watched when we got close you were aware
*  of the amount of heavy industry. It was just the place was the first place I've been to where I
*  thought I'm not sure I should be breathing this. It just felt like you were breathing in stuff that
*  was hurting you. I've been to you know Indian cities where there's heavy pollution but that's
*  just sort of diesel and petrol fumes. There's something else there you know you're like going
*  what is that? But they it culminated with us watching a Soyuz rocket take off and they let
*  us get much closer to film it than you would normally be allowed to be and I've never watched
*  a rocket take off before I haven't been to Cape Canaveral or anywhere in the US. It was one of
*  the most awe-inspiring things I've ever seen. Sounds like such a cliche but watching a vehicle
*  that has enough power to leave our atmosphere is something I'd advise anyone to do if they have
*  the chance. There's a sort of ripping sound in the air that people who have seen it will
*  understand. It does feel like just the power of this thing is shredding the atmosphere around you
*  and it hits you in the solar plexus. You have no control over this sort of rattling in your chest
*  and I think we were less than a kilometer away from where it went off. It was absolutely sensational
*  to witness. Just power, raw power. The idea that Mr Musk has got something that's more power than
*  Saturn 5 about to take off. That fascinates me that all of that sort of thing is just we talk
*  about power and engines. Your act has got a bit of grunt but these things they just rattle you but
*  the smell afterwards is interesting. Oh it's got to be horrible. Yes. Every time they launch I mean
*  how many cars does that account for? You think about like the amount of pollution that's put out,
*  amount of carbon that's put out by the burning rockets? I can't even begin to quantify it.
*  Hundred thousand cars? What are they burning as well? What's in there? Talking about ropey fuels,
*  I was talking to some guys that used to race sports cars and Formula One back in the 80s when
*  they were using some very funky fuels because they had there was lots of technology left over
*  the Second World War that the Germans had for jet engines that they had pioneered that had weird
*  lubricants in them that allowed them to run at very high temperatures or have properties that
*  normal fuel didn't have and they would use it for qualifying particularly in Formula One and the
*  drivers after one lap were gone. They were just spent. There was also great stories about the
*  fact that they would they sometimes have a sort of area outside the Formula One garage. It wasn't
*  developed for sport then but they still had sponsors and guests and one particular team had
*  you know all the trees they put outside just died in an afternoon because this fuel was so obnoxious
*  and I think actually a guy called Andy Wallace who's a fantastic racing driver who's now the
*  chief test driver for Bugatti tells some amazing stories about literally being hauled out of groups
*  who race cars after qualifying because the fuel was just impossible just poisoning them. Wow! But
*  it gave them an extra hundred horsepower for that lap. Well how about leaded gasoline? Leaded gasoline
*  has been studies that show that in the places with higher amounts of leaded gasoline there's a you
*  can see the lower IQ in the kids and they think that it has dropped people's IQ by a measurable
*  amount like people that grew up around leaded gasoline which is me yeah like during that time
*  have we are dumber because of leaded gasoline. The pipes the pipes in our homes 150 years
*  ago were made of lead. Lead pipes well my friend Shane Gillis is in a hilarious bit about George
*  Washington and George Washington had lead dentures so he had this lead thing where these fake teeth
*  were so he had like lead in his mouth so he's getting lead poisoning all day long. I have a
*  I have somewhere in my house something I bought from the internet which is boots chemists so our
*  chemists your CVS we have boots which is our standard chemist it's a logo of of um healthcare
*  of of stuff that's good for you boots used to sell cigarettes for coughs.
*  I've got some I've got a tin somewhere it's brilliant so it's there and it shows you how
*  you should smoke them to get rid of your cough. Oh boy! So I think that wasn't that long ago. No
*  that's probably after the second world war no before the second world war. Crazy! I would have
*  thought so. A hundred years ago they thought cigarettes were good for coughs. Of course they
*  did but but then someone I just googled something like it to see if I'd find the art the the ad
*  and it ai says that menthol cigarettes are flavored which to help with coughs. Oh come on!
*  What? It says it can the menthol can decrease the cough reflex. Which can help with coughs. Heard of
*  that. By reducing airway pain and irritation menthol can reduce the pain and irritation caused
*  by cigarette smoke decreasing the cough reflex menthol triggers cold sensitive nerves in the skin
*  which can decrease the cold the cough reflex soothing a dry throat menthol can soothe the
*  dry throat feeling that's funny that ai is willing to say something that's very un-pc. I fucked up
*  here because I never heard that. Well it's probably true it's terrible for you. Yes however smoking
*  can make you cough more. Interesting. That's so weird. Yeah can't you say it menthol without
*  it being in the format of a cigarette? I'm sure. Yeah it's a cough drop I think. Yeah but what we
*  what we've learned about metallurgy is is fascinating and it does it does mean that that's why
*  we have to apply that to what we currently witness in the motor car in the automobile industry that
*  there is there's technology out there that will change something at some point we just don't know
*  what it is yet it's going to happen because we're having to relearn so much of what we thought was
*  facts you know in other areas of our lives and I think maybe that's what I get frustrated by is
*  you can't wait for that unprecedented change to come necessarily but you have to assume at some
*  point someone's going to make a battery that runs on wasp piss or water or something aren't they it's
*  going to happen scientists are clever they have big foreheads for a reason at the moment the argument
*  is where there's not enough cobalt or weighting in the lithium from that's a slightly specious
*  argument because I think it won't always be like that someone will someone will invent something
*  that means that we won't need the cobalt and the lithium well some guy invented a water powered car
*  a long time ago and he was murdered do you know that story it's one of the great conspiracy theories
*  that he yelled he he met with some people you know they wanted to talk to him about this design and
*  then he yelled they poisoned me and he ran outside and died yeah and then nobody ever heard about the
*  water powered car ever again after that so what is all that fucks all that shit so the mysterious
*  death of stanley meyer and his water powered car it's a wonderful conspiracy theory I haven't looked
*  into it enough to know how much of it is true looks like a tamir model underneath look at it
*  it looks like it looks like the the wild one so this guy developed this water powered car that
*  you know had incredible mileage interesting messaging on the side of the vehicle yeah
*  jesus christ a lady oh is oh jesus christ is lord oh okay it's cursive um stanley did stanley meyer
*  die because he knew how to turn water into fuel this is a british newspaper is it the express
*  um when was this go back i can't remember this thing is ridiculous what kind of shit website is
*  it's some really bad one let me see if there's another article i'm sure there's other articles
*  about that car that ran on water where it happened happened outside of in columbus
*  oh okay city so his bizarre death at age 57 ended work that if proved valid scroll up could have
*  ended reliance on fossil fuels people who knew him said his work drew worldwide attention mysterious
*  visitors from overseas governments buying and lucrative buyout offers i know that he was offered
*  money to sell i think the y files did an episode on this the meyers death was laced with all sorts
*  of story and conspiracy cloak and dagger stories gross city police lieutenant steve robert robinette
*  lead detective on the case i told them the stan had died and they never said a word he
*  recalled absolutely nothing no condolences no questions how did it but how did it run on water
*  i don't know um steven meyers featured in numerous internet sites significant portion of the 1995
*  documentary it runs on water narrated by science fiction writer arthur c clark aired on bbc focused
*  on his water fuel cell invention it's a fuel cell okay who is ignored called a fraud and died
*  without his hometown even remembering him with so much as a plaque
*  hmm but i have to believe that a piece of technology will emerge in the next 50 years
*  that will make us all wonder why we all got so freaked out you know yeah right especially over
*  exhausts right it says the basis for meyers research electrolysis is taught in middle school
*  science labs electricity flows through water cracking the molecules and filling test tubes
*  with oxygen and hydrogen bubbles a match is lighted the volatile gases explode and prove that water
*  is separated into its components meyers said his invention did so by using much less electricity
*  than physicists say is possible video show his contraption turning water into a frothy mix with
*  within seconds takes so much energy to separate h2 from the oh said ohio state university professor
*  emeritus neville rie a physicist for more than 41 years that energy has pretty much not changed
*  with time it's a fixed amount and nothing changes that meyers work defies the laws of conservation
*  of energy which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed basically it says you cannot
*  get something for nothing he may have had a nice way to store hydrogen and use it to make a very
*  effective motor but there is no way to do something fancy and separate hydrogen with less energy
*  hmm so who knows i mean but when he said the lord sent me okay now it gets odd his first few words
*  were the lord sent me here to this home i'd like to use your home as an experiment wait okay hold
*  on meyers creativity seemed to peak when he met charles and valerie hughes truck drivers who lived
*  in the jackson township julia hughes the youngest of the seven children was five years old when
*  myer rang the doorbell of her home on marlaine drive his first few words were the lord sent me
*  here to this home i'd like to use your home as an experiment she said maybe it was just a two-story
*  garage shop or the privacy of towering oak and sycamore trees julia isn't sure what myer saw there
*  but she knew her parents didn't have room for a struggling inventor yet after visiting with the
*  family for several hours myer stayed the night and then the next few years in the late 1970s in return
*  myer built the family a solar silo designed to both heat and cool the home the structure required
*  thousands of clear resin light guides a crude form of fiber optics which myer baked and molded in the
*  family kitchen jesus julia hughes recalled the chemical stench the system was supposed to
*  channel the sun's rays into the tower base to heat water and generate electricity for an air
*  conditioner despite extensive efforts that included re-plumbing the house the invention never worked
*  oh so you might have been a kook hard to tell but but i tell you what you love a conspiracy theory
*  oh i love them i know you do i'm less i am seduced by some yeah but but i'm probably less into them
*  than you are i will say this the more you delve into the relationship between business and science
*  the way that our lives run it's very difficult not to assume that many ideas are quashed because
*  they're not helpful for certain businesses and i think i think the automotive industry
*  is is and has been at the forefront of that of the oil business just the oil business in general
*  speaking of before we go too far uh one of the kids remembered some people showed up at the house
*  and offered him quote 250 million dollars to stop yeah the arabs wanted to offer me 250 million
*  dollars to stop today you and this lovely family can live in peace and prosperity the rest of your
*  days meyer told them this the army officials meanwhile had questioned meyer about what
*  foreigners wanted thinking that the deal might have been struck charlie recalled meyer telling
*  the family meyer discussed the offer in the clark documentary many times over the last decade have
*  been offered enormous amounts of money simply to sell out or to sit on it the arabs have offered
*  me a total of a billion dollars total pay simply to sit on it and do nothing with it
*  hmm pardon me goes i think i'll tell you i'll tell you why sure an event that definitely
*  i knew people like that happened here that did shake my i'm less cynical probably what i'm less
*  uh likely to to be as interested in conspiracy theories maybe because i
*  maybe i lack your imagination i don't know what it is but i i like i like maybe i'm terrified of
*  the fact that i'm being taken for a ride in too many areas of my life but dieselgate the volkswagen
*  thing that happened in this country really shook me because i didn't think something could have
*  happened on that scale explain it to people because it's pretty crazy well effectively
*  um volkswagen were able to put software into their vehicles that allowed them to cheat in
*  emissions tests and a load of vehicles that were had stated emissions qualities didn't have them
*  when they were not on the test rig um and actually that that process had been going on in many
*  different ways for most motor cars forever but that but the scale on which they offended and
*  the fact they did it in the u.s meant they got absolutely hammered for it but you know if you
*  have an audi rs4 from 2007 and you start the engine up it idles in an odd way the car feels
*  very aggressive for the first 30 seconds that you start it that's because there's an air pump
*  inside the car that is basically forcing air through the exhaust faster than it needs to so
*  that when you put it on a test rig it has lower emissions than it should do this had been going
*  on for a long time but the scale of it was i suppose an sort of an industrial subterfuge
*  that i i didn't think was i didn't think it could happen right especially with a large corporation
*  like volkswagen i know that did shake me because that i always i'm a flag bearer for my industry
*  i'm proud to be part of the wider car industry and i didn't think that could happen and it and
*  it wasn't just a bit of naughtiness it was lies and how many people knew about it
*  one has to assume quite a few yeah you would assume but i think i think i think they would
*  have there was a moral complication to it because they were still making very clever
*  really quite clean vehicles they weren't you know they weren't trying to
*  cover up something absolutely hideous it was they were in the margins but it was still wrong it was
*  morally completely wrong and once they once they got away with it they were stuck with it they
*  couldn't suddenly sort of backtrack on it right and there's and i think the it shook my confidence
*  in in those large corporations i thought they were being more honest with us and probably made me
*  more likely to believe conspiracy theories afterwards so i thought well if they're capable
*  of that what else are they doing conspiracy theories are fascinating because some of them
*  are bullshit and some of them are real and it's hard to figure out what's what yeah you know
*  there's some crazy ones like the earth is flat and then there's some ones like the cia might have
*  killed jfk yeah and you're like who they might have they might have it makes very good listening
*  i love listening to talk about it oh they're fascinating but i suppose i'm i tend to sit a
*  bit further back and just i'd like to hear other people talk about them but when it enters your
*  worlds but when something becomes pertinent to you right you suddenly go hang on a minute what else
*  have they been doing here and how bad was it and how many of them did they get away with yeah for
*  everyone that gets caught it's not like they catch every conspiracy right there's no way no no some
*  of them sneak through and manage to be effective do you know the latest one about this gentleman
*  who was a a billionaire who had apparently overvalued his company and went to court for it
*  and the possibility of him winning this court battle was something like one half of one percent
*  this is mike lynch is it yeah the guy who just died on the boat and then right after he gets out
*  the guy who he's with the co-defendant gets hit by a car and then he gets hit by a freak water
*  spout and sinks his yacht i was discussing this over a few glasses of wine with some friends it's
*  a good it's got rogan written all over it this one has it's perfect for you it's so i'm gonna i'm
*  not gonna pass any comment i'm gonna be a soft cock again but i'm gonna say that i read it and my eyes
*  well my eyebrows raise i thought that seems like a coincidence didn't the lawyer die as well
*  um who else died the co-defendant was hit by a car in in cambridge i think so the the one one
*  incident was a cycling incident in the uk a few days was it hit and run no they've got they have
*  the person that hit the cyclist i think they have got but they were asking for information around it
*  did the person that hit the cyclist have any connection to anybody that i don't know was it
*  i don't know suspicious i just read it and just thought like you i'm like oh my god
*  yeah billionaire autonomy co-founder mike lynch and steven chamberlain's careers were intertwined
*  for years in a fraud trial then they died on the same day miles apart well
*  i think um i suppose the difficulty i have with that is that's a tragedy they've
*  fucked over some billionaires well they they've fucked over some very very it was
*  julip pakard yeah so they sold they sold autonomy to julip pakard and there was a
*  big um he was extradited to the u.s and uh and i you know i don't know it's not my world
*  i suppose the conspiracy theory thing is fascinating but then when it's in the
*  context of people losing their lives like that i'm like do i want to comment because it's so awful
*  what's awful and and also going down in a boat is right up there for me of jesus christ also a
*  freak water spout if you see the size of this boat yeah it's extraordinary it's like 300 feet long
*  yeah how yeah how did it say what happened i know you love it don't you love it you absolutely love
*  it love it yeah because i gotta think that there's people in this world that have the ability to do
*  certain things to certain people that fuck them over i think you're right yeah and uh that seems
*  like that would qualify we're talking about they got ripped off by billions of dollars and then
*  somehow another this guy gets off and then dies right away yeah and dies in the weirdest of ways
*  a freak water spout how many people die every year and freak water spouts on 300 foot yachts
*  i'm doing my uncomfortable face i just i it's so it's so out there it's so out there yeah yeah it
*  really is yeah and i i'll bring it back to something more mundane there were quite a few
*  things that happened in formula one sport that i follow the most closely probably in the 90s and
*  noughties that looking back you think there must have been someone had a button that could make
*  things happen because it was so beyond the coincidence and i and i never i never stopped
*  to think of the implications of that thought but if someone could do that in a sport they can do it
*  in the rest of your life and they've always rigged sports i mean people have been rigging sports
*  since the beginning of sports betting but the sport that you're involved with you can't can you
*  rig that oh yes people have rigged it yeah people gotten in trouble for rigging it yeah yeah certain
*  fighters may have an injury there's a controversy about a certain trainer that was involved in
*  betting and then an online discord server and they would talk about bets and they he'd make a
*  lot of bets and he was making more money betting than other things and there was a fighter that he
*  was taking care of and that fighter apparently had a knee injury and went into the fight and then all
*  this money got bet on this guy losing in the first round and so he throws a kick in the first round
*  falls down gets beat up loses by tko in the first round blows his knee out his knee apparently
*  already been fucked and so this guy who is the trainer has now been he's being investigated by
*  the feds he gets kicked out of the sport no one from his gym is allowed to compete the ufc anymore
*  and he's under investigation and if it turns out that they're what they're saying about him is true
*  he's really rightly fucked yeah i think actually there's a crossover here between conspiracy and
*  cheating now i think the greatest book that's not been written and never will be written is
*  the greatest cheats in motorsport some of the stories i've heard over the years are so good
*  just because what they do is they reveal the competitive nature of human beings but also
*  ingenuity that you you will see people that most ingenious when they're cheating not when they're
*  abiding by the rules right and formula one is about the phrase that the great mark donahue one
*  of your great drivers mark donahue was a can-am driver who did a bit for my ones as well he coined
*  the phrase the unfair advantage which a phrase i love because it just defines so many sports your
*  whether we like it or not we're searching for the unfair advantage and in motorsport some of the
*  cheats i've heard about are just just brilliant like what kind of stuff so i can remember hearing
*  a guy called win percy who was a touring car driver from the uk in the sort of 60s and 70s
*  describing how there was a famous commentator we had called murray walker he was the voice of our
*  motorsport for 40 years he had a very distinctive voice he was a lovely man met him a few times
*  and he had often described win percy getting out of this particular car he'd been racing covered
*  in sweat because it was such a monster to drive but it turned out that it was a v12 and it was
*  very very thirsty so to make sure that when they did a fuel check at the end of the race to make
*  sure they were abiding by the rules he would be furiously pumping a hand pump underneath the seat
*  to inflate a bladder in the fuel tank to cut off a load of the volume so that
*  and he told this story about i don't think i'm misquoting he said well that's why i was
*  knackered it wasn't it was a v12 because on the warm down lap i knew i had to pump this thing like
*  40 times to fill up the bladder wow and there's amazing stories of just just ingenious cheats
*  i mean there's so many of them i mean formula one is about not getting caught that's really what
*  that's what it's about you know you what's the line between interpreting rules and not getting
*  caught and i love all of that and i have a few times said to people i know in this in those sports
*  can i write that book will you tell me they went no i won't tell you any of the stories
*  i'll tell them to you now as a friend but if they're ever published i'm a dead man
*  right because all the money involved but the ingenious cheating i mean in 1995
*  toyota was excluded from the world rally championship because it just had
*  a brilliantly simple piece of cheating it's there all the cars were took the world rally cars were
*  turbocharged and you have what's called a restrictor you know an intake restrictor so you you actually
*  make sure that you can't take more than a certain amount of air into the turbocharger which should
*  limit the power and make it a level playing field but they created this brilliantly simple
*  bypass valve that meant that when the car was running the air would just go around and it
*  wasn't the intake restrictor was completely redundant what they didn't realize was that
*  that the world rally championship had a couple of situations where the cars run side by side it'd
*  be a drag race and so the toyota just fucked up into the distance they all went well they're cheating
*  and then they found it but it was this was you know perpetrated by a by toyota by a car company
*  and i i suppose those things i find fascinating wouldn't you tell them to don't get ahead in the
*  straightaway they didn't tell the the driver and co-driver didn't know
*  they just knew that sometimes when they got in the car someone did that with a lever
*  wow they didn't know and formula one is not big in america which is odd so how do you feel about it
*  here in austin well i saw it in austin it's amazing i love it yeah i went to coda that's that's we
*  have that up there yeah that's coda yeah um my friend bobby owns the place so you know he took
*  me around and showed me and we went there for the races it's incredible they put on one of the best
*  races of the season here awesome the track's incredible and it's so fast they're going so
*  fast it's so wild to watch yeah and i find it amazing how huge nascar is here where they're
*  just going around in an oval just they do have some street circuits don't they they do have some
*  shorter ovals but yeah formula one is is more complex way more complex and the the vehicles
*  themselves are so incredible and they're so expensive it's just unbelievable how much
*  money is involved in formula one so it makes sense why people would cheat a little bit i think it's
*  this interpreter this this gray area of interpreting a rule book that's complicated
*  but also try not to get caught and some of the just the way that they've through the years
*  and it creates subterfuge it creates games another great story we covered this on top gear was one of
*  the great interpreters of the rule book was colin chapman who was the man that founded lotus
*  and um he had found a way in something called the lotus i think 77 it was a car that andretti
*  won the championship in they've created a little ground effect so it's now a common thing but he
*  worked out that if you sealed the sides of a car on the road you could effectively accelerate air
*  underneath the car and create a low pressure area which basically sucked the car to the ground
*  so you were generating downforce not through wings but through accelerating air under the car
*  by the way any engineers listen i'm not an engineer but i'm basically understanding of it
*  i've been driven these things but if i'm if my terminology is wrong i apologize but effectively
*  you're generating downforce in a way that you can't see it on the vehicle it's not got wings
*  uh and what they would do is they'd lower these there was a sort of a handle they'd lower these
*  skirts when they went out onto the tracks when the car went out on track in the and then in the
*  paddock it looked like a normal car but he he they were going so much faster than everyone else
*  he needed to find a way of diverting the attention to the other teams so what he would do was at the
*  end of a test session quite often he'd have a guy scuttled from the back of the garage
*  with something underneath a piece of like cotton or something or a blanket and run over towards a
*  service truck and everyone would see him do it so all the teams were like they've got a trick
*  differential they've got something special but it wasn't it was a kettle it was a kettle this guy
*  was running around with underneath the towel just everyone thought it was a component it was a total
*  diversion and i met the guy that used to just run around with this he had it was like a like a
*  teapotty kettle thing he was just told at the end of the session put that under there and run away
*  with it so everyone thinks it's like a differential or something and i think that's where i love
*  motorsport because it brings out these bizarre human competitive human behaviors what's also
*  the margins of victory are so slim if you have the same horsepower same compound tires just
*  different engineers putting it all together but they are completely different vehicles yes they
*  may have the same tires right but this is you know these are a bunch of people 400 people in
*  different parts of the world are told this quote this is the rule book away you go and the margin
*  of and they are within a tenth of each other on a track yeah it's amazing amazing it is amazing
*  yeah but they but they're all at it and they're all like they'd see there's always some conspiracy
*  at the moment red bull apparently they thought they ever thought they had some special brake
*  system that they've now had to get rid of because the fia was aware of it now red bull's complaining
*  that mclaren and mercedes have got flexible front wings it is it is it is the politics of the
*  playground being played out with billions of dollars on a racetrack and i and that's why i'm
*  totally addicted to it and how much of that engineering and technology gets to consumer cars
*  good question i think direct crossover there's some but not as much as you'd hope but it's
*  undeniable that the brains that are involved in that sport when they go over to the road car side
*  carry with them a curiosity and a skill set that's been so enhanced by what they learned on the
*  racetrack that we all benefit i believe that i think if you look for direct crossovers in all
*  of these places you come away disappointed but if you tell me that the person that has run max
*  verstappen's car for the last three years if he went to be involved in the next tesla model three
*  he's going to have a profound effect on it he's going to know shit he's going to have a way of
*  looking at that project that's going to make it profoundly better i believe that i once wrote a
*  story for some in-house magazine i think for bar racing when they had a race team about the crossover
*  between aeronautical engineering and formula one that's profound that really is i mean the way a
*  formal one car sucks itself to the track is an upside down plane but there were further things
*  as well the carbon ceramic brake disc was developed for what concord really they had they couldn't
*  stop concord it was just it was going through brakes obviously and someone went well why don't
*  we use different material for the rotor and that's where the carbon ceramic the brake came from
*  so there is this huge crossover in metallurgy and actually you know to broaden that what's
*  what's the greatest legacy of your frankly amazing mind-boggling national space program
*  you know it's it's it's what we learned about materials isn't it nasa served to teach us all
*  about materials there's we we we are benefiting now the car you there's something about the raptor
*  you'll go home in that wouldn't be there if nasa hadn't needed to have some weird material with a
*  property that hadn't been required before i really believe that that's that's the incredible
*  corollary of of projects that are ambitious projects on that scale it has to be with like
*  the defense department and the construction of fighter jets aren't they i'm just fascinated by
*  them we did a film with the f-35 i raced an f-35 in a mclaren speed tail and the level of
*  classification around the vehicle was so difficult because i didn't realize that we don't as a
*  british government we don't own those planes we lease them from you we're not allowed to own them
*  really yeah so the ip stays with you guys and what we do with them is kind of up to you
*  um but we weren't allowed any cockpit shots at all we weren't allowed to see inside it i just
*  got a description from the from the pilot of what the aircraft could do well you know they're doing
*  those fighter jets now with ai running them and they beat human pilots 100 percent of the time
*  in dog fights do they yeah that the f-35 was one of the coolest man-made objects i've ever seen
*  they're incredible we had to go up there to so actually it was a bit like that bungee jump thing
*  this was so serious that we had to be rigorous for example with the uh in the theater of war i'm
*  not sure you can decide whether the ground is full of chips of stones or not but this they have a
*  decontaminated area the runway has to you're not allowed to go in there and drop litter because it
*  can get sucked up when it's doing that hovering thing um so you go in there you're decontaminated
*  and we spent several days working out how to run this drag race it started out with a genuine drag
*  race between me and the mclaren and this f-35 and they had their data on how it accelerated
*  and we have mclaren there with their data and we worked they worked out that the car would get off
*  the line much quicker than the plane would overtake at a certain point but i was told very clearly
*  that i couldn't get in the wash of the aircraft as it took off because it would just flip the car
*  backwards and we had to sort of choreograph that bit not fake it but choreograph it so anyhow first
*  run we did i was told that i'd be absolutely safe i'd be so far ahead of the plane that the plane
*  would then be in the air by the time it went over me and we'd be away anyhow first run we do i'm
*  like this in this mclaren it's fucking fast and it accelerates and i look left and i hear a noise
*  and there's a plane coming past me on the ground and i thought i'm in trouble here and the the
*  front wheels of the car came off the ground at about 130 miles an hour it didn't do that
*  oh i was fully god is any racing driver will tell you and i'm a pretty poor racing driver
*  you know when the front wheels aren't on the ground what do you do well you just shit yourself
*  and you're so invested in it you're like well it's going over if it's going over this is the
*  greatest piece of television ever and i hope it doesn't and the thing just the thing went it just
*  went next to me and again i'd this is why i you know i want to be someone that expresses joy
*  what a thing to have done and when an f-35 comes past you and it's just got off the ground here
*  yeah you were when this thing comes past you it just started screaming fuck does it show
*  you look at that look at that thing there that's incredible it's so nuts that they put you next to
*  that thing though when it got when it was right by me it fucking and we never showed you're going
*  218 miles no that's kilometers it comes past me like that bang
*  and i just thought and as it did it the front wheels just went and i thought well i'm in trouble
*  here wow but the power and the sound you know you talk about the internal combustion engine why
*  they these electric things make no sound we are amateurs compared to what they get to play with
*  yeah and they have like like what 30 minutes of flight time before they run out of gas yeah i
*  don't think that thing can go very far but but you know all this vectoring the way it can just
*  it can just decide to be hanging like a helicopter yeah incredible it's remarkable but they don't
*  share the ip at all you're not allowed to we were not allowed to see inside it that is so wild that
*  it can do that just hover in the air like that and shoot its draft down fucking crazy maybe that's
*  the maybe that's the tv show i just think there's a whole there's a is it boys toys there's going to
*  be more sophisticated there's a whole load of stuff that's got moving past i think you're
*  overthinking it i just like you and your passion for automobiles is all you need do it on the
*  internet it'll be huge i hope so i think so i don't think you need anything else i quite like those
*  things though they're pretty badass if you can get a hold of one of those that's great too but
*  f-22 have you been to an air show and seen one of those i flew in an fa-18 did you yeah with the
*  blue angels wow it was insane insane yeah insane just the g for the physical effect on your body
*  so extraordinary yeah you know they don't use g suits either they don't use gravity suits so you
*  you have to hook it's close so you hold on to the and then you do that breathing thing you're forcing
*  blood and you feel your consciousness closing like an elevator door you see it you see the darkness
*  coming from the left and the right you're fighting it off i wasn't very good at it i thought i'd be
*  quite good because the people of our height should be quite good at it but i felt it i got put up in
*  one of those extra 300s the stunt planes it's a prop thing but you know they're the ones that
*  they use in the red bull air races and i once he got to sort of six seven g's yeah i started to see
*  yeah you have to fight it all i think i got to seven and a half g's but those guys can go to like
*  nine ten g's like that it's fucking insane the pressure and the maneuverability of these things
*  the the pilot took me through like this canyon and you're you know 100 200 feet off the ground
*  just flying through this canyon sideways it's fucking insane insane i did a ridiculous film
*  looking back with a guy called andy green do you know andy green is no fastest man on earth he's
*  the one that still holds the world's land speed record so he he drove thrust ssc he was the first
*  man to go supersonic in a car and and they had this thing called bloodhound and this is the last
*  thing i'll bore you with on this podcast so they had this thing called bloodhound which was supposed
*  to go a thousand miles an hour and they were going to drive it in on a some salt flats or some
*  some something that dried out in south africa i think anyhow it was it was supposed to be funded
*  by industry they lost a lot of sponsors and they decided to try and publicly fund it and they
*  couldn't and andy during that phase said i've i've got an extra 300 he's an ex pilot fighter
*  pilot because only people that can drive these things racing drivers are useless because the
*  decision making is so quick and profound they identified early on they need pilots not racing
*  drivers he said i've got an extra 300 and it's got this car has got various stages of propulsion you
*  start off with a jet then it goes to a rocket and he goes his madness he goes i've got an extra 300
*  and i've developed a way of doing aerobatic moves that will demonstrate the change in g-force
*  during the run so he's put there's a bore yourself with it he's put he's put there's a film if you
*  type in my name look at that fucking thing type in my name and his name and you'll there's a film
*  on youtube of him taking me up in this stunt plane to put me through the g's that he'll have
*  part and i honestly by the end of it how fast did he go in this thing oh my god look at that
*  he had oversteer over 600 miles an hour look at it that was in the u.s. wow so he he um but the
*  way he put me through the g-forces i would have been a terrible fighter pilot i couldn't i kept
*  getting gray kept graying out pumping and everything yeah well those guys are all jacked that's one thing
*  i found out about the blue angels they had like when you go to their training facility there's
*  weightlifting equipment everywhere you have to have muscles because you have to you're literally
*  it's like brute force you should have been brilliant at it then yeah it's not fun it's a
*  lot of work so when i when i do some youtube videos with cars can i come and drag you into a
*  car yes let's do it okay i'm in okay let's go i've loved talking to you thank you very i love talking
*  to you too thanks for being here man it's great to see you again after all these years yes i'll
*  be back in 10 years no let's have it quicker and let's definitely get you on youtube on the internet
*  do your own thing it'll happen soon you don't need other people thank you fuck those people
*  bye everybody
