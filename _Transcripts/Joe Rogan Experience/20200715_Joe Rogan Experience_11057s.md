# Joe Rogan Experience #1508 - Peter Schiff
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [July 15, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK2zgeJLVwU)
*  Three two one boom here we go. Hello Peter
*  Joe good to see you buddy. Nice to see you again. I like how you have it Leach but nice to see you
*  I like how you have the Euro Pacific capital above your left shoulder. Very nice. Very wise
*  Well, this this is my studio in my basement here in Connecticut where I'm hunkered down
*  But you know in honor of doing your show I poured myself a glass of scotch. Oh, so I have it
*  I feel and I'm sure you have something to drink, but I wanted to toast your Spotify deal. Oh, thank you very much
*  All right. I got a bottle of my good friend Josh Barnett's war bringer
*  Warmaster edition miss a smoked whiskey. So I'll have a little here's to you and Spotify
*  And you know, I think they're getting you cheap. You probably could have held out for more money
*  Well, you don't know how much I got
*  Well, I just know what the public says. All right, they don't know how much I got either
*  But thank you. Good if you got more
*  Great I'll drink to that. I'm very happy Spotify is awesome. I'm very happy
*  I'm just I'm happy to be with a company where they have a vested interest in my success like we're together, you know
*  Beauty of capitalism, you know, right mutually beneficial voluntary relationships. Yeah, there you go. Exactly
*  So why are you in Connecticut in Puerto Rico?
*  Well, you know I live in Puerto Rico and thanks to my appearance on your show a lot of other people now live there, too
*  I just got to tell you how many people I run into and they say Peter, you know, I moved here because of you
*  I see really how'd you hear about it? Oh, I'm Joe Rogan. That's a lot of people have come down here
*  But I don't know. I don't think you've been to Puerto Rico. Well, I've never been to Puerto Rico
*  Yeah, I guess I you got an open invitation to come visit me. I'll put you up
*  I got I got a nice place on the beach for you. What's their cove situation like what's the cove it situation?
*  Oh, yeah, it this is it's hot now
*  It's you know, it's July August and so I would rather be in Connecticut
*  I love the weather here in the summer into the fall and
*  We still maintain a house here, you know the house that I lived in before we moved to Puerto Rico
*  So now this is more of a summer home. And so we're here for the summer. Although we may be here into the fall
*  I think we will because the
*  Schools, you know are gonna be remote now
*  So normally I would come back the schools start in mid-august in Puerto Rico
*  So we would normally come back then but since they're gonna be taking the classes online
*  We'll probably end up staying in
*  Connecticut for a little longer which which I like but I really enjoy Puerto Rico. It's a great place to live
*  You can't beat the tax breaks. So, you know, this is gonna be an important thing
*  Especially if Biden ends up winning which it looks highly likely that that's gonna be the case
*  I think a lot more people are gonna be coming down there to try to escape what will be real confiscatory
*  levels of taxation
*  So, you know people could look into it, but yeah, I mean it's a real real great place to be well
*  Let's let's get into that. So you you think that Biden has a very high likelihood of winning. Here we are
*  let's just if people come upon this in the future today is the 14th 14th of July and
*  We're a few months away from the election you feel like it looks like Biden is moving into the direction of
*  eventually winning
*  Well, I think he's already moved in that direction
*  And so the question is can Trump change that direction between now and election day?
*  And I think it's gonna be very challenging. Maybe his best opportunity is gonna be the debates
*  We'll see I don't think I have a big problem for for Trump and you know, I I voted for Trump
*  the first time and
*  You know, I was initially gonna vote libertarian, which is something I do and by the way
*  There's a there's a candidate Joe Jorgensen who you should have on your show
*  I don't know if you've if you thought about it
*  But there is a woman running for president and she will be on the ballot in every state Joe Jorgensen from the libertarian party
*  And so everybody who thinks there should be a woman president. I actually agree right now and that's who we should elect
*  Is that who you're voting for?
*  Is that who you're gonna vote for?
*  Well, I can't vote for anybody I live in Puerto Rico
*  But I thought Puerto Rico was a part of the United States sort of it is it is part of the United States
*  But you know from the revolution no taxation without representation
*  So what happens is when you move to Puerto Rico?
*  You no longer have to pay the federal income tax or the Obamacare tax, which is great
*  But then you can't vote in for the president and you don't have any member of Congress
*  So being in Puerto Rico, I have no
*  Representation in Congress and I can't vote for president but the trade-off is I don't have to pay the taxes
*  Wow, so, you know, that's a good trade-off that I'm you know, pretty much everybody is willing to make so I can't vote
*  And normally I vote for the lesser of two evils anyway, and most of the time I vote for the loser
*  So as far as I'm concerned giving up my right to vote for the loser is is not much of a sacrifice
*  But you know if I could vote I would still be living in Connecticut and it would be a total waste of my vote
*  To vote for Trump because he has no chance of winning Connecticut
*  So I would vote for Jorgensen even though I know she can't win
*  I would rather at least give her a vote of support
*  Because I wouldn't be wasting my vote because you know, it doesn't matter
*  Connecticut is gonna go for Biden in a big way and so it's you know
*  Voting for anybody it doesn't really matter who you vote for this is like like Connecticut
*  But as I was saying the problem
*  For Trump and I was one of the few people who was in the media
*  Saying that I thought Trump had a real good shot at winning
*  I didn't know it was in the bag
*  But I thought that he was more likely to win than lose, you know
*  even though everybody thought he was a long shot and the reason that I thought that Trump could win is
*  Because Trump was telling the truth about how bad the economy was. He wasn't regurgitating the lies
*  That the Obama administration had been
*  Telling or that Wall Street had been telling about how we had a real recovery
*  I knew that we had a bubble inflated by the Federal Reserve and that beneath that bubble
*  Where you know, you can see the stock market at record highs and these phony unemployment numbers
*  I knew laid a weak economy and Trump knew that too and Trump spoke to the forgotten men and women of this
*  And his message really resonated about how we were, you know a shadow of our former self that our industrial might had decayed
*  We had all these big trade deficits that the stock market was a bubble all the numbers were fake
*  The real unemployment number rate wasn't 5%
*  But 20% 30% 40% and that he was a non politician. He was gonna clean house
*  He was gonna drain the swamp
*  He was gonna put politics aside and big bring a businessman's perspective to Washington drain that swamp
*  eliminate the national debt right make America great again and
*  That message resonated with a lot of people and a lot of those people
*  Were maybe afraid to be honest with the pollsters because they didn't want to admit that they were gonna vote for this racist
*  Misogynist or whoever the media was portraying him. So I thought he could win and and he did
*  But here's the problem
*  Now that he's been in office for three years. He didn't drain the swamp. He made the swamp deeper, right?
*  He didn't make get rid of the deficit
*  I mean the deficit is bigger than ever even before cove it all he did was
*  You know nurture the bubble that he inherited from from Obama and helped make it get bigger
*  He became a cheerleader for the stock market
*  He didn't care. It was a bubble all of a sudden all the government numbers that were fake under Obama were all of a sudden
*  real like they just came down from from God on a tablet on my
*  Sinai and he began talking about this low unemployment and his booming economy the greatest economy in the history of the world the greatest
*  economy ever and none of that was true and
*  So you have the same people who voted for Trump?
*  Thinking that he would shake things up thinking that he would throw a monkey wrench in the system and make their lives better and their lives
*  Aren't better. They're worse people have more debt
*  You know the bubble got bigger the trade deficits that Donald Trump criticized are bigger now than they were before he was elected
*  And obviously the deficits are much bigger even before cove it
*  So I just don't see how Trump convinces those swing voters those blue-collar
*  Reagan Democrats in the Rust Belt who decided they had nothing to lose and so to take a chance on Trump
*  Why should they vote for him again?
*  I mean now they may take a chance on Biden even though I mean Biden doesn't represent any any change from the status quo
*  He's just more of the same
*  But you know once you're the insider and Trump's now the insider, you know, he doesn't have that edge
*  For a reelection. What do you think went wrong? And why do you think Trump just made the swamp deeper?
*  Do you what do you think that he was deceptive when he was running or do you think the influences once he got into office?
*  Were greater than he anticipated. What do you think happened?
*  Well, I have no idea
*  I mean
*  I know even Ronald Reagan right Ronald Reagan when he was elected and he was a very principled conservative right unlike Trump
*  You know, he was he really talked a walk the walk not just talked to talk and he was a big supporter of Barry Goldwater
*  Who didn't make it, you know when he ran against Lyndon Johnson, but when Reagan came in he really wanted to shrink government
*  I mean he campaigned about cut getting rid of the Department of Education
*  The Department of Energy or I forget he really wanted to shrink government and cut spending but he was never able to do that
*  Right. He was able to cut taxes
*  But he wasn't able to cut spending Trump never really campaigned on cutting spending
*  He didn't want to talk about that because he didn't want to alienate any voters. So he just talked about cutting taxes and
*  He did, you know officially cut taxes, but he actually raised taxes. That is the
*  Important thing that you have to recognize is that government spending is taxation and
*  What happened to government spending under Trump even before it went through the moon with kovat 19 and we'll get to all the kovat stuff
*  But even before then Trump signed on to all kinds of increases in government spending more spending on the military
*  More spending welfare huge increases in government spending that those are tax hikes
*  now Trump
*  Cut income taxes, but the income tax is just one way the government pays for spending
*  Because all government spending has to be paid for by the public one way or another we don't get any government for free
*  Everything the government does cost us money
*  so every dime they spend
*  represents taxation in some form and
*  What they've been doing is they've been printing money, right?
*  The Federal Reserve prints money and in fact right now the Federal Reserve is printing about
*  55 cents out of every federal dollar that spent so more money is being printed and spent than collected in
*  Taxation but all that printing all that spending that is being paid for by a printing pass. We don't get that for free
*  There is a cost see when the government takes our money through an income tax
*  They take my money that I earned and they give it to somebody else who didn't earn it and now that person spends the money
*  But because I don't have it. I can't spend it. I can't invest it or save it
*  I don't have it anymore the government took it from me in taxes
*  But if the government doesn't take it from me
*  They just print money and they hand it to somebody else who didn't earn it and didn't do any work and produce any
*  Goods or provide any services they just you know gotten money from the government
*  That still cost me because what happens is when that money is spent in a circulation
*  It bids up prices and so prices are now higher than they would have been had that new money not been printed
*  And so now everything that I want to buy costs more than it otherwise would have cost either the prices went up or it
*  prevented prices from going down and so now my purchasing power has been diminished and so either the government takes your money
*  Through an income tax or a sales tax or something or they take your purchasing power through an inflation tax
*  And so that's what Trump decided to do to pay for government through inflation rather than taxation
*  But what we know from history is that is the most expensive way to pay for government and in fact
*  It hits hardest the middle class and the poor right because the rich have a lot of assets
*  They have a lot of debt where they not consumer debt like on a credit card
*  But where they borrow money to accumulate income producing property to buy companies stocks things like that
*  And so inflation helps those people right if you if you have debt to buy assets
*  Inflation wipes out your debt
*  But if you're just saving money and working for a living and getting a paycheck
*  The inflation tax is very heavy on you and that inflation tax is going to get much much higher
*  Under Biden right for all the talk about all these big government programs
*  And we'll talk about that that he wants to pay for by taxing the rich
*  The rich aren't going to pay those taxes most of the money is going to come from the poor in the middle class
*  Through the inflation tax but getting back to you know where I think Trump went wrong
*  So Trump gets into office and he had promised to make America great again
*  And the reason that America is not great is because government is too big right when America was great
*  Right, we had very very small government government was you know an afterthought right on all levels
*  Maybe state federal and local. Maybe it was 5% of GDP. We didn't have an income tax corporate or personal
*  We didn't have Social Security
*  We didn't have all you know minimum wage or any of these any of these laws
*  We had a very very tiny government and because type government was tiny the economy got very big
*  We had all kinds of freedom
*  And because we were free we were very productive and the living standards were rising and we were eradicating poverty
*  We were making all kinds of strides
*  The greatest economy in the history of the world was produced from the freest people in the history of the world
*  Which was the United States?
*  Well Trump wanted to make America great again
*  The only way to do that would be to shrink government cut government spending and free up all those resources
*  Back into the private sector so that they can be used efficiently again
*  But the problem is how do you cut government spending when every single program has its own?
*  Constituency that benefits from it and so once you're there
*  you can't cut anything unless you're willing to stand up to all the politicians in the special interest groups and
*  Apparently Trump wasn't willing to do that
*  I mean Trump when he when he got into office became a politician or maybe he was one when he ran for office
*  But he was more concerned about getting reelected which is a shame because he probably won't he should have
*  Used the bully pulpit and used his office
*  right away to level with the American public to look them square in the eye and tell them that government is too big and
*  And and spending needs to be cut
*  Including things like Social Security and Medicare and all these sacred cows that nobody would gore Trump should have been the guy to do it
*  He should have said the buck stops with me
*  I don't care if I don't have a second term and he should have vetoed all of those bills that he signed
*  He never should have agreed to allow the allowing the debt ceiling to go up
*  He should have enforced that debt so we now have twenty six and a half trillion of debt, right?
*  When he came into office, it was just under 20 trillion
*  So we've already added six and a half trillion since he became president
*  I would not have allowed the debt ceiling to go up at all not one nickel and I would have forced the government to cut
*  Government spending and that's what Trump should have done
*  You know, but but he didn't want to do it because he was more concerned about the politics of it
*  Would you say I would are you running for president? Are you ready to do this?
*  I'm just saying what I would have done had I been Trump. Are you ready to do this?
*  I'm not running
*  But we need someone who understands
*  I could be the first Puerto Rican president
*  I'd be a did you ever watch the sweat hogs? Yes, sure
*  Yeah, I'm on Epstein. I'm a Puerto Rican Jew Epstein played my brother in an episode of news radio
*  Really? Yes. He played my older brother who was a priest who beat us up
*  Gabriel Kaplan show that was the 19th set but yeah, I could be a Puerto Rican Jew. Yes
*  You know, I can't vote right? I can't vote for the president, but I can run
*  In fact, I could be the only person elected president who couldn't vote for himself. That's hilarious
*  now I'm so glad you're on here today because you have a unique ability to
*  illuminate all these areas of
*  finance and
*  Taxing and Wall Street that most people just simply don't have the understanding or the knowledge to
*  Lay out for the lay person like myself
*  When you know, I appreciate that and you know, you've got a great audience
*  And I'm hoping to clear up a lot of misconception out there because I've been saying, you know
*  The only thing that spreads faster than the coronavirus is ignorance, you know about economics
*  about about finance and
*  So I want to clear that up and you know
*  a good place to get started is to really talk about the current state of the US economy and
*  Where we were right leading up to kovat 19 because you know
*  Donald Trump is out there claiming that we had this great economy right that just got screwed up by kovat 19
*  We had to shut it down
*  But we didn't we had an enormous bubble
*  there was nothing great about it other than the size of the bubble and
*  The reason that it collapsed so quickly was because what happened was kovat 19
*  Was a pin that tricked that bubble. In fact, the bubble was already deflating before kovat
*  It started to deflate in the fourth quarter of 2019
*  that's when the Federal Reserve stopped hiking interest rates and then started cutting them again and
*  Started doing quantitative easing again and then kovat 19 came
*  It was like a giant spear that put a gaping hole into a bubble that was already deflating
*  There Peter can I pause there? Why did that happen? Why did that process take place before kovat 19?
*  Well because again
*  Trump was very critical of Janet Yellen
*  During the Obama years rightly so
*  Because Yellen kept interest rates artificially low to make Obama look good by
*  Propping up the stock market and the real estate market with cheap money
*  But doing that is what prevented a real recovery that would have benefited
*  Main Street and so those are the people that Trump was tapping into the guys on Main Street that were getting screwed as the guys on
*  Wall Street were being enriched by by bad monetary policy
*  So fed was Trump was right to criticize Yellen and then he didn't want to reappoint her because supposedly he was gonna
*  reappoint somebody that would do the right thing
*  But as pal was doing the right thing albeit too slowly
*  Pal started to correct the problem by raising interest rates and shrinking the balance sheet
*  But when that began to impact the markets Trump was like, oh he started criticizing him
*  You know, we're gonna fire you you're doing your terrible Fed chairman. He was doing the right thing
*  We need higher interest rates and unfortunately higher interest rates means the stock market is gonna go down
*  I mean, that's just the reality the real estate market is gonna go down
*  You know, we're addicted to cheap money like a drug addict is addicted to heroin
*  But if you've got a guy addicted to heroin the solution isn't more heroin, so he stays high
*  The solution is okay no more heroin and now you're gonna go through withdrawal
*  So the economy started to go through withdrawal as the Fed was withdrawing that cheap money and Trump was like no
*  I don't want I don't want withdrawal who's gonna vote for me if they're you know, everybody's hung up
*  I want to party again. I want the stock market at record highs
*  And so, you know, but so because we did this we never actually had a real recovery
*  We just you know put more air into the bubble
*  but you know when when kovat started this is important to understand so kovat 19 hits and
*  All of a sudden, you know, and I don't even know I've seen some of your discussions on on the podcast about
*  Kovat itself and and whether or not the threat is being exaggerated
*  Is it really as big a health threat as a lot of people say and you know, I'm not an expert there
*  You know, I tend to I tend to always be suspicious of government and I and I kind of think it's being exaggerated like most stuff
*  But I'm not a doctor. I'm not an immunologist
*  And so I you know, let's just take them at their word that that it's as bad as they say
*  I just want to focus on the economics of it
*  but so when kovat hits and
*  people, you know people start, you know staying home and they're not going out and you know and
*  People start losing their jobs and the economy starts tanking right?
*  the government comes in as if it's the government's job to rescue the economy and
*  The politicians say in fact Trump himself said oh we're at war I'm a wartime president
*  This is like World War two. Remember that remember what he said that? Yes
*  Yeah, it's World War two and we have to sacrifice Americans have to sacrifice to beat
*  COVID-19 the way, you know a prior generation
*  Sacrificed to beat, you know, Nazi Germany
*  Imperial Japan we have to sacrifice except what we're doing
*  Now is the complete opposite of the actual sacrifice that Americans were asked to make
*  During World War two, right apart from the fact that 16 million young men
*  Went off to war and risk their lives apart from that sacrifice the people that didn't go off to war
*  They actually sacrifice right so because 1941 when the war started
*  Not even ten percent of Americans paid any income tax at all fewer than ten percent
*  1942 there was a victory tax and after the victory tax more than a third of
*  Americans began paying income taxes. They weren't paying any income taxes before the war all of a sudden
*  They're paying income taxes and in 1942
*  They stated they created the withholding tax which Americans, you know, we pay it today
*  You think it was always there up until 1942
*  Nobody had any income taxes withheld from their pay
*  What happened was if you were among the few people who actually paid income taxes
*  You didn't write a check until April 15th of the following year. You made no payments
*  You made no quarterly payments. You had no payroll withholding that started as part of the victory tax
*  So massive tax increases on Americans in addition to that
*  The US government told Americans we need more money than this
*  You need to loan us money
*  and so the the Treasury started selling these war bonds to the public and
*  Middle-class Americans bought the equivalent of trillions of dollars of war bonds
*  So the government taxed the middle class and borrowed from the middle class to pay for the war and this is in
*  1940 we just went through the Great Depression
*  So these are Americans that just lived through a ten-year depression the worst period in American history yet
*  They had enough money
*  To loan trillions to the US government and to pay much higher taxes
*  Then they were paying before in an addition
*  Nobody got a bailout
*  No
*  businesses if you ran a restaurant and nobody was coming to your restaurant because your customers were off fighting a war and the ones that
*  Weren't fighting a war we're now working harder to pay higher taxes, you know, and they people weren't taking vacations
*  They weren't going to theaters
*  They weren't staying in hotels, but none of these small business owners got one nickel from the US government
*  The government didn't loan money to anybody didn't bail anybody out. What are we doing now the opposite?
*  The government is loaning holding wasn't that but that's a different time, right?
*  This is a time of a united country that it's facing a global threat from a tyrannical
*  German Nazi regime this it's a different situation than dealing with a
*  Virus I mean well, no, well first of all, it's Trump and other people that made the comparison to World War two
*  I understand that it this was a global threat. This was a real war
*  This was actually worse believe me COVID-19 is not as bad as having a world war not even I would much rather fight a disease
*  Than to fight
*  Hitler and Japan. I mean this is not as bad as what people had to deal with in the 40s
*  Would you agree with that? Of course? Yeah, of course. Okay
*  But that but the concept is the same
*  Government had to spend a lot of money
*  Fighting this war and where did it get the money?
*  It had to get it from the people right and if people were you know
*  Disrupted a lot of people lost money because of World War two
*  It wasn't their fault if you ran a restaurant and now your customers weren't coming because they went to fight the war
*  It wasn't your fault right that your business dried up. Let me put can I pause you for a second?
*  Do you do you think that?
*  First of all
*  We we had to do something to stop the spread of COVID-19
*  Do you think I agree? Yes, I agree, but hold on
*  We have to bail anybody out. We have a problem. We have to deal with our issues
*  We have a problem listening to each other. Let me explain it to the people that are listening
*  We're on Skype and unfortunately when you talk and I talk we can't kind of hear each other
*  And you're not wearing headphones. So it's weird this I got I got a earpiece
*  Okay, okay, but there's a little bit of a delay
*  So just let me it's this is one of the reasons why I stress it's so much better to do these things in person
*  Yeah, and I understand that it's impossible for you to do that right now
*  When you have a situation like COVID-19 and these medical experts say hey, we've got to do something
*  We've got to shut down
*  most of
*  What we do we've got to shut down a lot of businesses
*  We got to shut down schools and make things remotely
*  There's gonna be a situation where there's gonna be a lot of people that are not going to be able to work
*  But we want to keep these businesses alive
*  This is a very unique situation and this is not like any situation we've ever faced in my lifetime
*  What do you think could have been done?
*  That would have been a better solution
*  Than what the government did in terms of bailouts in terms of telling people to stay home like what could have been done
*  Yeah, well first of all you have to remember that the government doesn't have any money, right?
*  The government only has money it takes from the people one way or another
*  Right Grover Cleveland who is a president in the late 19th century. He was quoted. He had a good quote
*  He said while the the people must support the government the government should never support the people and so I agree
*  Let's say we have to shut down the economy temporarily and
*  People should have enough savings to weather the storm
*  Businesses should have enough savings to weather the storm like they did in 1940
*  Average Americans had lots of money in the bank. They weren't loaded up with debt. They didn't have credit card debt
*  They didn't have student loans. They didn't have car loans. They were they were solvent even after a Great Depression
*  They were solvent. We lived in a bubble economy. Everybody was paycheck to paycheck. Nobody had anything
*  Businesses couldn't survive if their revenue stopped workers couldn't pay their rent if they didn't get their
*  Their salary that's not right. That's that's part of the bubble, right?
*  So the fact that we were so ill prepared for a rainy day is because we had no rainy day fund
*  You should have been able to deal with this on our own, right now
*  From the government
*  Peter we're at now we basically locked down somewhere around March
*  We're four and a half months in or four months in now. That's a long rainy day
*  Four months is a third of a year. There's very few human beings that have enough money to last
*  Four months. I'm sure you do and I do but most folks out there listening don't have enough money
*  To live and feed their families and pay their mortgage or pay their rent and and pay their car payments for four months
*  That's a long fucking time
*  right, but
*  They're gonna end up suffering much more in a year or two or three as a result of the massive inflation
*  That has been unleashed to finance all the bailouts in the stimulus
*  Don't you agree that it's it's a good idea to do something just to keep everyone alive
*  Just to keep businesses alive just to keep well people in their homes just to keep well, first of all
*  First of all a lot of the businesses should have failed even before I mean the Fed has been keeping a lot of businesses afloat
*  Okay, so this is a few years ago. Hold on
*  Let's talk about COVID would have been the final nail in their coffins and now they've got another lifeline
*  But these businesses are damaging the economy see businesses that are not profitable in a free market should shut down
*  Okay, because they're squandering. Can I pause you let's talk about my business
*  I'm in the business of comedy comedy clubs are suffering terribly right now
*  Because there's very few states that are allowing people to go out wear masks socially distance and go to comedy clubs
*  LA is not allowing any of that and they haven't since March the comedy store
*  Which is my home has been shut down since March all these clubs have been shut down all across the country
*  Through no fault of their own. It's not like I know that it doesn't but it's not like it's not their fault
*  But it's not like they've done anything wrong
*  It's the state of California
*  If the state of California is going to order businesses shut down and then the state of California
*  Wants to provide some kind of economic relief
*  Let California do it and let California impose higher taxes on whoever they think should fund it
*  We can't just use the Federal Reserve as a piggy bank
*  The Federal Reserve cure is going to do more damage than the coronavirus disease
*  And I think if the states knew that they would have to bear the economic consequences of their own decision-making
*  They would do a better cost-benefit analysis on what they shut down and how they do it right right now
*  Every state is like oh, let's shut everything down and the federal government is going to bail everybody out
*  So we don't care if we put people out of work because they're going to get these enhanced benefits from the US government
*  Oh, we don't care if we shut down businesses because they're going to get these PPP grants from the government
*  But if the federal government let every state know look you make a decision
*  This you handle this the way you want and you pay for it, right?
*  So you do a cost-benefit analysis because thinking that everything is free. That is the problem
*  I understand we are doing so much damage to the economy people have no idea
*  We are going to get such a massive economic collapse far worse than what I thought was coming
*  You know when I did your show last few times, this is going to be much worse
*  We are compounding the mistakes of the past with much bigger mistakes
*  I mean if you think it's bad now with the civil unrest, it's gonna get a lot worse when there's nothing
*  There's no food. I agree when we run out of stuff. Can I pause you?
*  Yeah, last time you were on you were predicting the bubble of commercial real estate and
*  a lot of other issues
*  What what do you think is different about that situation now?
*  And how much does that compound what we're dealing with currently?
*  well, obviously the
*  Coronavirus has made you know that the problem worse for commercial real estate
*  I mean commercial real estate is gonna get killed for so many reasons
*  It was in trouble I think before COVID but COVID again just accelerated the process but obviously
*  If you are a retailer, you know, no one's coming into your store your restaurant
*  If you've got a gym if you've got a movie theater, so you're not collecting any rent
*  So you want to default and so now your landlord's not getting paid and he might have a mortgage and now he can't pay because
*  He's not getting rent. You've got all these office buildings where a lot of
*  Offices now like my company almost all my people are working from home now
*  I mean, I got some people to come into the office
*  But I got a lot of people working from home and so a lot of companies are thinking hey, I don't need all this
*  Commercial space I don't need this big in office anymore because more of my people are working from home
*  So now you have pressure on the rents and that was already happening
*  You know you had we work that blew up and they had you know
*  They had you know rented all this space that was now, you know on the market for sublease
*  But all this was inflated by the Fed keeping interest rates artificially low to prop up these bubbles
*  Made that real estate bubble very very big and so now it's gonna be far more disruptive when it pops
*  But it's got a pop, you know trying to prevent bubbles from deflating by trying to blow more air into them
*  Just makes it worse
*  Maybe you delay the day of reckoning a little bit
*  But you make the day of reckoning much worse because now you have additional mistakes that you need to reckon with I
*  understand so it's essentially like a pull off the band-aid situation and
*  We we have to have a healing moment
*  You have to let things collapse that need to collapse that should have been
*  Done a long time ago because of mismanagement
*  Yeah, and you have to understand that we're ripping the band-aid off a wound that the government inflicted us with in the first place
*  Yes, the free market never would have screwed us screwed us up this much. It was government interference in the free market
*  That's why you know capitalism gets a bad name
*  You know, that's why you know
*  We talked about on a one of these earlier podcasts about when I went to Occupy Wall Street years ago
*  And I went down to Zuccotti Park because you had all these young protesters
*  Who were blaming Wall Street for the bailouts and for the financial crisis and I was saying no
*  It's not Wall Street that took the bailouts blame the government for providing the bailouts for making them available
*  Blame the Federal Reserve for funding all this and inflating the bubble
*  Yes
*  But you know the interesting thing if I tried to do that today if I tried to go to one of these protests one of
*  These black lives matter protests or any of these you think they'd be civil
*  You think I could do that you think I could walk into a crowd of hundreds of people and take the opposite position
*  I walk out of there, you know, they would beat you to death
*  They would beat you to death a hundred percent. Yeah, so I mean
*  The loss of civility in just you know, ten years. Well, it's it's not just a loss of civility
*  it's a loss of opportunity and the loss of
*  Faith in the system and the future if we stay on the same path, that's part of the problem
*  It's a people don't believe that if we keep going the way we are going that things will work out in
*  in an
*  equitable fair and balanced way and that's where young people today one point I wanted to make though too when I went back to
*  America in 1940 was to show that the American middle class, you know was real strong
*  They could afford to pay for World War two and for and to provide for their own families, you know
*  Because now they keep comparing World War two now because we're running up as much debt now as we ran up during World War two
*  But we had the capacity to pay it back back then that was the point
*  The debt went way down debt to GDP went way down in the decades after World War two
*  Because Americans had the capacity to pay back what they borrowed to fight the war
*  We don't have that capacity now
*  I mean the debts never gonna go down the debts gonna keep on rising and rising and rising
*  Until the dollar implodes see that is the real crisis that we're headed for
*  It's gonna be a collapse in the value of the dollar because right now we're printing money
*  right and and and the government is sending it out and
*  People are able to buy stuff with it, right?
*  But that's gonna come to an end
*  Because the world is no longer going to accept US dollars as the reserve currency
*  See, that's the unique privilege that we've enjoyed for several generations now and that we've been used to the point
*  Where we're going to lose it see right now
*  We're able to print money and we use that money
*  We print to buy all sorts of stuff that the rest of the world produces that we didn't have to produce ourselves
*  But producing goods requires capital it requires labor. It requires land. It requires real resources
*  But we get all the stuff for free
*  we just create money and here you go and they send us stuff and
*  Then to make it even better for us
*  They take the money that we send them the paper and they loan it right back to us and very low rates of interest
*  They buy our bonds. They buy our mortgage-backed securities
*  So Americans get to spend all this borrowed money that they didn't save we get to consume all this stuff that we didn't produce
*  And so we have an artificially elevated standard of living we live beyond our means
*  That's gonna come to an end because foreigners are gonna realize that we're never gonna stop printing money that the deficits are never gonna be brought
*  Under control that we're gonna have QE infinity zero percentage of straights in perpetuity
*  And then they're not gonna want the dollar anymore
*  And then the dollar is gonna crash and we're not gonna be able to import anything anymore
*  And the only things we're gonna be able to buy is this stuff we make ourselves except we don't make much stuff anymore
*  So prices are gonna go through the roof. That is the real economic consequences
*  And so it's not gonna matter that the government sends you a stimulus check if you can't buy anything with it
*  Because the government can't create purchasing power they can print all the money they want but none of that printed money adds any purchasing power
*  They don't grow any food. They don't produce any products nothing. They just print money
*  Right, but there is if if the government gives money to people they will be able to buy things and people still are making things
*  But now but when the dollars value
*  Collapses see you can't keep printing trillions and trillions of dollars and expect the dollars not to lose purchasing power
*  right, right because paper money all that does is that
*  Allows us to divvy up what we produce right you have all these Americans now who used to be working doing something
*  Right. They were helping to produce a product
*  They were providing a service and now they're just at home collecting a check, right? So they're getting money for nothing
*  They didn't put anything into the pot
*  Can I pause you?
*  They want to take out of the pot with their money. Well, there's nothing in the pot
*  Right. So now the prices of everything in that pot have to go up because there's no there's no extra stuff
*  There's just more buying Peter as what's been I'm sorry as an economic expert
*  What would you have done differently if you could have advised this government and we were let's let's go back to March
*  When everything was shutting down, what would you have have advised differently?
*  Again, first of all, I would allow I would allow the states to be responsible for their own policy
*  So you you decide what you want to do in your own state as far as you know
*  What do you want? What businesses you want to close?
*  You know what what you want to do and and you pay for it
*  And if you think that certain businesses or individuals need to get money then the state will provide it based on local taxpayers
*  But what I would have done on the federal level is I would have dramatically cut government spending
*  You know even after COVID-19 because government spending is a drain on the private sector
*  It's a drag on the economy
*  it's the government taking resources away from the private sector where they would be used efficiently and
*  Squander them in the public sector. I understand. Can I pause you for a second there?
*  Can I pause you? I would have lightened the burden. What would you have what would you have when you say lighten the burden?
*  What would you have cut and how would you do that?
*  When you think about all the different aspects of the government that are essential things that need to be in place
*  What would you have cut most of most of the government money is is transfer payments where the government takes money from one person?
*  And gives it to somebody else. I mean the government shouldn't be doing that
*  That's not why we have a government in America government is here to secure our rights
*  Explain that protect our property not steal it. Can you explain that what do you mean by transfer payments?
*  Well, that's when the government takes money from one person through taxation and just hands it to somebody else or now through inflation
*  The government just prints money and gives it to people that it thinks needs it
*  But what that's not what government but let's look at the PPP
*  Let's let's look at that or the cares act right? Okay, look at all the damage that the cares act did to the economy
*  So first of all, let's look at the payroll protection plan that everybody wants to brag about right?
*  What a complete fraud this was I said from day one this would be a cesspool of fraud
*  You know, we found out last week that there were six hundred
*  approximately hedge funds private equity funds asset management companies that got
*  PPP loans and they're not even loans because you don't have to pay them back
*  So it's free money, right and I could have gotten one of those loans if I wanted to I just didn't want to lie to
*  Qualify can you stop right there?
*  Did can you stop right there?
*  Most people don't know that these hedge funds got this money
*  most people think this money went out to
*  American businesses to keep these businesses from collapsing because we need restaurants
*  We need you know movie theaters and all these all these various
*  American businesses that we assume this money went to prevent from collapsing explain that please
*  Yeah, well you didn't have to all you had to do is apply and according to the
*  Small Business Administration as long as the money you asked for was less than two million
*  They didn't ask any question because in theory you were supposed to need the money, right?
*  You are supposed to have some disruption like if you ran a restaurant and your restaurant is shut down. You don't have any revenue
*  There's nobody eating in your restaurant. So you have no money coming in. So how do you pay your your waiters?
*  How do you pay your your bus boys you have no money
*  So the government was like oh we'll give you some money as long as you don't fire your workers
*  We'll give you some money to pay your workers
*  But a company like mine, right my god
*  I have two or three companies that I could have taken money from and I didn't but you look at my like my asset management
*  Company your Pacific gas at management. I'm making more money now than I was before covid and
*  I was a case with most firms that are in my industry. Can you explain how that revenue was never shut down?
*  How's that possible? How are you making more money?
*  Because all I do is charge fees to manage people's money. I didn't stop managing their money because of covid
*  I mean, we just keep on managing it and we keep on billing for our fees. We bill every quarter
*  We weren't even shut down
*  Even in Puerto Rico where they were shutting down everything. I mean I was considered an essential business financial services
*  So I you know, I people can come to my office
*  even though I let a lot of them work from home and remember all
*  Our customers they talk to us on the phone
*  So when I want to talk to a customer the customer doesn't drive down in my office
*  You know, they just call me on the phone and so there's no physical contact
*  So there isn't any disruption all of the revenues that the hedge funds were getting at the asset management companies all that revenue continued
*  Unabated not a single job was in jeopardy, right all these companies that got government money
*  See that the government wants to pretend that these loans save jobs
*  They didn't say these jobs these jobs were never in jeopardy of being lost
*  So all that happened is that it's a windfall the asset management companies the hedge funds
*  They got extra money from the government to make their profits even bigger on
*  Top of the fact that the Federal Reserve printed all this money which inflated asset prices
*  We charge fees on those assets. And so as the Fed inflates assets
*  Wall Street has inflated fees. We make more money was a double bailout for a lot of these Wall Street firms
*  So that was one of the frauds but even in the case where the government is actually giving companies
*  Giving money to companies that need it right that otherwise would have fired their workers
*  Look, we don't know
*  You know what the future demand for restaurants and bars and theaters is going to be I
*  Personally believe that demand is going to be diminished for a long time. It's not just a temporary thing
*  I don't think it's going to come back to the way it was
*  Especially since the way it was was a bubble see that's what people don't get they say we want to go back to the way
*  It was before COVID we can't reflate that bubble. We have to start spending less
*  We have to save more and that means we can't go out as often
*  We need to build up our savings again because we've depleted it. So there's going to be less demand for restaurants
*  There's going to be less demand for a lot of things. We have to let these companies downsize. Look at the airlines
*  Americans are going to be flying less. There's no question in my mind that
*  Domestic air travel is going to be down for many many years even after kovat is is is cured
*  So the airlines have to shrink they have to lay people off. They have to be profitable
*  They have to you know, effectively utilize resources. So to the extent that the government
*  Prevents businesses from laying off workers that really should be laid off
*  They ultimately compromise the viability of those businesses and in the long run
*  They may end up putting people out of business that would have stayed in business
*  Maybe they you know
*  Maybe somebody had a hundred employees and maybe they could have downsized to 30 employees and at least those 30 employees
*  Would have a job
*  But instead they keep those employees on the payroll for long enough to the point where the whole company has to go out of business
*  So now everybody loses their job
*  Now when you when you say hedge funds were able to receive PPE and you're saying that they did so while they were still earning
*  Profits and there wasn't any
*  Diminishment of their income. Why were they able to receive PPP?
*  Well, that's the problem with government programs
*  There's always fraud look whenever the government is giving out free money
*  People try to qualify for it now, you know, you can read the fine print that I know a lot of other people could say
*  Hey, you know Peter and said as long as your business was affected by kovat and look. Yes, my business was affected
*  I mean people worked at home that used to work in the office
*  But you had us you had to basically testify or certify that the money was necessary to support the ongoing
*  Operations of your business which for most of these firms it wasn't and you also had to say that you had no other source of capital
*  Which again people were lying, but the government basically said if you ask for less than two million dollars
*  We're gonna look to what other way we're not gonna vet these loans. Hold on
*  Did they actually say that they're non recourse
*  There's no collateral so a lot of businesses that we're gonna fail anyway, and that we're gonna lay off all their workers took the money
*  They're still gonna lay off all their workers
*  But now they're not gonna have to pay the money back because they're gonna bankrupt their business and once your business is bankrupt
*  Even though you fire all your workers you're under no obligation to repay the loan
*  Okay, did they actually say that if you ask for less than two million dollars
*  We're gonna look the other way like what were you taking that's right?
*  It well that what what it says is we'll assume that
*  You're filing an honest claim right because they're saying that if you if you ask for more than two million dollars
*  We're gonna vet the claim and we're gonna take a look at your situation
*  But it's set on the small business administration that will just assume you're being honest, right?
*  So if you ask for less than two million, we'll assume you're being honest
*  Well the minute they say it I should I'm gonna lie. That's the problem
*  So many people like whenever the government has a program it gets abused that that's part of the problem with government spending, right?
*  Everybody tries to qualify like just like the unemployment benefits this crazy
*  deal with the
*  Enhanced unemployment benefits you have a lot of people now who are being paid twice as much not to work as they were earning when
*  They were working now you create that kind of incentive
*  You have a lot of people now the last thing they want is to go back to work
*  Because they're making so much more money not working than they were they were working and most of these people if you have a job
*  Where you're making you know ten fifteen dollars an hour twenty dollars an hour chances are you don't love your job
*  I mean you're not working because you enjoy what you're doing. You're working because you need the money
*  You need to pay the bills. Well, if you can make the same amount of money or more
*  Without working I mean who's not gonna go for that
*  I mean
*  I don't blame anybody for not wanting to work if the government is paying you more not to work than what your boss was
*  Paying you to work and of course, you know, there's more than just working
*  You have to get up early in the morning. You got to fight traffic, you know, you know, you got other expenses
*  Maybe you got to you know, put your kids in daycare
*  You know, you got a you know laundry, you know
*  Dry clean your clothes women women could spend an hour in the morning doing their hair doing makeup
*  They don't get paid for that, but they got to do all that, you know and add all that to commute time
*  I mean, so there's a big cost of working and then of course you give up all your leisure when you're at work
*  You can't have fun. The government now has created a situation where people are getting paid to have fun
*  So, I mean, how do you end that what politician is now going to take this away?
*  I understand what you're saying about that and I do agree with that and that was very shocking to me that
*  People that I know who have friends that are on unemployment
*  Don't want the economy to reopen because they would lose money and I was like my
*  Hire people but you can't get hold on. Why did you work? I get money not working
*  So, you know what? So we'll do Peter Peter Peter Peter hold on. Please cash
*  Jesus Christ and they're unemployed Peter you can keep getting those benefits and then they take a job under the table for cash
*  Hold on what's going on? I believe that but but that doesn't make sense with hedge funds with hedge funds
*  If you're talking we're talking about small businesses
*  Does a hedge fund qualify as a small business and we're talking about them receiving PPP and
*  As long as it's under two million dollars is no questions asked if they can't demonstrate a loss of income
*  How are they receiving this money and what should have been done differently?
*  Look, I look as soon as I heard about the program
*  I went online and I doubt and I you know, I got the application just to you know to see what it was
*  You don't have to prove anything all you have to do is you have to have fewer than 500 employees
*  Which is pretty much everybody. I mean most of us in this business don't have 500 employees
*  And then what you did is you just listed your payroll, right and they gave you
*  Three months of your payroll. So whatever you pay all your workers, right and it was capped
*  So if you had some people that were making a million dollars a year, they wouldn't cover the whole thing, right?
*  It was like I forget what the limit was maybe a hundred grand a year or something like that
*  but what they did is you could take all of your payroll for all your employees and then take three months worth of it and
*  The government said we will give you a loan
*  No questions asked for three months of your payroll and as long as you don't fire more than a certain percentage of those people
*  You never have to pay the money back
*  So it didn't say anything about proving that you actually needed it proving that you know that your revenue went down
*  So the government opened up an opportunity for all sorts of people
*  I mean I could have had a few hundred thousand dollars if I wanted it
*  All I had to do is lie and claim I needed the money
*  But you know look as much as I don't want the government to have money and I'm already living in Puerto Rico
*  So I I'm not paying taxes
*  So, I mean people can say I'm a hypocrite because I'm living in Puerto Rico, but I'm not committing fraud
*  I'm being honest anybody that wants to pay less taxes is free to move to Puerto Rico
*  But I didn't want to commit fraud
*  I didn't want to sign a document and attest to the fact that I needed the money when I knew I didn't and
*  What business owner needs the money like that?
*  I mean if you're managing other people's money for a living and you can't handle, you know a
*  Downturn in your business and what business do you have managing people's money if you can't even manage your own?
*  I can't believe that anything under 500 employees is a small business. That seems like a well
*  That seems like a regular business like what what the fuck world that we live in in where
*  500 employees or less is a small business that seems like you know business. Yeah, well, they're not well, believe me
*  They're not like big corporations that have thousands and thousands and they're also there was other criteria
*  Like how many locations you can have I can't remember all of it
*  I know a lot of the people that applied were just self-employed people
*  Yeah, you know, so and so they were businesses of one and so they got to you know, they got their own
*  Pay, but you didn't have to prove because a lot of people's businesses were not disrupted
*  Because if you didn't work with the public in a public setting, right?
*  If you just sat at a desk and worked on a computer and a telephone, you know, your business wasn't disrupted
*  So why do you need any government money? Yeah
*  Even if you needed the money the federal government shouldn't supply it by printing money
*  People don't realize how much damage we have done to this economy the US government the Federal Reserve is doing far more damage than
*  COVID-19 that's what people don't get we're gonna we're gonna reap the whirlwind for what the government is sowing
*  Well kudos to you for not taking that money. I really appreciate that
*  Giving your understanding of what's legal and not legal and the fact you're willing to move all the way to Puerto Rico to avoid federal income
*  Taxes kudos to you. I didn't only do it for the taxes
*  I didn't know lifestyle and all that kind of stuff there. I mean the taxes make it make it make it affordable
*  I understand there are other reasons to live. I was gonna move the Florida
*  I mean, you know, I was gonna go down there and so I ended up going to to Puerto Rico
*  Listen to me fuck, Florida saw that shit off and sell it to the Russians. I
*  I'm happy that you didn't take that money. I really am and but I really I
*  Want to understand what would have been the best maneuver if
*  if the federal government had like let's imagine that you and Trump were besties and
*  He's like hey Peter Schiff. What should I do? What should I do?
*  We're gonna have to do something that we have this COVID-19 situation. We're gonna have to
*  Protect the citizens the United States from this weird novel
*  Coronavirus that we don't really totally understand at the moment, especially in February in March
*  We really didn't understand what the consequences of this virus were
*  What do you think they should have done differently? Yeah
*  Well again, first of all we have to acknowledge how weak the economy was before COVID right that we didn't have a great economy
*  The economy was a mess that people were broke, right? Everybody was living paycheck to paycheck. Everybody was levered up
*  Can I stop you there?
*  Yeah, but we have to recognize the fact that we it was pouring out and we had nothing saved for a rainy day
*  Yes, we need to acknowledge the fact and we have to understand why were we so broke?
*  Can I stop you? Can I stop you? Peter, Peter, Peter, Peter. This is so frustrating to do these things with a delay
*  I'm so sorry, but when Trump talks about COVID he talks about it being this interruption
*  For this world's greatest economy this thing that he had created during his administration
*  What's wrong with that narrative?
*  Well, I said that's a lie
*  You know, that's one of the things that frustrates me about Trump is pretending the economy was great
*  Because somehow he thinks that because he's president the economy should be great
*  I mean that might be his own ego. Hey, I'm the president so we must have a great economy, but we don't it's the same economy
*  He inherited from Obama only more highly leveraged and it's all the debt
*  It's all the corporate debt all the individual debt all the government debt
*  That's why we're so ill prepared for any crisis whether it's COVID-19 or anything else
*  We were broke before this happened. I said it's raining out and we've got no rainy day fund
*  So the first thing we have to acknowledge is why was the economy so screwed up?
*  How did it get screwed up? And that was because of the Fed keeping interest rates too low
*  discouraging people from saving rewarding people from borrowing
*  Putting too much emphasis on the stock market and not enough on the real economy and government spending too much money
*  Government making us less productive by spending too much and regulating too much and subsidizing too much
*  So we screwed up the economy. So what we needed to recognize is okay
*  We need to reverse all that right and yes now we have an extra reason to do that because now we have COVID-19
*  But we need to restore sound money. We need to let interest rates go up
*  We need to let asset prices go down and and and we have to build up our ability to deal with COVID-19
*  Instead we're just printing even more money. We're juicing up the economy with even more debt
*  We're pushing up the Nasdaq to new highs. This is not productive
*  So this is making the problem worse that dwarfs
*  COVID-19 but I agree because of all the mistakes of the past because of all the bad monetary and fiscal policy
*  We were not prepared for this crisis. We weren't prepared for any crisis
*  Like we couldn't fight World War two again, like we fought in 1940. We're a shadow of a former self
*  We don't have the industrial might we don't have the savings
*  So we don't have the tax base for the government to tack into tap into to actually pay for a war
*  We just have a printing press and we can only use that because foreigners are dumb enough to accept our money
*  And you know, they're not going to be accepting it much longer. So this is bad news, right? Anyway
*  You shake it
*  America has a day of reckoning and I would have rather had trump level with the public and say you know
*  What the day of reckoning is now?
*  And yes, I know covid-19 is bad
*  But we got a lot of other problems too, and we have to deal with it. We got to pay the piper
*  Right, if they were saying nobody has to suffer nobody has to sacrifice
*  You know what we have to suffer we have to sacrifice. I'm not happy about that
*  But it's better than the alternative which is kicking the can down the road again
*  So that we have to suffer even worse, which is that's the deal with the devil that we made
*  so
*  We should have you know
*  made government smaller
*  And look, maybe we maybe we should have dealt with a crisis more like sweden
*  You know, I mean a lot of people are giving shit to sweden
*  But you know sweden didn't want to make that bargain. They didn't want to print all this money
*  They didn't they you know, they bore their own costs and so they had a a a different approach
*  That didn't do as much economic damage and you know our commie was so screwed up
*  I mean the swedish economy is in much better shape than ours and not because they're socialists like bernie sanders thinks because they're not
*  Because they're actually more capitalist than we are
*  Sweden's more capitalist than we are
*  Yeah, you know the rich pay lower percentage of taxes in sweden than we do
*  You know, they don't even have an inheritance tax. There's no estate tax in sweden really zero
*  No, yeah, I would have never guessed that
*  Sweden
*  Sweden became a very rich country because they were a capitalist country and once they became very rich they experimented with socialism
*  Which was an unfortunate experiment because there's no reason to experiment with socialism because every time it's tried it failed
*  But they decided to try it and of course it failed
*  And so they had to start rolling it back once they saw all the damage that the welfare state in sweden was creating
*  So they started dialing it back and and you know, they've gone a long way. They haven't eradicated it completely
*  But you know
*  And if you look at the tax proposals by joe biden
*  I mean we're going to go so far above sweden as far as the the confiscatory levels of taxation
*  I mean look what joe biden is wants to do
*  With the income tax the corporate tax and the personal tax he wants to raise
*  the
*  corporate tax
*  from 21 to 28
*  But then he wants to raise the dividend tax from 24 where it is now
*  to about
*  40 something ish. I forget the exact amount
*  But corporations are taxed twice, right?
*  They're taxed when they earn the money and then when they distribute it to the owners
*  So you have to add up both rates, but then he also wants to apply
*  Social security taxes to those dividends not just the medicare taxes
*  So he basically wants to take the corporate the effective corporate tax rate up from about 40% where it is now
*  To about 60% that's where he wants it, you know, which is a you know, a huge increase or 70
*  I forget the word. It's a it's a it's a massive number
*  and it really is fascism because the government ends up owning all these businesses because if you
*  If you take
*  More than half of the income of a business. I mean you basically own that business
*  I mean, it's your business you're getting half the more than half the income, right?
*  So the government is really nationalizing these corporations
*  That's a very taxation, but it's not the corporations. It's the individual shareholders, right? They're they're the ones that own the business
*  That's a very important way to look at it the way you look at it there where half of the income
*  Is going to someone else and let me I wanted to stop you for a second
*  But I wanted to hear that rant. There's
*  a connection that people make
*  from
*  It's they connect socialism to empathy
*  socialism to kindness socialism to people that are less greedy
*  Socialism to people that are more interested in in a community
*  This is and this is coming from a person like myself who has no economic
*  86% of what I know about the economic world is from you
*  So i'm an idiot, all right, I listen to people who are experts
*  But when I think of the idea of community and of helping people out
*  I think of the idea like what what's wrong with some socialist policies. We have the fire department. That's a socialist policy
*  Nobody wants a fire department to be
*  Only for people who have money we want the fire department to be for the community
*  It doesn't matter if you have zero dollars
*  If your house is on fire, we're all going to pay for the fire department to come put it out
*  We all have a vested interest in keeping your house from burning down and you dying and the whole community from burning
*  Right. We have these certain agreements. There's a big difference between that type of program. But hold on a second
*  You're right. You're 100% right
*  But it's the idea behind it that comes from idealistic people and i'm putting myself in this category
*  I am often naive and idealistic but also
*  Ruthless in my assessment of human character
*  It's a big contradiction because I think there's a lot of people that really could do more than they're doing and they know they could
*  And they want to make excuses and it's part of the reason why throughout history
*  They've left people behind there's certain people that if you had a tribe and you had to make it over this mountain
*  And bob is fucking lazy and he's like you got to carry me bro. I'm like bob. We're both walking. Come on, man
*  Bob's not supposed to make it. He's not supposed to make it
*  We want him to make it but we don't want our kids to die. We don't want our mom to starve
*  We got to keep going bob you lazy fuck. Come on, bro
*  There's always been people like bob and it's part of the problem with humans. So i'm a contradiction
*  But hold on a second. I understand but i'm going to give you but
*  I that's what attracts people to socialist ideas is just they're nice
*  That they want everybody to do better socialist
*  Socialist ideas are very appealing
*  I mean I get that and that's why they're very popular with young people who don't know any better
*  They don't have enough life experience, but this is the bridge and peter schiff
*  This is the bridge because a guy like you who really understands economics
*  Can talk to a guy like me and we can explain it to everybody because otherwise we just have
*  And i'm definitely not arguing with you
*  But your argument versus people who disagree with you's argument you have this but there's a there's an opportunity to make this bridge
*  And for us to understand each other i'm hoping I think that's why i'm here
*  That I listen to make that bridge and I appreciate that I want to help people evolve
*  From being socialist to being capitalist because capitalists aren't mean. Yes, they just understand the unintended consequences of these
*  Well-intentioned programs when that the left is in favor of but they don't understand that they actually backfire and make all the problems
*  That they're trying to solve worse. It isn't part of the problem with your fire department
*  Isn't the part when you have a local fire department, right?
*  That fire department is there to put out any fire at any house, right? So everybody in the community
*  Benefits from having a fire department. It's not there just for one person. It's for everybody in the community
*  We're talking about
*  Where the government takes money specifically from one person?
*  And gives it to somebody else for their specific benefit because they think they need it for whatever problem
*  Whoever reason they need the money agreed and this would be like bob wanting money from you
*  Our lazy friend bob we're talking about
*  I am all in favor of
*  Private charity i'm all in favor of people voluntarily helping out their fellow man
*  And americans will do that. I mean we didn't do that
*  We did that a lot more in the past when the government didn't take so much of our income and taxes
*  We had a lot more money
*  I mentioned grover cleveland when he said that quote about the government not supporting the people there was a bill
*  to appropriate
*  $10,000
*  For some farmers in texas who had been hit by a drought
*  And grover cleveland vetoed the bill because he said look there's nothing in the constitution that allows the government
*  To give money to people just because they need it
*  I mean, this is not right
*  We can't take money from the taxpayers and just give it to somebody because we feel they're in need and so he vetoed
*  That bill but after he vetoed it the farmers got more than 10 times that amount of money in private donations
*  From individual americans who wanted to help out. That's a that's good
*  That's a great thing your own money at a charitable giving that is great. That is noble
*  Yeah, but when you steal money from somebody else and give that money, there's no nobility in that
*  That's theft. I don't care what you do with the money after you steal it stealing is wrong
*  I see what you're saying. It's I like what you're saying
*  Is there an opportunity where these two things can merge where people can realize like hey
*  We need less taxes and more charitable donations and it's both possible
*  And you would probably save money and we could figure out a way to distribute that money in an equitable way that you have
*  Control over so if there's certain charities that you really feel strongly about like cancer research
*  The people who are likely to give the most to charity are wealthier people because they have more discretionary income
*  And if you have a lot of wealthy people who are paying 40 50
*  Taxes and I was doing that I was paying about half of my money
*  In taxes before I moved to puerto rico, right? I didn't have any special tax breaks
*  I paid about almost half my money in taxes
*  So because half the money went to the government I had a lot less money that I could be charitable with
*  Right. I mean I had I had all the money I needed to take care of myself
*  The money that was taken away from me by government was money that I would have invested to help grow the economy
*  Or maybe I could have used it
*  in direct charitable giving and and the other benefit
*  Of when you allow more private sector charity
*  Private sector charities are much more efficient because they really care about the people they're trying to help
*  Governments don't give a damn
*  When you have a government program that program exists to benefit the bureaucracy of the program
*  So they squander the money and the last thing they want to do
*  Is is end poverty because then they there's no longer a need for their program. They want to perpetuate dependency
*  You know if you go back to the the great society in the 1960s if you look
*  At the declining poverty rates in the 1940s 1950s
*  You know leading up to the 1960s when we had the you know, all the civil rights and all this big war on poverty
*  We were beating poverty
*  We were kicking poverty's butt poverty rates were really falling in this country until the government declared war on poverty
*  And then poverty won that is the problem the government created poverty. They didn't eliminate it. Well, what should they have done differently?
*  They should have allowed free market capitalism to keep lifting people out of poverty
*  Look the reason people are poor is because they're not earning enough money. Well, how do people earn more money?
*  They become more productive
*  How do you get more productive you acquire skills and you have capital you you you your your employer provides you with capital
*  That makes your labor more productive and because you're more productive you can earn more money and that lifts you out of poverty
*  So it's free market capitalism that lifts people out of poverty
*  And so the smaller the government is the more capitalism we have the more wealth we can create the more employment opportunities we can create
*  Government just gets in the way. Can I pause you for a second? So
*  What you're saying is there's an opportunity to be compassionate without like the demand
*  For you being compassionate by the federal government and if people had to spend less money on the government
*  There's opportunities for them to donate more money to charities
*  And this this would be like a better this would be a better way of managing our money and our charity and
*  all these things
*  Yes, it's much more efficient voluntary giving look when people give money voluntarily their own money
*  They don't want it to be squandered. They don't want it to be wasted
*  I mean whatever you give the charities you always look at the charity and you want to know hey if I give you a thousand dollars
*  How much of it is used in bureaucracy and how much goes to the recipients?
*  Isn't that shocking and you can say hey
*  We're going to take 10 cents to run the charity and actually 90 cents is going to go to the to the people that we're trying
*  To help right but isn't the government it's the other way around
*  They take in a dollar and only 10 cents actually goes to the people that need the money
*  The rest of it is is absorbed in the bureaucracy. There's no incentive to be efficient
*  Charities have to be efficient or nobody will give them money government has no incentive to be efficient because they take your money
*  There's no voluntary interaction there
*  They take your money from you and so they can be as inefficient as possible
*  But then the private charity wants to help people out so they no longer need the charity
*  The government wants to keep people impoverished so they're in constant need of the charity because that way they can get their vote
*  The government knows if they steal money from peter and pay paul that they'll always get paul's vote
*  And that's what they're concerned about. They want to keep people entrapped in poverty so that they'll be reliable votes
*  Is that what they want or do they just want to maintain this system that they have control over because if they just released everything
*  To the public sector like if they they if it's both or the private sector
*  But if they just release but if they everything from policing to
*  The the water purification to everything they do if they just went instead of the government handling everything
*  They just allowed it to the private sector
*  What
*  How would we manage whether or not they were doing the good of the people overall like that's what everybody's worried about
*  What everybody's worried about is big business assuming this
*  Monopolistic gigantic monolith that crushes everything before it and pollutes the rivers. That's what we're worried about
*  So the idea of the government stepping in for business is to keep business from
*  Only growing and not growing with concern for the consequences of all the other people around it
*  That's where everybody gets real suspicious, right?
*  Wouldn't you agree and and and they shouldn't be and this is something that always kind of bothers me that
*  People just attribute sinister motives to private businessmen
*  Yet they think politicians are angels and just there to do the lord's work
*  I mean, there's just as many greedy people who go into politics as who go into business
*  In fact, probably more but there's a big difference. See I have protection
*  Because if a greedy person goes into private business his greed can only help me
*  right because the way a business grows and gets bigger is by
*  Selling more products and services. Well, why would I buy those products and services? I have to like them
*  I have to think they're better than the products or services that some other businesses is offering me
*  And I have to value those goods and services more than the money i'm voluntarily exchanging to get them
*  So the beauty of the free market is that you have all these businesses who may be greedy
*  Competing with one another to best satisfy my desires my needs to make me happy
*  And and if they don't make me happy if they can't satisfy my disease, I don't buy their products agreed
*  They have to win me over they they have to woo me and seduce me to get my business
*  So I don't have to be worried about a greedy businessman who wants to make money because he could only make money by making my life
*  Better on the other hand you take a greedy person and you give them the power of government
*  They can make my life miserable. They don't have to get me to voluntarily do anything
*  They just take my money by brute force
*  And they just do to me whatever they want
*  So where you have to fear greed and power is when it's in government where it can actually harm you
*  Okay, not in the private sector where it can help you. I know someone's gonna say well
*  What if there's a criminal? What if somebody is stealing my money? Yes
*  They're violating the law and we need government to protect me from thieves
*  But businessmen that are honestly convincing me without fraud or deception but are being honest and i'm buying their product
*  That you know, their greed doesn't help me
*  Right, it doesn't hurt me. It only helps me
*  I think I think we're in agreement on a lot of this especially what you said that we need government to protect people from
*  A business getting out of control and demonizing people
*  But it doesn't mean that capitalism in of itself is a demonic thing a bad thing. It's a good thing
*  No, and you think you can elevate what we're doing now, but all the wall street bailouts, that's not capitalism
*  Right the banks that were over leveraged in 2008 should have been allowed to fail
*  Investors should have lost money. None of this is capitalism bailing out companies that should fail is not capitalism
*  Do you think it's corruption? Do you think it's a crime like when you say it's not capitalism, then what is it?
*  Well, I mean you can call it statism a crony capitalism fascism
*  So I mean there's a lot of ways you can describe it corporatism, but it's not free enterprise. It's not capitalism
*  Failure is an important part of capitalism
*  Right, because if you look at the science of economics, what is economics about?
*  It's about how do you satisfy?
*  unlimited human
*  Desires unlimited demand with limited resources, right? We have scarce resources. They're not, you know infinite
*  We have so much land labor capital and so we have to figure out how to organize our resources
*  In the way to satisfy as many
*  You know demands as we can
*  and and so
*  businesses compete with each other for those resources
*  And the businesses that combine them in a way that they can generate a profit
*  That means that they're adding value that means that the goods they're producing
*  Are more valuable than the resources they consumed in the process of producing them. So that's a good thing
*  but when businesses are taking resources and
*  their products
*  Cannot recover the cost of production they are squandering our resources and those businesses need to fail
*  So those resources can be freed up to be utilized more effectively by some other entrepreneur doing something else
*  So we need companies that can't generate a profit to go bankrupt that the profit and loss
*  Is the thermometer that tells you if you're doing the right thing if you're making a profit keep doing it because you're creating value
*  If you're losing money, then stop you're destroying value. Your business is making us poorer
*  So the market is trying to function so that we can have an optimal amount of economic growth
*  Then you have the government coming in and deciding to subsidize businesses that it doesn't want to fail
*  You know because oh we you know, we might lose some votes you see there's a there's a concept
*  about the seen in the unseen
*  And politicians are concerned about what you can see
*  Because when the politician bails out a company and they save the jobs of these workers
*  Everybody can see that and they can take credit for the jobs
*  They supposedly save but what you don't see are the jobs that were never created or might have got destroyed
*  Because the government misdirected capital from where the market would have put it to where the government wants it
*  So we destroy productive jobs in order to save non-productive jobs. That makes us poor
*  But the politician takes credit for the good that he supposedly does
*  But he doesn't get any of the blame for the bad that nobody can actually attribute to his action
*  Is is it possible that?
*  There could be a cap on the amount of like we all agree that everyone there needs to be some regulations, right in terms of
*  environmental impact and a bunch of
*  Different things that corporations can do wrong with regard to fucking over their workers or whatever. They're doing wrong
*  There has to be some government. You can't just allow people
*  To thrive and do whatever they want to do. You have to have some sort of regulations, right?
*  So who decides you can't violate people's rights, but give me an example when you're saying there has to be some
*  rules
*  To protect workers from their employers. Like what are you talking about there in particular?
*  Well, I mean if you have a company that gets enormous just absolutely enormous and they control all the jobs in the region
*  They could really dictate how much money people get per hour and they could make it really poor and terrible
*  And you could say that people have the the right to just leave or find something else or create a better future
*  That is possible. I mean they can do that
*  But if something controls but assuming there's something controls an enormous guy really big right?
*  Right not because it had some special monopoly granted to it by the government, right?
*  It didn't get a big government subsidy. It's just commercially effective law making it illegal to compete
*  Right this company got so big in a free market
*  That meant it got really big because it was just providing the best
*  services
*  To its customers, but also if it was able to employ that many people
*  It must have been offering those people a good deal. Otherwise, they wouldn't have taken the job, right?
*  That's not necessarily true that's not necessarily true
*  Because if there was no other jobs available if you live in a place that would have been there would have been some jobs
*  Originally, I mean there's no way that there's just one business in the entire community
*  But if you're born into this and you're 16 years old you're shit out of luck
*  And that corporation does have control over you if you're if you're born into it if you're 16 years old
*  Okay, you're in high school and getting your first job and the only job is at walmart. You're working at walmart if that's all you have
*  You know, it's it's assuming walmart is the only potential employer now. I I would say that that's not going to be the case
*  I mean the reason that you're not getting a job when you're 16 is probably because the minimum wage is making you
*  Unemployable and and we can get into that discussion because i'd like to talk about minimum wage. But first let's talk about
*  Um how businesses compete for workers just like they compete for customers, right? Because I have three businesses
*  I hire people right and I just can't
*  Pay my workers, you know, uh, you know a tiny wage
*  Because they're not going to work for me. Don't you agree there should be a minimum wage that are in demand
*  There's plenty of people that are bidding against me for those same workers, right?
*  And so I have to pay the market rate. I can't just underpay them. They'll go work someplace else
*  I understand but do you think there should be a minimum wage?
*  No, there should be zero minimum wage. Wow, that's we've discussed that before I know but
*  I still don't think there should be a minimum wage is because I think individuals should be free
*  To accept employment opportunities that they want to accept see the minimum wage doesn't hurt businesses
*  It hurts individuals that have low skills
*  Right and that's always the problem when you when you have people defending the minimum wage
*  They are opposing minimum wage hikes. They always say oh it's going to hurt businesses because you know, it's going to increase their labor costs
*  You know what?
*  It doesn't necessarily increase their labor costs because they don't hire as many workers, right?
*  They hire skilled workers instead of unskilled workers. They automate they find ways to do without workers
*  They outsource. Uh, they they hire people in other countries
*  The minimum wage law hurts the most
*  Low skilled people and they tend to be young people teenagers
*  minorities
*  Uh, that's who get get hit the hardest, you know before we had all these programs
*  You know that the black teenage unemployment rate once upon a time was actually lower than the white teenage unemployment rate
*  Now it's like double or triple as high but before we had all these laws it was actually lower
*  Because they got disproportionately impacted by the minimum wage law which prices them out of work
*  I mean basically if you're a 16 year old kid when were these laws implemented?
*  Well, the minimum wage didn't really start until the great depression, right?
*  So it started but it didn't apply to there were a lot of jobs that it were exempted from it
*  So it really started kicking in more in the 1960s and then it really you know started
*  Can I ask you this playing role? Has anybody ever tried to have no minimum wage as an experiment like maybe a town or a city?
*  Well, first of all
*  We had no minimum wage before it was implemented and we had much lower rates of unemployment real unemployment
*  And this is the great depression that don't have the minimum wage
*  There's not that many left anymore
*  I mean most countries have made this mistake because the minimum wage is good politics because it sounds good, right?
*  If you're for the minimum wage, it sounds like you care, right? Oh, yeah, we you know
*  Is anybody against you know people working for low wages? No, okay
*  So it sounds good, right? But all you do is you destroy jobs and you destroy employment opportunities
*  But there are countries like singapore for an example has no minimum wage, you know
*  And wait a minute don't they can you don't they can you?
*  Singapore don't they cane you if you graffiti shit
*  Right, that's not me. That's the best place. I know they frown at that on that over there. That was that was a famous place
*  I'm talking about that. I understand. I know we're talking about minimum wage
*  I mean, Switzerland doesn't really have I mean, there's other countries that have some kind of weird minimum
*  But you know, it's not the same as as ours
*  I feel like I feel like there could be a minimum wage and we still hold the same values that you're talking about
*  In terms of competition to keep people from getting fucking shitty with their employees
*  Have you ever seen an employer like yell at their employees or like being like one of those?
*  corporate gathering situations where
*  Someone has a lot of control over their employees now
*  imagine
*  If that guy was making all the money and he was only giving these employees a dollar an hour and making them
*  Living they would quit but it's not slavery. I agree with you
*  Remaining your job if you like it if you think it's the best alternative look people quit all the time because they can get a better job
*  Right. So by definition if the best job I can get is the job I have
*  And nobody will offer to pay me more money then i'm not underpaid if nobody will pay me more. It's a free open market
*  There's all kinds of employers out there and remember you're free to work for yourself
*  Nobody forces anybody to accept a job everybody can start their own business everybody can be self-employed, right?
*  So if you don't think your boss is paying you what you're worth then quit and and start your own business
*  I feel I completely feel where you're coming from. But couldn't we just say?
*  That there's a level of paying if you make someone work 40 hours a week
*  And they don't have enough money for food or shelter after 40 hours of week
*  Couldn't we say that maybe that is not a good level like let's let's just as a community
*  So everybody agrees we're all competing
*  But let's let's make it so that if someone is under your employment and it's a human being and they're doing 40 hours of work
*  Every week they should have enough money for food and shelter. That seems reasonable as a community
*  I know what you're saying in terms. I know what you're saying from like this economic standpoint
*  I know what you're saying like let your free market capitalism
*  Let it ride figure out get paid what you're worth and if you don't feel like you're getting paid enough quit
*  I understand what you're saying, but wouldn't it be nice? Let's backtrack then. Okay, so go ahead in general, right?
*  If you don't have any skills, right?
*  If the most you're able to earn at your job
*  And let's say there's no minimum wage and you're just a young kid and you don't have any skills, right?
*  and the most you can earn is four dollars an hour that's because
*  Again, it's you're paid based on your productivity
*  Businesses are there to make a profit for the owner of the business because that businessman is taking a lot of risk
*  He's bearing the potential for losing money. Of course he has to you know, and so
*  A businessman is not going to hire somebody if they're not adding value to the business. So if somebody can add
*  Five dollars of value to my business. I'm not going to pay him
*  7.25 an hour because i'm going to lose
*  225 for every hour that person works. So the only way I can hire somebody who is providing
*  Five dollars worth of value is if I can pay him four dollars, right then I can make a dollar for every hour
*  He works. I'm not the business is not there to lose money. They're there to make money
*  So let's say you're a young kid and you can only provide five dollars worth of value
*  And so you get a job for four dollars and your employer makes a buck an hour off of you
*  Chances are you don't have a family you're young you're living with your parents. You don't have rent
*  You don't have you know, so making a little bit of money is okay
*  You just need some spending money to go to a movies or maybe go out on a date or something
*  You don't need a lot of money. What's important is the work experience having that job?
*  Developing some skills get your foot in the door step on that first ladder of the job the rung of the job ladder
*  So that by the time you're 30
*  And you're ready to settle down and get married and have kids
*  You've now increased your skills to the point that you can make 50 dollars an hour where you can afford to support a family
*  If you try to tell a business that you need to pay somebody who has no skills
*  And as minimal economic value if you have to pay that person enough so that you can support a family
*  Nobody's going to hire that person. All you're doing is pricing those people out of a job
*  So it's really good to say it's not right if somebody is working
*  And only making you know, ten dollars an hour and they can't support a family. It's not the employer's responsibility
*  It's not his fault that he's hiring somebody that doesn't have a lot of skills
*  And if you impose that minimum wage all you're doing is making it impossible for this guy to get a job
*  It really what the minimum wage law is is it makes it illegal for you to work?
*  Unless you have enough a certain amount of productivity
*  So if the minimum wage is fifteen dollars an hour what that means is if you only have ten dollars an hour work of productivity
*  Right, you can't work that you have to turn down every offer of employment you get if someone offers you ten dollars twelve dollars
*  That's illegal. You can't accept those jobs even if you want them even if you think that that's the beginning
*  Of your first step on a road to higher wages in the future the government says no
*  You can't accept that unless you can find somebody who will pay you fifteen dollars an hour
*  It is illegal for you to have a job
*  And that is not good economic policy that is and it's not even compassionate because now you've taken away all the honest
*  Ways that somebody can make a living and they end up turning to crime a lot of times
*  I see what you're saying and that that actually makes a lot more sense the way you're framing it about like if you only provide
*  ten dollars worth of
*  Value to the company. Why should they pay you fifteen dollars?
*  And they won't I think I I agree with you. I see what you're saying
*  I see what you're saying. You're making me think about it in a different way for sure
*  um, I think a lot of people would say well
*  If they're really only providing ten dollars worth of value. Do you really need that person?
*  Do you do you should be more streamlined? I mean ten dollars worth of value is still value. Yeah, I see what you're saying
*  Think of all these look I get very frustrated all the time
*  You know when I make phone calls and I can't talk to a human being I have to talk to a a a computer
*  Yeah, and and the reason for this is because they we've priced the human beings out of the market
*  Well, you know what else is interesting peter?
*  What's what's horrible about this for all of us is when when you do do that and you know, you're dealing with these
*  Goddamn computers. It's like we're we're losing part of our connection when it comes to doing business
*  We're doing I like if I do business with a company. I like to be able to call them up
*  I like to there's I'd love it if there's a thing when i'm when i'm doing something. I like to
*  Make contact with the person if everything is being done through automated systems. It's getting weirder and weirder for us
*  More and more detached. Yes. Do you remember do you remember back the original backs of the future movie?
*  Yes, remember when when he when he goes back to
*  1955 for the first time and he sees that car pull into a gas station and like five people descend on the car and start
*  Watching the windows checking the tires doing all that stuff, right? What happened to all those people?
*  Because that's what gas stations were like sort of for the minimum wage destroyed all those jobs
*  I've worked in a gas station. Did you ever work in a gas station?
*  I never did but I look I delivered groceries. I delivered pizza. I worked in a shoe store
*  I had all kinds of jobs in high school that you know, the probably kids don't have those opportunities today
*  They just they they you know, they they can't get it but going back to the gas station, right?
*  Do you like pumping your own gas?
*  Um, I do because I used to
*  I used to work at a gas station and I know what happens when you let kids pump your fucking gas
*  I don't want anybody open they spill it they fuck up
*  There's some weirdo has got a highly flammable fluid next to a piece of your property and they get to stick it in there
*  Look, I think if we didn't have a minimum wage
*  You'd have a lot more kids working mostly for tips and we used to tip if you remember i'm still old enough to remember
*  Tipping the guy and pump my gas. Yes, they check your tires the whole deal
*  But but you know what used to happen these young kids that got low paying jobs as pump jockeys
*  What they would do between philips is they would go and hang out with the mechanic
*  Who was there working on cars and they would get a free education in auto mechanics and they would actually learn a trade
*  Have you ever seen these guys? I mean we'd have more auto mechanics. They get a skill some of these guys would end up
*  You know opening up their own service stations. Look, it's it's good to allow young people
*  To have employment opportunities not to price them out of the market by just by mandating a minimum wage
*  I mean the minimum wage benefits high skilled workers unions by by eliminating competition with younger, you know lower skilled workers
*  You're forcing employers to hire high skilled people instead of a more numerous
*  Uh number of lower skilled people that that's what happened
*  Have you ever seen the uh movie the hustler with paul newman jackie gleason?
*  Yeah, it's a great movie. I saw the remake with uh with um
*  Um, what's his name? Um, tom cruise tom cruise. Yeah
*  But the point my point is they're both good movies they're great movies but in the beginning of the hustler
*  paul newman pulls into a gas station
*  And he tells the guy check the air and tires check the oil do all this and and the guy fill them up, mister
*  They go out there and they have like they they they do all kinds of shit for you
*  It's not just as simple as they pump your gas. They pump your gas check your tires check your fluids
*  They do everything but there was less people
*  In cars cars were in better shape because you know every time you went into a gas station somebody made sure you had enough oil
*  They made sure your tire pressure was good. Well cars are more reliable today. Those those cars were bullshit
*  Those cars like you had to check the air you had to check the tires. It was bleeding oil
*  But it's just interesting to see the difference they used to have look they used to have ushers in movie theaters
*  Yep, I remember that they would just show you to your seat with with the there was the service sector has really been obliterated
*  All these low-skilled look they're working on these kiosks now
*  Look, they're going to get rid of all the workers. Anyway, ultimately all these fast food restaurants
*  There's not going to be anybody there. They're all going to look like self-serve gas stations
*  Yeah, you're going to go in you're going to order off your smartphone
*  And the food is going to you know, come come down a chute through some machine
*  There's there's going to be nobody there. I worried we're going to lose movie theaters
*  I really worry about that movie theaters that we're going to lose movie theaters
*  Well, we're probably we lost drive-ins. Yeah, you know that some of them are coming back
*  But once upon a time we had coming back now because of covid people love them now
*  It's a great idea. It's a great way to be socially distant and still watch a movie with a bunch of other people
*  Yeah, but look that's things evolve. I mean now I look I've you know, people have giant screen tvs now
*  They don't cost a lot of money. That's the beauty of capitalism. I remember the the first
*  uh, like kind of like
*  Uh high def tv I ever saw I went into a department store
*  We're not the part like a good guy is one of those electronic stores
*  And I remember looking at it. I was amazed because I was like, oh this is like looking through a window
*  It was like because people don't realize how bad the pictures used to be unless you actually see an old tv
*  You know one of these with the tubes compared to what we look at now
*  I mean you can't even watch one of those things
*  But you know, we didn't know how bad it was until something better came along. But when I first saw
*  That I was like, oh my god, this is incredible, but I didn't buy it because it was ten thousand dollars
*  And that was a lot of money to me back then when I was in my 20s a ten thousand dollar tv
*  I could buy a car for that. I wasn't going to spend that much money on a tv
*  Now you get those tvs for five six hundred bucks. Yeah, and they're internet enabled and they're you know, they're smart
*  They do all this stuff
*  but
*  um, so now you know people don't need to go to the theater as often because they have
*  Good quality at home. They've got all kinds of streaming services
*  They can see and so if the if we're evolving
*  To the point where more people are chilling at home with netflix, then the theaters have to evolve
*  I mean the and you know what so we can use those resources we can do other things
*  I mean businesses have to find other ways
*  To make me spend my hard-earned money
*  Uh at their at their establishment, you know
*  But by the way that the example of a television set because you hear this all the time
*  I mean, it's a little bit of a tangent, but it's an important topic, you know, so
*  The reason that I didn't buy that ten thousand dollar tv. It wasn't because I didn't want it is because I couldn't afford it, right?
*  but
*  Some people were rich enough to afford it
*  And they bought those tvs and because some rich people
*  Bought those ten thousand dollar tvs the companies that made them got money so they can figure out how to make them make them cheaper
*  And then the price came down to five thousand and then more people bought them and as more people bought them
*  The companies got bigger and they invested in rrnd and they found out how to make them better and cheaper
*  And so the free market
*  Reduces prices and when prices go down
*  We buy more stuff
*  But now you have all these politicians trying to sell us a bill of goods that we need inflation
*  That the federal reserve has to make sure that prices go up every year
*  Because if prices don't go up, they say we won't buy anything. We're all going to sit back and wait for lower prices
*  Which is a bunch of nonsense
*  People buy televisions. They buy computers. They buy cell phones
*  They know that if they wait a year or two, they'll be cheaper
*  But they don't wait because the only only time you wait to buy something is if you can't afford it
*  And then you wait until you can't afford it, you know the first cell phone you ever watch show the movie wall street
*  Yes, I talk about that scene all the time him walking on the beach with that brick
*  Yeah, money never sleeps those cell phones those cell phones were like, I don't know five grand
*  Yeah back then and if you made a phone call
*  It the phone it was like a dollar every every 30 seconds
*  Yeah, I remember my first cell phone I would like I would have to get off the phone so quickly because I didn't want to
*  Spend the money well, you know
*  I would have people I would wait till the evening or the weekends to make the calls because it was too expensive
*  To make the call, you know during the mid during the day
*  I remember those days roaming remember roaming
*  Yeah, you get charged crazy money. I mean you got charged extra long distance
*  I mean it used to cost a lot of money to dial long distance. Yeah, I mean there's no such thing
*  I can call I can call somebody in asia, you know on whatsapp and it's free and I can see them
*  Yeah, this is the beauty of capitalism. Yeah, the free market brought the prices down
*  And now more people own these products. So the government is trying to tell us that we need rising prices
*  We don't businesses make more money when prices go down because when prices go down their costs go down
*  And what's important is not the price but the margin the difference between your cost and your price
*  And the lower the price the more customers you have and if you sell more units you make more money
*  So this is all nonsense, but that's the beauty of capitalism. We it makes things cheaper and better
*  Government makes things worse and more expensive right every service that the government provides you with whether it's education
*  Or health care it gets more expensive and the quality goes down
*  Everything we get from from private sector gets cheaper and the quality goes up
*  That's why we want to limit what government does to the smallest
*  Amount of stuff and let the free market do everything else because it's going to do it better
*  I see what you're saying. It sounds beautiful if it was that simple
*  Do you do you think it's really it's really possible to manage this whole country that way really genuinely? Well
*  We should have should we have some regulations in the way that is the problem
*  Right because you have these politicians that want to get votes, right?
*  And the way they get votes is they promise to steal something from one person and give it to the person who votes for them
*  That's the problem and then in order to stay in power
*  right
*  Governments basically take what amounts to bribes from businesses
*  To basically protect them from competition or bail them out. We've given the government too much power
*  And you can't blame the private sector for trying to get that power to be used in its advantage
*  Because if it doesn't do that one of its competitors will get it and it'll be used against like the government is like the mafia
*  right and people have to pay protection money for the government to leave them alone and to and to kind of
*  set them against
*  Somebody else, you know, there's a there's a great movie
*  I might as well plug it because the sequel is coming out but the guys that produce it they did a really good job
*  It's the bubble movie, right? And if you go to um, let us disagree
*  Dot com and you can see this movie, but it the guy that produced the jimmy maurice and you know
*  I remember he came to my office and filmed me. This is he started it back in like
*  2010 or something because he wanted to talk to the people that predicted the 2008 financial crisis and get their perspective
*  On what the government did wrong
*  And so this is a whole movie about the history of how government has screwed stuff up
*  Going all the way back to you know, the the great depression because there's you know, there's a lot of misinformation out there
*  About why we had the depression people say oh, it's because we had too much capitalism
*  It's not it's because we had too much government
*  We had a depression in 1920 that nobody knows about because it ended so quickly because the government did nothing
*  The reason we had a great depression in the 30s was because herbert hoover did the same type of stuff that trump is doing
*  Herbert hoover was the first big interventionist president that started spending money to prime the pump to try to make it better
*  We can't just sit back and allow people to lose their jobs
*  and so hoover intervened in the economy and
*  helped create the great depression and then roosevelt came in and just
*  Expanded on hoover's failed programs and the great depression spanned the entire decade of the 1930s
*  We didn't get out of the depression until 1945 when we ended the second world war and government finally started to get smaller
*  But this movie goes all the way back to that and then it goes to the housing bubble
*  And and so it's a great movie to really show how the government creates these problems with well-intentioned
*  Programs and this the sequel is about to come out which is about
*  The next crash which is the one that's coming right and that it's coming soon
*  And and and because of what we just did
*  after covid 19
*  Uh and the mood that we're in right now. I mean I am so terrified
*  Of what's coming in this country. I mean the popularity of socialism
*  Has risen so dramatically because we have discredited capitalism by preaching it by not and not practicing it
*  All the damage that has been done in the economy in the name of capitalism has given it a black eye
*  You know, there are real problems in this country. I'm very sympathetic
*  With people on the left who point out some real problems now racism isn't one of them. I'm afraid let's forget about that
*  But there are a lot of problems
*  They're not because of racism. They're because of too much government, right?
*  And those problems are real and I want those problems solved
*  But I understand that the solutions that everybody has we're going to make them much worse
*  And the way we're going to finance it by printing money. See we can pretend that we're going to tax the rich
*  That's not going to work. You know, we've tried to tax the rich before in fact
*  People don't know this the only reason we have an income tax is because we were going to tax the rich in 1913
*  That's the only reason and the government told the public
*  If we have an income tax on Rockefeller and Carnegie and Vanderbilt and it was only going to be like 2 tiny little teeny tax
*  The government said we'll we'll eliminate tariffs
*  That's why we had an income tax to get rid of tariffs because tariffs were paid by the average american
*  I mean people back in 1913 were smart enough to know that consumers paid tariffs
*  I mean donald trump is trying to pretend that the chinese pay his tariffs. They don't
*  Americans pay every tariff that trump is imposed. There are tax on americans. That's what they are. And so what hoover said
*  Uh, or not hoover. Yep. Um
*  What woodrow wilson said
*  was hey
*  Let's tax the rich with an income tax and we can eliminate these tariffs that the average people are paying and we made that deal
*  but now
*  Average americans are paying income taxes at levels far higher than anything contemplated
*  For for for vanderbilt the rockefeller and and carnegie. So look taxing the rich doesn't work
*  Right, and you know what a lot of the wealth that that bernie sanders said
*  I know you had him on the show and you know
*  But a lot of the wealth that his ilk wants to tax is going to be destroyed by the very taxes that they want to impose
*  And they're not going to collect anywhere near the revenue that they think they're going to get instead
*  Everything is going to cost much more than they think and they're going to have to pay for it by printing money
*  And they're going to destroy the value of the currency if you're a person who was advising a president or a governor
*  how to fix an
*  economically disabled community if you have a community that's always had a history of poverty and crime and uh, you know
*  Drug use and gang use in these communities like what what would you do?
*  How do you use this idea of like?
*  Capitalism to fix something that clearly requires some charity
*  It requires first of all, right? First of all, we can we can stop making the problem worse
*  We can decriminalize drugs and end the war on drugs
*  Just like the war on poverty. It's backfired the war on drugs is a failure
*  Right people look in a free society
*  People have a right to to consume what they want to consume. Of course, especially if they want to do drugs
*  Let them do drugs, right? Yeah, and even if those drugs are harmful
*  Adults can make decisions and deal with the consequences of their decisions, especially the legal alternatives are just as bad
*  Right, but the problem is when you
*  When you have the the war on drugs and you and you make it a crime
*  Now you incentivize criminal activity because whenever something is illegal
*  It's much more expensive than it would be if it were legal
*  And now you create this huge profit opportunity for criminals to come in and fill that demand
*  Because people still want the drugs. They just can't buy them legally through a reputable source
*  The only way they can get them is, you know illegally through a criminal
*  So this is the best example of what we've created in mexico the best example of that in mexico, right?
*  And then what you do is you increase the cost of the illegal drugs. So let's say there's a heroin addict
*  And now heroin is illegal and so heroin is very expensive
*  Well, where is this heroin addict going to get the money to buy that heroin? He goes out and steals
*  I mean most of the robbery is committed by drug addicts because they need the money to buy their expensive heroin
*  Well, if heroin were legal, it would be much cheaper and they wouldn't have to steal of course, you know
*  The best example is prohibition, right? I'm not saying that people should do heroin
*  But they should be free to make a decision
*  But they shouldn't have to rob other people to support their habit
*  Yeah, and and you know, and when you when you when you have heroin when you know when it's illegal
*  And there's all these profits, you know, the the drug guy the pusher has an incentive to get you hooked on it
*  You know, I think it should you know, maybe you should have to go get a prescription for it
*  Where the doctor can try to talk you out of it. Hey, are you sure you want to use this stuff?
*  You know, this is going to really hurt you. I mean you really want to become an addict
*  Here's some movies watch what happens to you
*  You know, I mean most people probably wouldn't necessarily make that decision if they were confronted with a lot of evidence
*  That shows why it's a very disruptive way to live your life
*  But so we got to get rid of the war on drugs get rid of the crime in that community, you know
*  You know, that's number one. But then as far as if you've got a lot of poor people
*  Why are people poor? Right? They're poor because they don't have
*  Uh the skills or they can't earn enough money
*  They're not productive enough to generate income, you know above the poverty line
*  So if you have people who are poor the way to make them less poor is to increase their productivity
*  Right one way obviously is through education when they're young
*  But I don't think government education is the solution because I don't think government education is educating anybody
*  I think government schools are run for the benefit of the bureaucracy
*  Of the of the school districts of the the teachers unions I want free enterprise
*  I want vouchers or private schools to compete
*  for
*  Educational dollars just the way, you know, the cell phone companies are competing, you know
*  They want me to buy their cell phone instead of somebody else's they have to make it better and they have to make it less expensive
*  So let's have schools that are competing to be the best to offer the best education at the best value
*  And we've got in these cities. We've got these poor kids trapped in these failed government schools. They waste their time
*  They learn nothing a lot of these kids graduate. They're not even literate
*  I mean, they can't even do basic basic
*  Arithmetic, right? But in the current state of the world right now education
*  But in the current state of the world right now, those people don't have any other options
*  Those people they don't have any other options because the government has taken away that option
*  But what do you what do you do for them in real time?
*  But what do you do for them in real time?
*  If you have a a guy who's in a lower income family and he has a seven-year-old son
*  And that kid is going to school right now. Like how do you fix that right now?
*  By making it open if we had private schools the kid could go there. They couldn't afford that right?
*  What if they couldn't afford private schools for people who are really poor?
*  Private schools would give out scholarships to kids that have a lot of potential and their parents don't have the money
*  But it when the private sector educates kids
*  That it's cheaper lot of potential a lot of potential that bothers me because like what if a kid doesn't have a lot of potential
*  Then he doesn't get an education because he can't afford a private school
*  Not every but let's say let's say a kid doesn't have a lot of potential
*  A certain type of education might be a waste. Yeah, that's when kids learning a trade. Hold on
*  He might be better off learning how to do something. How would you know?
*  You know, I learn a trade how would you know while the kid is seven if the kid's in first grade and is seven
*  How do you know whether or not that kid has a lot of potential? That's crazy. Yeah seven is I don't know
*  Seven might be a little young how I think before you pull the blood on that kid the tuition
*  In first or second grade is probably going to be less than in high school because in order to teach a second grader
*  The teacher doesn't have to know as much as a teacher needs to know to teach a 10th grader
*  So you wouldn't have to pay a second grade teacher as much as a 10th grade teacher
*  See the problem the problem in the government is everybody get paid the same whether they're a lousy teacher or a good teacher
*  Whether they're teaching a first grader or a high school. It's just all based on seniority
*  It's a crazy crackpot system that only the government could devise and it's only because they have a captive audience
*  The people the customers don't have a choice
*  And the parents aren't even involved if the parents were actually writing a check and paying for the education
*  They would make sure the kids did the homework
*  They would make sure they were getting their money's work when you get it for free
*  I mean you just you know take it for granted
*  So we need real education for the kids that can benefit from it
*  We need to get rid of the minimum wage law and all sorts of occupational licensing laws and other things that the government does
*  That prevent people from from getting jobs or starting businesses. The government is creating all sorts of barriers artificial barriers
*  That would not exist
*  absent government
*  Right, like like you you have you have a government. Let's say, you know
*  If you want to be a florist by all these, you know states they have licenses you have to get a license to to to sell flowers
*  Why why can't I just buy flowers from wherever I want?
*  I mean, what's the worst thing that can happen to me?
*  I buy flowers from a guy that doesn't know how what he's doing. I get a lousy arrangement and so I don't go back
*  He does the government have to protect me from getting a bad floral arrangement
*  Well, look the free market sorted out if a guy's no good. He won't have any customers
*  But we make it a lot harder. There's all kinds of regulations and rules and permits just let people go into business
*  You know, I mean poor people can start businesses if we didn't make it so expensive and so hard and if they can flourish
*  Flourish in the marketplace if they can find customers then great if they're no good at what they do. They're not going to have any customers
*  Do you feel like this applies to everything?
*  This applies to all businesses all the time
*  I mean pretty much. I mean we don't need government
*  You know having these certifications
*  I mean the private sector is is certainly capable at this point
*  Look is is a consideration social media and holding people accountable like holding businesses accountable for their actions
*  And like it's a different world in terms of like the ability to like alert consumers as to what's good and what's bad
*  It's a different world when it comes to that kind of thing, but people especially now with the internet
*  Yeah, I mean if a business isn't any good, I mean, it's going to get a bad reputation online
*  I mean you're going to have consumer reports that go out and rate look look at what happens like look at the banks, right?
*  The banks are completely regulated by the government, right?
*  Everybody who opens up a bank account knows that the government is guaranteeing their deposit
*  That wasn't always the case
*  That the deposit insurance didn't start until the 1930s
*  Because of the bank failures in the great depression which were minimal
*  I mean fewer than two percent of the banks actually failed
*  There wasn't that much in the way and we had a lot of banks way more banks than we have now
*  Now we just have these massive banks before the government got involved. We had a very very competitive market
*  We had lots of little banks out there
*  Taking deposits making loans to entrepreneurs
*  To start businesses and employ people not you know funding wall street, right?
*  But you remember the savings and loans collapse for sure you do right?
*  Yeah, but that was but those banks had government guarantees that was the problem that was the problem the government
*  Right before the government guaranteed banks
*  Before you would put your money in a bank
*  You would do a little research just like you do research now before you buy a car
*  You you try to figure out
*  Which is the best bank for my money?
*  Which bank is the safest which bank, you know isn't you know having problem loan and you would you would consult?
*  You know periodicals or you know reviews online, you know not online
*  But you would find out where the banks were good
*  And and you would put your money in that bank and now the banks
*  Would have to compete on reputation on honesty on on not being aggressive
*  And they knew that if they if they made bad loans and they went bank and something happened
*  Nobody would bail them out the government wouldn't bail them out their depositors would lose money. So we had a very sound banking system
*  back then
*  Today, it's very unsound the banks are doing all sorts of reckless things with their deposits because no one gives it down
*  Nobody cares what the bank does with their money once they deposit it because the government guarantees a deposit
*  One bank is just as good as another i'm just going to put it whatever bank is closest to me
*  You know, and and so the government has polluted the entire system
*  They've taken away all the checks and balances of a free market
*  And now we have a banking system that is completely, you know a reckless
*  It's all these banks that we bailed out in oh eight are going to fail again
*  And they're going to need even bigger bailouts. We have a we have a very fragile
*  A system and now they say well, we can't let one of these banks fail because it's so big
*  Why is it so big?
*  Because the government insured their deposits and allowed them to get this big and allowed them to have access to all this cheap money
*  From the federal reserve. I mean we we would have a vibrant
*  Competitive banking system if the government got out of the way, we don't need the government
*  To do the banks are are much more reckless and much more corrupt now
*  Because of government than when we had free market forces reigning them in
*  Why aren't there more people saying what you're saying?
*  Why is this a controversial? Why is there are I mean i'm not the only free market guy out there as I said if you have
*  A jurgensen the libertarian candidate. She'll say some of this stuff. No, I you know, i'm sure she's a woman
*  We could actually have a woman president if we vote for her
*  I'm sure I could find it if I went looking for it peter what i'm saying is why why is this not?
*  You know, there's there's various discussions about how we should do things economically moving forward, right?
*  You hear it from a bunch of different experts. I don't hear your perspective your perspective is very
*  ruthless and honest and some people would say
*  Maybe you're not considering the people that really don't even have an opportunity to get into this system and compete
*  They'll be held down. They'll be put into this club. I'm not i'm not being ruthless and I am being honest
*  But I think i'm being fair and compassionate because I understand
*  The damage that is being done. I understand in the name of these programs
*  But the reason that you don't see more people like me
*  In positions of power in government is it's because it's hard for people like me to get a power position in government
*  Because we're not beholden to a special interest you have so many special interests that are feeding off the public trough, right?
*  There's so much corporate welfare in this country right now, which is not capitalism
*  And so they're not going to fund candidates that want to take away their corporate welfare
*  They want to fund candidates that are going to protect the status quo and the same thing with people
*  Look, the government has crippled so many people that they think they need a government crutch. You know, that's an old harry brown
*  Uh quote that he ran for libertarian
*  President he said the government is great
*  At crippling you and then handing you a crutch and saying you see without me you couldn't walk
*  So so many people have been crippled and they think they need that government crutch
*  I don't want them to be crippled. I want them to walk on their own
*  Right to be free
*  You know, I wish you know, we you know, we we had the fourth of july just recently and you know, we celebrate america
*  And you know, I talked on my old podcast, you know about what it means to be an american and people just don't
*  appreciate
*  What truly america was all about right? It's about freedom
*  It's about liberty and individual opportunity
*  It's about being left alone from government and being able to achieve all that you can achieve without anybody standing in your way
*  without anybody erecting
*  A roadblock and we created government in america
*  Government didn't create us. We you know, we didn't have a king that gave us some privileges
*  We started off as free people and we ceded some of our sovereignty to a government to secure and protect our rights
*  And that's it and that's what made americans rugged individuals, right?
*  With who who were not beholden or begging from government, right?
*  They took care of themselves and they took care of their neighbors if their neighbor neighbor really needed help
*  It wasn't about thief. It wasn't about trying to get free stuff from the government
*  I mean look at all these kids now, what do they want free this free health care free education, you know
*  All kinds of free stuff, right?
*  free housing
*  free guaranteed jobs
*  That's not what america was about my all of my grandparents, right?
*  All four of my grandparents came to this country broke barely spoke any english, right? Some of them were teenagers
*  They came with nothing
*  From poor countries and they came to america. They had no welfare
*  No food stamps, no minimum wage. They didn't they didn't want anything from the government
*  They came to america because they could be free of government. They left the big governments that existed in europe to have american freedom
*  Right because that that's what it meant to be an american and it was unique and we created the wealthiest society
*  In the history of the world because of the freedom that was uniquely american, right?
*  So that's what we need to restore. That's our birthright, right?
*  Is is is to be free not to try to get the government to steal stuff from our neighbors because we think we're entitled to it
*  That's a hell of a rant right there peter chef, let me tell you what that was very good
*  Um, I I I see but that but that's I see your perspective
*  Wouldn't that make you be proud to know that we're a nation of free people?
*  Yeah, I I can I can I um, can I say that your your assessment?
*  This is what i'm seeing from you you think that the
*  The competition and the nature of the free market would have been better off without the intervention of the government
*  But you understand the government was kind of put in there to regulate things
*  Because they thought that people were going to get out of hand and they wanted to make sure that things were fair
*  But then the government grew too big and became a problem with human beings in general
*  And this is my perspective human beings in general always get hold on a second
*  The problem is human beings in general have a problem when they have power over other human beings
*  And if that power is absolute like the power of the government if that power is absolutely like the power of the police
*  If that power is absolute, that's where people have a problem because human beings just in general
*  Have a problem with having absolute power over other people and if you add that to government in business corrupts
*  Absolutely, that's the problem and it fucks up when you have politicians, right?
*  And maybe term limits would help this if we could have some term limits or something like that, you know, maybe
*  You know, you can't you can't be in government for more than I don't know five or ten years
*  and then that's it's people in mushrooms, it's not a career immediately, but
*  These these these bureaucrats get in office
*  And they want to stay there. They like it. They enjoy of course the perks the privileges
*  So what they do is they go out and they try to raise money to get re-elected
*  So they go to somebody and they say give me money to help me and it's like well, what are you gonna do for me?
*  What's in it for me?
*  All right. Well, i'll give you this special tax break or i'll i'll do something to protect you or i'll hurt and so this is
*  What happens so people are bribing politicians to use their power to benefit them or to hurt their competitors
*  We need to disarm the bureaucrats
*  We have to take the power away from washington washington needs to live by the constitution which limited federal power
*  Almost everything the government does today is unconstitutional yet. They do it anyway
*  Yes, that that it's the fact that they can wield this unconstitutional power
*  I'm giving you a magic wand. Peter Schiff if I gave you a magic wand
*  What do you do with it? How do you fix things if I say Peter Schiff?
*  I love what you're saying if trump pulls you into his office Peter love what you said phenomenal tremendous
*  And he pulls you into the oval office and he says what do I do? How do I fix this mess?
*  Yeah, well again, you know, he's not gonna like the truth
*  Because the public there's an old expression that you shoot the messenger, right?
*  I mean nobody wants to be the bearer of bad news. Maybe he's open-minded
*  Yeah, it would have been better if he did it on day one
*  It would have been a lot more effective if they had told the truth rather than lied for three years and now come on
*  Okay, i've been lying to you now i'm gonna i'm gonna finally level and tell it like it is
*  Do you think that he's been lying solve a problem?
*  Do you think he's been lying or do you think it's been?
*  Do you think he's been lying or do you think it's been?
*  A disagreement it went the way you look at it versus the way they look at it
*  No, I think he's been lying because look there's no way
*  that
*  Trump as a candidate
*  Said the real unemployment rate was 30 or 40 percent and the government numbers were a lie a fraud
*  Right. So if he actually said that and now all of a sudden he's president and the same exact
*  Labor department that was coming up with the same five percent unemployment numbers that he said was really 30 or 40
*  And now he says oh the unemployment rate is four percent and that's magically what it is
*  He knows that he's lying. He's either he was lying as a candidate or he's lying as president
*  Yeah, but these statistics don't mean anything
*  You know, we don't measure unemployment the way we measured it in the past, right because in the past
*  if you were
*  Unemployed and you were no longer looking for work because you were discouraged you were still counted as being unemployed
*  Now if you've given up looking for unemployment because you don't think you can get a job you're not in the statistics
*  So, you know, you're not looking for a job. I mean you're unemployed, but you're not counted or
*  This happens a lot. Let's say somebody had a good job
*  And they lose that good job
*  And so while they're looking for another good job, they accept a shitty part-time job, right?
*  They're still looking for a good job, but they're making ends meet with this crappy part-time job in the past
*  That guy would still be considered unemployed because he was still looking for a job
*  Even though he took a part-time job to help make ends meet today
*  If you take a part-time job and even if it's one hour a week and you spend the rest of the week looking for a job
*  You're not counted as unemployed
*  so when you take the statistics from today and compare it to statistics from the 60s or 70s or 50s
*  You're comparing apples to oranges because back then all those people were considered unemployed
*  So if and this is what trump meant when he was a candidate if you actually measured unemployment today
*  The way it was measured back then we'd have an unemployment rate well above 10 percent
*  I don't know where it would be it probably wouldn't be as high as 30 or 40 percent like trump was saying as a candidate
*  He was probably exaggerating that but his basic premise was right. The numbers were a lie
*  The same thing about the stock market
*  How is it that the stock market was a bubble while he was a candidate and then all of a sudden it wasn't a bubble now?
*  That he's president. It's the same bubble
*  He was criticizing janet yellen for keeping interest rates too low then he criticized powell for raising them
*  And demanded that they go to zero. In fact, he actually wants negative interest rates
*  He is actually saying that rates should be negative when he was criticizing yellen for having them at zero
*  Now we think zero is too high. So negative means you would get paid if you bought a loan if you got a loan you'd you'd get paid
*  That's what he wants, but you know, where's that money coming from?
*  Exactly, you know donald trump. I think you know one of the the speeches that he gave he's like, you know
*  I don't know how this is, you know how this is happening, you know, who's who you know, who's making these loans?
*  But we want some of that money. He's like we we should be able to borrow at negative rates
*  Well, that means somebody has to be losing money
*  Well, the only one dumb enough to lose the money is the federal reserve. Well, that's the american public
*  You know why?
*  Why should the american public go deeper into debt, you know so so that we can basically steal money, which is what?
*  Trump is advocating look we need higher interest rates as I said earlier
*  The reason that we were so ill prepared
*  For covid 19 the reason that families couldn't get by without a paycheck for a few months
*  The reason that businesses couldn't get by without revenues is because nobody has savings we had savings once upon a time
*  Before the government screwed up the economy
*  Americans saved their money
*  Right, they were self-sufficient because they weren't looking for the government to take care of them, but we saved money
*  They saved money for their own age. They saved money for a rainy day, but this is four months. That's a long time
*  You know what it's not but it is to live a normal life with a car payment and a mortgage and a
*  Verizon bill. Yes a lot of money, but
*  But you know what people shouldn't have car payments. Oh you son of a bitch they can afford
*  You son of a bitch, but what if I get a 2020 corvette right now the reason that's
*  What if I can get a 2020 corvette right now?
*  Look if i'm working at fucking ups and i'm making 60 grand a year and they go you're qualified
*  I'm like, holy shit. I'm getting a corvette. I'm not waiting to save up 85 000
*  If we had a free market in lending if we didn't have government guarantees and we didn't have artificially low interest rates
*  No bank would lend you that money
*  And interest rates would be much higher for those type of consumer loans because if they lend it to me I can get a corvette
*  Yeah, the government is subsidizing these auto loans. The government is the government is buying these loans
*  The government is making it possible for people who can't afford expensive cars to buy them
*  Okay, explain that. Explain that how is the government subsidizing auto loans?
*  Like if I want to buy a 2020 corvette and I make 60 000 a year and they hook me up for some
*  $85 000 loan how is the government subsidizing that because the government is buying those loans what happens is so your car company
*  Doesn't actually keep the loan so it doesn't give a damn whether or not you actually can repay it
*  Really it it it it loans you the money right and now it has this loan
*  And it sells it the government buys it or some government guaranteed entity buys it or the fed now buys it
*  This is assuming that you don't pay it
*  But the bank doesn't lose any money assuming you don't pay
*  Assuming you don't pay but if you do pay it like if you have a loan and you pay all your payments on time
*  The government doesn't assume that loan does it?
*  No, no, they don't know which loans are going to default and which are going to pay they just buy all the loans, right?
*  The car like there's a lot of this stuff like you ever go the government buys loans that are viable
*  The mattress store is going to say
*  You can buy this mattress no payments
*  No interest, you know for you know, till 2022 2023, right?
*  Yeah, you ever see these, you know, no payments just walk you can nothing down walk out the store with a thousand dollar mattress
*  Yeah, not specifically, but I know what you're talking about
*  Yeah, well the reason that this is possible is because the company takes that
*  Loan and sells it on the secondary market to get the money
*  And so it doesn't care
*  If the person who bought the mattress can repay that loan because it's going to sell the loan as soon as it's originated
*  And get the money and so the loan gets bought and and packaged and structured and it's all on you know
*  Insecure ties, but all this is being propped up by artificially low interest rates and government guarantees
*  If we had higher interest rates, right and a free market
*  Consumer loans would be much more expensive than they are now much more expensive
*  And so most people would not borrow money to buy stuff
*  They would save up their money and then they would buy stuff
*  They would buy less expensive stuff and that's what we want because we want savings going to businesses
*  Who will invest in plant and equipment to make the country more competitive more productive to provide?
*  Services to create goods to provide jobs. We don't want to squander savings on consumption
*  But you know because when you borrow money to to buy capital equipment
*  The capital equipment makes you more productive generates more income and that income helps you liquidate your debt
*  But when a consumer goes out and borrows money to buy something they don't they don't get an income producing asset
*  Nothing services that debt. They have to service the debt at a future consumption
*  So now you know, they're out of work. They can't make their car payment
*  They can't make their their their their you know, the other loan payments this type of bubble society
*  Never should have existed in the first place and it only exists because of government because before government got involved
*  People had savings
*  And and and it's not that the american people changed
*  It's the american government changed and when the government changed and created all these perverse incentives, then behavior changed government policy
*  Manipulated behavior and it made us behave badly and recklessly and it set us up for the fall that we're about to have
*  I completely see your perspective
*  However, I look at your perspective as a guy who actually understands economics
*  And you're a mature man who's had a successful life
*  I'm looking at it like if I was a 19 year old kid working at ups and they told me I can get a corvette
*  Okay, let's do it. That's the problem. It is the problem. It's not the problem
*  But it's not the problem because that kid gets a corvette
*  And his summer will be immeasurably better with that corvette than without that corvette and maybe that will propel
*  His emotions and his future and his ambition further than he ever anticipated
*  Because he had that great summer with that corvette that he got that he shouldn't got the loan for I see what you're saying
*  Like if you're my dad, I'm probably got that
*  I know you're right. He thought he'd get laid more if he had a corvette
*  I mean more because he's a man and he's american and he enjoys a corvette
*  It doesn't have to be negative playing the kid
*  I blame the system for making it possible for him to borrow the money and his parents for not teaching them better
*  But look the problem is I was that kid. I was that kid and I would be like fuck you. Let's get that car
*  Yeah, it's good. I'm willing to take an example
*  Let's let's talk about student loan, right? Because right now one of the big political issues, especially among the left, right?
*  They want to forgive the student loans and they want to make college free, right?
*  That's like a big thing like we have all these students with all this debt and it's it's bad, which I agree
*  It's a terrible situation
*  But what the left doesn't want to accept is responsibility
*  For creating the situation in the first place
*  It is government's fault that all these student loans exist without government. There would be no student loans, you know, once upon a time
*  People didn't borrow money to go to college. Nobody borrowed money to go to college, right? My father
*  Went to college and his parents were poor. I mean, yeah, look they my dad said they weren't sure
*  They were upper lower class or lower middle class, but you know, his dad was a carpenter
*  um, and um, and so he went to college
*  And his parents didn't have any money to send him to college and there were no loans
*  So how did my dad go? He got a summer job and he worked his way through school
*  Which is what most people did you work your way through school? So here's what happened
*  In the early 1960s, you know around the 1960s once the 18 year olds could vote
*  This was a big thing and they lowered the voting age from 21 down to 28, right?
*  So now you have all these 18 year olds that are about to go to college
*  And so here's what the politicians said to all the 18 year olds with democratic politicians
*  They said, you know, you shouldn't have to work
*  Your summers you shouldn't have to have jobs while you're in school
*  You should just be able to go to school and enjoy yourself
*  And we're going to make it possible for you to borrow money to go to school
*  By guaranteeing the loans because normally the bank wouldn't lend you any money because you have no credit history
*  You have no assets. So you're not going to be able to get a loan
*  But you're going to guarantee the loan and that way you'll be able to get the loan
*  Now somebody else won't get it
*  Some businessman won't get the loan because we're going to make them loan it to you
*  And now you won't have to have that summer job
*  And then
*  When you graduate and have a good job, you'll just pay back the money and it sounded like a great deal
*  Hey, I want to party now. I don't want to work. I'm gonna have a good time
*  And when I get my college degree and i'm making a lot more money, well, it'll be no problem to pay back the loan
*  So that's how it all started when it came in when they and they basically created an incentive
*  For banks to make loans to kids with no assets and no credit history. What year was this?
*  What year was this?
*  Maybe that's 60s. I don't know the exact year. Okay
*  but anyway, so then
*  Once the colleges saw
*  That all these kids can borrow money
*  To go to go to college. Well, they were like this is great. I'm just going to raise prices
*  So all of a sudden tuition started to go up
*  I mean for a long time you can look back in the future in history college tuition used to be pretty stable
*  It didn't go up very much
*  Until the 60s until the government really got involved
*  And so as soon as these colleges saw that the kids had access to all this money they started jacking up prices
*  And then of course the university started competing who's got the best
*  Gymnasium who's got the best, you know housing all kinds of other incentives and then everything became bloated and they kept raising their prices
*  And then in order to get the votes of the students the government kept raising the the limits on how much loans they would guarantee
*  So it became this self-perpetuating cycle where the more money the government guaranteed that the students can borrow
*  The more the colleges could charge in tuition. And so tuition kept skyrocketing and then as tuition goes up
*  It's like oh nobody can afford to go to college. We need more loans. So the loans themselves
*  Became the reason that people needed the loans because the loans were why college was so expensive
*  And so now you needed a loan to go to college
*  But without the loan tuition would have come down
*  You see if there were no student loans at all and right now the government has actually taken over
*  They don't just guarantee student loans. They loan directly to the students if there were no student loans at all
*  If the government just said no more student loans
*  All of a sudden the colleges would be oh my god
*  We need to cut costs. Otherwise, we'll have no customers. Nobody could afford to go without these loans and they would cut costs
*  They would start looking they would they would streamline their business like everybody else
*  I mean any business that could charge whatever the hell they wanted because the government could borrow the money
*  Right. If you had a restaurant where the government was going to guarantee
*  To pay the bill of everybody who dined there. I mean shit the restaurant could charge whatever it wanted
*  Oh a hamburger is a thousand dollars. Oh the government's going to pay. Yeah, what do you care?
*  You know, it's because people are paying with their own money that they they got to keep the cost down
*  And this situation's been going on for so long that it's just now how they do business
*  Right, but now see college is now so expensive
*  Kids think they need government to afford it and they don't realize that the only reason it's so expensive
*  This is because of government. That's the harry harry brown cripple you and then give you a crutch
*  You're freaking me out petershiff college so expensive. You're freaking me out, man
*  Jesus christ, there's an easy solution. Okay, get rid of the loans get rid of the loans
*  You know, let let colleges lower their tuition
*  Well, and then my people go back to what my dad did work your way through college. No big deal
*  We're in this crazy situation where a lot of kids are going to have to go back to school through zoom even harvard
*  They're they're talking about having these harvard kids do school online for forty thousand dollars a year. Wasn't that what you did?
*  look, yeah
*  Higher than 40. It's more than 50
*  Jamie says fifty thousand dollars a year to do school online. That's hilarious
*  Education at this point is a racket. I mean most people will never recoup the cost of a college degree
*  I mean the colleges are out there perpetuating this myth, right that you know, um
*  Going to college is your ticket to success that you have to go and if you if you don't go
*  I think I mentioned the video on your show the podcast last time where I was down on bourbon street in new orleans
*  And I was interviewing all the people there that were working that had college degrees, but were doing menial jobs
*  You know the bartending bouncers and strip cubs petty cab drivers
*  They all had college degrees some of them had two or three degrees and you know
*  They were doing stuff that you know
*  You didn't need to go to college to do and so the colleges perpetuate this myth look
*  With the internet today and the access to online classes and self-help you can educate yourself
*  You don't need to buy this over price certificate that says that you graduated from some college to prove that you're competent
*  I mean it doesn't even prove anything now. In fact, the government did two things
*  They made a college degree very expensive and then they made it practically worthless because before the government started subsidizing college
*  Fewer people actually went because only the people that could really benefit from the degree
*  Went and so then if you had a college degree it actually meant something in the marketplace now
*  Since everybody goes to school because it's you know, you get the money from the government. Everybody's got a college degree
*  They mean nothing. So now you got to get a master's degree. You got to get a phd
*  You're in school till you're in your 30s. It was ridiculous that we spend so much time. It benefits the bureaucracy
*  It doesn't benefit the kids, you know, so this bubble this is a gigantic bubble
*  In in higher education, it's a bubble in lower education, too
*  You know, I mean some of america's wealthiest men they didn't go to college
*  You know, in fact way back when they didn't even go to high school. They called it these billionaires, you know dropped out of grammar school
*  but today
*  With the internet it should be even easier for people than it ever was because one of the things that the colleges had
*  Is they had the they had the libraries right? They had all the books
*  So if you wanted to get access to these books you needed to have be get into these libraries
*  Well, it's all on the internet now. They don't have a monopoly on anything
*  You know and believe me you see how much they charge for these books. It's crazy
*  It's such a good point professors write these books and they and they force the kids to buy these books paying
*  $100 for a textbook. I mean, it's ridiculous. It is a racket
*  Right and it's all supported by government and the problem is if you come out against this educational racket
*  Oh, you're a bad person. You're anti-education. I'm not a bad person
*  I care about the kids who are getting ripped off who are getting indoctrinated not educated and who are being saddled with a mountain
*  Of debt and the government says the solution is free education
*  Can I throw something at you if you think education is expensive now?
*  Wait, do you see how much more it costs when it's free?
*  Do you think that the current state of?
*  Colleges when you know when we think about colleges today, we think about social justice warriors
*  We think about these kids growing up in this weird future where they're going to graduate online
*  Do you think that?
*  The like the the extreme liberal socialist
*  Bend that you see in colleges would be different if there was a free market
*  Do you think people would be more realistic?
*  In terms of all universities were free market based you think people would be more realistic in terms of their expectations for other people in the future
*  And not look towards the government as being this piggy bank that they could dig into and pull things out
*  Yeah, I I think so and I think one of the the driving forces is a lot of these universities
*  They always want to hire professors, especially when it comes to economics or some of the political science
*  They want to hire people who have worked for government and they want to see some of their professors go to government and then come back
*  and the only
*  Economists that will get a government job are the Keynesian economists who want to pretend that government can actually help the economy
*  I mean there is no role in government for a free market economist who says leave it alone
*  Let the market function right that guy's not going to get a government job
*  Right the government wants to hire people that are going to justify more government spending because that's how they buy their votes
*  So you get these big government Keynesian economists who go between government and academia and they go back and forth
*  And so it perpetuates this cycle, but there are look you can find some examples of universities that that that teach
*  You know real economics free market austrian economics
*  But but but they're they're in the minority
*  Yeah, not that many of them. Is that a problem? I mean when we think about educating kids
*  I mean is part of it's really a weird it's a weird way of looking at it, right?
*  The idea that the government paying for everything making everything more expensive is going to make more people that are dependent upon not
*  Competing and being a part of this weird system where you think your own things
*  Right. Yeah, I mean look look at aoc right? I mean she was an economics major
*  But look like she's completely ignorant about basic economics. I mean the thing is she thinks she knows a lot
*  She doesn't know anything. She you know, it's like a lot of times when people learn economics in a university
*  They end up knowing less about economics after they graduate than before they enroll
*  They end up, you know
*  They lose their common sense and they and they and they get spoon-fed a bunch of nonsense which they end up, you know
*  regurgitating throughout their careers
*  Um, you know, I hear what you're saying, but hold on a second. I think when you deal I mean she's 28, right?
*  I think what she is is an idealist. I think she's a kind person who has this visionary perspective
*  of how she wants the world to play out
*  And when when she says those things, I think she's saying those things from because she feels like she's a force of good
*  Yeah, I don't you know, I don't doubt that although I mean look she could a lot of it could be
*  She's just a great politician. Yes, but I think that
*  Economics are complicated and I think most 28 year olds don't really understand it
*  I think it's really complicated and I think we get idealistic in or or
*  Ideologically based in like you're a left wing you think you think this way your right wing
*  You think that way and we get very rigid in how we look at things
*  but if you you want to look at what you're saying in terms of
*  Competition creates the best solution for everybody because the most effective and viable
*  Method is the one that rises to the top and that's the one that people support with their money if they have total freedom
*  But if you have the government that steps in and dictates that you have to go this way or that way
*  Or ask about this cost this much or that much then the government itself becomes a business
*  And the problem is it needs to verify or justify its own existence by creating more and more regulations more and more problems
*  more and more
*  impediments to freedom freedom of competition
*  Yeah, every time the government writes a regulation or passes a law
*  We are less free because those regulations and those laws are limiting our freedom because they're restricting our choices
*  Right to bring the two of us together to bring everybody together. Don't you think that like
*  Maybe there's an opportunity where people can recognize like that doesn't mean you're a bad person
*  You're just looking at the actual game
*  And there's a lot of bullshit going on where people are pretending what's happening is different than what it is
*  Because they want to feel better about the results
*  But the reality I think most of the people on the left
*  are not
*  Bad people they they they're motivated by good intention kindness. They just don't understand the bad outcome
*  Yes, but you know, and this is the interesting thing because a lot of people
*  Of my persuasion, right?
*  We look at the left and we don't think they're bad people. We just think they're missing
*  Puerto Rican jews, but the people the people on the left
*  Actually think people like me are bad and evil because we don't agree with their programs. We must be mean people
*  We must be heartless people because we're against all the good that they want to do
*  Okay, but stop you know that that's a reductionist argument the rational thought because they don't have those thoughts, right?
*  But you know, that's a reductionist argument that doesn't really make any sense
*  But you'll entertain it even though you know, it doesn't make any sense
*  Like the the people that are really paying attention know that doesn't make any sense
*  It's not that you're heartless that you're a heartless person. You're not heartless at all
*  You're explaining what is actually going on in terms of like government subsidizing education
*  You're talking about competition in terms of the free market
*  You're what none of what you're saying just from me to you
*  Is in any way conveying a sense that you're a heartless person
*  But that is the narrative when people don't agree with what you're saying because they have in their head an
*  Ideologically based alternative to what you're saying
*  Yeah, and look I I watched your your the interview that you did with john stewart, right?
*  And you know and john said a lot of things that I agree with like a lot of the problems on wall street and the bailouts
*  All that's true. But again what he didn't understand was that's not capitalism. That's wrong
*  That was an example of socialism that never should have happened
*  But then when you guys were talking about and you said yes
*  I mean you'd be willing to pay more taxes if it would make the problems better
*  Yes, the problem is paying more taxes is going to make the problems worse
*  We're paying a lot of taxes and the government is spending even more money and that spending is the taxation government has never spent
*  This much money and the problems have never been bigger, but hold on a second
*  Money solves you for a second. You would have solved them a long time ago. Yes, I agree with you
*  But can I stop you for a second when i'm saying that I would pay more money if I thought it would fix it
*  In taxes, I don't i'm not thinking of the government as its current entity that ruins everything
*  I'm thinking of like if I could give more of my income
*  To taxes and it would actually
*  Make a solution. I would be willing to do it. I'm not saying that it would work that way
*  I don't know if it would work that the way I don't understand economics at all and I don't understand the government
*  When I say why not cut out the why not cut out the middleman, right?
*  Because you think hey if I can give my money to government and maybe they do good with it
*  There's no example of government doing good with money because it's not their money. They don't give a damn
*  I don't disagree with you. I don't disagree with you what?
*  What's stopping you joe rogan you?
*  From giving more money directly to causes that you think are worthwhile
*  You don't need the middleman. You don't have to cut into government on your charitable giving
*  You can do it yourself. That's true. You know, one of the best things that you can do for people
*  Is employ them provide them with a job grow your business. So if the government taxes your money, hold on
*  You can't invest in growing your business
*  I have a fucking manageable business with a skeleton crew and you're not going to fuck this up for me
*  All right. I'm not making more business
*  settle down buddy
*  But you can also joe you can invest let's say a friend of yours came to you, right?
*  A good friend of yours and said hey joe
*  I got a great idea to start this business and he had a business plan and here's what i'm going to do
*  I say good luck, bitch
*  Hey, i'll invest in your business and then all of a sudden the government takes that money in taxes
*  Oh, I can't afford to make that investment in your business because the government just took the money in taxes
*  So now you can't start that business completely understand what you're saying when I was saying it
*  And I don't disagree with you when I was saying it I was saying if I could give more money
*  And that money if I didn't have to think about like where to put it if I knew that that money was going to be managed by ethical
*  knowledgeable
*  wizards who know how to take care of the world's problems that they just get five percent more taxes from people that are doing well
*  I'd be willing to do it. It wasn't saying that I be
*  I think it's a good idea to give more money to these people that we elect that we don't even know
*  I mean, I don't know gavin newsome. I make fun of him all the time. I bet he's a nice guy
*  I don't know. Mayor Garcetti. I bet he's a nice guy, too. It's a fucking impossible job. I don't want that job
*  That that benevolent government doesn't exist on this planet, right? So you know, there's no point
*  It's like saying i would be willing to give money to government if they would use it wisely, right?
*  It's like but it's like i'd be willing to give my 10 year old, you know
*  Uh more more money if I thought he would spend it wisely
*  I mean they're not going to do that and you know to the extent that you want government to have money
*  It should be local government the closer to the actual source
*  So you should if you're going to if you want government to have more money
*  It should be your local government your your city your county don't send it to washington dc. You're in california
*  That's 3 000 miles away. What the hell are they going to do about your community?
*  They don't know what's going on. They're so far removed from the money they're spending they can't they it makes no sense
*  To do this. This is such a waste of money and such a waste of resources. That's a good point
*  That's something that hunter s thompson had said in the 70s when he's running for sheriff in aspen
*  He said you can affect local community, but the people in washington. They really don't affect your day-to-day existence
*  It's a myth. Yeah, the more money that you send to washington the less money you can send to your local government
*  I mean initially the federal government didn't have any taxes
*  I mean, I mean and so the taxes were local
*  Okay, again peter schiff
*  But now if the government is the government takes everything and now all the towns have to beg to get the money back
*  And now the government has all kinds of strings
*  The federal government says if you don't do this and you don't do that. We're not going to give you highway funds
*  We're not going to give you student funds. So now the government is taking control. The federal government is taking control of all the states
*  Let's take the power away from the federal government and put it back in the states where it belongs
*  By don't by you don't let the federal government take all that money out of the out of the local economy
*  And now you free up more resources for local governments that would do a much better job
*  With the money than washington dc
*  so
*  Essentially, it's like we all we need some sort of rules to get along
*  But you're saying that we should agree upon those rules in the free market and not have some
*  Government entity some group of people that's no different than our own selves
*  Controlling us and telling us what we can and can't do because it's written on paper somewhere
*  Because somewhere in the halls of justice people agree that you should be able to control people in a certain fashion
*  And acquire some percentage of their income and you use that money at your own discretion with no receipts whatsoever
*  Is that what you're saying? Yeah, and and here's you know, here's an important point though that I really want to get across
*  In in you know in this podcast
*  Because you know we are headed as I said for a massive economic crisis
*  I mean what we've seen so far is nothing right what happened in oh eight what's happened since covid
*  This is a dress rehearsal for a much bigger show that's coming that's going to be much worse
*  It's going to you know inflict a lot more pain and i'm not happy that this is going to happen
*  If I could stop it, I would i'm just like watching this, you know train wreck wreck in slow motion
*  And I can't do anything about it, but I know what's going to happen. It's going to be blamed on capitalism
*  Right there the politicians are going to say you see what happens when you don't have enough government when you don't have enough regulation
*  When you have too much greed, right and the public is going to buy this nonsense just the way they bought it
*  About the financial crisis the reason that I was warning people for years about the housing bubble and the financial crisis
*  The reason I was able to write a book and lay it out exactly the way it happened
*  The reason I was doing all these lectures around the country warning people about the disaster that the federal reserve was creating
*  Was because I understood the economics I understood the mistakes that greenspan was making and I knew the consequences
*  That were in store for us. Well the mistakes that have been made by by by bernanke by yellin by pal
*  Dwarf the ones that were made by by greenspan. It's the same mistakes just on a much bigger scale
*  The country is in far worse shape now than it ever was at any point in the past
*  You know structurally and with all the debt and this crisis is going to be a currency crisis
*  Where the dollar crashes we're going to have massive inflation in a weak economy
*  They called it stagflation when it happened in the 1970s the kainsians didn't know what to do with it because it did
*  It violated all their rules of economics because they don't understand economics
*  Well, this is going to be much worse and I want to make sure that people understand where to put the blame
*  It's not capitalism
*  It's not freedom
*  It's government and government is going to try to sell us on another bill of goods that the solution is to give government even more power
*  To give the federal reserve even more power when the only solution is to take away the power that they have
*  But I also want to make sure and this is what i'm doing personally. I do two things, right?
*  I try to educate people so they understand
*  The economy and so they know where who to blame for the problems
*  But i'm also trying to make sure
*  To spare as many people as I can
*  From suffering the financial consequences, right? I said earlier in the podcast that the government is
*  Financing these expenditures through inflation inflation is a tax right? The government is aching your purchasing power
*  We don't feel it that much now because foreigners are subsidizing us with holding our dollars in treasuries and other instruments
*  But when the dollar crashes and prices go through the roof people are going to get wiped out by this inflation tax
*  A lot of people who are retired are going to see their life savings just evaporate
*  I mean they'll still have their money
*  They just won't be able to buy anything with it
*  And what i'm afraid too is that we're going to get price controls because when the government starts to see prices really going up
*  And the public complains just like richard nixon did and although inflation was only four percent
*  When tricky dick put on wage and price controls, but I mean, it's gonna be way higher than that this time
*  But they're going to create shortages. They're going to create black markets
*  There's going to be blackouts food shortages audit. There'll be riots
*  You think the riots are bad now wait to see how much worse they're going to get, you know right now people are getting
*  You know placated by all these checks that the government is sending out
*  But when the checks bounce because they don't buy anything, uh, that's when you're really going to see
*  Uh the civil unrest but I want to make sure that people do something right?
*  That's what i'm doing with my clients that they that they get out of their dollars
*  To escape this inflation tax. I I want as many americans as possible
*  Not to go broke like you. I want to make sure that you just signed a big check with uh spotify
*  I you know, you know, you should have had a gold clause in that contract because you know, it's over 10 years
*  Five years from now. You're not going to get anywhere near the money
*  You think you're going to get because that inflation is going to destroy its value, right?
*  So you got to do something a lot of people let me hold on a second. Hold on a second. Stop
*  What would you have done differently and what can we do now like what would you have done differently if you and trump were homies?
*  And he said hey peter chef i'm thinking about shutting this thing down
*  Uh, what do you think I should do? What would you have done differently that would have somehow or another preserved?
*  At least a modicum of our economy
*  And what would you do? What would you advise they do going forward?
*  What would you have done differently? I don't want to preserve. I don't want to preserve the economy we had
*  Right because it was a what would you have done trying to preserve that as a mistake, right?
*  But what would you have done first thing, you know, this is coming
*  We need higher interest rates from the federal reserve not lower interest rates
*  We don't need any more money printing and we need the government to cut spending. Okay, but a disease is coming
*  We've done a disease is coming peter chef. We got to shut down the world or we're going to kill people
*  What do we do differently than what we did?
*  Again first of all, I think we would have handled the our response to the disease better
*  If we actually realized the cost of what we were doing. I think that we've acted so cavalierly
*  Because we believe we're getting all this government for free
*  We believe it's okay for people to stay at home and watch netflix and receive government checks
*  We don't understand the greater damage. See what we're doing now
*  This monetary policy this fiscal policy is going to impose far more harm
*  On average americans than the coronavirus ever could have so we have to get that that our cure
*  Is so much worse than the disease ever could have been we got to we got to we got to understand that concept
*  And we got to understand the concept that we had a bubble. We need to let it deflate
*  That is the best thing you can do with a bubble. Don't try to blow more air into it. Okay. Okay
*  Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Let me take this from this alternative perspective you
*  The the problem with what you're saying is that people
*  If the government didn't step in and ensure that some money went out so people could provide basic needs and necessities
*  People were going to die because they were going to have to go to work. They were going to die
*  Well, that's what we were thinking but peter that's what we thought in march. We did think that
*  Look, well, you know, they let hold on
*  You know, they thought take care of it. Did you not need the federal?
*  Did you not think we were gonna die in march?
*  Did you not think we were gonna die? Do you not think a certain percentage of people you knew were gonna die?
*  Well, I I there's always a certain percentage of people who get the the flu died
*  You know, obviously I knew from the beginning it was a little more concerning
*  Were the people who were 80 years old or higher who were dying from all sorts of things?
*  I mean, that's about that's when we started dying. I mean not many of us live much further than 80
*  That's about life expectancy. That's not necessarily true though. I know I have a good friend that almost died my friend
*  Michael yo who's a comedian has been on this podcast who's very healthy. He almost died from it
*  It's but how does the federal reserve printing money save somebody's life? I'm not saying it does what i'm saying is when it happened
*  It just creates a new problem saying is when the pandemic occurred. We were all scared
*  So if you're sitting here saying they should have done this
*  In a way at least it's an unfair version of monday night quarterbacking because or monday morning quarterbacking because we didn't really know what this disease was
*  In march, I was fucking scared of it. I was really nervous. Yeah, i'm not but i've had that's what i'm trying to do
*  My point joe is that our commie was such a disaster before covid. I understand that we were vulnerable to any
*  Anything that came out of left field any problem? So this is another financial crisis. It's like the oh eight financial crisis
*  Why is this a financial crisis in in 2008?
*  The reason it was a financial crisis was because real estate prices went down because they were they were a bubble created by the federal reserve
*  Fannie Mae freddie mac moral hazard and I wrote a book
*  I would lecture for years and years about the housing bubble and how the government nurtured it, right?
*  um and and so
*  um
*  Because we had this housing bubble once real estate prices went down people who borrowed money
*  Didn't pay back their loans
*  They no longer had any incentive to make the payments because their house was worth less than their mortgage
*  They just mailed in the keys. They called it jingle mail, right?
*  So now the banks were in trouble because the loans went bad and now wall street had packaged up these loans into tools of
*  Sub-prime securities. I made some money shorting those back in the day and some other people did too because we recognized
*  What was going to happen?
*  Uh, but the crisis started when people defaulted on their loans
*  Well, what's happening now way more people can't pay their loans than in 2008. It's not just people with mortgages that can't pay
*  Businesses can't pay their rent
*  right
*  Companies can't repay their debt. We have a corporate debt bubble in addition to a consumer debt bubble
*  We have record a credit card debt record auto loan debt record student loan debt record corporate debt record government debt
*  Everybody is loaded up with debt and now nobody can pay
*  It's all a financial crisis
*  but again
*  The only reason that this economy is so screwed up is because government policy screwed it up
*  And the solution isn't to increase that policy just like I said earlier
*  If you have a drug addict the solution isn't more drugs bigger doses of drugs to try to keep the guy high
*  Because eventually you can kill him you can overdose and that's where we are now
*  The amount of monetary stimulus that the fed is now crammed into this economy is a monetary overdose
*  Can I talk they're going to kill the economy peter? I know I I I see where you're coming from when it comes to
*  2008 loan crisis that makes a lot of sense
*  But the difference between this and that is these people didn't make any poor decisions
*  They're just thrust into this crazy world where there's a disease that forces businesses to shut down, but this is my perception
*  As a community of people shouldn't there be a way at least the government does its best at organizing
*  People to donate money that could go and help people that are in this situation
*  Don't you think there's a there's a there's a people would organize themselves
*  You think they would there would be private charities nobody would starve and nobody was starving in america
*  Before all these government anti-poverty programs when poverty was on the decline nobody was starving, right?
*  But hold on a second when starving people in right now are in the the they're in a real peril
*  They're in they could lose their house. They could lose their car. They could lose their education
*  There's a lot of weird shit going on right now. That's through no fault of their own because businesses are shut down
*  This is why I disagree that it's the same sort of situation that happened in 2008
*  For sure what you're saying makes sense in terms of economics about the the the foundation of our economic country
*  The the the way the economy was was fucked up already that makes sense
*  But yeah, but the same thing happened in the great depression
*  People through no fault of their own people were unemployed
*  Yeah, but this is a disease. I mean we had we during the depression russians initially got some relief
*  That was the first time we had welfare. They called it relief. It wasn't a lot of money, right?
*  There were no bailouts for businesses really, you know cash bailouts like we have now
*  Look if the government stayed out of this let the free market let landlords and tenants
*  Work it out among themselves. I mean the landlords know they can't evict because there's no other tenants
*  You know let let employers and employees let everything will work out in a free market, right?
*  If you let people voluntarily interact people aren't going to be kicked out on the street
*  People aren't going to be left hungry
*  The market is going to be able to solve the problems the government comes in and creates a whole new set of problems
*  That are that are far worse, right? Because the government doesn't have anything
*  All it does is print money now
*  It doesn't create anything right? It just prints it just creates money out of thin air that doesn't have any real value
*  I understand what you're saying in the process of doing that
*  They destroy the value of the money that exists and they screw up the economy immeasurably
*  They make the economy less productive and less efficient. And so that means people are going to be poor
*  Government makes me people poor. It's free market capitalism that makes them wealthier
*  I understand what you're saying, but in this situation, isn't this really unique where no one can work?
*  Where we're in a situation where for months and months we have to stay locked down
*  A lot of businesses are not essential or labeled essential whoever gets to decide that
*  I mean shouldn't that be something we vote on what's essential and not essential? I mean that seems a little crazy
*  Yeah, I do think that all that government telling people what businesses can and cannot open look
*  I disagree with a lot of these policies and again
*  I believe that governments would have acted more responsibly if they didn't think they could put the cost on the federal reserve
*  Which is what everybody is doing. I think if each state had to shoulder the burden of its own policies
*  They would they would have a more rational approach
*  To to covet 19. This was what everybody thought it was free and we had this huge moral hazard
*  Yeah, this is what I asked you to get and now again we created this situation. Look, you got all these school teachers
*  They don't want to go back to work. They want to get paid not to work
*  We've now created a situation where so many people i'm not going to go to work
*  Oh, I don't want to risk getting covid just send my paycheck to my house. Why'd you single out school teachers?
*  This is ridiculous. Why'd you single out school teachers? Why'd you say school teachers?
*  Because I was just you know, they're the unions are you know, they're out there saying but it's not just school teachers
*  Right. There's a lot of people who want to say I don't want to work because I don't want to get covid
*  And so, you know, but meanwhile people take a lot of risk. I mean maybe someone who doesn't want to
*  Go get covid they go out mountain biking, you know where they go skydiving or who knows what they're they smoke cigarettes
*  You know, they do all sorts of things that that risk their health
*  But now all of a sudden no, no, no, i'm not gonna i'm even I don't even want to go if I have to wear a mask
*  I just want to stay home because we're giving people
*  An easy way out of going to a job that they'd rather not go to
*  I mean, I don't blame people for not liking their jobs, you know, I don't blame people for enjoying leisure
*  But you know, we can't set this situation up
*  But what makes everybody think it's possible is because we don't think there's a cost to all this printing money
*  It's all this like modern monetary theory nonsense that we can just print money
*  We can have whatever we want as long as the federal reserve prints the money to pay for it
*  I see what you're saying. This is a disastrous way of thinking. I see I see exactly what you're saying
*  um, and
*  I think it's interesting because I don't think it's either or I think there's definitely a lot of people that are going to
*  Just never go back to work again if they get that money if they get free money for the government
*  But I also hold on a second peter
*  I also think it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if we could figure out a way to get food to people
*  And make sure they don't starve to death. I see like both extremes
*  You know how cheap food is now thanks to the free market the government has screwed up agriculture
*  But here's the department of agriculture. We actually pay farmers joe. We pay farmers not to farm
*  Yes, we pay farmers not to grow food to diminish the supply of food
*  Do you realize that we do that? I yeah, i've heard about that with corn subsidies and yeah
*  The goal of the department of agriculture is to keep food prices high
*  That is the stated goal right what they want to do is restrict farming
*  So that less stuff is farmed so that food prices are higher. That is what the government is actively doing
*  They are pursuing a policy to make food more expensive than it otherwise would be but what is there?
*  Less abundant what kind of asinine policy is that what's there when when they describe it?
*  How do they describe about when they they state their business model? How do they say it?
*  That's your version of it. They're trying they're saying that they want to protect the farmers
*  They want to keep farmers open or because they could have bad weather or bad crops or right
*  They just want to make they want to keep up
*  Do you know income? Do you know where these subsidies came from? Do you know where these subsidies came from?
*  They came from again they start with the new deal right but it came from world war ii when they needed food
*  When they needed to supply the troops they needed money for food
*  There's a lot of a lot of what happened with farm subsidies
*  They want they recognize that we could get into a situation where we don't have enough food
*  Especially if farmers go under so they decided to subsidize farms
*  That's what's like what i'm not an expert on this by any stretch of the imagination
*  But I read a piece on it once and the way they were describing it was like people like to look at subsidizing farms
*  As being this like frivolous thing or thing that doesn't really benefit the people
*  But the idea came about because they were worried about one day having a food shortage and this can't happen post world war ii
*  Are you aware of that? That's the nonsense right that the government wants you to believe look you can go back
*  You know we subsidize tobacco right the government gives subsidies to tobacco farmers
*  And and and actually if you go back when they you know they talked about it initially because they say hey
*  Why are we subsidizing tobacco farmers?
*  Because you know don't we why do we want to make it easier for people to smoke and they actually agreed that the subsidies are
*  Restricting the production of tobacco and making tobacco more expensive and so by subsidizing tobacco farmers
*  We'll actually have fewer smokers because we're making the cost of tobacco higher. That's what government does
*  Tobacco goes in but makes the price of food higher. That's their goal. That's it make food more expensive
*  I mean, that's an industry that kills people. Heartless is that that's tobacco
*  You're talking about an industry that knows from the jobs for subsidy, but but but tobacco is different man
*  They know they're killing. No, no, that's the same
*  Okay, i'm saying we shouldn't we shouldn't subsidize tobacco farmers, but they said we're doing it because it makes tobacco more expensive
*  Okay, well it's the same subsidy for wheat farmers, but it wasn't originated
*  Goal is to make a price higher. Yes, but that's not that wasn't the initial goal the initial goal
*  Like of course it became they never say that they're never honest government is never honest about what it's doing
*  But don't you think it's trying to get the votes of the farmers the farmers want higher prices
*  I understand but don't you think that post world war two they were seriously concerned about having food supplies
*  So they could feed soldiers and feed people in this country if the shit hit the fan you think it was really
*  About so much food, you know joe one of the things they did during the great depression was they destroyed food
*  So that was like one of the big programs of fdl i'm saying is just right again
*  Because we had too much of it. So it's just propaganda what i'm saying is just yes
*  I got a whole they they hit me they hit me with their propaganda. I'm reciting it
*  Yeah, it's all look people always want something from government. Look people who are selling a product want high prices, right consumers
*  We want low prices, but if you're selling something you want high prices, but competition brings prices down
*  So what you do is you enlist government to help you and government helps you get higher prices than you can get in a free market
*  Right. So government private companies have an incentive to get the support of politicians
*  So they can make more money than they could in a free market
*  The problem is we need to take away the power of the government to grant those special privileges to any business
*  There should be no subsidies for businesses, you know corporate welfare does as much damage maybe more than than welfare for individuals
*  Right all of this has to go and we need a vibrant free market economy
*  And hopefully when this whole thing collapses and it's going to collapse
*  And we have hyperinflation or very high inflation and we wipe out the savings of the vast majority of americans
*  And we go through a really really, you know hard deep economic time period
*  If we could do a reboot if we can resist the temptation to fully embrace socialism and go all in
*  On the ill ideology that destroyed us if we can go back to free market capitalism. We have a bright future
*  I mean, you know with the tools that we have today if we can have 19th century capitalism with 21st century technology
*  I mean, it's amazing what we can achieve. You know, I watched your interview with andrew yang
*  You know who's afraid of technology destroying jobs. Look technology is going to liberate labor. It's going to make us richer
*  They've people have been advancing
*  Andy yang's
*  Analogy probably ever since the wheel was discovered. There's always some politician that says oh this new technology advancement is going to put somebody out of work
*  Yes, we want to save labor
*  We want to free up labor to do something else because labor is scarce
*  And if we can free it up from a mundane up, you know activity that labor can do something else
*  And now we can have more we can have more stuff. We can have a higher standard of living
*  So all that is possible, but I want to make sure that there are people who don't go broke
*  That's why i'm telling people, you know get out of your dollars, you know buying gold
*  I've been telling people on your podcast, you know gold is now over 1800 dollars an ounce
*  I think when I started coming on, you know, it was closer to a thousand
*  But I think it's going to five thousand ten thousand twenty thousand. I mean and it's not really gold going up
*  Let me dollar going down. This is dollar is going to lose its value. This is how this is where people are at today
*  one of the concerns
*  with um
*  the way our our country is going is there's a lot of people that are just
*  They're leaning towards what they feel is the right way to go where all their peers agree is the right way to go
*  And it's going to lead to a better future
*  But a lot of the people making these decisions don't have a lot of life experience
*  So you got a tremendous amount of momentum for 18 19 20 year old people
*  And when they hear something like free market
*  Free market capitalism is going to fix the world
*  One of the things that bothers them the most is that they associate free market capitalism with greed with greed and money over people
*  And and this is what what what the problem is the way
*  They promoted themselves the like and you yeah, I agree someone says like i'm a libertarian
*  There's a lot of people that automatically say i'm doing a better job of selling their ideology. Yes
*  Than the capitalists and and capitalism is getting blamed for a lot of the problems that socialism
*  Is is creating?
*  But you know when when people are saying again, it's somebody is greedy
*  We're all greedy in the sense that we all want
*  Uh the best for ourselves and our families, right?
*  We all want to go out and and and and make money so that we can have a better life and buy more things that
*  We feel will make us happy, right? Yes
*  And so but what again what people have to understand is capitalism channels that greed
*  In a very positive way
*  Because in order for somebody to enrich themselves in a free market
*  They need the voluntary cooperation of other people
*  They need to be able to to provide goods and services that are better
*  lower cost higher quality than somebody else
*  And they have to provide employment opportunities
*  They have to provide people with better jobs than somebody else because they usually you can't have a company
*  Unless you can get people to work for you peter. I'm agreeing you have to have good jobs and good products peter
*  I agree with everything you're saying and the worker I agree with everything you're saying
*  But what i'm saying is that in the general public's view when you say free market capitalism
*  They equate mean when you see socialism. Yes equate kind. This is the problem
*  There's a problem
*  not even nearly as much as philosophy or fact
*  Or history of like when you're talking about the free market
*  But rather the way the public perceives it when they think of socialism they think is good and healthy
*  And and warm and loving and inclusive and they think that's the future like I don't know
*  What socialism is done to market themselves so well legalized theft whatever socialism is done to market itself
*  There's nothing benevolent or caring about theft. Yes, right. I don't care if the thief is well intentioned, right? It's immoral
*  Capitalism is moral. It's honest and it's what lifts people out of poverty
*  You know the world is his is littered with examples of socialists that have impoverished people and you know
*  There's various forms of socialism. There's communism. There's fascism, right?
*  Millions and millions of people have been slaughtered in the name of this failed ideology
*  And every country that has embraced it it has impoverished everybody, right? They don't share the wealth
*  They destroy the wealth they make everybody equal by impoverishing everybody
*  But peter why is it so attractive the rich people under socialism are the people with political connections?
*  Why is it so attractive then why is it so attractive?
*  Why do so many kids why are so many young progressive?
*  Ideologically left-wing kids
*  Attracted to the idea of socialism. Why is it so attractive?
*  Why do so many five-year-olds believe in santa claus, you know, I mean
*  Because you lie to it's a nice idea some guy comes in down the chimney and gives you a bunch of presents, right?
*  But you're agreeing you lie to them when you tell them about santa claus. That's a willful lie
*  But you don't have to tell them they figure it out. I mean eventually the kid is old enough
*  So this is this is what happens with socialists, bro
*  You're a young guy or a young woman
*  And you don't have any real life experience. You haven't worked. You haven't had a business
*  You haven't been out in the real world. You live with your parents you go to school
*  And and socialism sounds good. I mean in theory it sounds great, but you don't have any real life experience
*  By the time you're older and you've been in the real world and you've paid taxes and you've seen the consequences
*  You start to understand more and then you you you give up your childish beliefs
*  The problem with a lot of these older socialists like sanders. It's like a kid that never grows up
*  It's like somebody who's 70 and still believes in santa claus like they never figured it out, right?
*  So that's sanders never figured out that there's no santa claus
*  He thinks there's santa claus and it's the u.s government and we can get all this stuff for free
*  If you know if we're just nice, I would love to lock you two together
*  I would love to lock you two together in a room and film it for like six hours. Just have you
*  I would debate any big socialist that you could get on your show. I'm sure you would i'd love to do it
*  Listen peter, we just banged through three hours if you can believe it or not
*  No, I you know
*  We can keep going for another three because there's so much stuff that we could actually talk about
*  No, I think but I just want to say this before we wrap up. I think you provide some very honest and brave insight
*  You you buck the trend of sugar coating things and the way you describe your version of free market
*  Capitalism is very honest and it doesn't seem mean
*  I think this is what's important about it
*  Like there's a lot of people that think that they have this thought in their head
*  This was trying to get across that if you say capitalism if you say someone who's ambitious you equate that and success to mean
*  And this is a part of the problem with the marketing strategy that's been employed
*  By capitalism and it's not a real strategy but versus socialism
*  Socialism has a really attractive even though it has what you were saying before it has all these deaths connected to it
*  No success. It's got this really like maybe if we just try it one more time. This is really attractive
*  It's it's it's something that's inside of people that are compassionate. They're like maybe we can try it one more time and get it right
*  Yeah, and it's not my version of capitalism. That's capitalism. What we have now is not capitalism
*  My bad, but i'm saying your version. I mean the way you describe it
*  People who are mean right actual mean people don't succeed in business
*  They they piss off their customers. They piss off their workers
*  They lose their customers their employees quit and they get better jobs from people who treat them fairly customers go where they get a good deal
*  Right and and so I want to put my faith in individuals and the free market not a bunch of bureaucrats, right?
*  These guys are out for themselves don't don't think they're there to be public servants. They're there to enrich themselves
*  That's who you have to be suspicious of that's where greed is damaging when you have when you when you when you take greed
*  And combine it with political power. That's what it's a problem in a free market. It just helps me
*  It's government that hurts me. But look, I want to you know point out I talk about this
*  I got my own podcast not nearly as popular as yours
*  Uh, but you know, I would certainly welcome the people that listen to rogan to go and listen to the petership show
*  I I do a couple of podcasts. You could listen to them on shift radio. You can listen to them on youtube
*  Instagram what's your instagram?
*  Yeah, you know, I just started instagram crazy enough. My wife was like you got to go on instagram
*  How many people do you have on it right now?
*  Well, I only have you know a few thousand followers. I just started we can do i've got
*  I've got about
*  250,000 twitter followers, you know, they still haven't verified my account, you know
*  Whatever it is, I can't get verified. I got a million followers. I'll tell you exactly
*  Those are occupy wall street videos. That's what it was. They fucked you over
*  Those occupy wall street videos on my youtube channel. I've got about 350,000 subscribers on my youtube channel
*  So and but i'm talking mostly economics. I do a little politics. I touch on some of the social issues
*  I talk a lot about the markets and again, I think it's important. I mean I have an asset management business
*  I'm trying to get people to get out of us stocks. I think are overpriced out of us bonds
*  I think we're headed for a major crash and unlike the crash we had in 2008 and
*  2000 the feds not going to be able to bail you out with a printing press
*  It's not going to be the third time the charm it's going to be three strikes you're out
*  So you got to get your money out of us markets
*  I'm investing money around the world in countries that I think are relatively free
*  They have less regulation lower taxes more economic freedom their markets are not overpriced
*  Their currencies are going to retain their value. We're buying gold. We're buying gold stocks
*  I'm doing everything I can to preserve as much wealth as I can for americans
*  Yes, so that when the shit hits the fan we can bring that money back and help to rebuild this country. You're an animal
*  Listen, um, what how many people do you have on instagram? I want to see how many we can bump you up to
*  What do you have right now? As I said, I just started it this week. But what is it?
*  I'm gonna start putting up. It's my peter schiff is my handle but I want to know how many you have because I want to
*  I want to see how many we can get you look at it. I just 3000. Jamie. What does he have?
*  Yeah, 35. Jamie doesn't know he's gonna find out on the internet. We'll see we can
*  Yeah, but look see if you can get my twitter up to a million or my youtube channel
*  I mean, you know listen we will get people will go everywhere peter schiff. Listen, I appreciate you
*  I appreciate your honesty and your perspective and it's always a good time talking to you and I appreciate you
*  Sharing your information with us because from a real experience perspective of someone who really understands what you're talking about. I really appreciate it
*  One thing I want to mention about that occupy wall street
*  I did that occupy wall street and I got two and a half million views on it now on my channel and it had
*  Millions and millions of views before I posted it. I posted it a couple years ago right before I went on your show
*  Just so I can point people to it. But even though I did that like in 2009
*  Every single day. I don't think I miss a day
*  I get an email from somebody some young person from somewhere in the world
*  It's you know all over the world to say that that video that two-hour video of me
*  Addressing the occupiers that that is what changed them and put them on the direction of going from socialist to free market
*  That after they heard me talk, they did some more research
*  They educated and they did a complete 180 and they went from being total government socialist to being complete free market capitalist because
*  They saw that video and that's why I went down to zuccotti park
*  I didn't think that I would necessarily change the minds of the occupiers, but I knew that the video that reason was doing
*  Would would change more people minds so the more people who see that
*  You know who look at that interaction and share it with your friends and people who you know
*  Who look at me listen to my podcast or look at my tweets and share them?
*  And we got to spread the truth because there's so many people spreading lies
*  There's only me and a few other people spreading the truth
*  So we need help we need the public to help disseminate the information that i'm putting out there
*  I don't charge anybody for this information. Everything is I don't you know, I don't make any money off the podcast
*  I'm trying to get it out there. Yes. Sometimes I get clients people become clients of mine that I make some money
*  But the vast majority of people who are listening to my content
*  They're they don't have enough money to fund an account with me
*  But what but but i'm influencing them in the way they think and i'm helping them influence others
*  All right, so they tune out all the nonsense. Thank you. Thank you
*  Peter chef. Thanks joe. All right. Stay hard. Thanks for having me on. Thanks buddy
