*  I've seen you in documentaries for decades. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=21.0s)]
*  So many documentaries. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=24.0s)]
*  I've watched so many things about Egypt. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=25.0s)]
*  I'm completely fascinated by it. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=27.0s)]
*  You know, I will tell you something. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=28.0s)]
*  Do you know this guy used to do a radio show late evening? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=30.0s)]
*  Art Bell? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=34.0s)]
*  The best. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=35.0s)]
*  He was the best. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=36.0s)]
*  Can I? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=37.0s)]
*  I need to say this on air. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=38.0s)]
*  I need to say this story on air. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=39.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=41.0s)]
*  Now, are we on air now? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=42.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're on air. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=43.0s)]
*  Art Bell used everything to attack me. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=44.0s)]
*  He did? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=48.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=49.0s)]
*  How? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=50.0s)]
*  How the Egyptians can move stones. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=51.0s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=55.0s)]
*  The Egyptians cannot do that. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=56.0s)]
*  Bah bah bah bah bah. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=58.0s)]
*  Then I was teaching at UCLA, and he called me for an interview. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=59.0s)]
*  I said, no, I'm not going to give you an interview until you come to visit me in Egypt. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=63.0s)]
*  And he said, okay. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=70.0s)]
*  He came with his wife. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=71.0s)]
*  I took him to a quarry that were cutting stones to construct the strings. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=72.0s)]
*  Then I brought a stone, eight tons weight, and I brought a man on the age of 70. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=81.0s)]
*  And I told this man, cut this stone. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=89.0s)]
*  The old man stood above the stone. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=92.0s)]
*  You know, stones has weak parts like us. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=95.0s)]
*  With a pencil, he draw a line from the beginning to the end. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=98.0s)]
*  In the middle, he put a piece of iron, pump, pump, he cut it for twice. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=106.0s)]
*  I said, art, the Egyptian doesn't use muscles. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=113.0s)]
*  They use their brain. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=118.0s)]
*  Because the pyramid was the national project of the whole nation. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=120.0s)]
*  If you go today, if I take you today with me, and you know, I always tell people this. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=124.0s)]
*  I give lectures, maybe three, four times a week for American groups. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=130.0s)]
*  And I tell them the following. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=136.0s)]
*  If you stood in front of the Great Pyramid and you look at it, you will never believe that this pyramid built by human being. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=139.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=146.0s)]
*  Because you don't know. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=147.0s)]
*  And number two, if you try to do it today, you will never be able to do it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=149.0s)]
*  If you're going to hire today, Tim Sutherland, to work for Tim for 28 years for nothing. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=153.0s)]
*  That was the national project of the whole nation. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=161.0s)]
*  I think Art Bell's real concern was how would someone possibly move those stones 4,500 years ago? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=165.0s)]
*  OK, yes. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=174.0s)]
*  But can I answer you now? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=176.0s)]
*  Yes, please. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=177.0s)]
*  Listen, two examples I will tell you. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=180.0s)]
*  The first example happened a few years ago. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=184.0s)]
*  I discovered a tomb in a site called Abbasir. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=187.0s)]
*  In the top of the tomb, there was a huge granite sarcophagus, 20 tons weight. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=192.0s)]
*  OK? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=202.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=203.0s)]
*  If you come to Egypt, have you been to Egypt? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=205.0s)]
*  No, I haven't. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=207.0s)]
*  You have to. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=208.0s)]
*  If you talk about Egypt, you have to come. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=209.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=211.0s)]
*  But you have to tell me before you come. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=212.0s)]
*  I'll come. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=213.0s)]
*  I will tell you. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=214.0s)]
*  Now. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=215.0s)]
*  I promise. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=216.0s)]
*  I brought only 10 people because I called the Minister of Culture. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=217.0s)]
*  And I told him, we found an intact tomb. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=224.0s)]
*  And the minister said, wait, I will bring the reporter, the press, and we'll do it live. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=230.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=236.0s)]
*  But I hate to do anything live. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=237.0s)]
*  Then I came to the site. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=239.0s)]
*  I brought my workmen. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=241.0s)]
*  10 workmen only moved the 20 tons only by wooden slinges. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=243.0s)]
*  We found underneath another sarcophagus 10 tons weight of granite. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=250.0s)]
*  We took the third one and we found underneath another, a third one, 5 tons weight. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=257.0s)]
*  We took the 5 tons out and we found underneath a coffin with zamami. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=263.0s)]
*  And I told the workmen, put everything back. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=268.0s)]
*  And I called the minister. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=271.0s)]
*  I said, you can bring the press. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=272.0s)]
*  We'll open it live. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=274.0s)]
*  I never told them that I cheated them. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=275.0s)]
*  But only in a site that I'm excavating right now, we do discover 60 feet under the ground. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=277.0s)]
*  We discover sealed sarcophagus. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=285.0s)]
*  The lid is about 10 tons weight. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=287.0s)]
*  Two workmen only opened the lid for me. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=292.0s)]
*  We have a machine called the devil. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=295.0s)]
*  I don't know why they call it the devil. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=298.0s)]
*  Devil? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=300.0s)]
*  Devil. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=301.0s)]
*  Why? I don't know. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=302.0s)]
*  I asked them. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=303.0s)]
*  They said our grandfathers called it like that. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=304.0s)]
*  Then they brought it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=307.0s)]
*  This is an ancient machine? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=308.0s)]
*  It is an ancient machine. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=309.0s)]
*  Jamie could probably pull it up. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=311.0s)]
*  It's probably online. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=312.0s)]
*  They put this machine under the lid and they come doing like this and they raise the lid [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=313.0s)]
*  a little bit. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=323.0s)]
*  When the lid is raised, they put a piece of wood, another piece of wood, until there is [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=324.0s)]
*  a half a feet that they can put my face inside with the flashlight to see what's inside the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=331.0s)]
*  coffin. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=340.0s)]
*  That's what we, because the people today are the descendants of the ancient Egyptians. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=341.0s)]
*  There is a village located north of Luxor and this village, all the people work in antiquities [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=347.0s)]
*  and they know if you look at their faces, exactly like the ancient Egyptian people and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=356.0s)]
*  all the people working with me. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=361.0s)]
*  I'm excavating right now in Giza. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=363.0s)]
*  I'm going to tell you good news inside the great pyramid that we found and also in Saqqara [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=366.0s)]
*  and Luxor. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=373.0s)]
*  This is why in my lecture tour now I'm making major important announcements that we'll [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=374.0s)]
*  talk about with you today. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=379.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=381.0s)]
*  What did you find? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=382.0s)]
*  Now, you know, can I call you Joe? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=383.0s)]
*  Please do. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=388.0s)]
*  And you call me Zahi. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=389.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=390.0s)]
*  Now. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=391.0s)]
*  You know, I do receive fan emails. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=392.0s)]
*  You've received emails? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=396.0s)]
*  Fan. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=398.0s)]
*  Fan emails. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=399.0s)]
*  About 50 a week. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=400.0s)]
*  Some of them bad ones. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=402.0s)]
*  Some people think that I discovered evidence to prove that pyramids built by aliens or lost [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=405.0s)]
*  civilization and I hide them. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=415.0s)]
*  I never answer these questions. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=417.0s)]
*  But to you I tell you how do I, how can I hide anything? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=420.0s)]
*  I'm not working alone. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=423.0s)]
*  I'm working with people. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=425.0s)]
*  You cannot hide anything because people will see you. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=427.0s)]
*  And I will tell you a joke. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=430.0s)]
*  It happened. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=433.0s)]
*  But it's a joke. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=434.0s)]
*  A reporter came to see me from California to my office and my office was located next [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=436.0s)]
*  to the great pyramid of Kufu. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=443.0s)]
*  And he said to me, people say at 12 noon, you leave your office and you go to the bathroom [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=447.0s)]
*  and you open a tunnel from your bathroom. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=453.0s)]
*  It's really what he said. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=457.0s)]
*  And you go from the tunnel to the great pyramid and you hide things and you come back. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=459.0s)]
*  I said, okay, what do you need from me now? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=464.0s)]
*  He said, I want to see your bathroom. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=467.0s)]
*  It really happened. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=469.0s)]
*  He went to my bathroom. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=471.0s)]
*  Did he check all the panels? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=473.0s)]
*  And he came back and have you seen any tunnels in my bathroom? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=475.0s)]
*  He said, no. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=477.0s)]
*  I said, what are you going to do now? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=478.0s)]
*  He said, I will publish your bathroom in the internet. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=480.0s)]
*  And therefore, if you want to see my bathroom, write www.hawasbathroom.com. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=484.0s)]
*  Is that much of an issue that people really believe it, that you had to make a website for it? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=491.0s)]
*  They do. They do believe in this. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=496.0s)]
*  And some of them attack me badly. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=498.0s)]
*  Well, that's part of the problem, right? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=500.0s)]
*  The Egyptian pyramids and just Egypt in general is so spectacular. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=502.0s)]
*  The accomplishments of the ancient Egyptians were so monumental and so above anything that anybody had ever achieved. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=507.0s)]
*  And since, you know, what they've done thousands and thousands of years ago still to this day puzzles people when they try to figure out how it was built. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=514.0s)]
*  I will tell you. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=523.0s)]
*  You will tell me how it was built? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=525.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=526.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=527.0s)]
*  I. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=528.0s)]
*  How do you know? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=529.0s)]
*  How do you know? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=530.0s)]
*  I found all the evidence of building the pyramid. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=531.0s)]
*  I we we published a book, one thousand pages. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=534.0s)]
*  This book is a Bible of the pyramids of Giza Plateau. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=538.0s)]
*  Okay. Tell me how they did it. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=542.0s)]
*  Now, what we found out, the major problem that people think about pyramids, because most of the information that's written on pyramids are wrong. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=544.0s)]
*  Most of it? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=558.0s)]
*  Most of it. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=559.0s)]
*  In archaeology? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=560.0s)]
*  In archaeology books. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=561.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=562.0s)]
*  Except me and Mark Liener. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=563.0s)]
*  You guys are the only ones that have it right? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=565.0s)]
*  Because I have been working in Giza for the last 57 years of my life. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=567.0s)]
*  I excavated every piece of sand. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=573.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=575.0s)]
*  What do the archaeologists have wrong in these archaeologists books? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=576.0s)]
*  For example, number one, they say that the workmen who built the pyramids worked only four months a year. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=581.0s)]
*  When the flood covered the whole country, the king hired the workmen to work in this pyramid. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=589.0s)]
*  This is wrong. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=595.0s)]
*  And I will tell you what's correct. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=596.0s)]
*  Number two, that the stones used in building the Great Pyramid came from Torah. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=598.0s)]
*  And Torah is a 25 mile to the east from Giza. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=604.0s)]
*  And number three, that Kufu ruled for 23 years. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=610.0s)]
*  And number four, that the stones of the Great Pyramid are 2,300,000 blocks. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=614.0s)]
*  How many blocks are there? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=620.0s)]
*  Now let us talk about number one, the workmen. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=622.0s)]
*  The workmen. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=625.0s)]
*  I found the tombs of the pyramid builders only one mile south of the Sphinx. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=626.0s)]
*  A major important discovery that can tell everyone. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=634.0s)]
*  Number one, that pyramids built by Egyptians because of the names that we found inside the cemetery. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=639.0s)]
*  And they were not slaves. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=647.0s)]
*  Is that your phone? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=649.0s)]
*  I have to kill that thing. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=650.0s)]
*  Kill it. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=653.0s)]
*  You're right. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=654.0s)]
*  I always, because I do lots of interviews, I always close it. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=655.0s)]
*  Oh, I get it. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=658.0s)]
*  Except today. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=659.0s)]
*  No worries. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=660.0s)]
*  Nobody knows how to shut these things off anymore. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=661.0s)]
*  Then now this discovery. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=666.0s)]
*  So explain. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=669.0s)]
*  So you found the pyramids, excuse me, you found the workers pyramids graves a mile away. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=670.0s)]
*  Away one mile south of the pyramids. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=677.0s)]
*  And by their names? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=680.0s)]
*  Then I found names of the workmen. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=682.0s)]
*  I found the lower symmetry. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=686.0s)]
*  The lower symmetry were for the burial of the workmen who moved the stones. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=688.0s)]
*  And the upper symmetry was for the technicians. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=693.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=697.0s)]
*  And how do you know this? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=698.0s)]
*  I will tell you. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=699.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=700.0s)]
*  Now, the tombs down there are very primitive tombs built from mud brick, cost nothing. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=701.0s)]
*  Underneath is a skeleton. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=708.0s)]
*  And if a skeleton is for a man, he's holding a beer jar. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=711.0s)]
*  He wants to drink beer in the afterlife. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=716.0s)]
*  If the skeleton is for a woman, she has a perfume vessels. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=718.0s)]
*  She wants to have perfume in the afterlife. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=722.0s)]
*  Inside the upper symmetry, I found 21 titles in hieroglyphic. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=725.0s)]
*  For example, the overseer in hieroglyphic of the side of the pyramid. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=732.0s)]
*  It says that the overseer of the side of the pyramid. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=738.0s)]
*  Emera ges mer in hieroglyphic. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=741.0s)]
*  The overseer of the west side of the pyramid. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=744.0s)]
*  The craftsman, craftsman, the one who stand in front of the harbour. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=748.0s)]
*  All these titles had to do with building the pyramid. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=753.0s)]
*  Inside the tombs, we found the tools that the Egyptians used to cut the stones. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=757.0s)]
*  What tools? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=763.0s)]
*  Durete and flint tools. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=764.0s)]
*  Because in the whole kingdom, there was no iron. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=767.0s)]
*  Are these photos of these tools available online? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=770.0s)]
*  Can we look at them? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=773.0s)]
*  Yeah, I can send it to you. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=774.0s)]
*  Can we see them online? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=775.0s)]
*  Are they online? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=776.0s)]
*  No, in my book, Giza and the Pyramids. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=777.0s)]
*  I don't know if it's online. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=779.0s)]
*  I'm sure it's online. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=780.0s)]
*  Jamie will find it. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=781.0s)]
*  So these tools were flint and durete. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=782.0s)]
*  What is durete? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=785.0s)]
*  Durete, D-I-O-R-I-T-E. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=786.0s)]
*  Durete is more sharp stone than iron. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=790.0s)]
*  And it came from a quarry south of Aswan. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=795.0s)]
*  So you feel like they used this very hard stone to cut into the pyramid. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=802.0s)]
*  To cut the stone. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=806.0s)]
*  And I will come back to this cutting the stones. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=807.0s)]
*  But let me continue about the workmen. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=810.0s)]
*  To the east of the tombs, we found an area for sorting salted fish. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=812.0s)]
*  We found an area for the bakery making bread. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=818.0s)]
*  We found the workmen barracks for the workmen who moved the stones to live. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=822.0s)]
*  We found a whole city for the technicians, for the artisans. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=828.0s)]
*  And we discovered thousands of animal bones. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=832.0s)]
*  Because people always say that the workmen who built the pyramid, they ate only garlic and bread. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=836.0s)]
*  And drink beer. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=843.0s)]
*  And I thought if they do that, they will die. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=844.0s)]
*  But now we discovered that they slaughter 11 cows and 33 goats every day. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=847.0s)]
*  And this can feed 10,000 workmen a day. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=855.0s)]
*  Then we believe now, and I published that the workmen who built the pyramids were 10,000 workmen. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=858.0s)]
*  And they worked every day. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=864.0s)]
*  And they took one day off every 10 days. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=866.0s)]
*  Joe, I want to tell you, the pyramid was a national project. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=869.0s)]
*  The three millions who lived in Egypt had to build the pyramid for the king to be a god. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=872.0s)]
*  And therefore, the households in the south and the north of Egypt participated in building the pyramid. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=879.0s)]
*  By sending workforce and food to help the king. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=886.0s)]
*  Now we come to the second point, the stones. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=890.0s)]
*  We discovered that all the stones of the three pyramids at Giza, the stones came from quarries in the site itself. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=892.0s)]
*  Even the king's chamber? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=902.0s)]
*  No, except the granite in the king's chamber. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=905.0s)]
*  And where did that come from? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=909.0s)]
*  From Aswan. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=911.0s)]
*  And that's 500 miles away, right? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=912.0s)]
*  Yes, by the flood. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=914.0s)]
*  The flood. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=915.0s)]
*  And those were 50 to 80 tons? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=916.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=918.0s)]
*  It doesn't? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=919.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=920.0s)]
*  If I was working there, it wouldn't matter. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=921.0s)]
*  No, because I showed you. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=922.0s)]
*  I showed you. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=924.0s)]
*  Not only 50 tons. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=925.0s)]
*  It's 20 tons. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=926.0s)]
*  Now, what we found out, first how the Egyptians built the pyramid. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=928.0s)]
*  They make on the ground a square base. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=934.0s)]
*  Okay? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=937.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=938.0s)]
*  And after that, they cut in the solid rock in the four sides. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=940.0s)]
*  You know, I'm going to tell you one thing. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=946.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=950.0s)]
*  If you tell me that pyramids built by giants, okay? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=951.0s)]
*  I'm saying, okay, come to the excavation. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=957.0s)]
*  All the skeleton that you discover are five to six feet high. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=960.0s)]
*  Nothing about giants. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=966.0s)]
*  Who's saying they were built by giants? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=967.0s)]
*  Some people say that. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=969.0s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=970.0s)]
*  The second. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=971.0s)]
*  I've heard aliens. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=972.0s)]
*  Okay, the second aliens. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=973.0s)]
*  If aliens built the pyramids, do they leave any? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=974.0s)]
*  Do they shit sometimes? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=979.0s)]
*  Aren't they going to shit? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=981.0s)]
*  Maybe aliens don't shit. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=982.0s)]
*  If they don't shit, are they going to leave something on the ground? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=983.0s)]
*  On the contrary, I give you the evidence, every evidence that I will tell you today, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=989.0s)]
*  of actual workers and what's happening. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=995.0s)]
*  Now we come about building the pyramid. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=998.0s)]
*  All the stones I told you came from Giza Plateau. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1001.0s)]
*  We found out what happened first. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1003.0s)]
*  They cut in the solid rock. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1005.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1007.0s)]
*  And they made the base of the pyramid to be 28 feet on the solid rock. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1008.0s)]
*  No stones. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1017.0s)]
*  Do you get this? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1018.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1019.0s)]
*  We have in Egypt 120 pyramids. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1020.0s)]
*  We don't have only Kufu pyramid that everyone is talking about. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1024.0s)]
*  You have 120 pyramids. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1027.0s)]
*  This is one of them. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1029.0s)]
*  But the reason that this pyramid is so accurate and strong because Giza Plateau is the only [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1031.0s)]
*  site in Egypt of the pyramids. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1037.0s)]
*  It's a part of the Mokattam formation. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1039.0s)]
*  It has three levels. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1041.0s)]
*  Level one and two are very bad stones. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1043.0s)]
*  But level three is the top quality of the stones that the Egyptians use this stone to [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1046.0s)]
*  build the pyramid. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1053.0s)]
*  Then after they make the base of the pyramid to be 20 feet each of stone, we found out [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1054.0s)]
*  1000 feet away. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1060.0s)]
*  We found out the quarry location. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1063.0s)]
*  All the stones. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1066.0s)]
*  So they only had to bring the stones 1000 feet. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1067.0s)]
*  Only. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1070.0s)]
*  Only the stones that came from outside are the KC stones. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1072.0s)]
*  And I will talk about this later. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1078.0s)]
*  That came from Torah and the granite came from Aswan. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1080.0s)]
*  And the casing stones with the outside smooth surface. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1083.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1085.0s)]
*  It came from Torah. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1086.0s)]
*  Then now when we discovered the quarry location and the base of the pyramid, we thought how [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1088.0s)]
*  they established the ramp. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1094.0s)]
*  You know the ramp to move the stones. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1098.0s)]
*  We found out if the Egyptians would make the ramp from the quarry to the base, it will [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1101.0s)]
*  never happen. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1106.0s)]
*  Because when you raise the base, you need to extend the ramp. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1107.0s)]
*  We found out, listen to this carefully, that the only way to have a pyramid ramp is to [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1111.0s)]
*  come to the southwest corner of the main pyramid. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1118.0s)]
*  They built the ramp like this. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1123.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1125.0s)]
*  And I excavated and this are photos in my book Giza and the pyramids. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1126.0s)]
*  I excavated from here to here. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1133.0s)]
*  When the Egyptians construct a ramp, when they finished building the pyramid, they demolish [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1136.0s)]
*  the ramp. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1143.0s)]
*  They cannot demolish all of it. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1145.0s)]
*  They have to leave something in the ground. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1147.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1149.0s)]
*  Do you get this? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1150.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1151.0s)]
*  I excavated from here to here. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1152.0s)]
*  I found in situ remains of the ramp. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1154.0s)]
*  Are there photos of this? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1159.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1160.0s)]
*  In my book. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1161.0s)]
*  Okay, let's find the photos of the equipment first. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1162.0s)]
*  I can't find anything. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1166.0s)]
*  I'll show you what I was looking for. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1168.0s)]
*  It's in my book. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1170.0s)]
*  What did you find? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1171.0s)]
*  Well, nothing. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1172.0s)]
*  Nothing? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1173.0s)]
*  How is that not online? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1174.0s)]
*  That doesn't even make any sense. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1175.0s)]
*  It's in my book Giza and the pyramids. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1176.0s)]
*  Maybe look up from this book. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1178.0s)]
*  No, Joe, these are the tombs of the pyramid builders. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1180.0s)]
*  This is the excavation. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1184.0s)]
*  This episode is brought to you by the Farmers Dog. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1186.0s)]
*  Dogs take a lot of care and responsibility, but every minute is worth it. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1188.0s)]
*  They add so much to our lives. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1192.0s)]
*  I would do anything for my dog. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1194.0s)]
*  And I'm sure you would too. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1196.0s)]
*  You probably only want the best for your pets. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1197.0s)]
*  But figuring out what that is could be a real headache. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1199.0s)]
*  There's a lot of misinformation out there, especially around dog food. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1203.0s)]
*  Take kibble, for example. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1206.0s)]
*  Nearly everyone has probably fed their dog kibble at some point. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1207.0s)]
*  But if you do a little digging, you'll find out kibble is an ultra processed food. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1210.0s)]
*  You'll notice that it comes in these bags with buzzwords like premium, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1216.0s)]
*  with pictures of juicy meat and fresh vegetables. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1219.0s)]
*  But inside, it's dried pellets. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1222.0s)]
*  And the vague serving suggestions make it really hard to get the portions right. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1225.0s)]
*  And luckily, there's a simpler, better option. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1230.0s)]
*  The Farmers Dog is healthy food from people who care about what goes into your dog's body. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1233.0s)]
*  They make dog food that's actually real food. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1239.0s)]
*  It's meat and vegetables lightly cooked, and it's developed by board-certified nutritionists [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1242.0s)]
*  to be complete and balanced and made to the same safety standards as our food. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1247.0s)]
*  Unlike kibble, it's pre-portioned just for your dog's needs. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1252.0s)]
*  That makes it easy to get your dog to the right weight and keep them there, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1257.0s)]
*  which is one of the biggest predictors of a longer, healthier life. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1262.0s)]
*  I mean, it's the same for us too. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1265.0s)]
*  When you eat right, when your body gets all the vitamins and nutrients it needs, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1267.0s)]
*  you just feel better. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1271.0s)]
*  Look, no one, dog or human, should be eating highly processed foods for every meal. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1272.0s)]
*  And it doesn't matter how old your dog is, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1276.0s)]
*  it's always a great time to start investing in their health and happiness. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1279.0s)]

*  Every piece of sand here tells us about the builder of the pyramid. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1313.0s)]
*  But let me continue this. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1317.0s)]
*  I will come to you now. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1319.0s)]
*  Let us, if you go to my book, you'll find out that you, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1322.0s)]
*  I found here that you write and the flint tools. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1326.0s)]
*  Listen, now I will come. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1332.0s)]
*  The stones for building the pyramid came from the plateau. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1335.0s)]
*  The casing came from Torah. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1338.0s)]
*  Now we come to how many years Kufr ruled. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1340.0s)]
*  So there is one big discovery happened a few years ago. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1344.0s)]
*  Are these the tools? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1348.0s)]
*  No, no, this is tools for artists. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1350.0s)]
*  The tools in our book, which is big, do you write tools? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1353.0s)]
*  And big flint tools, big ones. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1359.0s)]
*  And why is this not online? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1363.0s)]
*  We never put them online. It's in my book. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1366.0s)]
*  Right, but wouldn't that be everywhere? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1369.0s)]
*  That's such a huge archaeological discovery. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1371.0s)]
*  It's not. It's because it's everywhere. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1373.0s)]
*  It's not only in the Willkerman only. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1375.0s)]
*  It's in every site. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1377.0s)]
*  You have these tools in many sites. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1379.0s)]
*  Right, but why aren't these tools online? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1381.0s)]
*  That's all I'm asking. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1383.0s)]
*  I ask the people online, but they are in, remains in my book. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1385.0s)]
*  Are they in a museum somewhere? [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1389.0s)]
*  There is some in the Cairo Museum, yes. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1391.0s)]
*  So there should be a photograph of them in the museum. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1394.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1396.0s)]
*  What would Jamie look for? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1398.0s)]
*  But I don't know, I'm just like asking him. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1400.0s)]
*  Now I want to come to what museum would have them? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1402.0s)]
*  Cairo Museum. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1404.0s)]
*  Cairo Museum would have those tools? [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1405.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1407.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1408.0s)]
*  A few years ago, a major discovery happened for the first time. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1409.0s)]
*  It is the first time that we have written evidence about building the pyramid of Khufu. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1415.0s)]
*  When did this happen? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1422.0s)]
*  Three years ago. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1423.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1424.0s)]
*  It's called the Wadi Al-Jarf Papyri. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1425.0s)]
*  Do you want to know what's in this papyri? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1428.0s)]
*  I do. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1431.0s)]
*  This papyri was found in Sinai, in a port that belongs to Khufu. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1432.0s)]
*  And inside this port, there were caves. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1438.0s)]
*  And inside the caves, found remains of boats and this big papyri. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1442.0s)]
*  It's large, huge. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1449.0s)]
*  There it is. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1450.0s)]
*  That's it, exactly. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1451.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1452.0s)]
*  And what does this say? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1453.0s)]
*  Now. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1454.0s)]
*  First of all, how old is that? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1455.0s)]
*  4,600 years ago. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1457.0s)]
*  Isn't that amazing? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1460.0s)]
*  And listen. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1461.0s)]
*  You can find writing in this. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1462.0s)]
*  4,600 years ago. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1464.0s)]
*  So papyrus was made with animal skin, correct? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1465.0s)]
*  No. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1468.0s)]
*  Papyrus was made from papyrus. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1469.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1472.0s)]
*  What is it? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1473.0s)]
*  The papyrus is just like leaves. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1474.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1476.0s)]
*  Now, but listen to the papyri. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1477.0s)]
*  It is a diary of an overseer of the workmen. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1478.0s)]
*  His name is Mirer. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1483.0s)]
*  M-E-R-E-R. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1485.0s)]
*  Okay? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1487.0s)]
*  Mirer is saying, I am sahaj in hieroglyphic, means inspector. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1488.0s)]
*  Under me, working 40 workmen. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1495.0s)]
*  I was hired by Kufu to work in his pyramid. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1500.0s)]
*  This is in hieroglyphic. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1505.0s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1507.0s)]
*  And he said, my big, my immediate boss, his name is Diddy. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1509.0s)]
*  Like P. Diddy? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1516.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1517.0s)]
*  Now. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1518.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1519.0s)]
*  Twenty years ago, in my excavation, west of the Great Pyramid of Kufu, I discovered [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1520.0s)]
*  20 tombs. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1529.0s)]
*  Are these the tombs? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1530.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1531.0s)]
*  No, this is not the tombs. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1532.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1535.0s)]
*  The tombs are really sharp type of big tombs. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1536.0s)]
*  We found some of them. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1541.0s)]
*  What is that, Jamie's looking at? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1543.0s)]
*  What are these? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1545.0s)]
*  These, um... [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1546.0s)]
*  This could be, the tombs in the left is like them. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1547.0s)]
*  In the left here. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1551.0s)]
*  Those tombs? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1553.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1554.0s)]
*  More. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1555.0s)]
*  No, down. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1556.0s)]
*  No. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1557.0s)]
*  Where? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1558.0s)]
*  You know, here there is two, there is more. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1559.0s)]
*  To the left, to the left. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1562.0s)]
*  To the left. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1563.0s)]
*  To the left. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1564.0s)]
*  No! [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1565.0s)]
*  Again. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1566.0s)]
*  What? [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1567.0s)]
*  These two tombs. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1568.0s)]
*  You mean up? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1569.0s)]
*  Down. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1570.0s)]
*  What are you talking? [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1571.0s)]
*  The second one. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1572.0s)]
*  After this one. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1573.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1574.0s)]
*  Up. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1575.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1576.0s)]
*  And this one. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1577.0s)]
*  Oh, those. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1578.0s)]
*  Those. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1579.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1580.0s)]
*  But don't those look exactly like the other photograph we just had? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1581.0s)]
*  Those up there. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1583.08s)]
*  That looks like the heads of these things. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1584.08s)]
*  Well, these ones are small. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1585.08s)]
*  I'm talking about big ones. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1586.52s)]
*  These are tools for making statues and things like, but not cutting the stones. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1588.72s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1594.4s)]
*  So these are the same kind of tools, though, with the same kind of materials. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1595.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1599.0s)]
*  But let me talk about the papyri again. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1600.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1603.0s)]
*  Because this, many people don't know about this. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1604.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1606.0s)]
*  Then Miller said, my boss's name is Diddy. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1607.0s)]
*  Twenty years ago, I excavated west of the Great Pyramid of Khufu. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1610.0s)]
*  I found twenty tombs. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1614.6s)]
*  Beautiful ones. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1616.52s)]
*  I published all of them. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1617.52s)]
*  Except one small tomb I said is not important. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1619.6s)]
*  Three years ago, I found this is the tomb of Diddy. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1622.52s)]
*  The person that was the boss of Miller. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1627.12s)]
*  And I published this tomb. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1630.58s)]
*  You can find this tomb online now. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1631.92s)]
*  It's called Diddy's Tomb by Zahi Hawass, west of the Great Pyramid of Khufu. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1634.72s)]
*  Now listen, Joe, what Miller said. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1640.3600000000001s)]
*  I took my workman. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1645.6000000000001s)]
*  This is in hieroglyphic. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1647.8400000000001s)]
*  We went to Torah to cut the white fine limestone. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1648.8400000000001s)]
*  This sentence means that the pyramid was finished and Miller went to bring the stones for the [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1655.18s)]
*  casing. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1662.9s)]
*  And he said, I'm not alone. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1663.9s)]
*  There is many other gangs are cutting the stones. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1665.8200000000002s)]
*  And Torah is in north and south. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1669.5800000000002s)]
*  And he said, I divided my gangs to three gangs. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1673.18s)]
*  One gang to cut the stones. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1678.14s)]
*  And one gang is smoothing the stones. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1682.02s)]
*  And it's smoothing the stones with the right tools to face the stones for the casing. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1685.06s)]
*  And after that, he said, and the third group moving the stones in wooden slidges to us [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1692.82s)]
*  is on the papyri in the papyri to a cargo boat. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1701.34s)]
*  What happened in the Old Kingdom? [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1706.0s)]
*  We have evidence that the river Nile, the Egyptian cut to the west of this river Nile, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1708.64s)]
*  another Nile to be near the pyramid. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1717.6000000000001s)]
*  From this Nile, they cut a canal. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1721.3600000000001s)]
*  At the end of the canal, there is a harbor in front of every pyramid. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1726.0s)]
*  In my excavation in front of Kufu pyramid, there is a village called Nazl Sassaman. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1731.72s)]
*  In this village, the people were building houses. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1740.08s)]
*  Underneath the houses, we found basalt walls. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1745.2s)]
*  I stopped the construction of the houses and excavated the whole area. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1752.48s)]
*  I found this is the harbor of Kufu. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1756.96s)]
*  And I published this in an article. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1760.1200000000001s)]
*  And I excavated in front of the Sphinx temple. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1763.76s)]
*  And I found the harbor of Kifrin. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1766.8s)]
*  And it's published. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1769.5s)]
*  Now, the reason for the canal and the harbor to bring non-local stones, granite from Aswan, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1770.5s)]
*  alabaster from Middle Egypt, durite from Nubia, basalt from Fayyum, white limestone [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1780.24s)]
*  from Torah. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1792.2s)]
*  The Egyptians had everything. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1794.32s)]
*  So they essentially cut a second canal. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1795.84s)]
*  They cut a canal just so they can move the stones to where they wanted them. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1798.6s)]
*  And I discovered all of this. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1802.44s)]
*  And this is published. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1804.36s)]
*  If you write Zayi Hawais. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1806.04s)]
*  And so this is all the casing stones. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1807.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1809.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1810.6s)]
*  Is it possible that the casing stones were put on later? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1811.6s)]
*  No, after you finished building the pyramid. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1813.4399999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1815.84s)]
*  There is two important things when they finished building the pyramid. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1816.84s)]
*  I discovered in a site called Abusir. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1819.3999999999999s)]
*  I discovered two scenes. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1822.32s)]
*  One scene where Kaman dragging a capstone. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1824.84s)]
*  Above the capstone is a hieroglyphic word called Jaim. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1828.56s)]
*  So where is this? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1832.52s)]
*  Where is this? [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1833.52s)]
*  This is in hieroglyphs? [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1835.28s)]
*  The dragging the capstone? [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1836.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1837.28s)]
*  Can we see this? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1838.28s)]
*  I don't know if it's internet or not. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1839.96s)]
*  What would Jamie look for? [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1841.96s)]
*  Look for Zayi Hawais discovery in Abusir. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1844.2s)]
*  How much do you think was lost during the burning of the Library of Alexandria? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1851.32s)]
*  A lot, of course. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1854.84s)]
*  Everything, right? [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1855.84s)]
*  Everything. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1856.84s)]
*  And this is why what I'm telling you based, I have been excavating in Giza, Joe, for the [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1857.84s)]
*  last 57 years. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1862.8799999999999s)]
*  I know every piece of sand in the site. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1865.32s)]
*  And I want to tell you one thing also. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1868.64s)]
*  I am the only Egyptologist who have an open mind. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1870.72s)]
*  That I always look at what the public say. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1875.1200000000001s)]
*  And I will tell you about this later. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1880.2800000000002s)]
*  I will tell you what I found in the pyramid. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1881.2800000000002s)]
*  But let me finish this story and after that I will come back to tell you how I look at [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1883.88s)]
*  what people say and I try to investigate this. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1890.1200000000001s)]
*  And now, Merer said, I put the stones on a cargo boat. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1895.28s)]
*  And we came in the boat to Giza Plateau. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1901.6399999999999s)]
*  The workmen took the stones up to the pyramid. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1906.0s)]
*  We slept overnight in Giza. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1908.8s)]
*  I got up early in the morning with my workmen, wanted to Torah. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1910.68s)]
*  He made many times talking about that. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1914.42s)]
*  Then he said, I wanted to Sinai to bring cover and turquoise. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1917.52s)]
*  What he said in Sinai, our big boss, his name is Ankaf. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1924.84s)]
*  We know from text that the architect who designed the Great Pyramid, who was Kufu's cousin, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1930.28s)]
*  his name was Hem Euno. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1937.32s)]
*  Then actually, it seems now that Hem Euno died and Ankaf completed the Great Pyramid [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1939.76s)]
*  and built the second pyramid of his son, Kephren. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1946.04s)]
*  Then he said, I'm working in year 27 of Kufu's reign. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1950.6s)]
*  He mentioned that Kufu was alive in year 27. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1956.8799999999999s)]
*  How long do you think he reigned for? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1961.6799999999998s)]
*  28 years. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1963.1599999999999s)]
*  I published an article about, you can find this article. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1964.1599999999999s)]
*  Why was the age 23, 23 years, why was that attributed to them? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1969.6s)]
*  Now, this is a good question. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=1973.84s)]

*  The Egyptologist has a problem when they count the name of the king, because when the ancient [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2063.44s)]
*  Egyptians counted the cattle, they counted the reign of the king. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2068.56s)]
*  Sometimes they count the cattle every year, sometimes they counted the cattle every two [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2073.68s)]
*  years. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2077.88s)]
*  Then we make mistakes. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2078.88s)]
*  But now we have year 27 of Kofi's reign, and we have on the second boat bit that the Japanese [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2080.12s)]
*  are restoring now. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2088.04s)]
*  We know when the king died, his son buried him. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2089.64s)]
*  Then Kofi's son, his name is Jennifer, who did not respect his father, and I will tell [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2093.3399999999997s)]
*  you why. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2099.7999999999997s)]
*  He buried his father in year 28. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2100.7999999999997s)]
*  Then we know now for sure that Kofi ruled for 28 years. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2105.52s)]
*  Miller said something that made me very happy, because 25 years ago I wrote an article to [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2114.52s)]
*  say that Memphis was not the capital of Egypt. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2124.72s)]
*  I said that the king ruled Egypt from the pyramid. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2129.72s)]
*  If the pyramid is in Abrahuash, the king ruled Egypt from Abrahuash. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2135.0s)]
*  If the pyramid is in Giza, Giza, Abu Sayr, Saqqara, then Miller said something many people [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2140.08s)]
*  do not believe me when I wrote this article. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2146.7999999999997s)]
*  But Miller said Kofi lived in his palace at Giza. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2150.48s)]
*  If he lived in a palace at Giza, it means with the royal family, the public, and the [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2158.48s)]
*  government. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2164.48s)]
*  And he said that the area that Kofi lived in it in the pyramid called Ank Kofi in hieroglyphic [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2165.48s)]
*  means the Kofi lives. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2171.96s)]
*  This is the name of the city that Kofi lived in it. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2174.0s)]
*  And Miller said we came to Giza in an area in hieroglyphic called Ra Shay. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2178.36s)]
*  And Ra Shay means literally mouth of the lake. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2185.4s)]
*  This could be the entrance of Giza Plateau. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2190.44s)]
*  But what's really strange, he said it took me almost one day for me and my workmen to [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2193.88s)]
*  up to come to the pyramid. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2201.8s)]
*  Why? [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2204.28s)]
*  Because Giza entrance was busy. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2205.36s)]
*  Every stone coming in has to be counted. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2208.2000000000003s)]
*  Every workman has to sign the first letter of his name. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2211.7200000000003s)]
*  And this is why if you go today to the Port of New York, it will take you five hours to [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2215.48s)]
*  enter because it's busy. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2220.38s)]
*  And this is what happened at Giza Plateau. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2222.28s)]
*  This papyri, in my opinion, is really one of the most important discoveries that tells [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2224.5600000000004s)]
*  us for the first time about building the pyramid. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2230.36s)]
*  And now we come to the reign of Kofu, 28 years, and now the stones of the Great Pyramid. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2233.44s)]
*  I looked everywhere to find out how they counted the stones that people said it's two million [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2240.6800000000003s)]
*  and three hundred thousand blocks. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2251.12s)]
*  I found no evidence. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2253.48s)]
*  It's only when the Arabs came. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2256.36s)]
*  You know, all the theories that the new age people say now, it came from the Arabs. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2258.12s)]
*  When the Arabs came and they entered the pyramid, they said all this nonsense stories about [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2264.4s)]
*  the pyramids. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2269.88s)]
*  Then I never found any place to tell me how they cut the stones. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2271.6800000000003s)]
*  But now we have evidence that the base of the pyramid is 20 feet high of solid rock, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2277.82s)]
*  no stones. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2285.7400000000002s)]
*  In 2010, I brought a team scientist from every field and we recounted the stones based on [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2286.7400000000002s)]
*  the new evidence. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2294.5s)]
*  And we found out that the stones of the pyramid are only normal, more than one million. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2295.94s)]
*  The average height of the limestone is half a ton to two and a half tons. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2303.62s)]
*  So the base of the pyramid is 20 feet high carved into solid stone. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2309.14s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2314.8599999999997s)]
*  And then the other rocks were placed on top of it. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2315.8599999999997s)]
*  No, I want to come to when you told me about this capstone, because we did not complete [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2318.62s)]
*  the capstone. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2325.22s)]
*  Let's start off with this, though. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2326.22s)]
*  The base is 20 feet high and then the estimation was 2,300,000, but you think it's far less [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2328.0s)]
*  than that. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2336.0s)]
*  Because of the new discovery that we found that the base is made of the solid rock. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2337.0s)]
*  So before they thought the base was individual stones? [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2343.82s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2346.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2347.92s)]
*  So now that you know that the base is solid rock, that removes 1,300,000 stones that were [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2348.92s)]
*  necessary. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2352.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2353.76s)]
*  Got it. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2354.76s)]
*  So the pyramid is known, they were going to put a pyramid on top of it. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2356.5200000000004s)]
*  And what about the subterranean chambers? [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2358.76s)]
*  Every king in Egypt is buried underneath the pyramid. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2362.8s)]
*  Everything except Khufu and his father Sinephram. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2366.32s)]
*  The only two kings, they are not buried underneath is Khufu and his father. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2371.1800000000003s)]
*  If you look at the one chamber underneath, it was cut and built. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2376.6600000000003s)]
*  If you go down, it's left unfinished. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2383.58s)]
*  Left unfinished in what way? [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2388.2799999999997s)]
*  It was planned to cut it, but they did not complete it. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2390.06s)]
*  You can see when you go down that the barrier chamber is not finished. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2394.44s)]
*  Why? [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2399.38s)]
*  Why? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2400.38s)]
*  Because I found out in our research, every king is Horus on earth. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2401.38s)]
*  When the king died, he became the sun god. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2407.7999999999997s)]
*  Okay? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2411.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2412.5s)]
*  In year five, he said, I am the sun god. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2414.42s)]
*  And he abandoned the construction of the first barrier chamber, and he built his chamber [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2420.7s)]
*  within the pyramid because he's a god. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2428.58s)]
*  And that's the queen's chamber, correct? [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2431.18s)]
*  No. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2432.78s)]
*  The first one. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2433.78s)]
*  I'm going to come to this chamber later. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2434.78s)]
*  And the second evidence that he called his pyramid, Akhid Khufu, means the horizon of [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2438.38s)]
*  Khufu. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2446.28s)]
*  And the only one in the horizon is the sun god. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2447.34s)]
*  And the third evidence is something that only occurred at Giza, the Sphinx and its symbol. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2451.46s)]
*  I found that the Sphinx represent Kefren, the son of Khufu, giving offering with his [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2462.98s)]
*  two paws to his father, the sun god, Khufu, who rise and sits in this temple, the first [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2470.1s)]
*  sun temple. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2477.7400000000002s)]
*  And this why Khufu's pyramid is unique among the 120 pyramids. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2478.7400000000002s)]
*  And I will tell you what I discovered inside the pyramid now. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2485.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2489.42s)]
*  Before I tell you about what I discovered, I have to complete the scene that I told you [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2490.42s)]
*  that I found workman dragging a capstone. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2500.66s)]
*  You remember you asked me that we stopped with that. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2504.54s)]
*  Above the capstone, there is a hieroglyphic word called Jaim. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2507.82s)]
*  And Jaim means white and yellow gold. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2512.3s)]
*  A second scene I found ladies dancing, and they call them the khener. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2516.78s)]
*  And the khener are the dance troupe of the king. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2524.26s)]
*  My interpretation of these two scenes, when the pyramid was finished, the king asked the [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2527.46s)]
*  workman to put the capstone in the top of the pyramid. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2534.7400000000002s)]
*  When they put the capstone in the top of the pyramid, caged with gold, the whole country [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2537.7400000000002s)]
*  dance and sing because the king became a god. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2546.34s)]
*  That's what I call the national project of the whole nation. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2551.9s)]
*  The three millions who lived in Egypt in the time of the whole kingdom, all of them participated [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2554.86s)]
*  in building the pyramid to make the king as a god. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2560.18s)]
*  This is your theory. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2564.58s)]
*  Not a theory. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2565.58s)]
*  No, it's it's fact. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2566.58s)]
*  It is a fact. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2569.66s)]
*  The pyramid was the national project. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2570.66s)]
*  Well, that's not what I mean. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2572.66s)]
*  I mean, it's your theory that the capstone was put on and it's not a theory. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2573.94s)]
*  It's based on evidence. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2578.58s)]
*  I found the scenes, the papyri, not the papyri, something else. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2579.86s)]
*  What I'm talking about is blocks, limestone blocks. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2585.62s)]
*  One scene workman dragging a capstone with the word Jaim. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2589.66s)]
*  Is this written in limestone blocks? [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2594.26s)]
*  Is that what you're saying? [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2595.86s)]
*  No, it's show the workman dragging a stone. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2596.86s)]
*  Shows it where? [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2599.94s)]
*  In the stone that they discovered. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2600.94s)]
*  So it's carved into the stone. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2602.88s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2604.6s)]
*  And the word Jaim in hieroglyphic above that. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2605.6s)]
*  Where is that at? [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2608.0s)]
*  It's an Abbasir. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2609.34s)]
*  I found it. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2610.34s)]
*  But are there photographs online? [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2611.34s)]
*  Yes, in my book. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2612.34s)]
*  I don't go online. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2615.34s)]
*  Why do I have to go online? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2616.34s)]
*  I go to my book. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2617.6s)]
*  Oh, no, I understand. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2618.88s)]
*  But for everybody else that doesn't have immediate access to your book. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2619.88s)]
*  Did you find them online? [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2624.28s)]
*  It's called the Abbasir blocks. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2626.9s)]
*  Abbasir. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2628.88s)]
*  A, B, as in boy. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2629.88s)]
*  How do you think they got the stones from the king's chamber 500 miles away and put [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2632.44s)]
*  them 120 feet up in the ceiling? [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2639.12s)]
*  I told you if you come today and see how the workman move 20 tons of granite, you understand. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2643.12s)]
*  Workers today? [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2650.96s)]
*  Yes, today like yesterday. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2651.96s)]
*  The same workman. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2653.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2654.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2655.44s)]
*  But now, Joe. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2656.44s)]
*  We're dealing with a different time, correct? [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2657.44s)]
*  If they're doing it today, they have access to modern machinery, right? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2658.44s)]
*  No, no, it's everything based on the idea of the national project. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2662.56s)]
*  They want to make this for the king. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2667.48s)]
*  I understand the national project. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2668.48s)]
*  Now, now, now. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2669.48s)]
*  What I don't understand is the physics involved in moving 80 ton blocks 500 miles through [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2670.48s)]
*  the mountains. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2676.52s)]
*  If you don't believe on this. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2677.52s)]
*  It's not that I don't believe. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2678.52s)]
*  I just want to know. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2679.52s)]
*  I just want to know. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2680.52s)]
*  Inside this block. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2681.52s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2682.52s)]
*  Inside. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2683.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2684.52s)]
*  It's not that I don't believe. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2685.52s)]
*  I want you to explain to me how you think they did it. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2686.52s)]
*  I explained to you. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2688.92s)]
*  From 500 miles away. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2690.36s)]
*  50 to 80 ton blocks. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2692.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2693.84s)]
*  This comes through the Nile. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2694.84s)]
*  You can bring all the stones. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2695.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2697.52s)]
*  But the quarries are in the mountains, right? [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2698.52s)]
*  No, the quarries. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2699.52s)]
*  The granite quarries in Aswan. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2700.52s)]
*  And we have cutting of the obelisks and cutting of the stones and cutting of everything in [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2702.52s)]
*  the site. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2706.92s)]
*  And they brought in when the flood comes in July, they bring boats through the flood. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2707.92s)]
*  They bring us all the stones to give them a plateau. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2713.16s)]
*  They plan things for the floods and then they would figure out some sort of a raft system [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2715.6800000000003s)]
*  to get them on and then move them that way. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2720.2s)]
*  Now if we now do not believe that this cannot be moved by human being. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2723.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2733.56s)]
*  But on the other side, what I can tell you inside above these blocks written the names [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2734.8199999999997s)]
*  of the gangs who built the pyramid above the King Chamber. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2742.4399999999996s)]
*  One of the names, Friends of Khufu. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2747.04s)]
*  I did a 3D a few months ago and we recorded in the five chambers that has this huge blocks. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2749.04s)]
*  We found two more names of the gangs. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2757.4s)]
*  One name called Those Who Are Connected with the Goodest Wadjit. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2760.32s)]
*  And written year 13 of Khufu's reign on the third chamber. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2765.6s)]
*  I took Mr. Beast with me two months ago. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2770.92s)]
*  I took him and I showed him how these blocks they were written by the workmen before they [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2774.12s)]
*  move these stones. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2781.16s)]
*  And in the fourth room, we have the good gut. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2783.56s)]
*  Another name was year 13 of Khufu's reign. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2788.24s)]
*  This is when they move the stones. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2792.44s)]
*  So I understand what you're saying. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2793.92s)]
*  So you're saying that they took these stones, they waited for the flood season, they got [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2794.92s)]
*  these stones on rafts, they moved them down the river, they got them to the site. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2799.3199999999997s)]
*  How did they get them 120 feet in the air? [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2803.3199999999997s)]
*  You know, again, this is the most important thing. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2806.3199999999997s)]
*  This is the national project. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2810.8799999999997s)]
*  Oh, I understand. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2811.8799999999997s)]
*  It was very valuable to them. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2812.8799999999997s)]
*  I just wondered what technology was used. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2813.8799999999997s)]
*  No technology. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2816.72s)]
*  Well, technology is tools. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2817.72s)]
*  Technology is levers. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2819.2s)]
*  Okay, the technology that whatever they had at the time was their current technology. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2820.52s)]
*  The huge wooden sludges. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2824.9199999999996s)]
*  Huge wooden sludge. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2828.02s)]
*  This is the only way that today we move huge stones. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2829.02s)]
*  This is how my workmen moved 20 tons of sarcophagus in a tomb. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2833.98s)]
*  How far did they move it? [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2840.1s)]
*  They moved it just a few feet away. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2842.9s)]
*  But we have scenes of how workmen move 60 tons of statues. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2845.34s)]
*  How they move with the sludges. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2853.3s)]
*  And they draw it. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2856.06s)]
*  Yeah, I've seen those scenes. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2857.06s)]
*  Yeah, then we have all these types of scenes that the Egyptians show that, again, this [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2858.1s)]
*  is the national project. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2862.94s)]
*  Do you think they wet the ground? [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2864.42s)]
*  Like what did you think that they did something like that to make the ground more slick so [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2866.62s)]
*  they can pull it? [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2869.94s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2870.94s)]
*  And then do they are they using sleds? [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2871.94s)]
*  Like how do they sludge it? [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2875.5s)]
*  Sludges, wooden sludges. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2876.98s)]
*  And then they just slowly but surely pulled it into position. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2879.2599999999998s)]
*  We have this in the tombs, this wooden sludges. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2883.02s)]
*  But let me take you now to what I began to reveal the secret of Kufu pyramid. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2886.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2894.66s)]
*  As I told you again, I always listen to what people say and I try to prove them if they [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2896.66s)]
*  are right or not. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2903.46s)]
*  I was interested in the Great Pyramid most of my life because I was an inspector of the [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2905.2200000000003s)]
*  pyramid, director of I spent most of my life there. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2912.02s)]
*  Then I closed this pyramid for a year to stop humidity. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2916.26s)]
*  To stop humidity? [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2921.9s)]
*  Because every person. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2923.78s)]
*  All the breathing? [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2924.9s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2925.9s)]
*  And then inside the pyramid gives about 20 gram of water and this water becomes salt. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2926.9s)]
*  Then mechanically I removed the salt. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2932.6600000000003s)]
*  You had to clean the walls. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2935.78s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2938.0200000000004s)]
*  And after that, I thought, how can I make a ventilation system of the pyramid? [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2939.0200000000004s)]
*  Between the king chamber and the queen chamber, you have this tunnel. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2945.82s)]
*  20 by 20 centimeter only. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2953.5800000000004s)]
*  Small tunnel. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2958.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2959.06s)]
*  Then I thought I should clean these tunnels. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2960.06s)]
*  Then I can make a ventilation system. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2963.98s)]
*  I had no idea of what I'm going to find out. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2965.5800000000004s)]
*  What'd you find out? [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2968.7000000000003s)]
*  I hired a German robot and we took the German robot to the king chamber. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2971.22s)]
*  We are sitting in the king chamber with a TV screen and the robot entered in the shaft. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2979.8199999999997s)]
*  We found out that the interior of the pyramid, the stones were interplaced. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2988.22s)]
*  And this is why when the Arabs came to Egypt and they said man first time and time first [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=2997.54s)]
*  pyramids. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3003.06s)]
*  Then we found out that this shaft went outside. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3004.74s)]
*  Then we put a fan here and the fan suck the air and push it in the tunnel and we made [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3009.3s)]
*  a ventilation system in the pyramid. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3016.46s)]
*  So discovery of these stones, what was unusual about the way they were placed? [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3021.5s)]
*  What? [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3026.78s)]
*  You said they interlocked? [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3027.78s)]
*  Interblocked. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3028.78s)]
*  Interblocked? [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3029.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3030.78s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3031.78s)]
*  Like fingers. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3034.78s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3035.78s)]
*  So there's like different levels and they all slid in together? [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3036.78s)]
*  They how they put the stones with each other. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3040.26s)]
*  But now the most important that I took the robot to the second chamber. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3044.58s)]
*  Now we know that the tunnel in the first timber are open outside. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3049.42s)]
*  Open outside. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3054.34s)]
*  But I think why we have these tunnels in the second chamber. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3055.34s)]
*  They call it wrong in the queen chamber. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3058.86s)]
*  Then we took the robot to the northern tunnel of the queen chamber. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3061.46s)]
*  After 60 feet the robot stopped because the tunnel was bending to the left and the German [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3068.3s)]
*  robot could not bend. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3077.66s)]
*  Then we took the robot to the south tunnel. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3079.54s)]
*  The robot went for 200 feet, stopped in front of a door with two cover handles. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3083.18s)]
*  That was the first discovery. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3093.14s)]
*  Now I began to think how can I find out what's behind this door? [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3095.54s)]
*  In 2002, I was chosen by the National Geographic as explorer in residence. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3104.38s)]
*  Where nine explorers with them with us was Bill Billard who found Titanic. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3113.9s)]
*  Each explorer had a dream. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3121.78s)]
*  I told them I need you to design a robot for me. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3123.3s)]
*  I want to find out what's behind this door. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3127.06s)]
*  And they did make a robot and they called it pyramid rover. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3130.54s)]
*  We took the pyramid rover and the robot went in the south tunnel and the robot had a drilling [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3137.86s)]
*  on his hand. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3145.14s)]
*  The robot opened one hole, one centimeter and one millimeter and sent an optic camera [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3147.38s)]
*  through this hole. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3157.2599999999998s)]
*  We found after 21 centimeter of this door a second one and the second one has an egg [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3159.1s)]
*  shaped like that. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3168.02s)]
*  As if it's hiding something. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3171.66s)]
*  Then after that we went to the northern tunnel that was bending. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3173.7799999999997s)]
*  We found out it's bending north and south for 24 feet. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3178.7799999999997s)]
*  And the reason for the bending was to avoid the grand gallery. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3184.62s)]
*  At 200 feet the robot stopped in front of a third door with two cover handles in the [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3188.9s)]
*  same distance of this one. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3196.46s)]
*  And these doors are very small, right? [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3199.38s)]
*  Very small, 20 by 20 centimeter. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3201.2200000000003s)]
*  Now I spent most of my life from 2002 until 2024 last year. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3203.58s)]
*  I found a team from England and we worked it last year for three seasons. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3220.18s)]
*  I found out above the King's Chamber a big void. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3229.54s)]
*  The grand, I'm sorry, above the grand gallery. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3239.38s)]
*  This void the size of two trucks. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3244.18s)]
*  The second void behind the northern tunnel, another small void. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3251.1s)]
*  Inside this void we can see hieroglyphic inscriptions. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3259.14s)]
*  So those are the only hieroglyphics on the Great Pyramid, right? [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3265.06s)]
*  And I can show you the footage in my, if you can come to my lecture in Houston. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3268.1s)]
*  What about right here, right now? [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3274.9s)]
*  I can send it to you. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3277.18s)]
*  Where do you have it? [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3279.22s)]
*  Do you have it on you? [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3280.58s)]
*  In my computer. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3281.58s)]
*  Where's your computer? [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3282.58s)]
*  In Las Vegas. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3283.58s)]
*  Oh, well, fuck. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3284.58s)]
*  But I can send it to you. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3285.58s)]
*  Yeah, but I want to show it on the show. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3288.1s)]
*  Show it in the show. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3290.66s)]
*  I can send it to you tomorrow. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3291.66s)]
*  Okay, you can send it tomorrow? [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3292.66s)]
*  Yes. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3294.22s)]
*  Okay, we'll splice it in, folks. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3295.22s)]
*  Then tomorrow I will send it to you. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3296.4599999999996s)]
*  Please do. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3298.7799999999997s)]
*  Okay, I'll give you my email. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3299.7799999999997s)]
*  Now. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3300.7799999999997s)]
*  I'll give you Jamie's email. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3301.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, give me, but you should come and, can you come and introduce me here in Houston? [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3302.7799999999997s)]
*  Excuse me? [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3307.54s)]
*  Can I introduce you in Houston? [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3308.54s)]
*  No, I cannot. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3309.54s)]
*  Why? [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3310.54s)]
*  Because I'm very busy. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3311.54s)]
*  Okay, fine. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3312.54s)]
*  If I had known in advance, I could. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3313.54s)]
*  Oh, fine. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3314.54s)]
*  Fine. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3315.54s)]
*  I, unfortunately, I don't have any free time, Zahe. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3316.54s)]
*  Zahe. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3319.54s)]
*  Zahe. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3320.54s)]
*  Zahe. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3321.54s)]
*  Not Zahe. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3322.54s)]
*  Zahe. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3323.54s)]
*  Then now. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3324.54s)]
*  Mr. Hawass. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3325.54s)]
*  Then now, what we are going to do? [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3326.54s)]
*  So this is the only pyramid, can I ask you, though? [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3327.54s)]
*  This hieroglyphics inside this chamber that you've discovered, these are the only hieroglyphics [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3330.7s)]
*  in the Great Pyramid, is that correct? [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3336.02s)]
*  No, there is in the five chambers, I told you. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3337.34s)]
*  Oh, in the other chambers? [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3339.58s)]
*  I told you in the five chambers, now we have five names of the gangies who built the pyramids. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3340.58s)]
*  And we have years. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3345.54s)]
*  These are all recent discoveries? [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3346.54s)]
*  Yes. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3347.54s)]
*  Within how long? [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3348.54s)]
*  How recent? [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3349.54s)]
*  The, this, Voigt, as last year, 2024. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3350.54s)]
*  The hieroglyphic discovery or three months ago. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3357.1400000000003s)]
*  So all this is very, isn't that fascinating that you've been studying the pyramids for [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3360.98s)]
*  so long and you're still finding things? [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3364.34s)]
*  Listen to me, what I'm going to do. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3366.14s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3367.9s)]
*  You know, there is a friend of mine, his name is Leslie Greif. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3368.9s)]
*  Leslie is from Hollywood. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3374.2999999999997s)]
*  He did with me many live TV shows and he did with me Chasing Mommies. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3376.74s)]
*  And Leslie now is working to find a network to come. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3382.22s)]
*  We need to do this program live. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3388.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3390.54s)]
*  I want to show the whole world what I discovered inside the pyramid that we are not hiding [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3391.54s)]
*  anything. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3397.5s)]
*  I want to show them the hieroglyphic. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3398.5s)]
*  Why do you always feel like you're in battle with people? [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3400.46s)]
*  Because they attack me. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3403.2599999999998s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3406.2599999999998s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3407.2599999999998s)]
*  They are in the battle with me. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3408.2599999999998s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3409.42s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3410.42s)]
*  But I'm giving you an opportunity to just lay things out. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3411.42s)]
*  You don't have to argue with people that aren't here. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3413.2599999999998s)]
*  I'm not arguing. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3415.74s)]
*  Fuck those people. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3416.74s)]
*  I'm not arguing. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3417.74s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3418.74s)]
*  I'm just telling the people. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3419.74s)]
*  I'm just fascinated by the discovery itself. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3421.54s)]
*  What does it look like? [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3424.2999999999997s)]
*  These hieroglyphs? [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3425.2999999999997s)]
*  I know you can read hieroglyphs. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3426.2999999999997s)]
*  You can read that stuff. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3428.8599999999997s)]
*  Yes, but the signs are not clear. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3429.8599999999997s)]
*  It's not clear? [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3432.06s)]
*  No. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3433.22s)]
*  We need to do more investigation in September. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3434.22s)]
*  Is it a difficulty in seeing inside there? [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3437.3399999999997s)]
*  You know, because when the Egyptians write inside the five chambers, for example, they [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3439.7799999999997s)]
*  don't write hieroglyphic. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3446.62s)]
*  They write accursive hieroglyphic. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3448.3799999999997s)]
*  It's called hieratic. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3450.78s)]
*  And this hieratic, Joe, it's very difficult to read from outside. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3453.5400000000004s)]
*  What does that look like? [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3458.94s)]
*  It's a cursive of the hieroglyphic. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3459.94s)]
*  Let me see what that looks like, Jamie. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3462.3s)]
*  That's fascinating. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3464.5s)]
*  No, this is hieroglyphic. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3465.5s)]
*  This is hieroglyphic. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3466.5s)]
*  That's hieratic. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3467.5s)]
*  We need to talk about hieratic. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3468.5s)]
*  On the right hand side. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3469.5s)]
*  It says hieratic. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3470.5s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3471.5s)]
*  Look at the one on the right. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3472.5s)]
*  This is hieratic. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3473.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3474.5s)]
*  Then it's very difficult. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3475.5s)]
*  That's so beautiful. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3476.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3477.5s)]
*  What a beautiful language. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3478.5s)]
*  It looks like art. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3479.58s)]
*  Then, Joe, what we're going to do before the end of this year, we are going to show what's [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3480.58s)]
*  inside the five, this void's life. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3487.98s)]
*  Can you repeat that up, Jamie? [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3492.46s)]
*  These symbols that look like, like make that larger, please. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3495.22s)]
*  These symbols to the far left that were right below Jamie's cursor, right there. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3499.58s)]
*  Like, what are those supposed to be? [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3503.34s)]
*  They are signs. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3504.78s)]
*  But what does it mean? [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3505.78s)]
*  Look this. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3507.54s)]
*  It looks like a device. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3508.86s)]
*  The one down means for a scribe. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3509.86s)]
*  What is the one that his cursor? [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3516.3s)]
*  This is a stop sign. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3517.98s)]
*  It's for a scribe. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3519.26s)]
*  A scribe. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3520.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3521.78s)]
*  What does it mean? [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3522.78s)]
*  Scribe. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3523.78s)]
*  It means a scribe. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3524.78s)]
*  Sish. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3525.78s)]
*  Okay. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3526.78s)]
*  I understand. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3527.78s)]
*  So and then the other one on the hieratic, that's the cursive version. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3528.78s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3531.7000000000003s)]
*  I'm not that expert in hieratic. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3532.82s)]
*  Okay. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3535.06s)]
*  Because hieratic is very cursive. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3536.06s)]
*  I understand. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3537.54s)]
*  But I think this is showing that, right? [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3538.54s)]
*  I know. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3540.58s)]
*  But we, if you look at the signs in the five chambers that I will send it to you tomorrow, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3541.58s)]
*  it's very difficult to read. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3547.74s)]
*  But you can see they are hieratic, cursive signs. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3549.06s)]
*  But the most important that we are going to show this live. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3553.62s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3556.7s)]
*  Okay. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3557.7s)]
*  So people don't even know and you're going to show all this stuff live. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3558.7s)]
*  We will do it live. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3560.54s)]
*  We have another team called Scan Pyramids team. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3562.78s)]
*  They are scientists from Japan, France, and Egypt. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3567.98s)]
*  I am the scientific director who really, if they discover something, they come to me. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3573.46s)]
*  I have to discuss it with them. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3581.0600000000004s)]
*  And they found, you know, the pyramid. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3584.26s)]
*  You have the entrance that the people use now is the entrance that the Arabs open. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3588.86s)]
*  That's in the north face, correct? [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3594.5s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3596.38s)]
*  Above that is a mini chamber. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3597.38s)]
*  Okay. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3600.42s)]
*  The team are using a very sophisticated techniques like ultrasound, infrared. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3601.42s)]
*  With these techniques, you do not need any more to drill. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3611.46s)]
*  You can really see what's behind the door. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3616.54s)]
*  And this is really what I'm using right now. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3620.06s)]
*  Then they came to me and they said behind the main entrance of the pyramid, there is [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3622.06s)]
*  a corridor. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3628.94s)]
*  And they showed to me this corridor clear in the five techniques that they're using. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3630.9s)]
*  But I don't know why I have to see it. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3640.34s)]
*  Let's go up there. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3642.5s)]
*  We went up there and they sent an optic camera through the stones. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3644.22s)]
*  And they found I could look at the corridor 30 feet long, eight feet wide, topped with [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3654.22s)]
*  chivalry shape. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3664.2599999999998s)]
*  I think you can see that in the internet, the corridor behind the main entrance of the [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3665.54s)]
*  pyramid. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3671.18s)]
*  Can you get it? [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3672.5s)]
*  It's in the internet, I'm sure. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3673.58s)]
*  This void above the Grand Gallery? [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3677.42s)]
*  The size of two trucks. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3680.14s)]
*  What do you think that is? [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3681.5s)]
*  I have no idea. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3682.74s)]
*  I'm just telling you what I found. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3684.7s)]
*  This was a great pyramid. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3689.2999999999997s)]
*  I did more work on the third pyramid with the same techniques and the second pyramid. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3690.2999999999997s)]
*  This is the void. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3695.18s)]
*  Can you see it? [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3696.18s)]
*  Wow, that's incredible. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3697.18s)]
*  And I think and bring the other big void above the Grand Gallery. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3698.94s)]
*  I think you'll see it also. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3702.86s)]
*  So find the void above the Grand Gallery, Jamie. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3705.54s)]
*  So this is two trucks. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3710.7000000000003s)]
*  The size of two trucks. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3713.42s)]
*  Size of two semi trucks. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3714.78s)]
*  And do you have any idea like what the inside? [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3716.78s)]
*  I will tell you about my theory. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3720.6200000000003s)]
*  Please do. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3722.86s)]
*  I think that it's here. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3725.2200000000003s)]
*  That's it. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3726.7000000000003s)]
*  That's the void. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3727.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3728.7000000000003s)]
*  It's in that direction, so it's at a slope. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3730.54s)]
*  It's above the Grand Gallery. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3733.3399999999997s)]
*  That's it. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3734.98s)]
*  That's it. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3735.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3736.98s)]
*  The scanned pyramid project. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3737.98s)]
*  Now, I tell you my theory. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3738.98s)]
*  Please do. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3741.66s)]
*  We have a story written in hieroglyphic, but not at the time of Khufu. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3743.7799999999997s)]
*  It's after Khufu. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3748.62s)]
*  The story, it's written in a papyri. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3750.98s)]
*  It's called Khufu and the Magician. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3753.7s)]
*  It says that Khufu was staying in his palace and he was very upset. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3756.86s)]
*  He was not happy. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3763.78s)]
*  And his son came to him, Your Majesty, why are you unhappy? [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3765.7400000000002s)]
*  He said, I'm searching for the secret of the Gattoth, the God of wisdom. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3770.86s)]
*  Then I can design my barrier chamber in the pyramid. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3776.3s)]
*  Then his son told him, I know a magician. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3781.42s)]
*  His name is Jiddi. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3784.6200000000003s)]
*  He knows how to cut the head of a man off and put it back. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3786.58s)]
*  And he knows the secret of the Gattoth, the God of wisdom. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3792.86s)]
*  He knows how to cut the head of a man off and put it back. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3797.04s)]
*  But is the guy still alive? [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3799.2999999999997s)]
*  Is that what he's saying? [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3800.74s)]
*  No, this is what the son is telling his father. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3801.74s)]
*  I understand that. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3805.46s)]
*  That Jiddi can do that. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3806.46s)]
*  A lot of people can cut a guy's head off. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3807.46s)]
*  But listen to the story. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3808.9s)]
*  This is the story. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3810.9s)]
*  Okay. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3811.9s)]
*  Then the king told his son, bring this to me. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3812.9s)]
*  They describe him as 100 years old and he drink 1000 beers. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3815.9399999999996s)]
*  Jiddi came in front of the king and Khufu told him, I heard that you can cut the head [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3822.9399999999996s)]
*  of a man off. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3829.8199999999997s)]
*  He said, yes, Your Majesty. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3830.8199999999997s)]
*  He said, do it. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3833.3799999999997s)]
*  He said, Jiddi said, I cannot do it to the human being. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3835.58s)]
*  He said, okay, I will bring you a prisoner. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3839.58s)]
*  Jiddi said, a prisoner is a human being. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3843.14s)]
*  Then he told, he brought him a goose. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3847.22s)]
*  He took the head of the goose up in front of everyone and the head came back and the [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3850.98s)]
*  goose was running in front of everyone. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3856.5s)]
*  That's written in the story. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3859.86s)]
*  Then I come back to what's believed that now. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3861.54s)]
*  Okay. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3867.02s)]
*  Then the king told him, I want to know the secret of the god Tuth to design my burial [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3868.3s)]
*  chamber. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3873.1800000000003s)]
*  He told him that this secret will not be in your hand. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3874.38s)]
*  It will be in the hand of another people who rule Egypt. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3881.34s)]
*  Khufu was very upset. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3885.26s)]
*  So he wouldn't give him the secret because that secret won't just be in your hands. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3887.34s)]
*  It'll get into other people's hands. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3891.2200000000003s)]
*  Then the king was unhappy. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3893.1000000000004s)]
*  He told him, don't worry, your majesty, because you will rule and your sons and your grandson. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3895.74s)]
*  Now about magic. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3904.4599999999996s)]
*  Do you believe in religion or not? [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3908.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3909.9799999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3910.9799999999996s)]
*  Do you know about Judaism? [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3911.9799999999996s)]
*  Sure. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3913.2599999999998s)]
*  When God told Moses, when Moses met God and God told him to go to Egypt to meet the Pharaoh [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3914.2599999999998s)]
*  him. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3922.2599999999998s)]
*  Remember, the pharaohs are highly in magic. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3923.2599999999998s)]
*  They will beat you. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3927.62s)]
*  Then God taught Moses how to be more in magic than the Pharaoh. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3929.22s)]
*  And you remember when he heard the stick and the stick became a snake, I think, and the [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3934.62s)]
*  and Moses brought more snakes to to swollen what the Pharaoh did. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3941.18s)]
*  Then we know from books, from Judaism, from the beginning, that the ancient Egyptian were [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3946.8599999999997s)]
*  really highly in magic, then we can believe. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3951.34s)]
*  Do you think that that magic might have had something to do with how they constructed [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3954.26s)]
*  the pyramids? [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3957.46s)]
*  No. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3958.46s)]
*  No. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3959.46s)]
*  You don't. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3960.46s)]
*  But but if you believe that they had enough magic to take a goose's head and put it back [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3961.46s)]
*  on and still alive, that's magic. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3966.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3968.3s)]
*  Wouldn't they use that magic for other things? [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3969.3s)]
*  But we have you believe in magic. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3971.42s)]
*  I do. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3973.46s)]
*  Of course you do. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3974.46s)]
*  You do believe in magic. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3975.46s)]
*  So you believe that someone could take someone's head off, put it back on. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3976.46s)]
*  It's written. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3978.78s)]
*  Okay, then it must be true. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3979.78s)]
*  All right. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3981.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3982.2200000000003s)]
*  What is this? [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3983.2200000000003s)]
*  Someone's going to kill a dove? [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3984.2200000000003s)]
*  It's a magic trick. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3985.2200000000003s)]
*  It can decapitate birds and stuff. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3986.2200000000003s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3989.2200000000003s)]
*  Put it back together. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3990.2200000000003s)]
*  I was just reading it. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3991.2200000000003s)]
*  Apparently in the trick that he did it, he put the head on the other side of the room [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3992.2200000000003s)]
*  and made him come back together. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3997.2200000000003s)]
*  He did it to a calf and a different animal. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=3998.2200000000003s)]
*  So now what really I want to tell you now. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4001.2200000000003s)]
*  That person's magic too. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4003.5400000000004s)]
*  Maybe that person can make a pyramid. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4004.5400000000004s)]

*  And do you think a lot of this information is what was lost in the burning of the Library [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4027.98s)]
*  of Alexandria? [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4031.54s)]

*  temples and things like that, because what happened? [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4045.54s)]
*  The ancient Egyptian believe that a pharaoh should be a male. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4050.1800000000003s)]
*  A pharaoh cannot be a female. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4055.9s)]

*  When she became a pharaoh, they hated her and they destroyed her monuments. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4064.8199999999997s)]
*  Kufu, when he changed his cult to be a sun god in the first intermediate period, they [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4070.9s)]
*  destroyed his monuments, the temples, the statues, the only statute of that king was [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4077.98s)]
*  found in upper Egypt, not at Giza. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4084.58s)]

*  Now, do you have any question about Kufu pyramid before I switch to the things? [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4099.86s)]
*  Well, I'm fascinated by a lot of aspects of Kufu's pyramid. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4107.7s)]
*  Well, one of the big ones that's come up very recently that I'm sure you're aware of is [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4112.26s)]
*  these satellite radar, what is it called? [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4119.22s)]
*  Tomography? [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4124.54s)]
*  Where they think that there's these pillars underneath the structure. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4125.54s)]
*  OK, I investigated this. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4129.46s)]
*  First of all, these two scholars from Italy, they have never been in Egypt. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4133.9s)]
*  They have never worked in the pyramids before. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4141.38s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4144.46s)]
*  They're using satellite information. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4145.46s)]
*  Number two, they published their article in a journal. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4147.66s)]
*  This journal do not send their article to the freeze. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4152.9s)]
*  You pay a fee to publish the article in your responsibility. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4158.26s)]
*  OK, number three, I am not a scientist. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4162.94s)]
*  I took this techniques that they used and I give it to expertise. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4168.98s)]
*  And they said this techniques cannot show underneath a solid rock of almost 600 feet [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4176.02s)]
*  down. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4186.900000000001s)]
*  No way. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4187.900000000001s)]
*  Why can't they? [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4189.900000000001s)]
*  They said this degrees cannot show that. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4191.5s)]
*  But these scientists are saying they can. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4193.42s)]
*  Do you know about the Osiris shaft, how they've got a I discovered it. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4194.900000000001s)]
*  You did right. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4199.9400000000005s)]
*  Yes, you know that they use this tomographic. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4200.9400000000005s)]
*  No, no, I am the one who founded. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4203.42s)]
*  I understand you found it, but they also discovered it. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4206.86s)]
*  They showed that it exists using the same technique. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4210.259999999999s)]
*  No, no, this is wrong. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4213.339999999999s)]
*  This is not true at all. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4216.74s)]
*  I can tell you how I found that. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4219.339999999999s)]
*  How can I find that? [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4221.419999999999s)]
*  I'm not saying that you didn't find it. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4222.419999999999s)]
*  It's under the paper Signature Aperture Radar Doppler Tomography by Filippo Bondi. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4224.339999999999s)]
*  If you scroll down, Jamie, you'll see an image. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4231.5s)]
*  And this image is of the Osiris shaft, which shows that they got an accurate depiction [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4235.14s)]
*  of that from space. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4242.22s)]
*  That's not true. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4244.34s)]
*  It's not true. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4245.34s)]
*  So what are you saying that they're lying? [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4246.34s)]
*  They're lying. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4247.34s)]
*  They're completely lying. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4248.34s)]
*  But if they're showing using these techniques, things that we know that you discovered that [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4249.62s)]
*  absolutely exist. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4254.02s)]
*  Now, they this techniques, as I told you, scientists said that these techniques cannot [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4255.02s)]
*  show 600 feet under the pyramid. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4263.06s)]
*  The Osiris shaft that they found was only 50 feet. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4266.14s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4270.540000000001s)]
*  But it's showing at least for 50 feet that this is accurate. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4271.540000000001s)]
*  What makes you believe those scientists rather than these guys from Italy? [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4274.780000000001s)]
*  Because these scientists are scientists. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4278.620000000001s)]
*  These are scientists as well. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4281.700000000001s)]
*  They are not showing their techniques carefully. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4283.38s)]
*  They have not. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4286.66s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4287.66s)]
*  They're not showing their techniques carefully. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4288.66s)]
*  Take the techniques that they said and show it to any scientist. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4289.66s)]
*  No one, no one can tell you this is accurate. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4293.66s)]
*  I ask it every person who knows about radar, ultrasound, all the people work with me. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4299.38s)]
*  The Scan Pyramid Project, they said this is bullshit. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4307.46s)]
*  It cannot happen at all. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4311.86s)]
*  Now, tell me. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4313.86s)]
*  So you're telling me that these scientists that are proclaiming the capabilities of these [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4315.86s)]
*  satellite tomography devices that are saying that they can see kilometers into the ground [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4321.62s)]
*  with this stuff? [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4328.179999999999s)]
*  That's not true. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4329.179999999999s)]
*  Are you sure? [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4330.179999999999s)]
*  Do you understand the technology? [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4331.179999999999s)]
*  No, not me. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4332.98s)]
*  But I asked scientists who are in this field. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4333.98s)]
*  Did you talk to these scientists that are saying that they have these discoveries? [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4339.26s)]
*  I sent, I made a press release. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4342.26s)]
*  But did you talk to them? [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4346.26s)]
*  I did not. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4348.26s)]
*  Why not? [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4349.26s)]
*  Because they did not talk to me. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4350.26s)]
*  How can I find them? [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4351.26s)]
*  Would you be willing to talk to them? [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4352.26s)]
*  Of course I am. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4354.26s)]
*  Yes, do. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4355.26s)]
*  I'll connect you to them. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4356.26s)]
*  I'm just interested if new technology becomes available and they figure out a way to look [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4357.26s)]
*  into the ground and you discover things, especially if they discover the OSIRIS shaft and it turns [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4361.42s)]
*  to actually be accurate. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4365.580000000001s)]
*  They did not discover the OSIRIS shaft again. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4366.580000000001s)]
*  You discovered it, but they use their technology to show an accurate depiction of the interior [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4368.58s)]
*  of the OSIRIS shaft. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4375.26s)]
*  Is that true? [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4376.26s)]
*  No, it's not. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4377.26s)]
*  The OSIRIS shaft is known to everyone. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4378.26s)]
*  Right. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4381.26s)]
*  It can be seen by everyone. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4382.26s)]
*  But when they turn their equipment on the OSIRIS shaft, it shows the actual interior. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4383.26s)]
*  Maybe I don't know, but this is 50 feet. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4393.82s)]
*  Let's look at it again. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4395.62s)]
*  But that took almost 600 feet. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4396.62s)]
*  I understand. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4398.06s)]
*  But if it can go 50 feet, why can't it go 600 feet? [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4399.22s)]
*  Again, I'm not a scientist. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4402.740000000001s)]
*  So why are you just missing it though? [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4405.780000000001s)]
*  I gave what they published to a scientist and they said this is not true. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4407.1s)]
*  But scientists are wrong all the time, particularly ones that are biased. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4413.620000000001s)]
*  What I did, I made a press release explaining my point. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4419.06s)]
*  And I said my work of the second pyramid, that the base of the pyramid is 28 feet of [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4425.14s)]
*  solid rock. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4434.22s)]
*  Right. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4435.22s)]
*  And there is no way that anything can be happened in the solid rock. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4436.22s)]
*  And I explained, I think what they're saying is it's underneath the solid rock. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4439.700000000001s)]
*  Correct. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4444.02s)]
*  Let me finish. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4445.02s)]
*  And I said your techniques that you published in this magazine is not to be freed by scientists. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4446.02s)]
*  You just published it. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4454.34s)]
*  And number three, the team that working in Giza with all these new techniques, they said [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4455.9400000000005s)]
*  this is wrong. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4464.1s)]
*  And they know. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4466.42s)]
*  The team that's working in Giza with all these techniques, what do you mean? [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4467.42s)]
*  We have the ScanPyramid team. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4471.82s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4474.14s)]
*  They're working. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4475.14s)]
*  But you understand this is different technology. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4476.14s)]
*  I understand, but they know about this technology. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4477.54s)]
*  But have they used this technology? [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4481.12s)]
*  They said this technology cannot work, cannot show 600 feet under the pyramid at all. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4483.26s)]
*  This is what they said. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4490.06s)]
*  And this is why if the Italians were confident, they could contact me. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4491.740000000001s)]
*  And I'm the pyramid expert that anyone should. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4497.820000000001s)]
*  Well, we'll make sure that happens. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4501.38s)]
*  But listen, if the stone is 20 feet thick, the solid stone at the base, that's correct, [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4503.02s)]
*  right? [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4509.38s)]
*  And you said Osiris Shaft is 50 feet. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4510.38s)]
*  That means it can see past 20 feet, right? [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4512.98s)]
*  But how can I see through the stone and see what they're showing? [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4516.259999999999s)]
*  But the Osiris Shaft is open, right? [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4520.139999999999s)]
*  It's not covered to see. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4525.54s)]
*  You can go and you see the Osiris Shaft down. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4528.54s)]
*  Everyone can see it. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4532.0199999999995s)]
*  But the interior is not open and the interior is visible. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4533.0199999999995s)]
*  You can't see it to the exact dimensions the way these tomographic images show, right? [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4538.14s)]
*  If they're using this technology to go 50 feet under the ground to get an accurate depiction [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4544.780000000001s)]
*  of the Osiris Shaft. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4548.42s)]
*  I am not a scientist. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4549.42s)]
*  I understand, but this is my question. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4551.14s)]
*  Why would you dismiss it if you haven't looked under there? [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4555.14s)]
*  Because I told you, it is not me who can dismiss this. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4558.700000000001s)]
*  What does it say, Jimmy? [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4563.5s)]
*  This is the link to the original article, I believe. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4564.5s)]
*  The very first sentence says that due to the poor penetrating action of electromagnetic [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4568.66s)]
*  waves inside solid bodies, the capability to observe these distributed targets is precluded. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4573.46s)]
*  And then they had to come up with an experimental, says experimental results are estimated by [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4578.299999999999s)]
*  processing the SAR images into something else. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4582.7s)]
*  So I think that's the disconnect I'm hearing. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4587.82s)]
*  Yeah, I don't understand the technology. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4591.179999999999s)]
*  But my question is, we know how spectacular the pyramids are. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4593.8s)]
*  We know how spectacular just the base of it, the fact that it's carved into solid rock. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4598.34s)]
*  Why would you not think that maybe other spectacular things exist? [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4603.16s)]
*  I told you I am not this type knows about the science. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4608.04s)]
*  I consulted the team, the top in the world from Japan, France and Egypt. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4615.22s)]
*  Who are these people? [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4623.2s)]
*  They are the scan pyramid team. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4624.2s)]
*  What's okay? [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4625.72s)]
*  The scan pyramid? [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4626.72s)]
*  Yeah, the ones that found the exactly the chamber above. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4627.72s)]
*  And they are working with me. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4630.76s)]
*  And we found many other things in the second pyramid and the third pyramid. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4632.44s)]
*  And we published this. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4636.76s)]
*  We just published an article last week using different than what I am saying. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4637.76s)]
*  If this techniques that these two Italians are correct. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4642.56s)]
*  The only people who really can tell you it's correct or not, are the scan pyramid people, [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4648.62s)]
*  not me. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4656.26s)]
*  But the scan pyramid people aren't they using different technology? [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4657.26s)]
*  But they know about technology. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4659.9s)]
*  They are the top scientists in the world. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4661.94s)]
*  I have to believe them, not that two Italians. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4665.34s)]
*  And if the Italians are really correct, they could come to talk to us, not me. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4669.099999999999s)]
*  Well, to talk to me and others. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4674.5s)]
*  I will definitely try to connect you with those people. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4676.0199999999995s)]
*  Because I know that Graham Hancock and Brian Mararescu have been in contact with those people. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4678.58s)]
*  And they are open minded about it. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4683.58s)]
*  They don't know what's going on down there. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4686.74s)]
*  But these images are repeated over and over and over again. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4688.139999999999s)]
*  Fine. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4691.099999999999s)]
*  But they... [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4692.099999999999s)]
*  Fascinating, either way. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4693.099999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4694.099999999999s)]
*  The whole... [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4695.38s)]
*  One of the fascinating things about Egypt to me is the fact that it's not just so much [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4699.5s)]
*  more advanced in terms of construction than anywhere else in the world. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4707.820000000001s)]
*  But that it's still to this day, like nothing even close has ever been even attempted to [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4712.780000000001s)]
*  this day. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4719.780000000001s)]
*  What do you think was going on back then as far as their capabilities and their understanding [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4721.46s)]
*  that led them to do something so spectacular that other people 4,500 years ago... [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4726.139999999999s)]
*  Again, the belief of the afterlife built Egypt. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4731.0199999999995s)]
*  But they also had to have the understanding of engineering and construction and design. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4736.42s)]
*  To do this belief of the afterlife, to build the pyramid, as I told you, this was the national [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4742.259999999999s)]
*  project of the whole nation. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4748.66s)]
*  I understand it's a national project, but they have to acknowledge, right? [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4750.54s)]
*  You can talk about this pyramid if it exists alone. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4752.26s)]
*  When you come to Egypt and you go through time, you will see that everything gradually, [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4756.22s)]
*  there is no gap that you can... [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4762.5s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4765.22s)]
*  There is no gap for anyone to think something different than the belief of the Egyptians. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4766.22s)]
*  Well, I don't think anybody's saying that. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4772.62s)]
*  Maybe some people are. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4775.78s)]
*  Maybe some people do. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4776.78s)]
*  It's all the Egyptians, obviously. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4777.9s)]
*  It was in Egypt. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4779.42s)]
*  It's the Egyptians that made it. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4781.62s)]
*  It's pretty obvious. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4783.62s)]
*  That just seems obvious. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4784.62s)]
*  If you believe in that, I'm happy to hear this from you. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4786.78s)]
*  I just think whenever people say it's aliens, they're like, where's the proof of that? [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4789.78s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4794.139999999999s)]
*  Also, they built a lot of spectacular things. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4795.139999999999s)]
*  No ifs, ands, or buts. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4798.219999999999s)]
*  Just the statues, just the faces of the pharaohs with incredible symmetry. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4800.58s)]
*  That's why I want to really... [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4804.42s)]
*  I want, since you are interested in Egypt, we would like to invite you to come to Egypt. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4805.74s)]
*  I want to come. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4810.58s)]
*  I just... [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4811.58s)]
*  For me, it's just I'm very busy. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4812.58s)]
*  We are willing to invite you. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4813.58s)]
*  I'm willing to go. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4814.58s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4815.58s)]
*  Okay, tell me when. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4816.58s)]
*  Okay. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4817.58s)]
*  And I will arrange everything for you. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4818.58s)]
*  Okay. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4819.58s)]
*  We'll hook it up. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4820.58s)]
*  But now, I want to come to the Sphinx also. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4821.58s)]
*  Okay. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4822.58s)]
*  Can we talk about the Sphinx? [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4823.58s)]
*  Yes, please. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4824.58s)]
*  Now, you know, when I was young, I was met by the Edgar Cayce son. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4825.58s)]
*  The psychic guy. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4832.42s)]
*  He was the son of Edgar Cayce. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4833.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4834.42s)]
*  And here, in case he was the son of Edgar Cayce. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4835.42s)]
*  I was young. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4837.42s)]
*  I really didn't know what this case he had. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4838.42s)]
*  When he came to Egypt and talked about his father, you know about Edgar Cayce. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4842.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4848.42s)]
*  Okay. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4849.42s)]
*  Then... [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4850.42s)]
*  He had a vision that there was a chamber underneath the Sphinx's paw. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4851.42s)]
*  Underneath the right paw of the Sphinx, there is a chamber. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4854.14s)]
*  And he envisioned that, correct? [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4857.82s)]
*  Yes. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4859.74s)]
*  I'm going to Virginia Beach to give a talk. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4861.0599999999995s)]
*  One of the cities in my tour now is Virginia Beach. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4864.74s)]
*  Why? [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4869.5s)]
*  Because when people began to tell me there is something inside the Sphinx, I really, [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4870.5s)]
*  as I told you, I have an open mind. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4879.74s)]
*  And I did search. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4881.9s)]
*  I found inside the Sphinx four tunnels. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4884.38s)]
*  One behind the stele. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4888.62s)]
*  They call it dreamy stele between the two balls of the Sphinx. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4892.14s)]
*  And the second one behind the head in the top. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4895.900000000001s)]
*  There's actually a door in the top of the head now, right? [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4900.34s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4903.18s)]
*  There's a lid. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4904.18s)]
*  Just a tunnel. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4905.18s)]
*  A tunnel. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4906.18s)]
*  Twenty-five feet. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4907.18s)]
*  But isn't it closed off though? [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4908.18s)]
*  No, yeah, it's closed. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4909.18s)]
*  Yeah, there's like a door on the top of it, right? [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4910.18s)]
*  It's not a door. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4911.66s)]
*  No. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4912.66s)]
*  A lid? [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4913.66s)]
*  It's just a tunnel. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4914.66s)]
*  Okay. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4915.66s)]
*  But it's closed off. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4916.66s)]
*  You cannot go up to the Sphinx. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4918.139999999999s)]
*  That's why we have to cover it because it will take rubbish and guards. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4919.9s)]
*  That's the top. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4923.66s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4924.66s)]
*  Isn't that the top of it? [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4925.66s)]
*  Is this the Sphinx? [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4927.22s)]
*  Yes, that's it. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4928.22s)]
*  Okay, that's a lid, right? [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4929.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4930.22s)]
*  We covered it. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4931.22s)]
*  Okay. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4932.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4933.22s)]
*  But we covered it to protect it from the sand. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4934.22s)]
*  I understand. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4936.66s)]
*  But it's not a door. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4937.66s)]
*  Okay. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4938.66s)]
*  It's a lid. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4939.66s)]
*  The third tunnel that I found in the back. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4940.66s)]
*  Now Edgar Cayce, he had this vision that there was some hall of information. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4943.78s)]
*  I know, but I'm going to come to this now. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4949.179999999999s)]
*  But I'm talking to you about the tunnels now. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4951.94s)]
*  And the third one is in the tail. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4955.62s)]
*  The fourth one was opened in 1927 by a French, his name is Monsieur Bérez, and I do have [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4958.0199999999995s)]
*  photos of workmen inside the Sphinx. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4967.54s)]
*  We found these four tunnels are published. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4971.34s)]
*  An article, scientific article, I found in situ in all the four tunnels of pottery in [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4977.06s)]
*  situ to prove that these tunnels were opened on dynasty 25, 500 BC as in the late period [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4986.860000000001s)]
*  When the Egyptians saw the Sphinx, they thought there is something hidden underneath. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=4998.98s)]
*  And they dug and they found nothing. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5004.86s)]
*  Now we come to the Edgar Cayce and what people believe because we had John Antony West and [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5007.9s)]
*  we had many new age people who believe there is something hidden underneath the Sphinx. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5015.3s)]
*  And they used to tell me, we need your permission. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5022.18s)]
*  To what? [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5024.78s)]
*  To drill. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5025.78s)]
*  And I let someone who's not an archaeologist, who's not a scientist, to drill. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5026.9s)]
*  No way. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5033.62s)]
*  But recently, I found out the rise of the water table in front of the Sphinx. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5036.0199999999995s)]
*  And I was really afraid that the water could damage the Sphinx. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5042.219999999999s)]
*  And I brought a team from Cairo University and we did drill 30 to 35 feet underneath [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5048.54s)]
*  the Sphinx everywhere. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5059.18s)]
*  And I do have photos of everywhere under the Sphinx. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5061.82s)]
*  The Sphinx is a solid rock or a living rock and there is nothing underneath. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5066.58s)]
*  So there's no tunnels? [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5071.3s)]
*  No tunnels. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5073.0199999999995s)]
*  This is exactly. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5074.0199999999995s)]
*  OK. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5075.0199999999995s)]
*  I told you what. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5076.0199999999995s)]
*  Tell us about Robert Shock and his theory about the temple and the erosion outside of [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5077.38s)]
*  the Sphinx, that it's water erosion. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5082.860000000001s)]
*  When Shock said that, OK, we brought through the American Research Center a scientist from [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5085.38s)]
*  Louisville University. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5095.620000000001s)]
*  I don't remember his name now. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5098.42s)]
*  And we gave him what Robert Shock. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5101.3s)]
*  You know what Robert Shock said? [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5105.6s)]
*  It's not a theory. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5107.68s)]
*  It's a theory of a new age guy who talked about this before. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5109.240000000001s)]
*  And John Antony West brought. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5113.04s)]
*  I don't remember. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5116.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5117.56s)]
*  Then we gave we gave this guy from Louisville University. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5118.56s)]
*  He was an Indian American who really studied. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5122.56s)]
*  He came to the Sphinx and he worked with us for a season. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5126.200000000001s)]
*  And he came and we published many articles that the erosion that you see outside and [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5130.72s)]
*  inside the Sphinx is from wind and not from water. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5137.6s)]
*  Now what Shock want to say that this is dated back 15,000 years ago. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5144.4800000000005s)]
*  I agree. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5151.8s)]
*  OK. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5152.8s)]
*  If I came here and I dug the Sphinx, I would leave something. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5153.8s)]
*  And what I did, we dug an area northeast of the Sphinx. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5160.12s)]
*  I found level Old Kingdom, Middle Kingdom, New Kingdom, Roman, nothing underneath. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5165.4400000000005s)]
*  Then this new age people say that the head of the Sphinx is very small compared to the [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5173.4s)]
*  body. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5178.36s)]
*  Yes. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5179.36s)]
*  Why? [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5180.36s)]
*  Why? [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5181.36s)]
*  If you take all the casing stones away from the Sphinx, you'll find exactly here. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5182.36s)]
*  The Sphinx. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5189.6s)]
*  And now this and another part like this in between. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5192.4400000000005s)]
*  There is a hollow. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5197.68s)]
*  Remember, I told you that Giza Plateau is divided to three levels. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5198.68s)]
*  Level one and two is very bad. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5206.68s)]
*  Stones can be seen to that shift of the Sphinx. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5208.56s)]
*  Level three, they carved with the head from level three. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5212.52s)]
*  When the Egyptian carved the head to represent the King Kephren with the Cobra, the royal [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5215.92s)]
*  head, they began to make a lion body. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5223.84s)]
*  Then what they did, they filled this hollow between the two Sphinx pieces with stones [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5230.04s)]
*  and they covered the whole body of the Sphinx with stones and they did the modeling of the [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5237.12s)]
*  lion body on the covering stones. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5243.56s)]
*  And this why the head is very small compared to the body. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5246.120000000001s)]
*  So you think the head was made first and then the body was made later. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5249.64s)]
*  If that's the case, why is the body so much more eroded? [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5253.72s)]
*  I told you the body, it is a part of the bad stones. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5257.52s)]
*  Bad stones. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5263.04s)]
*  The top one is the head. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5264.04s)]
*  The stones. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5265.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5266.04s)]
*  So it's a different density to the stones. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5267.04s)]
*  That's why the stone in the Sphinx's head is intact and the body is a softer stone. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5269.28s)]
*  It's level three. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5276.0s)]
*  So it's a different kind of stone. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5277.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5279.5599999999995s)]
*  Of the body. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5280.5599999999995s)]
*  And this why the Egyptian... [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5281.5599999999995s)]
*  Because there's layers to it all and some of the layers are more dense. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5282.5599999999995s)]
*  The Egyptian wanted to make a lion body. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5285.28s)]
*  They couldn't. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5289.04s)]
*  The only way is to cover the body of stones and do the modeling of the lion body on the [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5290.04s)]
*  covering stones. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5295.759999999999s)]
*  Can we take two minutes rest? [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5297.84s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5300.360000000001s)]
*  You want to take a break? [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5301.360000000001s)]
*  Yes, to go to the bathroom. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5302.360000000001s)]
*  Okay, go to the bathroom. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5303.360000000001s)]
*  You know where it is? [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5304.360000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5305.360000000001s)]
*  Just go outside, take a left. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5306.360000000001s)]
*  We're back. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5307.360000000001s)]
*  The Sphinx. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5308.360000000001s)]
*  Let's pick up where we left off. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5309.360000000001s)]
*  So you were saying that these other experts that looked at it didn't agree that it was [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5315.04s)]
*  water erosion and said that they think that it was wind. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5321.4800000000005s)]
*  So what John Anthony West and what Graham Hancock and what Robert Chalk and all these [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5325.4s)]

*  I did. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5622.44s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5649.9s)]

*  Well, before is not a scientist. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5658.78s)]

*  Yeah, I know. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5661.58s)]
*  Those people, Yani, when someone came to you with a theory, he has to have a chiptoolish [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5662.72s)]
*  background. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5669.96s)]
*  He has to write a scientific article. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5671.2s)]
*  We write all what we discover. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5673.8s)]
*  We write articles about them for people to read and criticize and give us opinion. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5676.16s)]
*  But I can go to theories like this. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5682.04s)]
*  I understand that has no base. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5684.68s)]
*  What do you base the dates on? [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5686.16s)]
*  Do you base it on carbon? [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5687.92s)]
*  I said no, we don't. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5689.6s)]
*  We based dating on the evidence that we discover. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5691.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5694.78s)]
*  But like that is based on carbon, right? [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5695.78s)]
*  No, I don't believe in carbon date 14 at all. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5697.74s)]
*  You don't know why carbon date 14 never give an accurate dating. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5700.66s)]
*  And this why I believe, you know, when you discover something, if you discover a symmetry, [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5705.12s)]
*  right, there is two type of datings. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5711.379999999999s)]
*  One called absolute dating means that in this symmetry, you have a name of a king and a [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5714.14s)]
*  date mean this is absolute. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5722.04s)]
*  But if you discover another symmetry and has no dates, then the best thing that we do is [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5725.4400000000005s)]
*  to find the artifacts in this symmetry and try to compare it with other dated symmetry. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5732.360000000001s)]
*  And you give a date for this. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5741.4400000000005s)]
*  But you don't believe in carbon. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5743.04s)]
*  I don't believe in carbon date 14 at all. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5744.04s)]
*  And it's not working in Egypt until today. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5746.44s)]
*  I have been excavating. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5750.12s)]
*  I'm excavating also in the Well of the Kings. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5751.8s)]
*  Right. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5755.04s)]
*  I discovered major important things that we can talk about. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5756.04s)]
*  So if you're going back, but I used I used radar. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5759.76s)]
*  Right in all my excavation. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5764.72s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5766.24s)]
*  I never had a result by radar and carbon date 14. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5767.24s)]
*  We people use it when there is no date. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5772.72s)]
*  But wait a minute. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5775.4400000000005s)]
*  You use radar to date things. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5776.4400000000005s)]
*  How? [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5778.12s)]
*  No, I use radar to discover things. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5779.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5780.6s)]
*  But what do you use to date them? [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5781.6s)]
*  I dated that I told you two methods of dating. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5783.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5786.84s)]
*  Most of the dating that for me now in in Oxford is based on evidence. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5787.84s)]
*  Like I discovered the Golden City. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5793.22s)]
*  It's a major big, large symmetry, large settlement, a city. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5796.96s)]
*  And you know, this city was it shows in the most important discovery in the world of year [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5804.32s)]
*  2021 because this is the first time that we have a big, large city to tell us about the [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5810.52s)]
*  people who made this civilization. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5817.32s)]
*  So how do you know how old the city exactly in the city? [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5819.6s)]
*  We discovered the names everywhere of King Amin Hoteb III, who was the father of Eknaton. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5824.16s)]
*  Inside the city, we found many statutes of his queen, Queen T. We found inscriptions [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5833.2s)]
*  about dried meat stored to celebrate the third set festival of Amin Hoteb III. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5842.48s)]
*  We found nine royal workshops in the city. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5851.4s)]
*  Then the city tells us about the golden age of that king. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5856.4s)]
*  It is dated by pottery, by hieroglyphic inscription, by many things. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5862.24s)]
*  But I'm curious as to why you're skeptical about carbon dating, because I think carbon [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5867.839999999999s)]
*  dating is generally accepted as being accurate within a certain framework. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5873.12s)]
*  But I never used it. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5877.16s)]
*  And many people very rare to use in Egypt because in Egypt mainly we have absolute [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5878.88s)]
*  chronology. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5885.12s)]
*  We have absolute dating based on inscriptions. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5886.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5889.4400000000005s)]
*  But I thought it was used in Egypt like to to measure wood that was in mortar. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5890.4400000000005s)]
*  I didn't date the Great Pyramid to 2500 BC. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5897.68s)]
*  No, that was that was an experiment to date the pyramid. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5900.36s)]
*  I think was about 2009 and it is not it's not working. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5905.76s)]
*  But I didn't see the result. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5911.16s)]
*  You haven't seen a result on carbon testing of the mortar of the Great Pyramid? [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5913.08s)]
*  No, but the mortar you can't. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5917.08s)]
*  One thing the mortar between the stones. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5919.8s)]
*  This mortar like if you take a piece of stone from the pyramid and you try to take carbon [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5925.72s)]
*  14, this piece of stone could be thousand years in the quarry. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5931.92s)]
*  It cannot date the pyramid. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5936.16s)]
*  How can you hold on? [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5937.16s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5938.16s)]
*  You don't date stone. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5939.16s)]
*  I'm saying if you date mortar. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5940.16s)]
*  OK, how can you how can you say accurately that this mortar is dated to the same time [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5942.68s)]
*  of building the pyramid? [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5949.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, you can't actually. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5950.4800000000005s)]
*  That's the argument is that there is probably repairs done. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5951.64s)]
*  Right. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5955.64s)]
*  And so the pyramid. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5956.64s)]
*  Yes. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5957.64s)]
*  There is no there's no evidence of any renovations, no restoration, nothing, never any accurate [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5959.04s)]
*  evidence that the pyramid was restored. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5965.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5969.76s)]
*  But any period of the Egyptian history, there is restoration that goes on even now, though, [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5970.76s)]
*  on the Sphinx. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5974.88s)]
*  Correct. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5975.88s)]
*  I did make 10 years of restoration. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5976.88s)]
*  You know, it's me who did the restoration of the Sphinx for 10 years. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5980.08s)]
*  Why did you decide to do that? [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5984.56s)]
*  The Sphinx when I was when I left, I was studying in the States. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5986.5199999999995s)]
*  I came to take my doctorate from University of Pennsylvania from 1980 from 80 to 87. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=5991.719999999999s)]
*  Some architect and archaeologist were really stupid. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6000.639999999999s)]
*  They began to restore the Sphinx and they took all the casing stones of the Sphinx out [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6005.8s)]
*  and they put modern stones and they used cement. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6012.88s)]
*  You cannot use cement in the restoration. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6018.08s)]
*  You can use cement in building a house. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6021.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's not even restoration. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6024.400000000001s)]
*  This is a new creation. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6025.96s)]
*  When I came, I stopped this restoration. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6027.52s)]
*  OK. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6031.08s)]
*  And few because the this restoration damaged completely the proportions of the Sphinx. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6032.4400000000005s)]
*  It brings to you another Sphinx. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6040.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6042.639999999999s)]
*  Ugly. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6043.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6044.639999999999s)]
*  Few months later, there was a stone was restored in the in the shoulder of the Sphinx and it [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6045.639999999999s)]
*  fell down in February. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6054.8s)]
*  It was raining and always people use the Sphinx for politics. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6057.12s)]
*  The Sphinx? [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6063.639999999999s)]
*  The politics? [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6064.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6065.639999999999s)]
*  I tell you, it happened the first time in the pharaonic period. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6066.68s)]
*  You know, the area beside the Sphinx was called the Valley of Gazelles and the princess of [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6072.04s)]
*  the New Kingdom used to come to hunt wild animals in the valley and come towards the [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6081.12s)]
*  Sphinx. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6087.72s)]
*  And this is story that I'm telling you is written in a granite stele. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6089.200000000001s)]
*  It's called the Dream Stele, located now between the two poles of the Sphinx. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6095.28s)]
*  In the stele, it say that Thutmose IV was a prince and he came to have a have to have [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6101.08s)]
*  a nap beside the Sphinx. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6108.5199999999995s)]
*  And the Sphinx came to him in dream and told him, my son, if you remove the sand away, [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6111.48s)]
*  I will make you the king of Egypt. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6118.2s)]
*  And here he's moved the sand and he came to a temple. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6121.04s)]
*  He found a door. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6127.4s)]
*  What year was this? [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6129.08s)]
*  This is one, three thousand years ago. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6130.4s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6133.8s)]
*  So the Sphinx was constructed long before that. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6134.8s)]
*  And that had been covered in sand. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6138.24s)]
*  Yes, completely. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6140.08s)]
*  This is why Herodotus, the father of the history, when he came to Egypt in the middle of the [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6141.28s)]
*  He never talked about the Sphinx because completely under the sand. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6147.8s)]
*  Then Thutmose IV came. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6152.8s)]
*  He took the sand away and he found that the old geese casing blocks are falling down. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6155.28s)]
*  He put them back and he went to the Sphinx nearby. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6161.92s)]
*  He took this granite stele as a door and he wrote this story in it. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6168.12s)]
*  But we found there is something politics in that story. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6173.28s)]
*  He killed his elder brother who was supposed to be the king of Egypt. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6178.36s)]
*  And he wrote this story to tell the Egyptian that the god Hor Imachit, Horus of the Horizon, [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6183.48s)]
*  it shows me to be the king of Egypt. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6192.88s)]
*  They will forgive the crime that he did. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6194.92s)]
*  On that stone, it fell down in 1988. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6198.68s)]
*  A big fight happened between the head of antiquities and the menace of culture ended by firing [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6203.16s)]
*  the head of antiquities. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6211.12s)]
*  It's politics. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6212.320000000001s)]
*  I stayed 10 years. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6213.320000000001s)]
*  When we were asked to be about the best thing that I did in my life, I say two things. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6218.320000000001s)]
*  Number one, that I restore the Sphinx. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6224.04s)]
*  I brought the proportion of the Sphinx back and I restored the oldest pyramid in Egypt, [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6226.96s)]
*  the steppe pyramid. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6234.64s)]
*  It was falling down. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6236.6s)]
*  In 14 years, I made major important conservation and restoration. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6238.6s)]
*  And I tell people, why do I have to fight all the time about the age of the pyramid? [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6244.0s)]
*  We have to fight. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6249.6s)]
*  We have to cooperate, all of us, to restore these monuments. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6251.28s)]
*  The most important thing for me is always conservation. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6256.56s)]
*  And I dedicate most of my life not only to the excavation, but to conservation. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6260.84s)]
*  What do you think the arguments are that try to push the date back of the construction [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6267.04s)]
*  of the pyramids? [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6274.64s)]
*  I've never heard of this. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6275.64s)]
*  You've never heard of this before? [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6277.72s)]
*  No, it's only new. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6278.72s)]
*  It's a theory from the new age. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6279.72s)]
*  But I saw a debate with you. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6281.64s)]
*  I saw a debate with you and Graham Hancock. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6283.72s)]
*  And there was another archaeologist. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6286.12s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6288.12s)]
*  The other archaeologist was saying, if you're saying that something happened 10,000 years [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6289.320000000001s)]
*  ago, where's the evidence of any civilization from 10,000 years ago? [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6294.240000000001s)]
*  But then you found Gobekli Tepe. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6298.92s)]
*  So Gobekli Tepe was buried over 11,000 years ago. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6300.96s)]
*  That's not true. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6304.08s)]
*  I never heard about this. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6305.08s)]
*  What do you mean it's not true? [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6306.08s)]
*  It's not true what I told you. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6307.08s)]
*  What is not true? [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6308.4400000000005s)]
*  It never happened. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6309.4400000000005s)]
*  We never discovered this at all. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6310.4400000000005s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6312.12s)]
*  Gobekli Tepe is in Turkey. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6313.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, in Turkey. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6314.599999999999s)]
*  Listen. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6315.599999999999s)]
*  Gobekli Tepe is in Turkey. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6316.599999999999s)]
*  I know. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6317.599999999999s)]
*  And it's more than 11,000 years old. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6318.599999999999s)]
*  It's very complex stone structures. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6320.88s)]
*  Fine. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6323.64s)]
*  But this was the evidence. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6324.64s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6325.64s)]
*  This is the evidence in the argument. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6326.64s)]
*  The argument was there was no evidence of an ancient civilization from 10,000 plus years [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6328.32s)]
*  ago. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6332.84s)]
*  This is before the discovery of Gobekli Tepe. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6333.84s)]
*  Gobekli Tepe gets discovered known to be more than 11,000 years ago. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6335.92s)]
*  That changes everything. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6341.0s)]
*  Yes, it does. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6342.88s)]
*  That's changed. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6343.88s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6344.88s)]
*  Because now we know there was an advanced civilization capable of a spectacular construction [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6345.88s)]
*  11,000 plus years ago. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6349.84s)]
*  This is what... [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6351.76s)]
*  Listen. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6352.76s)]
*  Look at the archaeologists in Turkey or in any civilization. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6353.76s)]
*  Okay. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6361.36s)]
*  They never talk about old civilization. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6362.36s)]
*  That's not true. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6366.12s)]
*  Gobekli Tepe is universally accepted as being more than 11,000 years old. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6367.12s)]
*  Joe, I am talking now about Egypt. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6372.04s)]
*  I'm not going to another civilization. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6374.12s)]
*  No, I understand. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6375.12s)]
*  But the argument was that there was never any ancient civilization capable of spectacular [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6376.12s)]
*  construction 10,000 years ago. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6381.36s)]
*  Now that they showed Gobekli Tepe is more than 11,000 years old, they know for sure [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6384.2s)]
*  that's not true. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6388.32s)]
*  Okay. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6389.76s)]
*  But now I'm talking about the pyramids of Egypt. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6390.76s)]
*  I have the evidence, the written. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6394.08s)]
*  We found everything about that. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6397.16s)]
*  We know the dating. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6399.8s)]
*  And I gave you hundreds of evidence that this pyramid built by Kofu are kept from... [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6400.8s)]
*  No, I'm not saying it wasn't. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6406.88s)]
*  I'm not saying it wasn't. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6408.84s)]
*  What I'm saying is... [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6409.84s)]
*  Any civilization older than we know... [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6411.28s)]
*  Older and still in the same spot. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6414.5199999999995s)]
*  How old does it go back? [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6416.44s)]
*  We have no evidence. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6418.24s)]
*  So how does ancient Egypt emerge? [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6419.74s)]
*  Emerge? [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6421.64s)]
*  How does it emerge and go from zero to pyramids? [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6423.4400000000005s)]
*  We have... [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6426.56s)]
*  Can you listen to me? [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6427.56s)]
*  We have prehistoric Egypt. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6430.4800000000005s)]
*  And we have the Old Stone Age, Middle Stone Age, Neolithic, when the Egyptians began to [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6434.320000000001s)]
*  know about agriculture. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6442.240000000001s)]
*  And they began to live together in communities. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6444.42s)]
*  Then after that, we came to the pre-dynastic. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6447.6s)]
*  When a king called Narmer in dynasty zero, he began to make unification of the upper [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6451.4s)]
*  and lower Egypt until one king called Mina or Horah, who united completely. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6459.24s)]
*  And what year was this? [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6468.44s)]
*  This is where it was 3,000 BC, 5,000 years ago. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6469.44s)]
*  In a place called Abydos, they built huge madbariq tombs. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6474.879999999999s)]
*  Huge. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6480.48s)]
*  From madbariq. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6482.28s)]
*  No stones. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6483.28s)]
*  And these tombs are created in a site called Abydos. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6485.12s)]
*  You know, what's really fascinating about this is that 500 years, you think about that, [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6490.759999999999s)]
*  how different just modern civilization was 500 years ago. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6496.259999999999s)]
*  500 years ago, we had almost none of the inventions we have today. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6500.16s)]
*  We had no internal combustion engine, no hardened steel, none of the things that we have. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6503.62s)]
*  And now look what we have with electronics. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6510.08s)]
*  Now imagine what the Egyptians were able to do in 500 years in a different way. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6512.2s)]
*  And construction with stone. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6518.84s)]
*  That their advancements weren't like our advancements, but their advancements were equally spectacular, [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6520.88s)]
*  just in a different way. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6526.28s)]
*  Okay. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6527.84s)]
*  Now I come back to the madbariq structure. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6528.84s)]
*  This is in dynasty one and two. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6532.92s)]
*  From dynasty three came a king called Zoser. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6536.64s)]
*  He had a genius architect. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6541.4800000000005s)]
*  His name is Imhotep. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6543.4400000000005s)]
*  I am searching. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6546.56s)]
*  Did you hear about Imhotep before? [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6547.56s)]
*  Yes. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6549.76s)]
*  Okay. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6550.76s)]
*  I'm searching for his tomb. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6551.76s)]
*  Only two weeks ago, before I came, I made a major important discovery in Egypt. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6552.76s)]
*  I found a tomb of a son of a king inside incredible statues of Zoser and his father and his son [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6558.280000000001s)]
*  and his queens and his children. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6566.6s)]
*  Where's this tomb? [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6568.84s)]
*  In the shadow of the steppe pyramid, in the shadow of Zoser. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6569.84s)]
*  And this really made me because I have been searching for the tomb of Imhotep most of [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6574.4800000000005s)]
*  my life. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6579.92s)]
*  But the area that I found this tomb, it was under houses, modern houses. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6580.92s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6587.4400000000005s)]
*  The workmen who work in the site. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6588.4400000000005s)]
*  One hundred years ago, they built houses in the site. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6591.08s)]
*  But they never excavated what's underneath the houses. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6595.24s)]
*  Wow. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6598.16s)]
*  So modern houses underneath the ancient tomb. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6599.16s)]
*  Six months ago, we gave houses to these people in another area and we demolished these houses [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6602.04s)]
*  and we found underneath major discoveries. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6609.5199999999995s)]
*  This discovery will be in today's show this week. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6614.28s)]
*  Now I am sure now that Imhotep's tomb is in this area. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6618.92s)]
*  Wow. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6625.4s)]
*  Now I can't wait. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6626.4s)]
*  What technology can you use to discover like these underground caverns and chambers and [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6627.4s)]
*  all what I do is digging. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6632.12s)]
*  That's it. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6636.4800000000005s)]
*  That's it. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6637.4800000000005s)]
*  What if these Italian guys are onto something and you can find more stuff? [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6638.4800000000005s)]

*  Maybe a book from 1960 and I couldn't figure out how he got there. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6658.8s)]
*  It's probably a long sludge through information. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6663.64s)]
*  Try to get to the root of it. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6666.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6667.0s)]
*  But can we continue with how it happened until you have the permits? [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6668.0s)]
*  Sure. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6673.400000000001s)]
*  So Imhotep came and he built the same mastaba mastaba in Arabic means a bench. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6674.4s)]
*  He built the construction in mud brick of stone for the first time and he added more [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6682.839999999999s)]
*  section to the first one and he put above that five mastaba. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6692.08s)]
*  It's called the step pyramid. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6698.92s)]
*  That's the first one in the pyramid text. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6702.4800000000005s)]
*  They say that the step pyramid is a stairs that the king is buried underneath to go to [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6704.68s)]
*  heaven. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6712.2s)]
*  And this one was how many years before the Great Pyramid? [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6714.08s)]
*  It's almost almost 700 years. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6717.4800000000005s)]
*  So obviously it's not nearly as sophisticated as the Great Pyramid. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6724.04s)]
*  So in 700 years, they just got way better. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6727.68s)]
*  Now on that is the three. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6731.12s)]
*  There is another pyramid was found and only I found recently. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6735.0s)]
*  That I did not excavate it completely. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6742.8s)]
*  I found a pyramid, which is the end of the three of a king called Hony. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6746.04s)]
*  The now we came to say his name is horny horny horny horny. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6752.5599999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6756.28s)]
*  It's you and I. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6757.28s)]
*  Then we come to dynasty for sin afro. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6759.28s)]
*  Okay, so if you had a genius architect, whose name was never mad, then he started tons are [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6762.44s)]
*  a good name for a genius. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6770.44s)]
*  Yeah, it started to build a step pyramid like this in a site called the Maidoon. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6771.679999999999s)]
*  But for a reason we do not know, he lifted unfinished and he went to a place called the [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6779.36s)]
*  shore. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6784.8s)]
*  He built the pyramid was a huge angle and he changed the angle. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6786.64s)]
*  It became bent and he built another pyramid. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6793.88s)]
*  If you look at the other pyramid of the father of Kofu, it exactly equal to the Great Pyramid. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6798.12s)]
*  This is the first to throw pyramid, but people never go to the shore to look at this pyramid. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6807.6s)]
*  People always look at Kofu. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6813.0s)]
*  Then you have in dynasty for the pyramids were huge because of the quality of the stones [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6815.92s)]
*  in dynasty five and six. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6825.36s)]
*  There is no good quality of stones in the Egyptian made decrees on the volume of the [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6827.28s)]
*  stones and did increase in the volume of the war reliefs. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6833.84s)]
*  The symbols began to be decorated with scenes for the first time in the Middle Kingdom. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6839.96s)]
*  Another trend mud break permit, but underneath maze corridors of stones that if you go down, [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6847.32s)]
*  you lose your way. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6857.16s)]
*  In the New Kingdom, they built they came in the top of the Valley of the Kings, a shape [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6861.08s)]
*  of the pyramid and they buried all the kings like King Tut and others underneath the parent [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6868.48s)]
*  shape. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6876.48s)]
*  So that's the story. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6877.48s)]
*  That's the story. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6880.92s)]
*  All right. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6881.92s)]
*  Well, listen, man, it's been fascinating talking to you and I definitely am going to take you [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6882.92s)]

*  I'm definitely going to go to Egypt. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6888.08s)]
*  No, now we'll talk. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6889.08s)]
*  Now we'll talk to and you got to send me that video so we can splice it in of the hieroglyphs [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6890.24s)]

*  And there are the people that will talk to them now to arrange for your trip. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6904.16s)]
*  Okay. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6907.96s)]

*  You think I should go 10 days? [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6911.96s)]
*  Jamie, you got to come. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6912.96s)]
*  You want to do a podcast from there? [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6913.96s)]
*  Just let us do one inside the Great Pyramid. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6916.96s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6920.64s)]
*  100% Okay. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6921.64s)]
*  Let the echo you though. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6922.64s)]
*  Oh, here's another problem with the idea that these Italians are proposing. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6925.360000000001s)]
*  Isn't there a water table under the pyramid that's like a million years old? [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6929.08s)]
*  No, there's not water underneath there? [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6933.400000000001s)]
*  No, this is the Osiris shaft that was full of water. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6935.6s)]
*  So is that what Mr. Beast was swimming in? [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6939.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6941.96s)]
*  But where's that water coming from? [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6942.96s)]
*  It's a water table. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6944.4400000000005s)]
*  There is a water table. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6946.4400000000005s)]
*  This shaft, this shaft, I came, I brought a company and we did suck all the water out [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6948.24s)]
*  until we found underneath a sarcophagus and four pillars. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6955.639999999999s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6959.16s)]
*  And this is the symbolic barrier of the Gadoziris because Giza Plateau was called in the New [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6960.16s)]
*  Kingdom Per Ozer Nebrastao, the house of Osiris, Lord of Rastao. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6964.799999999999s)]
*  Rastao means symmetry, but literally means the underground tunnels. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6971.799999999999s)]
*  That Osiris is ruling. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6977.4800000000005s)]
*  Then Herodotus, when he came, he talked about this water under the pyramid. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6978.4800000000005s)]
*  It is in the shaft. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6982.76s)]
*  And this one beast entered inside and swam in it. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6984.88s)]
*  Swimming. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6989.36s)]
*  OK. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6990.36s)]
*  You know, I met him because I wanted to convince the younger people that pyramids were built [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6991.36s)]
*  by aliens. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6995.76s)]
*  That's why I took him to three different sites. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6996.76s)]
*  I don't understand the alien thing. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=6999.96s)]
*  I think super advanced culture, super advanced civilization. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7002.0s)]
*  The Library of Alexandria burning is probably one of the greatest disasters. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7007.0s)]
*  Many people in America believe that you believe in aliens. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7011.0s)]
*  When I talk to them that I'm coming to see you. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7015.719999999999s)]
*  That I believe in aliens? [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7018.24s)]
*  They do. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7019.24s)]
*  Well, I'm not opposed to the idea of aliens existing. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7020.24s)]
*  There's hundreds of billions of galaxies in the known universe, each with hundreds of [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7023.839999999999s)]
*  billions of stars. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7028.959999999999s)]
*  The idea that we're uniquely alone. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7030.2s)]
*  You don't think there's anything out there? [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7032.4s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7034.44s)]
*  So you don't believe in ancient civilizations capable of advanced construction? [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7035.44s)]
*  You don't believe in aliens? [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7039.5199999999995s)]
*  You don't believe in carbon dating? [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7041.32s)]
*  I am a scientist. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7043.36s)]
*  If you believe in something, write an article. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7045.639999999999s)]
*  Then I can read. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7048.24s)]
*  But don't give me a theory. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7050.16s)]
*  But the theory of planets containing intelligent life is... [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7051.799999999999s)]
*  That's not true. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7055.839999999999s)]
*  I have been debating Graham Hancock and Robert Bofall and John Antony West and I told them [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7056.839999999999s)]
*  From the beginning, your theory will go with the wind. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7062.44s)]
*  Right, but we're not talking about that theory. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7065.88s)]
*  We're talking about aliens being possible. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7067.639999999999s)]
*  No way! [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7070.08s)]
*  No aliens, just us. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7071.12s)]
*  This is their national poison. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7072.44s)]
*  If you believe in God... [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7074.8s)]
*  Us in the whole universe? [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7075.8s)]
*  Only us. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7076.8s)]
*  If you believe in God, you'll do miracles. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7077.8s)]
*  The Egyptians believed in the afterlife and they made this great civilization. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7081.84s)]
*  I'm not saying aliens made it. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7087.48s)]
*  I'm saying it's very possible there's something else out there in the world. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7088.92s)]
*  Okay, thank you. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dbLZTJjZY&t=7092.84s)]
