# Joe Rogan Experience #1459 - Tom O'Neill
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [April 16, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J36xPWBLcG8)
*  I'm ready. Okay, Tom. How are you? Good Joe great to meet you you too
*  I've been deep into your book for the last two weeks and
*  We'll tell everybody what it's called right off the bat. It's called chaos Charles Manson the CIA and the secret history of the 60s and I
*  Think it's safe to say that everything that most people believe that happened during the Manson murders is a
*  Tiny fraction of what was going on behind the scenes and this is what you have
*  Mean you've essentially been obsessed with this for how many years it take you to do this?
*  Yeah, not obsessed by choice that kind of happened but in the end exactly 20 years we turned in the final
*  Manuscript I think a day to the 20th year and this wasn't a personal obsession with yours. You know writing an article
*  Let's fill people in the yeah, the beginning was I was in between magazines
*  And not working and I got a call from an editor. I'd worked with for years
*  And she was a premier magazine at that point
*  Which was a monthly movie magazine and she wanted me to do a story on the upcoming
*  30th anniversary of the Manson murders, which was
*  1999 happened in 69
*  And I was like, yeah, no, thanks, you know never been interested hasn't the story been written, you know death and
*  She said look
*  Once we talk about it. You're gonna see Manson comes up much more often in popular culture than you're aware of
*  Just trust me on that and I think that if you look into it, you'll find an interesting story
*  I go but you know, what about the 30th anniversary?
*  There's no angle and she goes you've done it before you'll find an angle
*  We'd work together a lot and that began a spiral into kind of madness that finally ended last last year in March when we turned
*  The manuscript in that is so crazy. It took that long
*  Magazine shut down five years later. So you never got the you never got anything printed in the magazine
*  Well, no, I mean that's also a little bit of a complicated story too
*  I got an assignment to do a normal feature, which is about
*  Three months three and a half months
*  So I got it on the day after my 40th birthday, which is the time in any man person's life
*  We were kind of re-evaluating things anyway
*  so I thought I needed the money and I needed a job and I knew that I could get into Premiere magazine as a
*  contributor on the masthead which meant a yearly contract because
*  all the people from my prior magazine had moved over and
*  And
*  Once I had a good story there and this would have been the first then I'd be set
*  so I agreed to do it and long story very long story short after a
*  month or two when the story kind of started breaking open and I started finding holes in the official narrative and
*  pursuing them I
*  had met with the editor-in-chief Jim Miggs and
*  He agreed once he saw all of the documentation I had and the evidence which was just you know
*  A small portion of what I ended up having in the end
*  He agreed to blow the deadline for what would have been the anniversary issue of August 99
*  and he started contracting me by the month and
*  That continued for a year and a half. All I did was report the story on Premiers dime
*  He lost his job
*  Because of you well that was kind of what was whispered around the offices I
*  never heard that
*  You know that was ever substantiated. I'm a little worried that it had something to do with it
*  He went on to a career that was fine anyway, but when the new guy came in he demanded the story right away. I mean I
*  Understood that and at that point I got a book agent
*  Through a friend and my book agent got me out of my obligation to premiere
*  So premiere essentially paid for you to start your book. Yeah a lot of money. Oh my goodness
*  Yeah, and that's I'm actually because it was resolved not in the courts, but we all had to sign non-disclosures
*  So I didn't get entirely away with it for for nothing
*  But at that point though, that was I think 2001 or late 2000
*  Then I was on my own. I had to write a proposal and sell the proposal as a book
*  So that happened next and finally in 2005 and when we took the proposal out it was book length
*  it was 220 pages and
*  My agent who was big shot at ICM
*  Who was also kind of what I would do it?
*  I was seduce people into this story and get them as I was like pretend
*  I'm a guy and you're trying to pitch me this book in the beginning in the first years
*  Just that the trial that had occurred that had been prosecuted by Vincent Pugliazzi had a lot of
*  Malfeasance in it by the prosecution
*  I was able to document that they planted a former prosecutor on the defense team to sabotage the defense
*  I found out that two or three of the principal witnesses including Terry Melcher who?
*  Played a big part in this and we'll probably talk about that at some point lied on the stand, you know
*  Suborn themselves in a murder trial and if you commit perjury in a murder trial
*  You could be convicted of murder. I mean you could be sentenced to a murder
*  You could get a murder sentence too because of that
*  so there was about a dozen of those and
*  None of them happened all at once
*  So if you committed perjury during a murder trial you could be sentenced for murder for the same amount of time
*  That someone would get sentenced if they murdered somebody you are subject to an actual capital
*  You could be elected you could be sent to the chair Wow and the five people who were convicted of murder in the first trial
*  once
*  Had I been around and able to prove this in the early 70s?
*  Vincent Pugliazzi and the three people who lied on the stand in a material way, you know in a very important way
*  They all could have been tried for that perjury and sentenced to the same
*  Or given the same sentence that the people who had gotten the death sentence now
*  I told you that I just got to the 11th chapter of your book, right and
*  Essentially what I'm getting so far I haven't finished the book
*  But what I'm getting so far is there was some sort of a CIA program
*  where they were
*  Explain how they did it they they
*  Infiltrated these hippie communities and they allowed Charles Manson over and over and over again to get out of jail
*  Yeah, they knew that he was committing all these crimes and instead of
*  Careful when we say they who's that? Yeah, we have to okay kind of break it all down
*  Let's let's break it all down one of the other things I found out that was very significant
*  Was that Manson had a parole officer his first parole officer?
*  Who kind of had given him a get-out-of-jail free card for the first year?
*  After Manson was released from prison and Smith Roger Smith. Yeah, and he was a criminologist in
*  the Bay Area
*  Manson violated his parole the day that he was released in Los Angeles
*  And this is one of the you think it's a little lie
*  But it's an important lie that Vince Bouliosi presented not just in a trial but also in his book a trial
*  It's much more serious. He
*  Changed the narrative
*  He said Manson had been given permission to travel to San Francisco from LA when Manson was paroled Manson hadn't been given that permission
*  he just showed up there they originally were gonna violate him set him right back to prison and
*  someone stepped in and
*  Took care of that and let Manson stay in San Francisco and he was assigned to Roger Smith
*  It took about a year and a half, but through a Freedom of Information Act process
*  His federal parole file and those were the kind of seeds of how I found out that Manson had this immunity from prosecution
*  For the two years he was out of prison from 67 until the murders occurred in the summer of 69
*  Who I'm sorry to interrupt but who was Smith doing this for who was giving him the instructions to continue to let Manson out?
*  And he can continue to monitor him. Well, that's the problem. I didn't get the whole file and the file
*  I got had redactions he would report to the head office and they would give him instructions
*  And then he would violate those instructions and there'd be no repercussions for him or for Manson
*  for instance Manson was arrested in
*  July of
*  1967 three or four months after he got out of prison when he was under Roger Smith supervision for
*  Interfering with an officer who was trying to arrest one of his first young followers Ruth M. Morehouse who was 15 and
*  He was put in jail
*  Plead out so he got a three-day sentence a new probation sentence as well and all that was hidden
*  Like it's not in Bouliosi's book
*  the
*  parole officer Roger Smith a week later wrote to the head office that Manson was doing fine and he actually
*  Recommended that Manson be allowed to go to Mexico and work in Mexico and the head parole office in the United States
*  Since his federal wrote back and they said that's insane. He was supposed the job that he was going to do in Mexico was surveying
*  Soil for insect insecticides. I mean it had nothing to do with and I have all these
*  Documents showing that who was hiring him Charles Manson to survey soil. It was a company in
*  Nevada which disappeared a couple years later
*  So it was a bullshit company. I believe so. Yeah, what do you think they were doing down there?
*  See, that's it. I don't like to speculate because I can't prove it
*  All I know is just the fact that his parole officer asked to send him not only to Mexico
*  But to the country that Manson had been deported from in 1959
*  The last time he was a free man. He had violated his parole then he was arrested in Mexico, right?
*  He was arrested in Mexico and brought over by the federales and given over to federal custody
*  For it was a drug violation and some other stuff. So why would his parole officer send him back to this place?
*  Three months after he'd been released and how do you supervise somebody who's in another country?
*  Can I make a summary just for people like what the fuck is going on right now?
*  Essentially what you're saying is that Charles Manson was a part of some sort of a program
*  Yes, and that through this program
*  They were using him and
*  Using with LSD and all the members of the family. They were turning them violent and
*  Why why do you think they were doing this again? This is where I got a real it in a little bit
*  I understand. Okay, I have to be real careful about not saying anything that I haven't been able to prove
*  I understand what I've proven is that he was getting leniency from the federal government and
*  the
*  Law enforcement first in San Francisco that year the person who represented the federal government
*  There was his parole officer Roger Smith the federal parole officer who was giving him leniency
*  Roger was also doing drug research at the Haydash Berry free medical clinic which opened in June of 67
*  Manson
*  During that period turned into the Manson that we're familiar with today
*  You know the monster the embodiment of evil as Vince Buleosy called him the guru who could control the minds of these
*  Followers so he would come into the clinic to see Rogers. Well, he went for two reasons
*  It was a free clinic. It was at the height of the summer of love the summer of 67 and
*  He would come in with the women the girls he had about five or six followers then and they would walk behind him
*  They wouldn't speak unless he spoke to them any command
*  He issued towards them they would follow and they became very well known around the clinic and they were there principally for
*  Manson to see Roger for his weekly parole appointments
*  And then the girls were going in for STDs and there were some pregnancies and stuff and they were getting free treatment
*  That was you the summer that the Manson family formed and then they left in
*  late
*  67 early 68 and migrated down to Los Angeles
*  Los Angeles and became this killer cult. It's crazy. How quickly this all happened. It's insane
*  So we don't understand we're talking about two years. We're talking about 67 Manson is in Haydn Ashbury
*  69 the Tate lobby on commuters and then the trial and then everything else. Yeah, two years. Yeah, and
*  So you brought up MK ultra? Yes, MK ultra was a government program
*  run by the Central Intelligence Agency
*  Agency
*  originally started as something called Bluebird in
*  1948-49 morphed into artichoke and then in 1952 became MK ultra
*  It was a mind control program a brainwashing program. The CIA was trying to learn how to
*  control people's behavior
*  Without their knowledge now, this is all came out in Senate and congressional hearings in the 70s
*  It was exposed but nobody knew about it until
*  1974 when Seymour Hirsch the New York Times reporter reported on the front page of the paper, so
*  Their main objective was to commit or to create what they called hypno program
*  assassins people who would kill on command
*  Populary known as Manchurian candidates after a book that was written 1962 and later became a movie and then a movie again
*  The people would be through drugs and hypnotism
*  The objective was to get people to go and commit an act of murder against their moral code and have no
*  memory of their programming
*  And be amnesic even of the act after the fact often
*  That was just one of that was their main goal
*  But they were also trying to create couriers people, you know military people that they could implant messages send them
*  You know across dangerous areas where they were at that time. It was the Vietnam War
*  And deliver messages and then have them wiped from their memory in case they were captured
*  they had all kinds of objectives, so
*  Roger Smith was
*  supervising Manson when he became
*  Exactly what or he was able to do exactly what the MK ultra program had been trying to create and do for at that point
*  about 15 17 years when it was all exposed in the 70s and there were these hearings first
*  the Rockefeller Commission hearings and the church hearings and then finally
*  Senators Ted Kennedy and Daniel Inouye held hearings
*  The CIA admitted that they had done this but they no one would say exactly what they did
*  all the records had been destroyed when the two people who ran it Richard Helms who had become the director of the CIA in the
*  60s and Dr. Sidney Gottlieb who was kind of the mad scientist who
*  had
*  Supervised all the all that they had safe houses in San Francisco, New York
*  Los Angeles where they would experiment on people that were lured into these
*  apartments and houses that were either look look like brothels or hippie communes or whatever and
*  The people who were working at the hate Ashbury free medical clinic that was run by another Smith which makes it a little confusing
*  But dr. David Smith who founded it
*  He had given an office to a scientist named Jolly West Louis J West who
*  Was when when the hearings occurred in the 70s identified as a top MK ultra researcher he was an academic
*  Come out of the military have been at the Oklahoma University or Oklahoma University University of Oklahoma
*  Sorry, and then UCLA running the psychiatric divisions
*  He denied ever being involved in MK ultra and this was one of the moments
*  I think it was 2001 when you know things really kind of
*  shook the
*  Course of my reporting was I learned that West had been at the same place that Manson was
*  in the hate in the summer that Manson became exactly what the CIA was trying to create and
*  I knew actually I'd interviewed West about seven years before for a story
*  I did about celebrity stalkers of people who were obsessed with stars and then only to kill them or try to kill them
*  And he was an expert in violence hypnotism brainwashing and he was the chair of the psychiatry department at UCLA at that point
*  he was dead when his name came up in the Manson story and
*  There wasn't a lot of I mean, I guess there was a lot of Google then or a little bit
*  But when I did a little research I found out that there had been these allegations that he'd been involved in MK ultra
*  He always denied it. He was never prosecuted never even investigated
*  He went to his grave threatening to sue anybody that said he would have anything to do with this kind of a program
*  Again through another long story, but I got access to his files which had been left at UCLA
*  And never they had never been processed when I called and when I made the request
*  It took him two or three months to process the papers
*  I went through them through the whole summer looking for a needle and a haystack
*  And it was intuition gut
*  I just thought there might be something there and sure enough I eventually found it
*  It was correspondence between Jolly West and Sydney Gottlieb the doctor that ran MK ultra beginning in 1953
*  about conduct conducting experiments on people without their knowledge to get them to
*  have amnesics
*  amnesia of the acts after they were programmed and
*  everything that he had been accused of
*  and
*  Denied he did not only did he do it. He created the blueprint for the whole program with Gottlieb
*  The fact that all these kind of
*  Interesting research programs merged at the hate
*  At the clinic and then Manson came out of it
*  With the power to do exactly what the MK ultra have been trying to create for up to that point. I thought was worth
*  Investigating further and that's why I kept going and going and going
*  They did a lot of crazy shit back then. Are you aware of operation mid-light midnight climax that those were the safe houses in San Francisco
*  Well, that was the brothel version
*  Yeah, where they they lured these Johns into these brothels and then dose them up with LSD and studied them
*  Yeah, George Hunter White was a head CIA guy and he would sit behind a two-way or a one-way mirror and
*  Watch them that the Johns would be dose with LSD
*  They tried aerosols or just drinks different things and then they would study their behaviors aerosols
*  Yeah, aerosol sprays really yeah, but that would get the prostitutes to them
*  No, no the prostitutes would get them in there and then they go to the bathroom or something or to be in the bathroom
*  Yeah, again, the problem is the records are so scant because Helms order Gottlieb to destroy all the records in
*  1973 when the two men left the agency
*  And the only reason anybody ever discovered that it existed was a whistleblower somebody who used to work for the State Department who?
*  remembered that there were records in a warehouse and they were just financial records from the
*  beginning of the program in 52 until the end and the possible end in 73 and
*  It was just financial records of where research took place how much was spent what kind of equipment was bought but nothing about the content
*  The guy that found that ended up testifying to Congress and working with Seymour Hersh to expose it was named John Marx
*  He wrote the first book about MK alter that came out in the mid to late 70s called the search for the Manchurian candidate
*  And after he wrote his book
*  He never you know
*  He spoke did a little bit of a tour and then retreated into obscurity and never would do an interview again
*  Until I approached him in
*  The early 2000s and when I told him what I had what I had found in West files these documents
*  He agreed to meet with me at his townhouse in Washington DC
*  And he told me he said the reason I stopped talking or writing about this was people were camping out on my front lawn
*  You know telling me that they'd been
*  Victims of MK alter he goes I couldn't go anywhere
*  my whole life became crazy because everybody thought that they were subject to this because nobody knew they
*  Did these drug tests on prisoners?
*  Hospital patients John's hippies people that had no idea that this was going on for 25 years
*  So Marx became the authority so he had never given an interview till he met with me
*  And when he looked at my documents at that point
*  I think I had about 10 or 12 or 15 pages that grew eventually because I kept going back to the files and getting more
*  He said it was the most unredacted uncensored
*  Account of what the real objectives were and what was really being done
*  He had never he said if I had had that my whole book would have been different
*  so
*  That's one of the problems about saying well how much did they do or how far did they go?
*  There's barely any record and that's another reason it took me 20 years because I was trying to find out
*  Whether or not West had actually
*  Interacted with Manson and were the girls. I mean I knew he was in the same facility
*  I knew that everybody that worked there because I interviewed everybody that was alive
*  They most of them were still alive back in the night late 90s and early 2000s when I did this they all said
*  Oh, yeah, Charlie was you know we knew it was Charlie and the girls
*  they come in every day or every few days to see Roger and
*  And West was there recruiting subjects now West
*  While he was there that summer had opened something called what he called the hate Ashbury project and in his
*  correspondence and papers that I found he called it a
*  laboratory disguise as a hippie crash pad and
*  And just like the operation midnight
*  Safe out they call them safe houses which were disguised as
*  You know bordellos and that type of thing or brothels these this was an apartment that was decked out
*  Or as he called it tricked out to look like a communal hippie place
*  Six graduate students and I have his letters to them before they came to work in this he goes grow your hair long wear jeans
*  Dress like hippies and lure people in there
*  So they ran that for the summer of 67 and West was getting people from that
*  Hate Ashbury free medical clinic on Clayton Street and sending them around the corner to Frederick Street
*  To participate in that Lord and I
*  Got the diaries of some of the graduate students who were there and they all in these diaries said
*  We have no idea what we're really supposed to be doing here
*  We feel like this whole thing is a cover for something else. What does jolly want?
*  Why is he making us bring these people in?
*  So I just doing that to graduate students telling them to bring people in and drug them up imagine telling them
*  Well, some of them like I'm sure they like because they were also, you know encouraged to use LSD. I'm sure
*  I mean imagine being a graduate student and this is your project on people
*  I mean that sets up even if you leave that program and go on to do legitimate work
*  The ethical foundations of your career are set up in such a strange way. You're manipulating people against their knowledge
*  Well, they didn't know who they were doing it for. That's why they were always questioning it. So
*  I
*  You know, I don't know how I found one or two of them after and they were very careful talking to me
*  I'm sure they felt like they were gonna go to jail. Well, that's the thing
*  Yeah, if any of these experiments or whatever was going on resulted in a death, there's no statute of limitations on murder, right?
*  Right. I mean that's one of the biggest disappointments of my book is that people like West aren't alive
*  You know to answer for that to answer to this and it was really frustrating for me because again
*  His name was on the front page of the New York Times in
*  1977 when they had the major hearings about MKUltra and
*  It identified him as the head of the psychiatry
*  Department at UCLA a very prominent doctor researcher and he said he had nothing to do with that
*  He'd never used LSD on humans and he wouldn't he said they had asked him and he said no
*  I have all these letters between him and the guy who was running the program
*  Describing how they're gonna do it hide it from his colleagues when he started it. He started at Lackland Air Force Base. He was
*  Running the psychiatry department at the hospital there in 1952
*  When he was there running that hospital, that's when he started his experiments on prisoners
*  Human subjects and one letter to Gottlieb he says eventually we have to take these experiments out into the field
*  Oh Jesus exactly. What does that mean?
*  Well, if you're haven't gotten it through a chapter 11 yet, you haven't gotten to the Jimmy Shaver case
*  No, I haven't a year after maybe Jamie did a year after
*  West contracted with
*  the CIA to do these experiments July 4th 1954
*  Three year old girl went missing from the parking lot of a bar
*  At about 11 or 12 at night now her parents was a heatwave they couldn't sleep they went to the bar
*  They brought their two kids. They let them play in the parking lot at midnight
*  The little girl disappeared. They organized a search party about three or four hours later. They
*  went to a gravel pit and
*  To air Oh to airmen had called or to
*  I tinnering guys had called the police the local sheriff and said there's a guy here that wandered out of the brush with
*  Scratches and blood no shirt and he doesn't know how he got here or who he is
*  The police came his name was Jimmy Shaver. He was an airman
*  They did a search and they found the little girl's body not too far away and she had been raped and murdered
*  By this guy who had no memory of doing it the guy had no history of violence
*  He had a couple kids and he was a flight instructor at the school he'd been in the military for a number of years
*  I think it was in his early 30s. Well guess who became his
*  psychiatrist in
*  preparation for the trial Jolly West who inserted himself into the case and then
*  Extracted his memory from him using sodium pentothal where he admitted to the the murder
*  Now in the context of what we found out West was doing and what his objectives were
*  At that same time it raises huge questions about this was an experiment
*  Gone wrong, you know that he was part of one of these experiments at Lackland Air Force Base where he was signed up
*  During the trial it came out that he had had treatment for severe migraines experimental treatment at Lackland
*  That's another you know a smaller sub chapter in the book
*  but does it describe what kind of experimental treatment he received no no because
*  Nobody I mean I have all the testimony there was actually a
*  Trial or retrial and sentencing and every time it came up. It was really frustrating because he never testified
*  So they it was either his wife or his mother who would talk about it was mostly his mother saying
*  Well, all I knew was they wanted him to be involved in this two-year study
*  To try to relieve his his migraines. He would have such horrible migraines. He would put his head in buckets of ice water
*  The people who described encountering him that night when he was arrested and immediately taken out of the sheriff's custody by the military
*  Police and brought to Lackland and then back to the sheriff's
*  He was in a trance
*  The doctors tested him for alcohol
*  Because they thought well, maybe he's drunk. He had no out just a little bit of alcohol in his system, but he wasn't drunk and
*  After the fact they found out that he had
*  What I mean, I don't want to get into this because it's really getting into the weeds, but he had hallucinated
*  That this little girl was a cousin who sexually abused him as a child and he was trying to kill her
*  Her name was Beth Rainbow. All this stuff came out of the trial
*  Jolly West in 1955
*  sent a
*  Report to Sidney Gottlieb, which nobody had seen and it was another document I found in his files
*  Announcing that he had learned how to or develop the technology to remove
*  true memories and
*  Replace them with false memories and a human subject without their knowledge
*  Which was one of the main goals the biggest goals of the MKL to program and again when the CIA
*  When they had the hearings in the 70s, the CIA said nothing was successful. Everything we tried was a failure
*  It was a waste of money. We shouldn't have done it
*  and
*  Not not just me but most experts think that that was a cover that they didn't want to admit they that they had developed these
*  Technologies that were effective. They also claimed that they had released everything they had I found the same report
*  Where West said that he had learned how to replace true memories with false ones without a person's awareness
*  But they had removed that from the report and then released it to Congress. So that's a crime right there, you know
*  So there's a lot of that stuff in the book
*  So the speculation is that this guy through these experimental treatments that they had dosed him up with LSD and
*  experimented
*  using these MK ultra techniques and did that to him and induce some sort of
*  Well, this is speculation. I'll go there. Okay for this
*  The guy had no history of violence
*  Never been arrested
*  Stellar upstanding citizen his only problem was he had these horrible headaches all of a sudden he shows up by a
*  Small girl's body who've been brutally murdered with no memory of doing it a
*  Year earlier. Dr. West who became a psychiatrist within a week or two
*  Possibly had
*  Experiences with them before but there was no record. Oh when I tried to get the record from the Medical Center at
*  Lacklin his file that his name was shaver. I think it was
*  SA to SI
*  Was missing so where shaver would have been and the medical records it was gone
*  So I couldn't find out whether he had actually participated in any kind of experimental program now
*  So is the speculation again?
*  This is speculation that he did commit the crime that he was somehow or another induced into committing this crime
*  Yeah, and again, this is speculation
*  It's completely circumstantial the objective was to get people who would go out and do things not even necessarily kill
*  That's that was the ultimate goal but to do things against their will against their moral code
*  Right, but how would they know that this child would be there? How would they know?
*  No, she wasn't targeted. So was it just that they put it into his head to go and something anyone?
*  Yeah, something clicked and went wrong. So it wasn't a precise thing. No, I wasn't no no
*  Nobody really knew what else this was the very early days of experimenting with LSD in the early 1950s
*  West was one of the premier researchers in that list II, but he was still new to it
*  He had actually come out of
*  He had first gained national attention for being one of four or five doctors who treated Korean prisoners of war
*  Who were returned to the United States after they had made?
*  Confessions of spraying the Korean countryside with illegal biological weapons
*  The United States said that we don't use that that's against the Geneva codes
*  and these guys were brainwashed by the
*  North Korean Chinese Soviets
*  So when they were brought back after the war West and four other psychiatrists were assigned to deprogram them
*  What a lot of researchers believe
*  Is that they actually
*  Brainwashed them into thinking they've been brainwashed by the Koreans where they actually were telling the truth
*  Because there's a lot of evidence that's come out as recently as five six years ago that we did use these weapons in Korea
*  Oh boy, you'll double cross
*  So is the speculation that Charlie Manson was basically just sort of a two-bit criminal who would spend most of his life
*  inside the system and
*  Had been incarcerated for what half of his life
*  I'm of his life when he was released about age 32 and 67 all federal institutions, too
*  Which was interesting even Bouliosi pointed that out in his book
*  First of all his mother was a prostitute
*  She kind of she would get sentenced to jail for petty theft or prostitution and she'd hand him off to her parents or other people
*  And by the time he was 10 11 12 years old
*  He was stealing cars committing petty theft and stuff. So then he was sent to
*  You know juvenile detention centers and schools
*  Reform schools all run by the federal government and then when he committed his first crimes as an adult
*  Which was again car theft the first
*  Crimes were car theft, but when he stole the cars he crossed state lines
*  So then it became a federal offense and he got in prison with much more serious
*  Sentences of as a federal offense and if it's a state and he'd do these long sentences back to back to back
*  And then every time he was released he either violated
*  Parole or probation and they were actually strict with him in the 50s and early well till 60
*  When he finally went to prison for seven years
*  It wasn't until 67 when he came out that all of a sudden it was hands-off
*  Now, what do you think happened?
*  In prison did they find him in prison well again, I'll go there with you
*  Okay, and I kind of lay out. Yeah what I do in the book is and I got criticism for this
*  Which we knew was a good possibility is I lay out
*  Circumstantial evidence for a case with proof of each circumstance, but when you put them all together
*  That's the hardest part is linking them finding the bridges
*  Okay
*  What I do is show what the objectives were of and either the federal government's case
*  through MK ultra and then other programs cointel pro and chaos and
*  The law enforcement's in Los Angeles and San Francisco at the time. So
*  MK ultra
*  Began in the in the federal prisons experiments on prisoners
*  Famously or notoriously whitey bolger, I don't know if you've heard about this but a
*  Few years ago
*  It was revealed that whitey bolger had been a part of MK ultra experimentation in the 50s when he was incarcerated
*  And after he was convicted he was claiming
*  That he believed that all of his violence was a product of what had happened to him in prison when he was experimented
*  upon with LSD through these scientists, so
*  Theoretically Manson was in the prime place where the experiments were occurring in prisons before he was released in
*  67 and federal institutions
*  They couldn't do it in the state did Manson ever talk about any experiments that took place turn no no no no he
*  He you know, I actually have his not only his federal parole file
*  Which was the hardest thing to get that had never been released from 67 to 69
*  But I also have the one prior to that from the 50s to the 60s and all the
*  Correspondents and he would talk about these doctors coming in to examine him and
*  He didn't trust them and he didn't know what they were doing and this was late 50s
*  and
*  Unfortunately, he never had the first names for the doctors. There were two one of them was dr. Hartman
*  I can't remember the other one's name
*  There was a Mortimer Hartman in Los Angeles who was one of the early psychiatrists using LSD in the 50s
*  Carrie Carrie grant was one of his patients
*  So
*  Theoretically
*  He could have come out of the program
*  Or the experimentation that began there
*  But you know, I hate to even I rather and again
*  It's hard to kind of synopsize all this without showing all the documentation and stuff of what was going on and where he was
*  And how everything matches up, but you'll see that when you get through chapter 11
*  Okay, so I wish I wish I got to it but
*  You know so rush to get that far. So
*  1967 he gets out of jail and
*  He how long before he hooks up with this clinic?
*  So he got out in March of 67 the clinic opened in June of 67. So just a few months
*  Yeah, well Roger Smith
*  He was actually living in Berkeley Manson was and he got his first follower Mary Brunner and then two or three or four more
*  And then Roger was the one who suggested that he go to the hate to absorb the vibes
*  He thought Manson might benefit from the love and peace vibes that were happening in the summer of love Roger Smith
*  Was his parole officer in 67, but also was his parole officer before that was that proven?
*  Well, no Roger Smith's well his assistant you that's good you remember that Gail Sedalia
*  Told me she was his assistant at the clinic at the Haydash Berry Free Medical Clinic when he was running his amphetamine study
*  in 68
*  She said that Roger had told her he met Manson when he was doing
*  probation work in Illinois in
*  The early 60s I
*  I eventually interviewed Roger several times and Roger denied that and when I went back to Gail, she was shocked
*  She's like I can't believe he's denying that that was a connection. He met that's why Manson was able to leave Los Angeles
*  He was sent to Roger Smith. So Roger could be his parole officer. I was never able
*  To document that Manson had been in Illinois except for three days
*  From in 61 or excuse me in 60 when he was brought from Mexico to Texas and then they brought him to Los Angeles
*  To be violated in front of the judge there and he did spend three days at Jolie at prison where Roger Smith worked
*  But he was there a year or two later
*  So that was one of the front one of the many frustrating moments where everything made sense
*  except for
*  one but one very important
*  Whole which was well they weren't there at the same time at least as far as the official record shows
*  so if Smith was a part of these experiments and Smith was also
*  His parole officer and did know him before he did the seven years before he got out
*  Which is when it's speculated that Manson was possibly
*  experimented on and Smith might have been aware of the entire process of it and was
*  Supervising him upon his release. Yeah
*  Yeah, so that's why every time Manson got arrested which should have just locked him up they would just let him go
*  Yeah, yeah and and Smith I mean to give you a little background on Smith as he told me he called himself
*  He goes I was a rock rock rib Republican from the Midwest and I came out he went to Berkeley
*  To the school of criminology to become a criminologist. I think in 65 or 66
*  He was getting his master's and his PhD and his special area of
*  study was in the beginning gangs collective behavior and violence and
*  Then how drugs would make some of these gangs that he had
*  People he was working with infiltrate students infiltrate
*  To get information. Yeah, this is an Oakland in the ghettos in like 65 66 when the Panthers were forming then and 60
*  Late 66
*  He decided to become a federal parole officer while he was still writing his dissertation
*  And he got assigned to something called the San Francisco project
*  Which was an experimental program?
*  Run by the federal government to see how different
*  Numbers of parole clients
*  Case loads for per parole officer were you know, you know super it was about recidivism
*  So if you had the lowest load was 20 clients, the largest was like 50 or 60
*  Were you able to super?
*  I mean you wouldn't think that 50 or 60 is gonna be a lot more difficult, but it always wasn't so Smith joined that program
*  Where he's supposed to be paying much more attention and care to his clients
*  Because it's part of a special
*  Program called the San Francisco project and in fact he was I mean he was he was seeing Manson
*  More than he was even officially supposed to things, you know, I guess even crazier
*  After 68 he stopped being his parole officer. He was actually removed and
*  He said it was voluntarily so he could focus more on his drugs and violence research at the clinic
*  Manson's three or four women followers got arrested in Mendocino
*  They had lured a couple young boys
*  Into a house giving them LSD there
*  Manson had sent them out up to Mendocino to recruit people for the family
*  the three women were four women were arrested one of the Mary Brunner had the first baby with Manson in the group and
*  Roger Smith and his wife Carol went up to Mendocino and petitioned the court to take foster custody of the child
*  Until Mary was until her case was resolved
*  So they were the foster parents of Manson's son, I mean everything was irregular about this
*  That actually that case is pretty interesting. So Mary Brunner and Susan Atkins two women who actually killed for Manson in 1969
*  were
*  given they were convicted of contributing to the delinquency of minors illegal drug possession and
*  Without a trial they pled out
*  and then there was
*  What they call the sentencing phase where a probation officer is assigned to decide whether or not they should be sent to prison or
*  given probation supervised probation
*  so I got access to their files Brunner's and Atkins and
*  In the file were recommendations to the court by Roger Smith and his wife saying these are good women. They shouldn't go to prison
*  Susan
*  Susan Atkins who you know stabs Sharon Tate and is that proven because she said it and then she went back and forth and back and forth
*  Yeah, is it proven because Tex Watson clearly was a murderer. Yeah. Yeah
*  So she had said that Tex did it she couldn't do it, but this was later on
*  Yeah, her first her first accounts were that she did it and then when she testified to the grand jury
*  She said that she didn't do it she held Sharon while tech stabbed her right later in prison
*  she said that she did do it then she changed again she go back and forth, but she was pretty brutal and
*  Mary Brunner and Susan Atkins were given probation instead of being sentenced
*  Partially based on Roger Smith's recommendation Roger Smith identified himself as a former parole officer, you know with this
*  Expertise and he said he had known both of them for two years and
*  Which was also a lie. He had only known Susan. He could have known Susan for two years. He knew her for about a year
*  He did know Mary pretty well
*  And he never disclosed that he was Manson's parole officer and Manson's identified in these same files as the person who lured these women
*  Into crime that they were his communal wives that they would steal for him prostitutes themselves for him and
*  The other people that they interviewed the probation officer argued against it saying they're gonna go right back to this guy who's down in Los Angeles
*  And continue their life of crime, but the judge released them now
*  This was they were doing Charlie's bidding according to the the record what they were trying to do was recruit people into the family
*  And so they would offer them drugs and and and
*  Sex and a lot of women and bring them to these parties and where they screwed up is they got an underage boy
*  Who was freaked out right and he was the son of a sheriff?
*  Turned into snakes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's what they screwed up in that situation and that's how they got arrested that time
*  Yeah, and still they got released
*  Yeah, which is really crazy
*  It's like there's so many of these instances where Charlie or members of the family were arrested and then
*  It seemed like the police officers who were holding them were being told. Hey, you got to let these guys go
*  Yeah, there's this is a higher the situation is above your pay grade. Yeah
*  well real turning point in my reporting was after I got access to Manson's parole file and
*  Saw that I mean and held her scaler bullio see I think describes two arrests that Manson got released on
*  Technicalities, you know shoddy police work or something when he should have been violated
*  But what he didn't do was talk about three or four more and if you've gotten up to chapter 10
*  You've seen all that stuff laid out. So when I got this record a pretty substantial record
*  I took it to someone named Lewis Wachnick who was a retired judge and a retired district attorney from
*  the valley out around here of that nice
*  Because I needed somebody with the expertise and the knowledge of how things worked
*  You have to look at everything in context things work at differently today than they did in 2009 or 2000 when I interviewed him
*  But he was there in 69 in the DA's office. I brought the documents to him and
*  We laid them all out on his kitchen table and he's looking at them and the poor guy was very sick with cancer and
*  Talk like this
*  But I had the recorder going and he's looking at all the documents and he's seeing this pattern of catch-release catch-release
*  And he's gone chicken shit chicken shit. This is all chicken shit
*  He goes he shouldn't he should have gone back the first time he goes they wanted him out
*  He said he was more important to somebody out than in
*  He goes you've got to find out who it was and I go up
*  How do I do that? And he goes you're not gonna be able to that's he's an informant
*  I go but who should I what should I look at? He goes well, he was working either for local law enforcement
*  The federal government the FBI but somebody wanted him out there doing whatever he was doing so that was important
*  Another turning point was a bunch of years later was when I brought similar materials to Stephen Kay
*  Who was bullio sees co-prosecutor in the case?
*  Can I stop you for a second? So the speculation his speculation was that Charlie was an informant?
*  Well, and again an informant has many definitions it's not just informing on crime it also can be doing the police's bidding
*  That's where the CIA's with the CIA or the FBI being a part of a program
*  right where they're allowing this and also there's speculation that the the goal was to try to diminish the
*  Anti-war movement and that this guy was a part of the hippie movement
*  So now people would associate hippies with violence and drugs and murder and all this
*  Well, I mean again, this is going into the weeds but it's important I'll try to do it
*  I know that your podcasts are longer than most well, we can keep going forever
*  It's been a while since I've done this the book came out a year ago and everybody I mean
*  I haven't been getting the calls I got when the book came out. So I'm a little rusty believe it or not
*  You're great. This is amazing stuff
*  It's just hard to kind of cover all these this ground without sounding nuts without giving context. Yes, I understand in
*  1967
*  The federal government started the FBI started a program called Cointel Pro
*  In San Francisco, they opened their first office the same time Manson arrived there
*  The CIA started a program
*  Like MK ultra illegal
*  I mean MK ultra was illegal because they were violating people's human rights by giving them drugs without their knowledge or consent
*  But they were also operating on
*  American soil domestic soil, which is against the law in the United States. You're not allowed to the CIA is not allowed to operate here
*  They opened something. They started a new program called chaos
*  Same thing they began in San Francisco in the summer of 67 authorized by Richard Helms
*  Who was by then the director of the CIA?
*  he had come up since 52 working under Alan Dulles and then John McComb and
*  He was the one who supervised Gottlieb and NK ultra
*  So chaos and Cointel Pro each had the same objectives which were to neutralize
*  What they believe was a revolution revolutionaries that were gonna create a civil war in America the left wing
*  the anti-war movement the black Panthers
*  And the hippie movement who kind of
*  embraced it all and this all began in the early 60s with Ronald Reagan had become the governor of California and
*  Jay Edgar Hoover was convinced that the free speech movement which began in the early 60s in Berkeley had been infiltrated by
*  Communists from Russia and China and they were trying to create divisiveness
*  within the United States to
*  Start a revolution so Hoover started Cointel Pro and
*  Reagan was involved with that as the governor and then
*  Helms started chaos and both of them had informants who were trained
*  They had something called the Hoover Academy where they had training programs to turn agents into hippies
*  Just like Johnny West with his graduate students. They grew their hair along they learned the lingo and then they went and tried to
*  Insinuate themselves with with left-wing groups
*  African Americans with the Panthers
*  Cointel Pro would pit rival groups against each other and the ultimate goal was to get them to kill each other and
*  Cointel Pro was exposed in
*  1972 one or two after a bunch of kind of radical people
*  Raided a warehouse in Pennsylvania where they knew immediate Pennsylvania not far from where I was raised
*  Where they knew that the FBI stored records and then they released it to the public and it was the record of this operation
*  And the documents were astonishing because they weren't redacted because they were stolen and then released
*  there are documents
*  celebrating the murder of one the Panthers became really paranoid by
*  67 68 there were all kinds of inner power struggles and they thought they thought that they
*  Correctly thought that they had been infiltrated and they suspect and they were some of them killed other Panthers because they thought they were informants
*  but they also had a rivalry with different groups like in Los Angeles the US slave, which was a militant group and
*  the Cointel Pro operatives
*  Would let the US slaves think they were about to be attacked by the Panthers and vice versa and then there'd be a shootout and
*  When Cointrell was pro was exposed in the 70s and resulted in more hearings investigations
*  they admitted to being responsible for
*  instigating I think 20 or 30 killings
*  By their operatives
*  Chaos on the other hand there's minimal records of chaos all we knew was it existed from 67
*  probably till Helms left the CIA in 73 and
*  that their objective was we knew that they were doing surveillance and
*  We knew that they were doing wiretapping and infiltrating groups. But as far as beyond that
*  You can't they can't even name a chaos agent
*  Nobody's ever been exposed because everything was destroyed when Helms left the record
*  so these groups were trying to
*  Incite violence now we get to the motive of
*  The official narrative of the Manson murder or the taila Bianca murders
*  Which is what the prosecutor Vince Bouliosi presented a trial which was the famous helter-skelter motive
*  In a nutshell Manson believed that
*  There was going to be a race war and
*  He wanted to incite this race war
*  Because he had convinced his followers that through messages he received from the Beatles white album from their lyrics from biblical
*  Old Testament prophecies that
*  He had been told that he was going to be the savior of the world and
*  Once the race war started he would hide his family in a bottomless pit in the desert
*  And when the race war ended with the blacks winning the blacks would be framed for for murders
*  They would the Manson family would emerge and repopulate the planet with their perfect up offspring and dominate the blacks
*  This was Vince Bouliosi's well he
*  There was talk of that there was a philosophy of helter-skelter at the spawn ranch where they lived in 68 and 69
*  That Manson would discuss but whether or not it was the motive for the murders is I raised serious questions about that
*  And look Manson would discuss it in that way that there was going to be a race war and that they would emerge
*  And then their offspring yeah, yeah except for the fact that
*  What's question so the way?
*  Bouliosi was able to convict Manson Manson wasn't at the Tate house when the murders happened
*  He had in the official story dispatched Susan Atkins Patricia Crenwinkel
*  Leslie Kasabian and Tex Watson to the house the former house of Terry Melcher
*  they didn't know who lived there, but just to kill everybody and
*  Has Manson allegedly said leave something witchy he wanted it to look like
*  Blacks had killed these all he knew was they were wealthy
*  beautiful whites and
*  he wanted to
*  Ignite the race war because if the Panthers got blamed for these murders
*  Then the police would crack down on them. They'd revolt the revolution would happen
*  It would be
*  It would spread across the whole world and then when it was over and the blacks had prevailed
*  They were too dumb Manson believed to be able to run the world
*  That's when he would come out with his followers of their hole in the desert and take over the planet now
*  Bouliosi said in interviews that I didn't have until after he and I
*  Stopped speaking which was when he started threatening me with lawsuits and other things in the about
*  2006-7 I
*  Discovered two or three interviews he gave in the early 70s where he was asked
*  If he believed that Manson really believed this craziness and Bouliosi said I don't think Charlie believed in it
*  He got his followers too, but he never believed in that. He was too smart
*  He was a calm man what the interviewers didn't ask him in the follow-up was well if he didn't believe it
*  Why did he send his followers to kill these people the first night at the Tate house the second night in Los Villas?
*  This is you know upper middle-class couple the La Bianca's then, you know, what was the motive and
*  That's one of my biggest regrets is that I slipped and they were kind of obscure one was a penthouse interview
*  The other was a regional newspaper, but that I didn't have them. I thought I had done all the research
*  I thought I read every interview he'd ever given
*  But I didn't have it at hand to say all right then I get that because I don't think Manson believed it either
*  Then what was the motive for the murders? Why were they sent there to kill and that's what the book explores
*  So do you think Bouliosi was operating with the knowledge that Manson was a part of these programs? Oh
*  That's the big question. Yeah
*  Again I lay it out in the book so I interviewed Bouliosi
*  He was the first not the first but one of the first interviews I did when it was a magazine assignment
*  He invited me to his house in Pasadena
*  So it was April of 99. We spent literally six hours together. He was
*  So kind and generous with his time. I thought I scored I had the prosecutor
*  He hadn't given interviews that he always gave interviews about this, but he hadn't for a number of years
*  he agreed to do it for whatever reason and
*  During the course of that interview
*  I arrived at his house went into his kitchen
*  His wife gave me Italian cookies with coffee and lemonade
*  Then he and I went out to lunch in the valley somewhere
*  He showed me some of the sites connected to the murders
*  Then we went back to the house and talked till sunset and towards the end of the six hours. I did realize
*  That even though he was talking non-stop and I'm recording everything he hadn't given me anything
*  New or different. I mean, I just finished Helter Skelter
*  I read it for the first time because I'd never been interested in the case till I got the assignment
*  So I did what we call the Hail Mary pass in journalism
*  Which is you ask someone if there's anything they could tell you off the record not for attribution
*  That will help them to get something fresh because I was still searching for an angle
*  This is the first month of reporting and Vince kind of thought a minute and he goes turn it off turn it off
*  So I turned off the recorder
*  And he did I could tell he was debating but then he told me something
*  Which I'm not sure if I don't think I reveal it till the last chapter. It's off the record was salacious
*  pretty shocking
*  in the larger picture it doesn't
*  Change anything really but it showed me that he had a very different account of something very important in the narrative
*  And I took that away and I thought wow, I'm gonna say
*  Well first let me explain it's it was off the record right in
*  2005 when I interviewed him for the second time and all things went to hell and he started threatening me and
*  With lawsuits and writing letters to my publisher trying to get them to stop the book
*  He wrote about what he told me and he claimed that
*  I had dragged it out of him and embellished it and all this but once he put that in a letter
*  The lawyers at the publisher said well, it's not on the record anymore because these documents will all be in a civil trial
*  When he sues you which he said he was about to do not off the record to me. Yeah, they said now it's on the record
*  Yeah, they said now it's on the record. I mean he is he's violated his agreement with you. So what he told me was that
*  famously an audio or video tape was taken from the Tate house by the police
*  Excuse me the first day after the murders
*  They found it hidden up in a loft
*  Video tape videotaping home videotaping was relatively new at that point
*  not a lot of people had cameras, but Roman Polanski did and
*  In Helter Skelter, Vince says in the book
*  That the police took the tape viewed it and
*  It was just Sharon and Roman making love and returned it to the loft
*  Roman was in London at the time of the murders. He came back
*  Immediately and then about a week later he went up to the house
*  and one of the first things he did was he went up to the loft and
*  He never even knew that they took it allegedly that that's a story
*  Found it and took it
*  Vince told me
*  Originally off the record that the tape wasn't of Roman and Sharon making love. It was
*  Sharon being forced to have sex with two men
*  Against her wishes and he said Roman was the one who was making it because you could hear him in the background
*  You know if you read the book you've read those chapters Roman did a lot of bad stuff to Sharon
*  Yeah, he seemed like a terrible person. He was pretty bad
*  He's pretty bad
*  Well, what do you when you hear what he did the reason why you never come back to the country you go?
*  Well, okay, it makes sense. It makes sense. Yeah, it's not that surprising. It's a monster
*  Yeah, yeah, I mean I'm sure that's really good at making movies
*  Yeah, yeah, which we're not gonna see anymore because the last one he made which is supposed to be at one of his best
*  They're not gonna release it in the United States, but
*  Once I had that that's kind of the first rabbit hole
*  I went down because I'm like well if this was different in the official narrative
*  What else might they have changed?
*  So Vince and I were talking on the phone about every week for two months. He was so accessible
*  so I'd be interviewing people and one of the first things after that that I found was
*  The perjuries by Terry Melcher on the stand. I found I got access to two separate files and found that Melcher
*  Doris Dayson record producer young boy wonder who lived in the house with his girlfriend Tandy Bergen on Cielo
*  up until January 1st of
*  69 then moved to Malibu
*  And Roman and Sharon moved into the house in February
*  Melcher was the part of the motive for why the house was picked and again
*  This is getting into the weeds, but it's hard to talk about any of this without this exposition
*  Manson sent his followers up there
*  To instill fear in Melcher by killing all the occupants of his former house who were strangers to them
*  I don't believe that that's the official narrative, but
*  Melcher testified at the grand jury and then at the trial that he had three fleeting encounters with Manson one at Beach Boy Drummer
*  Dennis Wilson's
*  Two there I think and then oh no one there and then two when he went to the spawn ranch in April and May of 69
*  to listen to them play music with
*  the
*  Possible possibility of recording them and he didn't think they were talented enough and told
*  Charlie that in so many words and then again, this is the official narrative
*  That's when Manson kind of spiraled and went crazy because he'd been rejected by Terry Melcher
*  So he decided it was time for helter-skelter the race war and again a lot of these things don't add up when you step back
*  Well, why didn't he killed Terry Melcher at the house in Malibu because he knew where he had moved to why did he just go?
*  To this other place and kill strangers
*  Maybe Terry wouldn't connect at all that the bottom line was Terry on the stand and in all the official accounts of this case
*  Of which there are many not just helter-skelter but lots of books
*  His relationship with Manson ended in May of 69
*  He said he never saw him again when the murders happened at his former house
*  It never occurred to him it had anything to do with him or that Manson did it
*  I stopped believing that a month or two in and then I found these documents showing that Melcher actually had
*  Gone to see Manson twice at the spawn ranch
*  After the murders and then once all the way out at Death Valley where they had the Barker Ranch where they were hiding when they were
*  Finally captured in the fall of 69
*  Once I could document that that
*  Changed the whole I
*  Mean it didn't change but impacted the mode. I mean Melcher was a principal witness
*  Again because Charlie wasn't at the Tate house
*  Manson had our bullion see had to convict him of conspiracy in other words ordering people to go up there and kill and
*  He had to have a reason for that house of Terry provided it by saying yes
*  I did go out there and try to record them and then eventually in the question it came out
*  But I never had anything to do with them again. I had no idea
*  I never saw him or heard from him the motivation was revenge on Terry Melcher because term Terry Melcher didn't turn him into a star
*  Right, so this is what bullios he was using but it didn't make any sense
*  Right because Melcher saw him after the murder several times
*  Yeah, and not only even if it makes it didn't make sense
*  You're right
*  and that's why I think
*  Well, I think you could get away with anything then because the antics of the family at the trial and everybody was so horrified
*  But what was going on? Nobody was looking at this
*  Critically and questioning stuff because every day, you know
*  Manson and the girls were getting thrown out of the courtroom for screaming for singing for dancing for mocking the proceedings
*  So all this stayed under the radar, but once I could prove that Melcher lied and then two or three more
*  Then I knew that I had to question the entire narrative
*  So bulliosi
*  Started monitoring my interviewing. This is all laid out in the beginning of the book
*  So by the fall of the first year of 99, I got a call from one of my sources Rudy Alta Belli
*  Who was another important witness? He was the man who owned the house where the murders happened. He was traveling
*  He was traveling actually in Europe with Sharon who had come back about Sharon tape about three weeks before
*  to have her baby
*  And Rudy had told me from the very beginning
*  He was very close to Terry Dennis Wilson and the third guy Greg Jacobson. Greg Jacobson was another important witness who lied
*  Throughout the whole all of his testimony in the trial to fit a narrative that Vince needed
*  Rudy had told me that Vince called him
*  Or excuse me Terry called him and said what are you telling this O'Neil?
*  No one was supposed to know about that Vince promised me it would never come out
*  so at that point I knew that I was on to something even even bigger and then I got a call from Vince and
*  He left a message on the machine saying he wanted to talk to me. It was important
*  So I called him back and he said, you know, I'm hearing I
*  Can't remember who told me and that was another little game of his he would never be like Trump saying
*  This guy said to me or one of my friends or they say
*  The Vince that someone told me I heard that you're questioning my tactics and my choices at the trial is that true, you know
*  Tom what's what's going on here? I go. Well, you know, I'm looking at stuff and you know, you knew where this was going
*  I mean, I know we haven't taught at that point. We hadn't talked for about six weeks
*  I think he goes well, I want you to assure me that I'll be given the opportunity
*  To answer any of these questions
*  He goes because what might appear irregular to you as a lay person can be easily explained by me
*  I said, well, of course fence. I'll definitely swing back around to you before
*  He goes and I thought this was gonna be out in August and we were in like October. I think I go. Yeah
*  Yeah, I got an extension goes well, they're also saying you're doing it's a book and that you lie that it's not a magazine strike
*  Oh, no
*  No, I'm still getting paid by premiere because I was at that point and I had no idea it was gonna be a book
*  Because we're still in the first six seven months
*  so at that point I we stopped talking Vince and I and it wasn't until
*  2005 when I got my book deal that I went back to him with these questions and I thought
*  Hoped naively that I would get him to break down and say yes. This was all the CIA operation
*  I was up. Oh, no, that was stupid with me
*  but you know, I thought what else can he say when I put all this in front of him, but you know as
*  He must have been really freaked out by how deep you got into this. Yeah. Yeah
*  Well again, you've read the prologue to the book where we open in that scene in his kitchen
*  Where he's screaming and cursing at me and saying he's gonna hurt me like I've never been hurt before
*  And he's gonna sue me for hundreds of millions of dollars. It's crazy
*  Well when you get to the end of the book
*  You'll see the outcome of that day and what happened when he's begging me
*  He's saying he'll give me a quote on the cover of my book if I don't publish this stuff
*  And and then when I wouldn't agree to anything
*  Then the lawsuit threats started happening so I naively I
*  Didn't think he was gonna break down and say I was working for someone else. I had no choice, right?
*  But instead he was evasive threatening screaming denying
*  He had two recorders. I had two recorders. He's he's he went off the record every two minutes
*  So we'd have to turn off all the recorders and Vince was not turning his I'm like Vince you didn't turn yours back
*  You didn't turn it off wait and no, that's my record now, this is yours
*  So one minute he's screaming and cursing at me going do you have any idea?
*  how I will fuck you if you fucking put this in your book and then the recorders go back on but sometimes
*  They were already on because we couldn't keep up with all the off the records
*  Then when I got home that night
*  So I walk out of the house six hours exactly almost six hours. Just like the first time six years earlier
*  He's grabbing me by the arm because this isn't quid pro quo this isn't quid pro quo
*  But if you don't put this ridiculous nonsense in he goes, you know a blur from Vince
*  Well, he always referred to himself in the third person of blur from Vince bullio see on the cover this book
*  You have no idea what that does and I rarely do it. I'm very selective
*  I get asked 10 20 times a day. I mean the man's he goes you'll see that in the book
*  Then I get home that night. There's messages call me call me and he called me
*  I think it's a week week and a half almost every day the next morning a few days later trying to
*  He would bully me and then he'd say no no, you know
*  Look at what this is gonna do to my family my kids all that went on and on and on
*  So you had to be very excited by that knowing that like this is oh, yeah
*  There's no there's no reason for that guy to react like that unless you had him. I know I know and then he knew
*  Yeah, so a year. He kept not a year later
*  He said when we finally he goes at the very last phone call, which was a week and a half later
*  He goes so you're really gonna go ahead and do with this go ahead with this events
*  I'm gonna report what I have I go if you want
*  Oh at this point I'd lost the magazine deal had ended. I
*  Had sold the book so he knew I had a publisher
*  I told him who it was and he asked for my editor's name there
*  He said because I will be sending them a letter he goes. I will work on this letter for hours
*  It's gonna be a complete rebuttal of everything you argued
*  All of your arguments all your points, it's gonna ruin you they're gonna cancel your deal because they're not stupid
*  So he wrote the letter they got it and I think it was June or July
*  After February of that that year
*  2005 and I got a call from my editor. He said you got to talk to our attorneys
*  He goes we have a letter from fence. I go. Well, I told you it was coming. He goes it's insane
*  34 pages single space with 50 pages of
*  attachments and
*  He goes I've never seen anything like this
*  So he said talk talk to the attorney so they sent me over to the attorney and he said my first question
*  I'd never met the guy before he goes my first question for you O'Neill is is
*  he
*  Suffering from dementia he goes
*  I was a law student during the trial and he goes I follow that trial every day in the paper
*  I've read helter-skelter. He was brilliant. He goes I can't believe the person that wrote this letter
*  Wrote that book. So maybe you were dealing with somebody who was impaired. I said he's
*  Mentally ill and I have a lot of proof of that in the book. He it's not dementia
*  I go he's finishing his magnum opus a 20-year
*  Effort to write a book of rebutting the critics of the the Warren Commission about the Kennedy assassination
*  I always got a book coming out a tour and sure enough, you know
*  He wrote I think two or three more books after that. I go he's just I caught him
*  He goes all of his arguments don't make sense. He's contradicting himself
*  The letter goes off in the directions that it sounds like it's written by a madman
*  I go is it gonna inhibit us he goes, oh no, we're selling we're opening the champagne here
*  You I mean he wouldn't write a letter like this unless you got him. Yeah
*  Makes sense 50 pages of attachment. That was the first letter then
*  About six months later another letter. I think there were four total. I quote some of them in the book
*  it was nuts and unfortunately, he passed away in
*  2015 or 16 and I get a lot of criticism by I mean you get it from all
*  I think 74 or 5 it was cancer. I know he was sick off and on for a couple years
*  but
*  I've been accused by my critics of not publishing the book until he died because of these threats of law. No
*  I wanted him to be alive. I wanted him to be accountable and have to answer to all this
*  The reason I didn't publish it when I was gonna publish it was penguin my publisher canceled my deal in
*  2011 and then sued me for a return of the advance which crippled I couldn't
*  Well, the book was due originally in 2008 and then I'm not good with the deadlines
*  Well, it's a great book even if it took you 20 years to write it yeah, no, I mean they they extended it and then in
*  2011 they lost their patience and it was a surprise
*  Because I knew that the editor and the publisher of Penguin Press the imprint who were very serious, you know publishers very well known
*  I knew I thought that they believed in me and understood why it was still taking long
*  So when I got the call it was devastating and then even worse was a year later
*  My agent got served with papers and they took me to court
*  Well, it never got to court. It was resolved but they sued me for my advance, which was substantial and
*  I'm not allowed to say
*  anything
*  Except that it was resolved because there's non disclosures, but let's just say
*  You've helped I mean you putting me on here and the advanced stuff you get this help the sales
*  I'm still not making money because I owe a lot of people money
*  So that was crushing and it held up the book because we couldn't take it out and try to resell it
*  Until it was resolved it took about a year and a half to two years to resolve the lawsuit. Luckily
*  I got a pro bono lawyer. I was busted broke
*  and then
*  once we
*  Resolved the lawsuit was about 2016 17
*  Then we could take it out
*  But we weren't sure we were gonna be able to sell it because it had this bad history trailing me. So from
*  2011 to
*  2016 it's in limbo. Well, it is except I know I worked just as hard every single day
*  And then I was involved with a director and I kind of hint in the book who it is
*  But I mean, I don't think it's a secret Errol Morris, you know who he is. No
*  He did thin blue line. Okay. Yeah, he's won an Academy Award for a documentary made about Robert McNamara
*  So they want to make a book about the no. No, so Errol Errol Morris. I think you had a son on Hamilton Morris
*  Yes. Oh, that's the son. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hamilton was he wasn't officially part of this project, but he came to the shoots
*  Errol approached me
*  He actually is a writer for Penguin Press an author there
*  He writes books too
*  Not too often
*  But occasionally and he knew about my book because they had asked him at one point if he wanted to collaborate
*  On it with me when it was when I was struggling with it and he said no, no, I want to make a movie about it
*  And they said well, it's not a movie. It's a book maybe after so when my deal got canceled and I was in limbo
*  I thought why can't go to Errol now?
*  I'd never met him or spoken to him, but I sent him an email
*  Got his email address and he called me like the next day and he goes are you kidding me? He goes
*  I've always he goes I was fat because they he had got my proposal
*  He said I was so fascinated by this story and I've always wanted to do something on both Manson and MKUltra
*  so it took about six months of legal stuff because since my book was still
*  Owned by Penguin, but the suit was happening and he helped this process
*  He got them to allow him to work with me on what became and was gonna be a Netflix series
*  He sold it. He shot out what he called a teaser
*  So he spent two days and this was 2014 with me
*  One day at my bungalow where he wired it with like 15 cameras on remote cables in the ceilings and then interviewed me all day
*  At the house at my house and going through all my files and everything and then the next day
*  His crew took like half of my apartment to a soundstage in the valley somewhere and
*  Recreated my apartment, but then he used all his magical tricks like he had a camera
*  200 feet in the air zoom down and spin. It was beautiful what he ended up cutting and putting together
*  and then in
*  2015 he changed what he wanted to do with the documentary. It was gonna be a six-hour series
*  He had sold it and I had never signed the final contracts because I said
*  Errol you got to give me a clearer picture of what this is
*  Well at one point he decided he wanted to do the story of Frank Olson
*  With my story and Frank Olson's sons Eric's pursuit of his father's
*  possible murder by the CIA in 1954 because of what he had found out about the Korean POW
*  Biological
*  Stuff that became warm wood, which I don't know if you saw it was a Netflix series about two years ago
*  It's the last thing no, Errol. It's the second to last thing. Errol did it was his first
*  six part series
*  That happened because I backed out when you know, I didn't like the direction it was going so Errol and I fell out
*  Over that we're still friends and he gave me some pictures for the middle of the book from from the shoot
*  And he did just just Frank Olson and Eric's pursuit of it. So that took up like a year and a half of
*  working with him and his people to develop it and and then it all stopped and I actually walked away from money that
*  Would have really helped me but I you know, I
*  Was willing to give him control but I didn't like where it was going and I had already invested
*  16 years of my life at that point and I just thought I can't I can't do this
*  you know, I still need this to be my vision not somebody else's and
*  He was pretty upset and pissed off
*  but he made another good series that you know evolved out of my project and
*  And at that point it was about to 15 16
*  I just kept reporting and working to get the lawsuit resolved and then as soon as it did
*  My agent took took it out and he said before I take out this new proposal
*  I got a collaborator Dan pipe and bring young
*  Had started working with Prince on Prince's memoir and then Prince died in the middle of it and
*  because
*  Once Prince was dead all this stuff had to be settled with his estate
*  Dan had like a year of not doing anything. So our agents were the same agency
*  Put us together and at first I was apprehensive because he was like 29
*  He wasn't even alive when this happened. I thought what this kid gonna know about this case and all of this stuff that
*  Cointel Pro chaos and Kelsa I'm gonna have to teach him so much that's gonna take a year
*  But the when I met him and I saw the writing had done before like this guy is perfect and he was so we turned
*  It out in a year. Well, we took it out and and Sloan my agent said we've got a Senate to penguin first because
*  We still have that resolution that hasn't been resolved
*  I mean it's it's all agreed to but we have to finish what we have to do
*  So they need to know about it. They saw the new proposal and made us an offer for the book that not
*  Larry I know after suing me and trying to I mean doing everything to ruin my life
*  they made the first offer and it matched the the publisher we went with little brown and
*  I
*  said
*  Gosh, I'm not sure how much I'm allowed to say
*  Okay in trouble. Yeah, let's just say I
*  Said if they just give me a little bit more than little Brown's offering
*  I'll go with them because it was the same people and they knew everything
*  I wouldn't have to educate little and they wouldn't and then I said screw you guys. I'm gonna go to little brown
*  I'm really happy with what little Brown did. Well, that's a crazy route to get a book out. Yeah, I mean
*  What it was it what did it feel like when you got this like in your hand
*  It's on the bookshelves. It must have been like you gave birth. Yeah, like a giant baby. Yeah, I
*  I don't want to be over dramatic
*  But I kind of spent
*  20 years of my life doing nothing
*  but investigating this and trying to bring it to fruition and
*  There were so many setbacks and so many times that I was broke and
*  my reporting had hit a wall and I
*  Found out I'd wasted three months pursuing one angle that ended up not holding up
*  But at some point I thought what else can I do now?
*  In good faith knowing that all this stuff I've done up to this point
*  Is in the gutter, you know in the garbage I can't let that happen and I knew I had really important discoveries
*  I mean my problem was putting them all together in a cohesive way
*  With a final answer and my agent had started telling me around to that the mid 2000s
*  You know, you don't have to have resolution. You don't have to have a perfect beginning middle and end
*  You've got so much important stuff that you've uncovered about not just the murders and the trial and the corruption in Los Angeles
*  The federal government the Jolly West MK alter Cohen tell for all of this stuff
*  He goes just put all that out there, you know, and and I never really believed that and when I finally said well
*  I can't I'll do this the rest of my life and have nothing when I made that kind of
*  Decision and then took on this den my collaborator and we literally turn it around in a year
*  It was like a dream, you know
*  And then when the book was when I first got the galleys at my house and then the hardcover
*  you know a few months later at my shitty apartment in mid-city that I
*  Just I couldn't believe it and I thought right now I can get run over by a bus. I don't care because there's a document
*  It's out there now. I don't care what happens to me and it's kind of giving me it gave me a freedom because
*  Now that I've done it and it's you know on bookshelves or wherever
*  I can go on with my life
*  I had hoped to go on with my life without ever having to think about this again
*  But then of course after you get calls you get emails from people who have information
*  There's so much stuff we had to leave out of the book. It's pretty long
*  It's a lot longer than they originally gave us and then I was telling you a few days ago
*  They were only gonna give me ten pages of endnotes
*  You know that where you show all your sources at the back of the book and I fought for more and I got 60 and
*  You know, that's the most important part of the book because it shows every single document where to get it where I found it
*  I you know add a little bit more of information about why you know why it's important
*  With all that out there now
*  It's like I feel like I don't ever I don't really need to do anything ever again. I want to I don't know
*  I mean the guy
*  They know that was Jamie. I was telling there's a guy adapting it for Amazon
*  studios
*  So it could become a film who knows what's gonna happen especially or a series on Amazon like a serious
*  No, we want it. I wanted a limit. No, not it's scripted. I wanted a documentary too. You're right
*  I think about a film is this is such a long story
*  I would hate to see them butcher it where you do have friends at Amazon where you please call. I don't know anybody
*  Yeah, no, no, that's by the way
*  Well, you're pretty good at what you do they're gonna butcher it they're gonna butcher it
*  Yeah, no, I mean I wanted it to be a limited series that's the way to go
*  Yeah, yeah, and when we made the deal with them, they actually bought it before the book was written
*  They got a copy of the proposal that we had submitted to a couple of the publishers with non-disclosures
*  they somehow got it Amazon and
*  Made us an offer and this was when I was really really broke in 2017 before I mean
*  I got a little advanced from little brown
*  But let's just say a lot of that had to go to some other people that I owed money to
*  so my agent basically said, you know bottom line is Amazon is going to do a great job whatever they do with it and
*  We can't get them to commit to limited series or feature and they're leaning towards the feature if you want to say
*  I'll only do it if it's a limited series. You're risking losing it. I
*  Would say go for it and then hopefully when they get this massive book they'll say oh it has to be a limited series
*  They didn't you know, and the guys they're really still trying to do it a feature. Yeah Amazon, please
*  Yeah, the guy who's doing it. So he came to spend a week with me about an October before he began writing
*  And he's an established guy smart good done a lot of films and he's like, oh my god now
*  I know why it took you 20 years. How am I gonna fit this into two hours can't
*  Make a series. Well, that's what I said to him. I go will you go to him? You know, trust you
*  Maybe they'll hear this and maybe they'll listen because I think this can be a spectator and I'll help get put this together
*  Put it on Amazon. I'll have people in here. I'll promote it. I think this is amazing. This this story is crazy
*  Yeah, it's crazy. And I think it's also a really important part of human history
*  Imagine if the whistleblower had not come forward and we didn't know about MK ultra and and all those
*  Documents didn't get they didn't find the warehouse where the document right just imagine. Oh, yeah
*  We'd never would have known about lost like kind of say nobody in the program has ever come out and talked about it
*  I mean I went to a couple of guys who are still alive wouldn't talk to me. Of course
*  I mean they always fall back on you know
*  We signed an oath with the agency right if we talk to you without permission and they're not going to give us permission
*  We could go to prison just imagine what life must have been like for them
*  Knowing that this is what they were doing to people. Oh, yeah, it's so that's such a strange way to
*  Also, these people are agents for the federal government
*  I mean, what kind of precedent does this establish? Well, most of the people doing the research were
*  subcontracted researchers at
*  You know medical personnel at prisons and in the case of Jolly West he was first in the Air Force and then he was in
*  university settings and
*  Jolly was you know once he got to University of Oklahoma
*  He was experimenting on patients and in one of his letters to Gottlieb asking for more funding
*  He's saying working with psychiatric patients
*  actually benefits us because people can't
*  I'm
*  Not quoting directly here
*  But he was making the argument that their weird behavior wouldn't be noticed by anybody at the hospitals
*  Because they're psychiatric patients. So these people are getting
*  LSD which is a pretty powerful drug and other drugs he was using
*  And he was hypnotizing them in some of many of his experiments without without their knowledge and their psychiatric patients
*  I mean that's worse than Nazis your mind is you know, the next most important thing besides your soul and they're tampering with it
*  You know
*  One of Jolly's colleagues a guy who actually took over the department when Jolly in 69 came out to UCLA from Oklahoma
*  Said to me because I
*  Again, I would do this with people I would show them all the documents
*  And he said he always says West was one of his best friends
*  For I think 45 years when West died in 99 he said but he said to me
*  Jolly
*  It doesn't surprise me that he would have done this this is the Jack Ruby stuff
*  Which I guess you haven't gotten to yet Jolly was Jack Ruby psychiatrist. Oh Jesus
*  It's a hole that makes sense to right. Yeah Jack. Well
*  Actually, I won't spoil it for you. Jack Ruby out in the hallway. I was impressed. Yeah. Yeah
*  Well, you're gonna get to about 30 or 40 pages on Jack Ruby and Jolly West
*  I just I don't want to spoil it for you or for the listeners if they haven't read the book yet, but
*  Jolly West inserted himself into the Ruby case
*  After Ruby was convicted of shooting and killing Oswald in the spring of 64
*  Before he was gonna testify to the Warren Commission. He had never told
*  He had never testified at his trial
*  About why he he killed Oswald his defense argument was that?
*  He had epilepsy and he had had an epileptic fit and shot him and was amnesic of the of the the shooting
*  Holy shit
*  Yeah, so that fits right into the narrative like a key well this gets better so West
*  Inserts and pull that microphone out towards your face. Oh, sorry. It's all right
*  So what's just you're getting to this? Yeah
*  Yeah move
*  So West inserts himself into the case gets a sign through his connections to Ruby's new lawyer
*  You Bert Winston Smith who's a whole other kettle of fish. But anyway
*  Goes to the Dallas County jail in I think was April of 64 to examine Ruby in preparation for
*  Not the Warren Commission testimony, which he was giving in a couple months before his next trial because he had gotten a new an appeal
*  for a psychiatric review and
*  West who had told Sydney Gottlieb in these early letters from the 50s that part of his experiments were
*  inducing insanity and a person without their awareness
*  West goes to examine Ruby
*  emerges from the county jail and there's press waiting for him and he announces that within the preceding 48 hours
*  Ruby had had a
*  Psychotic break that was irrevocable
*  It couldn't he couldn't return to sanity. He had audio and visual
*  Hallucinations during the exam
*  He said Ruby hid under a table because he thought there were people in the room trying to kill him
*  told West that he could hear children's screams outside his jail cell as
*  Jewish children as they were boiled alive and West said he's completely insane
*  That was
*  The day I mean there was no evidence of Ruby being mentally ill
*  Prior to West's exam West was along with him in the cell and then treated him for about six months
*  When Ruby finally gave his testimony to the Warren Commission, so
*  Earl Warren Chief Justice Warren who was head of the Commission flew down to Dallas with
*  Gerald Ford who was
*  In Congress and on the Commission and Arlen Specter the young Arlen Specter who was an investigator for the Warren Commission who eventually came up with
*  the Magic Bullet
*  Theory he called it the Magic Bullet
*  conclusion anyway, the three of them
*  You know put Ruby under oath and
*  Ruby babble was incoherent
*  Grabbed Arlen Specter who was like him Jewish and he said don't you know they're killing Jews
*  And and they've killed my brother and cut off his legs. I hear them being tortured outside myself. They couldn't use anything
*  West that was one of his objectives in his MKL to research was to make people
*  Induce insanity without a person's awareness
*  Was there any contact with Jack Ruby before he killed that was again that was one of the things I can't tell you how hard
*  You know, oh you mean West or you mean Weston Ruby?
*  Anyone that could have done something to get Oswald to kill Ruby. No Ruby to kill Oswald. Ruby to kill Oswald.
*  Ruby. Yeah, Ruby had a lot of
*  connections to organized crime and federal he was part of
*  Which later emerged the anti-castro
*  Cuban effort to overthrow Fidel Castro, which was run
*  It was operation mongoose by the CIA. It was an illegal assassination program
*  Ruby denied being in it and that's in the book. I found out that
*  again through West's papers that I got access to Ruby admitted never that he
*  Stalked and killed Oswald on the orders
*  Of anyone but that he was working with these people to get rid of the people
*  He was working with these people who were suspected of being involved in the assassination if there was a conspiracy
*  And he had never admitted that to anyone. It's only in West's file and West withheld that so let's break that down
*  So for people that don't know the the the primary theory of who was responsible if there was a conspiracy
*  to kill Kennedy and
*  one of the thoughts was that it had to do with some sort of a CIA
*  Operation to overthrow Castro. Yeah, well there was so the Warren Commission concluded
*  That Oswald acted alone. There was no conspiracy Alan Dulles Dulles the former head of the CIA who was fired
*  by John F. Kennedy
*  Was second in command to judge Warren and the commission
*  Richard Helms who was actually jolly west employer for mk ultra
*  Was the liaison between the CIA and the commission so Helms knew that
*  Ruby who they called their most important witness in their investigation the Warren Commission investigation because he was the one who silenced the killer
*  There could be no trial for Oswald because he was dead
*  So they tried to learn everything they could about uh ruby to see if he had had any meetings with
*  Oswald prior or if he had connections
*  Beyond the superficial ones to organize crime was there something deeper?
*  The commission which I believe was you know
*  A joke from the beginning it was set to determine. I mean they said in the beginning their objective was to prove that Oswald acted alone
*  They came up with that conclusion
*  but after the first intelligence senate intelligence hearings in this in the
*  Early 70s that exposed mk ultra chaos co-intel pro
*  primarily the the frank church hearings
*  They found out that Dulles and helms and others had lied about the CIA's
*  involvement with Oswald and and with their own agents who had had these
*  peripheral
*  We don't know if they were peripheral or not, but definitely encounters with Oswald
*  They withheld all that so the house voted to have what they call the house select committee on assassinations that began in 77
*  In 78 they released their report which they concluded. There was a probable conspiracy to kill
*  Kennedy that Oswald didn't act alone and you know, it's there's lots of books about that
*  Yeah, uh and in their findings and then later the two the head of the committee
*  Robert blakely wrote a book where he said that that ruby had acted on behalf of
*  The conspiracy to silence Oswald that he had stalked him
*  premeditated the murder and
*  That the whole thing was part of of keeping the secret
*  So was west a part of that?
*  You know again, I can't prove it. I wanted to find out if west had had any encounter or any
*  You know interaction with ruby
*  Prior to ruby committing the murder couldn't find that and that's the kind of thing that
*  Maybe there's no evidence. Maybe it happened, but there's no evidence, but I wasn't gonna
*  put it in the book, uh, and
*  I exhausted every resource I had, you know
*  Because that that one has always been so puzzling for me because here's this guy that's not connected to the murder allegedly
*  And then steps forward and shoots oswald in front of everybody
*  Yeah sentencing himself. I mean like there's no doubt about it. You're the guy who did it
*  Everyone saw it you're gonna go to jail forever. Why would you do that? Well the first report which was
*  Fabricated by his first lawyer who admitted this years and years later
*  Uh, he told ruby to say he did it to spare jackie kennedy from having to come to dallas for a trial of oswald
*  Yeah, that was made up made no sense. And then melvin bella. I was
*  Assigned to the case was I mean ruby fired like three lawyers in the first couple weeks then
*  Melvin bella I took over and took it to trial and his argument was that he had had an epileptic fit
*  And didn't know what he was doing and when he was grabbed by the cops after he shot oswald. He said hey, i'm jack ruby
*  What what am I doing here? What are you doing to me? Don't you know who I am? Because he knew all the cops
*  Um
*  My argument in my book is it's important
*  My most important finding is that a cia contracted agent
*  Or researcher for mind control
*  Became the most important witness to the warren commission
*  He became that witness's doctor right before he testified and told his story
*  I go that should have been disclosed obviously to the commission, but they're not going to say it because it's a secret program
*  And then he goes crazy and then he goes crazy
*  I got told by a couple of the people who were
*  Nobody on the commission would talk to me that was alive when I started pursuing them. I'm jolt ford wouldn't talk to me
*  Uh, arlen specter. I think I mentioned that to you before there's an interesting
*  I approached arlen specter who was running for reelection. This was 2002
*  And told him I had new information
*  And he had all he had always maintained, you know, he would he he made a lot of money off of his
*  books about um
*  Justice and and the magic, you know defending his magic bully bullet theory
*  He always said if anybody comes to me with new evidence, i'll look at it with an open mind
*  So I had sent him a persuasive letter. Well his people
*  Uh, they finally said all right if you have these documents showing that this doctor
*  Who treated ruby, you know and within the 24 hours he lost his mind
*  Uh specter will look at them and then decide if he'll talk to you fax him to us
*  And at that point that was 2002. I had lost the magazine story and I didn't have a book deal
*  So I was operating entirely on my own
*  I said I can't send this stuff to you because it's my smoking gun the letters between goth leib and and west describing all
*  the experiments
*  so finally
*  Specter agreed to talk to me on the phone for a few minutes and it was amazing
*  He called me from the senate floor while they were waiting to vote on whether or not they were going to invade iraq. This was 2002
*  Oh shit
*  So we were only supposed to talk for a few minutes and when I explained what I had and what it showed west had
*  You know been involved with at the time he treated ruby
*  He said well if you're not going to send this stuff to me, I don't know, you know
*  I need to see it and I go well, I can't send it to you and he said well you want to meet me
*  Because I told him I was in philadelphia visiting my folks and he he was from philadelphia, too
*  He says i'm there in the weekend. I'll meet you saturday. I have a squash game at the windham hotel. Meet me there christ squash
*  So we had a meeting set up
*  uh for like three days later and
*  This is something i'm always second-guessing about I made a decision
*  I don't think I got two. I don't think I ever really got paranoid during this but
*  Specter had been a long-term senator. He was running for reelection and it was the first time in his career
*  But the polls were against him that his opponent
*  Was uh, they were predicting that he was going to specter was going to lose
*  Uh, he had also, you know defended this magic bullet theory forever
*  I mean more people knew him for the kennedy assassination than anything else
*  I thought so if I do meet with him and I show him these documents, maybe it was grandiose to me, too
*  I thought he's going to go. Oh my god
*  I need to
*  Be part of their you know exposure because if he didn't
*  And walked away from it. I thought they were important enough
*  That he would know that that would you know, once they were publicized and he had the opportunity to say hey
*  We need to look into this and didn't he would look bad. So then I thought well, maybe he's gonna
*  Two things he's either going to use it
*  for uh to get publicity have a press conference and help him in his reelection or
*  He's going to use it to be the hero of it and
*  Run with it before I published a book and then i'll just be a footnote, you know to all this because he took it
*  So I canceled the meeting the morning of
*  I called up his press secretary
*  And his cell phone like the three phones I had for him and I said you have to tell senator specter
*  I am so sorry, but there's an emergency. I've got to go back to los angeles
*  I actually was scheduled to go the day after on sunday
*  So it was a lie and I didn't talk to anyone. I just left the message and I said i'm so sorry
*  But I obviously i've worked so hard to get this meeting. It's embarrassing, but I have to go back
*  So, um, I left my parents place
*  To go to the post office because I had been there for three months
*  I was actually writing the first version of the proposal at their place to get away from my friends and you know
*  all the distractions in la
*  And I was only going for like 15 minutes. I go mom if that press secretary calls
*  I told him I was leaving so tell him that I'm I just went to the airport and I and I apologize
*  And she goes well, I can't lie to a press secretary. I got to so I go to the post office and I come home
*  15 minutes later and she's like as white as a ghost. I go what and she goes
*  Senator specter called I go you mean the press secretary because no he called himself
*  He wanted to know what happened why you changed your mind and why you were canceling and I had to lie to him
*  I don't lie. I go but I lied to the senator, you know, he was a big deal in pennsylvania back then and so
*  I don't know if that was a mistake on my part. I think you know 2020 hindsight
*  I should have done it and taken my chances
*  I did go knows what he would have done. I know that's a very powerful man
*  And if he thought that he was in danger, yeah, you could have fucking driven off a cliff
*  I never I mean, I really didn't try to think like that through all those years. I thought like that
*  When it comes to arlen specter, I mean, do you know how deep that guy had to be in on that to come up with that?
*  Wacky magic
*  That theory is so bad
*  The fact that that actually gets debated and the fact that never gets brought up that there were more bullet fragments in connelly's body
*  Than there were missing from that bullet
*  Yeah
*  And the fact that anyone who knows anything about guns right any anyone who's ever shot a gun has seen what a bullet
*  Bullet shatters bone what it looks like would look at that fucking bullet and think that bullet went through two human beings
*  Right, right
*  And the fact that the reason why they had to make up this theory in the first place was because a guy was hit
*  By a ricochet on the underpass. Yeah, you know the whole story behind that. Well, here's what I did
*  I tried not to lose myself any more than I had to in each
*  Compartmentalized area I was going into so with the kennedy assassination. I just did a
*  Superficial because like manson I was never interested in any thing so-called conspiracies
*  Yeah, I had never cared about kennedy or the john f kennedy assassination
*  But once I found out that west was connected to ruby and again that was a moment that I was like, oh no
*  I mean first it was west in the cia and then i'm like and ruby
*  How can I not look at the kennedy assassination?
*  So I kept my focus narrowly just on ruby oswald west specter
*  I looked a little bit of the magic bullet and agree with you
*  But I never did a deep dive into a lot of that stuff
*  Well, they had to come up with that theory because there was a guy who was hit under the underpass
*  He was hit by a fragment or no bullet hit the curb and it the a piece of the curb hit him
*  So he had been injured and they recovered that bullet and they realized that that had been a shot that had to hit that area
*  And so then they had to attribute all of those wounds
*  To one bullet, right? So they had different bullets. They had the bullet that was the head shot
*  They had the bullet that hit the curb and then all the other injuries had to be attributed to one bullet
*  Yeah, not only that there's a different description of the frontal shot
*  There's a shot when kennedy you see kennedy grabbing his neck, right?
*  Well in the hospital in dallas
*  It's described as a frontal shot when they fly the corpse to bethesda, maryland. They describe it as a trach hole
*  Yeah, i've read some of that. Yeah, so much. There's so much of that the missing brain. Yes
*  Then on top of that the bulliose
*  Writes a book. I know to justify the findings of the warring commission
*  There's a great book called best evidence by david lifton and that book got me down a dark road
*  When I was in my 20s, that's what got me
*  really freaked out about conspiracy theories in the first place because I
*  I would always thought that conspiracy theories were for dull-minded people that didn't spend much time thinking or reading
*  You know, they just like they'd like to think that there was a bunch of people just controlling everything. Well, I was the same way
*  Well, then you find out about mk ultra and operation midnight climax and all this different shit you know
*  This is real this is definitely real yeah, like what and then it makes sense like there's video footage of I believe it's uh,
*  I think it's british soldiers where they dosed them up with acid and sent them out into this field
*  Have you ever seen that video? I have not seen that see if you can find that jamie. There's uh video footage of soldiers on acid
*  And this is like archived footage of uh, black and white they did experiments on these soldiers in the 1950s
*  Yeah, they had been doing it for a while. I mean once hoffman
*  Had figured out how to make lsd and they realized what it could do to people
*  They didn't know here it is watch this following footage from 1964 experiment testing the effects of lsd on british marines
*  You can see it on you don't have to turn around too. It's on this screen right here. So this is in uh,
*  What did it say 1962? Is that what it said 64 64? There is december of 64
*  So these guys are uh all wandering around on acid
*  Jesus and so they they
*  Dosed them up and then they send these poor fuckers out in the field and they're just freaking out and they don't know what's going on
*  Where'd you find this? Oh, this is online. Yeah. Yeah, you could you could it's on uh, it's on youtube
*  Yeah, but look at these guys just laughing and giggling these soldiers lying on the ground laughing hysterically covering their eyes and it's all
*  Archived footage. Wow. I don't want you to play it now, but is there volume or is it all silent?
*  Probably a little volume. Yeah, yeah, don't remember any volume, but look they're climbing trees and shit
*  Yeah, so this is
*  Archived footage. Yeah, right. This is they knew what they were doing to these people and then they filmed them
*  And this is what they got from imperial war museum in london original footage
*  Well, if we have films like that from our government, you're not going to see them, of course
*  They were if they weren't destroyed. They're locked up. I mean that was another big eye opener for what's kept from us. Um
*  At one point in 2011. I had a researcher at the washington post a woman there who has been there for years
*  I could get myself in trouble for this too. I won't say her name
*  But anyway, she's very well known and she's their intelligence
*  researcher she works with all of the reporters at the post on intelligence stories national security stories and she had a
*  someone at the
*  CIA in their information department who would confirm or deny stuff with her and she said I completely trust these people
*  I've been working with them for 10 years
*  I'll ask them about uh, jolly west and see what they have on them and I said all right before you ask them
*  Don't tell them because she had the documents. I'd share them with her
*  Don't tell them what I have proving that he was part of mk ultra
*  Just say you're working with an author on a book who wants to know whether they're because I already done a request
*  And I got we can neither confirm nor deny. Yeah
*  And she said they don't they'll tell me the truth like they're not going to give me another confirm or deny
*  We'll just say we have something and we can't tell you if we can or we have nothing
*  But we'll get the truth to see what they have
*  So a week later, she lets me know and she said
*  They said there's nothing he never participated in the program. There's no record and I go well
*  I don't want to say her name
*  I go well, I don't think you should be using them anymore because they're not reliable and you know that because you've seen the documents
*  So she had to rethink that. I don't know, you know what she did after well, that's that's the way they can
*  Embed themselves with reporters by letting these reports. I'm your friend. Look, i'll tell you the truth, right?
*  Okay, this is it's a complicated world. We're out there trying to keep people safe
*  Sometimes we gotta crack a few eggs to make an omelet, right? But uh, don't worry. I'll let you know
*  I mean i'm your friend. Don't worry if there's some wackiness i'll tell you. Yeah, that's hilarious
*  Yeah, and then I said to her
*  Ask about uh, oh reeve woods and we haven't even discussed reeve woods and um
*  He's the guy that claimed who he had infiltrated the manson family
*  Oh, you haven't gotten to that chapter. No, no, no, no is that after 11? How many chapters are there?
*  13 including the epilogue
*  Yeah, yeah
*  Yeah, I mean there were a lot of
*  Spooky people in and around the spawn ranch and in and around the family and this one guy
*  reeve witson who who um was a spook and
*  Unfortunately was dead by the time I started for people don't know spook is cia. Yeah. Yeah
*  Some people don't know what that means
*  Yeah, I I didn't know what it meant before I started all this
*  I don't you know, I mean maybe if I thought about it, but I wasn't interested in strange terminology. I know
*  Yeah, well, it's like a ghost. You don't see them. There's no trace no record and this guy
*  That's how he lived and I had found out about him in my reporting
*  First I got to his attorney and then to some of his close friends. He lived in los angeles and then he disappeared for months
*  Uh doing undercover work and he said we never he wouldn't even tell us who he worked for
*  But his wife and daughter who were in sweden and other people who said it was the cia
*  He told before he died in a couple years before his death three or four of his closest friends including his attorney
*  That he had worked on an operation
*  And he wouldn't tell them who but he had infiltrated the the manson family prior to the murders
*  And it was his dying regret was he could have prevented them but didn't
*  He also said that he was at the crime scene
*  After the killers had left but before the police had arrived which was like a four or five hour window
*  And I was able to confirm not that he was there those five hours
*  But that he was missing and that the police set up a watch at his father's house who he was living with to try to
*  Figure out what was going on
*  He ended up helping
*  Colonel tate sharon tate's father who left his job in military intelligence to
*  Help the police and the investigation he even dressed up like a hippie, right? He dressed up like a hippie and so did rebe
*  And rebe was a really hardcore right wing guy. I mean he was uh racist and and um
*  His daughter sent me pictures of him and she said once he died
*  In fact, this is how serious this guy was he divorced reed divorced his wife who was a swedish model
*  First he sent her and his infant daughter back to sweden
*  From the united states in 61 because he thought there was going to be nuclear war
*  uh, and then
*  In the mid 60s. He told his wife he had a divorcer
*  And he couldn't have any relationship with his daughter because his daughter was his only vulnerability because of the work he did
*  That would be how they heard even if they lived all the way in sweden
*  So the daughter lisa who i've never met but we started talking on the phone and she started sending me materials
*  Didn't meet him until a couple years before his death. He reached out to her
*  Said I couldn't
*  Have any relationship with you because of my work, but I want to do that now so he flew to los angeles
*  Introduced her to all of his friends
*  And after he died she went to his apartment and went through his things
*  And found a picture of him dressed up as a hippie. It's in the book and uh,
*  And I mean it's hard to tell but it's in a parking lot and the cars are all like late 60s models
*  so um
*  Again, this is one of the parts of the book where I work so hard to try to prove a definite link
*  I interviewed probably 12 or 13 mencin family members and i'd show them that picture
*  And they'd say he looked like any number of guys that that came in and out of there
*  They come for a day to screw us the women would say
*  Uh charlie would bring guys in and we didn't know if they were the ones who were providing drugs or who they were but
*  Yeah, maybe or maybe not, you know, and they were all high most of the time, too
*  You got to think that charlie's ability to constantly get out of jail
*  Also must have added to his delusions of grandeur because he felt like he was above the law because he really kind of was
*  Yeah, when the sheriff would go under the spawn ranch he would threaten that he'd say i've got guys in the hills with guns pointed at you
*  Yeah, and that's all in the book and i've got the document, uh in the notes
*  And he would give he would give everyone acid and then either take a very low dose himself or none at all pretend
*  Yeah, yeah, so do you think that this was something obviously we're in speculation again, but something that he learned how to do from smith
*  That's the question. Um
*  what what david smith and roger smith were looking at was
*  Personality change lasting effects of lsd on the personality and especially david did
*  Something he called it the psychedelic syndrome
*  He did this study
*  He was the one who ran the clinic and it basically gave jolly west an office at the clinic to recruit people in the summer of
*  67 and then roger
*  he um
*  Gave him office space there to contuck what he called the amphetamine research project in 68 and 69
*  Uh at the period that he was still you know
*  he was
*  They called him the friendly fed in the hate because everybody knew he was a federal government person
*  But he grew his hair longer and grew a mustache to try to blend in but everybody thought he was a narc and I guess he was
*  um, but david's line of work, uh after his
*  Mice research which people can read about in the book and mice and violence
*  Uh was trying to figure out why some people were more susceptible
*  to lsd
*  Uh and having a personality change they were doing they would screen people that this was volunteer testing
*  allegedly
*  For personality traits. They were trying to find out whether people have precipitating
*  factors
*  Uh in their subconscious
*  They were actually doing chromosomal studies too taking blood and seeing how the lsd affect the chromosomes
*  and why some people would
*  After one trip have a complete ideological, uh change they would go from being, you know
*  normal teenagers or 20 year olds to all of a sudden
*  believing in mystical stuff and uh losing the ego and all the kind of stuff that manson was trying to find when he was
*  Attracting followers who were more susceptible who were more suggestible and that was the research that they were doing at the clinic at the time
*  Another finding in the book and I wasn't the first one to find it, but I found more evidence of it
*  The clinic famously opened it was non-profit
*  And it was funded by the government and and david smith admitted that he took funds and that's one of the reasons he gave
*  He told me he gave jolly an office there was jolly was well known
*  In the research community. He knew that jolly would attract government funding
*  But they were only supposed to be a service to runaway kids and hippies and people who couldn't afford health care
*  They weren't supposed to be doing research. They weren't supposed to be doing experiments, but they were
*  the entire time
*  So it was it was sold as a non-profit health care facility when it was actually
*  A research center for the federal government
*  And this is interesting and this could you know, people might think i'm crazy, but it raises questions my book came out in
*  june last june of 2019 the clinic was open from
*  uh june of 67
*  It closed in
*  September of last year. I think it was it shut its doors for the first time in 50
*  No, 52 years three months after my book came out. Yeah
*  And that's one of the biggest disappointments of the book is you know, because I couldn't answer the question the bit the largest questions
*  I could only present
*  You know a case for why it sure looked like it might have happened this way that way the other way
*  um
*  I was hoping that it would be kind of a call to action, you know that other people
*  Would pick up the ball
*  And run with it, you know
*  And again, maybe it was my naivety my grandiosity. Hold on a second, man. It took you 20 years
*  Why are you on a rush for these people to take up the ball?
*  I wanted some serious journalists, especially in the cities where these things took place
*  I mean I exposed some pretty serious
*  corruption in the da's office in
*  1969 and one of the until the oj trial the biggest trial in the history of the united states, you know the one
*  They got more coverage than any other trial until oj
*  And I can prove that it was fixed from the very beginning when they switched the lawyers and and planted evidence and perjury and stuff
*  Like that a former prosecutor in charge of sharon tate or excuse me of charge of
*  Susan ackins, yeah without her. Yeah, and they fired her defense her legally appointed attorney
*  So I brought in someone who would play ball. Yeah
*  And I have the documents and they went to a judge who was complicit who agreed to this and I found all these
*  Documents in a file that I wasn't supposed to have access to at the sheriff's office
*  But I got in the back door through some of the retired guys that got sick of me bugging them for information
*  But I thought somebody from the la times would do it, you know a follow-up, you know, just go to verify
*  Confirm or refute my allegations. They gave me a pretty la times gave the book a pretty good review, but I know stories
*  I thought there'd be news stories. Maybe I was stupid maybe now
*  Maybe san francisco. I mean there hasn't been a story on
*  You know the fact that the clinic closed three months after david smith is still alive roger smith still alive
*  um
*  What about what are they?
*  I don't want to say what roger has talked to either one of them
*  No since that was the other thing we were sure we were going to get lawsuits
*  You know little brown was braced for it. I mean when bullio si he was already dead when I sold it to them
*  So they weren't so much worried about his family. Although his family
*  They did say, you know
*  We could be sued by his family because they own helter skelter and they could argue that you diminish the value of helter skelter
*  Which I hope I did and I'd love to have that argument in court
*  not a word, but
*  There are you know a dozen principal people in that book
*  Many of them not public figures like roger smith david smith to an extent is because he became very well known
*  Not one of them has either threatened a lawsuit
*  Contacted me the publisher
*  Uh, I defamed a lot of people and I think again, thank god
*  I've got the 60 pages of notes because I think they know they can't argue the points that i'm making everything I have exposed is
*  Documented that's why I was so careful about not putting speculation in the book about not putting stuff in there that I hadn't substantiated
*  Or corroborated. Well, I don't think the book made a big enough splash for them. Help me man
*  We're helping you right now. Thank you. Thank you. That's what I think
*  I mean if I had a guess also the fact that they can't refute any of the facts
*  Yeah, it's probably better to just let it die and in today's news cycle things go in and out in a period of days
*  Like who killed epstein? He didn't kill himself
*  Yeah, right boom gone. No one cares anymore. Covid 19. Oh, Jesus
*  Is it from a lab? It might have been oh and it ends it just keeps going on and on and on
*  No one's going to think about who killed charles manson today. We're worried about uh, quarantining and yeah
*  I mean that was a tarantino's movie came out and there were a ton
*  There's tons of press on on the family members. Where are they now this or that and again?
*  I maybe I was just stupid thinking my book it's all okay
*  You know, I got a lot of good reviews a lot of good response
*  But it didn't do what I wanted it to do which was to make a change
*  It didn't have enough publicity tom. I didn't know about it. I didn't hear about until greg greg told me about it with wild eyes
*  Greg fitzsimmons, I should say my good friend introduced and your good friend introduced me to the the thing
*  And greg is not a person who pitches things to me. So when he pitched it to me
*  Yeah, and he pitched it to me full-throated. I was like, whoa, he's like dude. It's fucking crazy
*  And then I got into it for the record best guy in the world fits
*  He's at the end of the book, but he's pissed off because I didn't name him
*  I just talked I identify him as a neighbor who came and consoled me at a really bad point and gave me some good advice
*  So when you get to the end of the book and i'm the neighbor comes by walking his two little stupid dogs
*  And asked me to ask me to if I want to come along and he gave me
*  I mean he's younger than I am and he gave me like a dad pep talk about hanging in there. He's great
*  I love him to death. He's the best. Yeah
*  when the book came out
*  And no one did try to sue you or no one did come after you
*  Were you concerned that maybe it hadn't gotten the push that you felt like the subject deserved? Yeah
*  Yeah, I mean
*  I was happy because i've never published a book before
*  And they had a team assigned to it at the publishers and you know
*  We got I mean we got a lot of publicity, but we didn't get news making publicity
*  I think part of the problem tom is that it's a deep book. Yeah, it's dense
*  You got to get into it to really piece all like yeah
*  There's a couple of times where I had to go back over things and like try to piece it together and like
*  There's a lot going on and a lot of people to follow
*  I know I know we were gonna put a character list up at the front. That's great. Listen, it's
*  Worth doing. Yeah. Yeah, the the juice is worth the squeeze
*  Yeah, when you get to the I mean where i'm at just beginning chapter 11
*  You're just like holy fucking shit. Yeah. Yeah, it's yeah, it was frustrating and um
*  Again, I mean the bottom line for me was i'm just so happy
*  It's out there in the public realm because that would have been I can't imagine dying with this
*  Either being sent into a dumpster somewhere. Nobody's seeing this stuff because I think a lot of it is important
*  Well, you were pregnant for 20 years. That's what yeah
*  I don't have any kids. So yeah, that's a good analogy. He gave birth. Yeah
*  So now let me ask you this what what is the speculation in terms of bulliose's connection? Was he given a narrative?
*  Was did did do you think that they
*  Yeah, I want to answer that. Yeah, so this is
*  All right. I'll start without the speculative part something I can prove. Okay. He was compromised when he was given this case in 1969
*  It's in the book. He
*  Oh gosh, I mean he has family out there, but they know about this
*  He was involved in a couple cases the first one before the trial
*  That are crazy. I mean when you see the stuff that happened between him and I
*  You know all those years later. It makes sense when you see what he was like before he became famous. So in
*  1965 he had his first child vincent bulliose jr
*  He decided
*  That he wasn't the father that the milkman was a father and back in those days
*  You're too young to know people used to deliver milk to homes. Yeah, I remember hearing about it
*  Yeah, so he believed that the milkman was a father. He was an up-and-coming
*  Deputy district attorney in los angeles
*  And for about I think 12 or 16 months he stalked his milkman
*  Trying to get him to take a blood test
*  To prove that he fathered his wife's child. Jesus christ. It got so bad that they had to
*  They stopped letting their kids take the bus home from school. They had two young kids
*  They didn't know who he was. He wouldn't tell them who he was. All he would say was
*  I was on the milkman had left the job
*  A month after his wife found out she was pregnant vince's wife vince and his
*  Delirium decided that he was fired because he had gotten
*  You know clients are people he delivered milk to pregnant so he was writing them anonymous letters
*  Following the kids. I actually this is one thing I did here. I heard from the little girl who's now a grown woman
*  Read about this in my book and she sent me a letter and she goes you only got half of it
*  He said he terrorized us. He said my father she said my father the milkman had a nervous breakdown
*  She said he came to my school and picked me up and and he took me to a toy store
*  Bought all these toys for me whatever I wanted brought me to the house and he had a driver
*  And he left me at the end of the driveway. My mom came out and I was like so happy
*  I was like five or six years old. I had all these gifts and she goes get into the house get into the house
*  So what happened was vince got caught. I mean he eventually
*  Was stalking them he sent his wife
*  To the house to beg
*  The milkman's wife to get her husband to do a paternity test
*  And i've got all this from all these civil depositions when it came when the milkman sued him later
*  So vince the the milkman eventually got his brother-in-law
*  To follow vince from one of his stakeouts vince would put the car outside the house
*  He sent them letters like they changed their phone number. He goes
*  I noticed you changed your phone number. That wasn't nice. I mean nuts. So the the milkman followed vince
*  Or his brother-in-law. They got the plate number found out who he was and that he was at the da's office
*  Called his personal attorney and the personal attorney called vince and they had a meeting
*  Between vince the milkman the milkman's wife and mrs. Bouliosi and vince
*  Admitted that he had been stalking them because he thought it was a bad thing
*  Admitted that he had been stalking them because he thought it was his wife. He had used da's investigators
*  Calling this guy a material witness in a in a murder case to follow him get information private information on they
*  So vince said he would pay them 100
*  And never do it again and the milkman said we don't want your money. Just never bother us again. So
*  That was all about the end of 68 early 69
*  The da's office knew about this. He should have been fired immediately
*  Instead he gets the biggest case at that point in the history of los angeles the tate la bianca trial
*  This is where we get speculative you have a guy like vince who's compromised. He'll do
*  What the hires up tell him to do and if you read in the book evill younger was a district attorney at the time
*  He was a shady guy who'd been in the oss which was the predecessor to the cia
*  trained in espionage
*  I won't say too much. It's in the book. That's where we get speculative
*  If vince was answering for something
*  The explanation is because he didn't go into this case clean. He had to do what he was told
*  That makes all the sense in the world, yeah after the tate la bianca convictions
*  In 74 helter skelter came out the book and to this day
*  It's the best-selling true crime book of all time
*  And it's a wonderfully written book. I mean I could
*  Take you page by page and show you stuff that's completely fabricated and made up and that contradicts the real record
*  But you know best seller and that same year
*  Vince was going to run for
*  district attorney
*  and the milkman and
*  His wife had never told anyone I guess outside of their family what had happened four or five years before
*  But when they saw that vince was trying to be the most powerful law and first person in the city of los angeles
*  They went to his opponent and said you need to know this this man cannot get this job
*  So they told the opponent and they had a press conference
*  So the milkman and his wife
*  went public
*  Vince responded by having his own press conference and telling the reporters
*  Here's here's what happened the milkman
*  We believe stole three hundred dollars in cash from our kitchen table when he was on the route
*  So I was just doing a personal investigation
*  And the reporter said well, did you hire? I mean, did you contact the pasadena police?
*  He goes no. No, I just wanted to do it on my own and then as other
*  People pointed out later
*  He was doing this this was 65 he was doing through the end of 68 the statute of limitations
*  on
*  Theft burglary robbery is three years. It would be he even if he found out that he had stolen the three dollars
*  Uh, they would have been able to prosecute it. So the whole thing was alive vince lied to the media
*  Uh, and he lost so then he lost that election then he ran again after helter-skelter
*  Skelter came out for attorney general of california
*  At that point the milkman and the the wife were going to go public again and say hey
*  We have even more to tell about this which is I think is what the daughter wants to tell me
*  She actually hasn't gotten in touch with me after the first email
*  I said I want to hear what you have and she said she has all these documents but um
*  Then a woman named virginia cardwell
*  Said she was going to go public, too
*  um
*  She came out and said uh, excuse me
*  after
*  Vince told the world that the milkman had stolen three hundred dollars for him
*  The milkman and his wife filed a civil suit against vince
*  And gail his wife because gail also publicly said with vince in an interview that that's the truth
*  It was all about this petty theft. They sued them for defamation
*  And they settled and vince paid them. I think it was
*  $12,000 in cash and hundred dollar bills
*  And you know part of the agreement was they weren't allowed to talk about it
*  They couldn't say they'd gotten any money and he would only give it in cash so they couldn't trace it to him
*  I ended up getting all the documents. It took a long time, but I got them
*  Then when they went public again when he was running for attorney general they were subject to you know being in violation of that
*  But they said he can't
*  You know then we'll tell everything he doesn't want to tell he lied under oath and deposition so did his wife about the stalking
*  So in 73 vince had an affair with a woman named virginia cardwell
*  Virginia cardwell was catholic. She got pregnant
*  She told vince that she was pregnant with his child and then said she had to get an abortion and she said I can't get an abortion
*  I'm a catholic. She was a single mother
*  He said he would set it up. He had a doctor
*  uh, it was still illegal then and uh, he he gave her the money to pay the doctor and then
*  He called her and she said she had gotten the abortion. Everything was fine. Then he called the doctor
*  Violating HIPAA rules the doctor said actually i've never heard from this woman. I didn't give her the procedure
*  So vince went to her house and beat the hell out of her
*  And uh, i've got all those depositions, too
*  uh, he he just
*  According to her story to the police because she she reported it
*  He dragged her across the hair about the floor by the hair sat in her and punched her and punched her again in the face
*  Told her she had to get an abortion
*  She miscarried after that episode. She went she went to the santa monica police as soon as he left and reported it
*  And nobody would have known about it, but a reporter saw it on the you know, the police wire service or whatever
*  So the next day it was on the front page of all the la papers that vince bullioci had been accused of a battery
*  Of a woman who said that he wanted her to have an abortion and she wouldn't
*  So vince went to the police told them she was lying
*  She was a a client that he had had one phone consultation with never met her face to face
*  And she was trying to embarrass him because he wanted her to pay him two or three hundred dollars
*  He defamed her like he did
*  The milkman he he made up a story
*  And worse this time he told that to the police
*  This was in their investigation of the battery. He lied to the police
*  That it had not happened but here's what happened the next day
*  After the newspapers reported it and vince said it was a lie and and he told the police that
*  Vince went back to her apartment with his secretary and a typewriter
*  And he held her hostage, I know this sounds crazy. It's in the book at the end
*  Held her hostage for I think three or four hours
*  Begging her and then bullying her and he might have hit her then too
*  I can't remember to go to the police and say that she had made the whole story up
*  His secretary was there because once he got her to agree to it do it
*  She wrote up backdated bill the bill for the money
*  Uh and had virginia sign it
*  So virginia finally agreed to go to the police. He said look you're going to be charged with filing a false report
*  Which is a felony. Well, it's a misdemeanor, but it could go to a felony and you but I can take care of all that
*  I've got the connections to the da's office in santa monica, which he did and he did take care of it
*  so
*  She called up
*  The santa monica police department to say she was coming in
*  To report that she had made the story up because she was angry about this money
*  and
*  The cop said right away. He knew that something was wrong in the tremor of her voice
*  He said we'll come get you and vince was on the other line and she's going no no
*  He's saying no. No, no, they can't come here. So she said no, no, no i'm coming and they said, okay
*  We'll see you when you get here and then they dispatched two cops to her apartment
*  Now this had never been public before I found it it did become public about what happened vince got away with
*  Denying it the cop that went to to see what was going on and to get her guy named michael landis
*  He was retired in santa monica. I got his name from the reports. He said oh, yeah, vince was at the house
*  He wouldn't let us in
*  He said he and his partner robert steinberg were there and she's cowering behind them crying
*  And we got her out of the house brought her to the station and she told the the story that it was fake that and
*  He said but we saw him there and she goes you have no idea how dangerous he is. Uh,
*  I didn't I made it up. Please. It was a false report
*  So she got charged the next day's papers reported that this woman had come out and admitted that the whole thing was made up
*  Nobody said anything because the cops didn't talk to the reporters about vince being at the house. Oh my god, and thence
*  You know he prevailed he won then when he ran for attorney general of california in 76 virginia cardwell went public
*  And then then said told the same lie about her. He had never seen her face to face
*  She was trying to get two or three hundred dollars from him for a phone call or not pay the money for a phone consultation
*  He lost the attorney general's raise when she went public and again with the milkman and mistress then she sued vince same thing
*  He lied in the depositions and then when he got caught with the cop
*  The other people who could show that they'd been together and there was a history of they'd had an affair for like six months
*  He resolved it and paid her a substantial amount of money to go away. So this was the kind of person who
*  When I told vince I was writing about this in my book
*  He's like well number one. I can't talk about either of those cases because they were resolved
*  And there's non-disclosures and I go but then she know that's not true because I mean number one virginia's dead she had died
*  So she can't sue you and she went public and so did the wiselles the the milkman and the mistress
*  Uh, and I wouldn't you know, i'm not interested in your sorted, you know personal life
*  But it's relevant because i'm arguing that you committed crimes in the prosecution of the manson family
*  Suborn perjury
*  hid evidence, you know manipulated the defense by planning an attorney so if i'm gonna
*  You know try to make this case and everyone's not going to believe it because you're vince bulliocci, you know this prominent
*  Prosecutor author well, I have to show that there's a pattern in this behavior
*  Not only that you're lying under oath in the depositions in these two cases before you settle
*  But you also lied to the police in the in the cardwell case and you lied to the papers in both
*  If I have that in my book
*  Then people will be more prone to believe that you do the same thing
*  In in the tate la bianca trial that you would you know break rules to win your your convictions
*  Did he have a ghostwriter for helter skelter? No, he had a collaborator kurt gentry. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so that makes sense
*  Yeah, and I sounds like an insane person insane person would probably not be able to make such a
*  Coherent book I know he had every book he wrote he had collaborators he so um
*  The milkman's wife
*  In her deposition said that when gail vince's wife came to her house and knocked on her door and said please do this
*  My husband's making me crazy. We know that he's
*  Your husband the milkman isn't the father of my my boy, but just do it to make him stop
*  And the milkman's wife said we're not we don't want to have anything to do with you people
*  Just leave us alone and go away and she goes you don't understand. My husband is mentally ill
*  He goes he'll never stop this. There's nothing I can do to get him to stop
*  At the end of our six hours. I don't remember if I put it in the book. I might not have
*  He said to me, you know gail thinks I have some psychiatric issues and she's been trying to get me to go to a doctor forever
*  So, you know, i'm not saying that this is the reason some of this stuff might have happened
*  But I I do you know, I don't even know why he would tell me that
*  But yeah, so I think that he was able to be manipulated because of these vulnerabilities so compromised. Yeah
*  Yeah, it completely makes sense. Yeah, it makes sense. Holy shit
*  He had a family a whole other secret family daughter and a mistress for the next 30 years. I interviewed the mistress
*  I didn't put it in the book. You know, I didn't think it was necessary. I guess now i'm telling it
*  But it actually got reported after he died
*  Because the mistress had told a few other people i'd known about her for years and I knew he had a daughter who was
*  You know at the time of vince's death. She was in her 30s. I think
*  Now to go back to the manson killings. What was the motive?
*  to to hit that house
*  If it wasn't to uh doris day's son
*  Was his name again terry melcher if it wasn't to scare terry melcher
*  What was the motive like why did they?
*  Kill sharon tate and the people in that house. Here's why it took so long to finish the book to write the book
*  I have conflicting theories, you know in the first couple chapters
*  I lay out the evidence that it was a drug deal gone wrong, right?
*  uh, it involved billy doyle and charles taco and these guys who were
*  Dealing drugs out of the house with voichek
*  Farkowski, you know one of the victims polanski's friend and possibly allegedly jc bring the hairdresser
*  I lay out that case
*  And then we bleed into the next part where well, wait a minute
*  What did it mean that manson had this immunity?
*  And why would terry melcher?
*  Lie on the stand
*  I mean, why not say he saw manson after yet undermines the argument, but I thought the bulliose he could have I mean
*  Manson and the followers did everything they could to get themselves convicted at trial. They didn't put on a defense
*  You know, they carved x's in their foreheads shaved their heads the girls
*  Skipped and laughed in and out of the courtrooms every day when they finally testified during the death penalty phase
*  Susan akins just then she said that she stabbed sharon tate, you know, do you think they were dosing them before the trial?
*  I can't go there. I I mean it makes sense if they're laughing and dancing
*  well my
*  If we're going to speculate again, I believe that
*  One of the other objectives was personality change using drugs hypnosis, etc and making it fix making it stick
*  These doctors were trying to learn why some people do they have precipitating personality factors that made them more vulnerable
*  To using lsd once or a few times and all of a sudden just losing all sense of reality
*  Not everyone had that experience but some did and that research began in 1962 in los angeles
*  There's a whole chapter. There's a few chapters, but there's a whole chapter that we left out of the book
*  And if we do do a follow-up, it'll be in there
*  About another guy who's not even named in the book who was one of these
*  Lsd researchers and you're interested in hyperbolic chambers and all that stuff
*  Hyperbolic chambers or you mean sensory deprivation? Yeah. Yeah, I have one. Yeah. Okay. It's not a hyperbolic chamber
*  Okay. All right. Well, this was a hyperbolic. I know hyperbaric. Is that the same as hyperbolic?
*  That's a the increased oxygen. Yeah. Yeah recovery from injuries. Yeah
*  Well, so there was a group it's a fascinating it would have been a fascinating chapter there was a group of people
*  Artists educators and but they were all kind of like beatniks and stuff that lived on topanga beach
*  In this community that of
*  abandoned
*  Fisherman shacks that had been there when the pch went up in like the 30s and 40s
*  There was this whole community of homes mostly ramshackle homes that were inaccessible
*  Except by one road, I think Topanga Canyon Road
*  so a bunch of people like migrated there who wanted to they were almost like communally living and
*  There were I think about 30 of them and they renovated them and they were beautiful little places
*  They all got destroyed when they turned that into a park in the I think early 70s or mid 70s
*  But one of the guys there Paul Rowan was an LSD researcher at UCLA doing the same kind of research
*  West was doing but as early as 62 but unofficially
*  He and I don't know if you know who Oscar Jeniger was he was one of the first
*  Doctors psychiatrists in Los Angeles who got LSD from Sandoz for his patients
*  But there was a group of these people that lived there and one of them was named Perry Bivens and he was a diver
*  And he was a trust fund medical student a lot of money and he built a hyperbolic chamber and
*  Put gases in it
*  His objective was to try to learn a way to dive
*  They were all deep-sea divers with a bunch of these guys dive to the depths that people hadn't
*  Dove to before
*  By learning how to deprive the brains of oxygen for longer and longer times
*  They got access to LSD they were the first ones supposedly civilians in the United States have access to LSD
*  You know not through military or CIA experiments as early as 1954 55 and then by the early 60s
*  Everybody who knew knew where to get LSD from this this community and Tex Watson moved there
*  Who was the main killer and in 68 and lived among these guys who were doing this early research?
*  Into mostly the one guy Paul Rowan personality change
*  It's I mean it's so complicated about why it's important that Watson was with this community
*  Prior to joining Manson and what happened to him as far as his personality changed even before he met Manson
*  Which was the summer 68, but I guess I'll save that for the next chapter
*  so the whole so
*  They the motive though to get back to the mode of yeah for the official motive was a double
*  I mean bully Ose said in his closing arguments that the main motive was to ignite helter-skelter race war
*  The sub motive was to instill fear and Terry Melcher because he had rejected Manson, right?
*  So you're saying well, then if it wasn't those then what was it? Right? All right
*  if you look at the co-op cointel pro objectives, which was to
*  To
*  Diminish the you know to neutralize the left-wing movement to make them look horrible
*  Evil bad and this is what drugs are gonna do your kids
*  The kind of outcome that this this
*  These murders had was to make the hippies the boogeyman. I mean the biggest boogeyman in United States history
*  I don't know forever, but at least until the 70s became Charlie Manson and
*  When Manson was and his family were identified as suspects the first week of December 69
*  I mean it was like earth-shaking because all of a sudden nobody knew who had committed the murders that the case was open from
*  August till first of December you have photos on the front page of every paper in the world of these hippie women
*  You know nursing children living communally who are accused of these
*  horrible brutal slayings and
*  The argument was and what the reporters were reporting was they had gone crazy on LSD and free love and
*  hippie ethic and
*  That was same thing chaos and co-entel power trying to do they were trying to damage
*  The youth revolution the youth why do you think they targeted that house though?
*  So Jay Edgar Hoover
*  When he had the co-entel pro operation that he wrote him no excuse me an LA agent wrote a memo to Hoover
*  Saying what we have to do. This is when they were mostly battling the panther
*  I mean trying to neutralize the Panthers in LA
*  Was go after the whites the elite whites the Hollywood whites who are supporting the Panthers
*  There was something called the white panther party that began in LA 67 or 68 Jane Fonda Warren Beatty Cass Elliott
*  Those three were actually under surveillance by the FBI
*  They were part of this group Donald Sutherland and they were basically a support Leonard Bernstein. They supported the Panthers
*  They raised money. So in this one memo, which I think it was
*  The winter of 68 it's I got the date in the book
*  Said that what we have to make the whites think is that when the revolution finally happens when the blacks rise up
*  They'll be lined up with everybody else and slaughtered
*  So if you look at that memo that was part of their operation which was
*  To they did it by inflicting letters making, you know the whites scared so that
*  Hate to speculate but I think people will draw that conclusion
*  If you read the book that this could have been a chaos or co-entel pro operation
*  to
*  Turn, you know the world the nation the culture against
*  Hippies the left wing the Black Panthers and
*  They picked that house because it was high-profile because Sharon Tate was it actually when not because Sharon Tate was there
*  Well her and Polanski and that's one thing that Tarantino
*  I don't think he showed the parties at the house. They were like the social center of
*  Hollywood it wasn't just the movie people
*  It was the music people and Terry Melcher and Candy Bergen lived there for two years before that was a party house
*  Everybody went in and out of there it kind of represented the elite of
*  Movies music Hollywood, you know white people so that would have been a very high-profile
*  Place to hit target. Yeah, because all the people in that community in the Hollywood community would then also be aware that that was a spot
*  That they had been to yeah, all these high-profile people had been there. Yeah, it's like Joan Didion wrote in her book the white album
*  That the morning she learned about the murders and she knew most of the victims she goes it occurred
*  She goes I knew that the 60s had ended they were over. I mean there was also Altamont and I
*  Mean not a whole lot else, but that was like a cultural watershed moment, but the La Bianca killings were fairly random
*  Yeah, and that's a regret. I have that house was just up for sale, you know
*  Yeah, just really recently. I heard you're really cheap
*  Yeah, yeah, I mean they changed the number on the street still yeah, yeah not not this yellow house
*  I know the La Bianca house Waverly Drive. Yeah
*  Yeah
*  Oddly enough. I knew it was for sale. I was like I was really interested
*  Not to buy it, but I was like wow, that's crazy
*  Like imagine someone buying the house where that the killings took place, but it was so long ago
*  Yeah, it wouldn't be that creepy for some
*  House on the other side is the former convent that Katy Perry's been fighting in court with the nuns or the church to buy
*  This has been going on for a couple years. I don't know if it's been trying to buy a convent. Yeah. Yeah, it's a
*  It's a big beautiful home that had been turned into a convent like a retirement home for nuns
*  And when the church really hit hard times financially
*  They told the nuns they were gonna have to leave there because they were selling it
*  So they the church I think sold it to Katy Perry and then some of the nuns
*  Hired a lawyer because they didn't want to leave
*  I can't I mean I didn't look too closely at it, but I just know that the whole thing is in dispute
*  That's hilarious. And that's on the other side of the La Bianca house. Oh, wow. So the whole area is haunted
*  so did they
*  Did they target the La Bianca house for any reason?
*  All right, so the book is about 500 page long 500 pages long
*  I didn't put anything in there about the La Bianca case and what I learned
*  we
*  Also, you know withheld our chapters on the RFK assassination sir hand
*  Connected to it's 20 years of reporting now. I mean and the sir hand
*  assassination of Robert Kennedy it was
*  Same cops investigated it same district attorney's office prosecuted it and if you want to take a deep dive into that
*  You know sir Hans amnesia of how we ended up in the pantry that Jesus Christ
*  I actually filmed an episode of fear factor at that hotel
*  Oh, yeah hotels being used now for that and I walked through that pantry. Yeah, you know, you can watch the very area
*  I was there too. There you know, it's torn down now. They made it a public school
*  I mean they built a public school, but there was a crucifix carved into the floor
*  This amendment floor where Robert Kennedy Robert Kennedy fell. Oh Jesus. Yeah, so I think I remember that somehow
*  Yeah, so the stuff we kept out about RFK that'll be in the next book if we do it, but there's incredible power
*  Oh, you're doing another book Tom. I don't want to because I don't have 20 more years to live man
*  I know one thing I wouldn't do it without my collaborator because he speeds it up. Oh, yeah, you get it done in four
*  You've got so much information already, right? Yeah, so the LaBianca killings with a lot of the other killings again
*  This is stuff that Vince kept out and again
*  The reason the book so hard to write is one theory would conflict with another right?
*  so if the Tates were killed for
*  You know chaos co-intel pro high profile
*  Neutralize the left or a drug deal gone wrong. What about the LaBiancas?
*  Well, the LaBiancas were an upper middle-class couple that lived in Los Villas and
*  Vince wrote in the book that they were randomly targeted because
*  Manson had been to the house next door quite a bit when someone named Harold true lived there
*  And knew the layout and supposedly went to kill Harold true first got to Harold true's house
*  Which was empty and then went next door
*  Tied up the LaBianca couple left the house and set tech sent Tex Watson and Patricia Crenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten in to kill them
*  What Vince wrote about what the investigators found out was that?
*  Lino the father had
*  Gambling debts. He also had embezzled two hundred thousand dollars from his family company and
*  the original
*  Investigation the two teams were separate the LAPD assigned two different units
*  One to the Tate murders, which was much larger and one to the LaBianca
*  And they announced within a couple days that even though
*  The crime scenes were similar, you know same weapon
*  Multiple stab wounds blood writing on the wall pig pig
*  They didn't think they were connected
*  They thought that somebody had done a copycat of the first night's murders to throw off investigators
*  I
*  Make an argument in the book that I think the police knew exactly who did both murders from very right away
*  It'd be too long to get into here, but all the evidence that I accumulated is in there
*  and I'm not the first one to say that but
*  So then why were the LaBiancas killed, you know?
*  What Vince kept out of the book was not only was you know, you know in debt to his family
*  But he had a meeting on August 9th with his family that they had told him
*  He had to come in his two brothers-in-law and his mother who operated the the Gateway's shop
*  It was called Gateway markets. They had a bunch a string of supermarkets
*  It was pretty well to do except that Lino kept stealing all the money
*  They had a meeting on August 9th where they were gonna make them sign over all his shares
*  Leave the family business and on August 9th
*  He didn't show up. He went
*  with his wife and their boat to a lake where
*  Their daughter was visiting a friend so the daughter and her friend could water ski
*  Didn't even call the family to say he wasn't showing up came back that night and was killed with his wife
*  Vince kept that important meeting out. He also kept the depth and the degree of
*  of Lino's debts out so
*  And this isn't in my book. We didn't have enough room
*  You know I'd mention them, you know, because it's an important part, but I don't
*  Talk about what I found out and why it was important. There's a much better case that that Lino was targeted
*  You know the argument would be well who would ever hire Manson to kill someone
*  Well, you know Manson wasn't as dumb as he seemed, you know, and they needed money
*  This is where I don't want to speculate and again
*  It's not even a chapter in the book so I can't really show you what I've got except to tell you one other
*  you know argument that Vince made for
*  Why he thought the LaBiancas were killed by the Manson family
*  I mean, they were actually right with their first theory
*  It was a copy of the night before to throw off investigators
*  But it was the same killers the police were wrong when they thought it was two separate killers
*  Which I don't think they did is he said we could never establish a connection
*  Between the two groups of victims. So there was the Hollywood set
*  Benedict Canyon Cielo Drive and then there was Lino and his wife across town in Los Villas
*  And we worked so hard to try to determine if they knew each other
*  At any encounter thus tying them together and we couldn't that was a lie Lino got his haircut from J. Sebring the victim
*  He was in J. Sebring's appointment book. That's in the police report
*  I got access to like my first or second year when I begged persuaded a cop to let me come go through his files and Palm
*  Springs so he very well might have been to that house to the Cielo Drive house. Yeah. Yeah, so they weren't they knew
*  That social circle. I don't know about the social circle, but he could have
*  You know who knew I mean J. Sebring was a very high-profile
*  Hairdresser he was yeah, and it was very expensive. It was very exclusive. Yeah
*  Yeah, he charged I mean it was expensive back then I think it was just $20
*  But most men got their hair cut for like a buck or two back then
*  Yeah, it was an exclusive and he was a hairdresser to the stars
*  He was Sharon's ex-boyfriend who was still supposedly in love with her Roman stole her from him
*  And he was with Sharon, you know the last night of her life
*  Yeah, I mean
*  There's other stuff that didn't end up in the book for space reasons
*  And also one of the most important things I found out and this
*  Goes to your question about why why this house or why that house?
*  That's not in the book, but I've talked about it before
*  And I found this out too late to get in the book. I was able to confirm it the night before
*  Sharon Tate J. Sebring
*  For check for Kowski and Abbe Gale Folger were killed in Cielo Drive
*  For check for Kowski and Abbe Gale Folger were killed in Cielo Drive
*  The four of them had dinner at Jay's house down at the bottom of Benedict Canyon. That's all on the official story
*  Jay had them to dinner Amos's Butler made them steaks
*  And they ate them in Jay's bedroom. So the four people were in the bedroom. This is August 7th the night before the murders
*  What's not in the official version?
*  But I found in the police reports is Jay had gotten cable TV which again a lot of my critics
*  So there was no cable TV in 1969 in Los Angeles
*  There was it cost a lot of money only a few people had it, but you had it Jay Sharon Abigail and
*  Vojchek had their ice cream dessert served by Amos the Butler. He went back downstairs
*  They were gonna watch the movie and then all of a sudden there was a whoops
*  Sorry a power surge and the lights went really really bright and dimmed and they lost the cable so Jay called
*  Paul Greenwald Paul Greenwald was a law student whose father was Jay's attorney and
*  He and he was an electrician. That's how he supported himself going through law school and he had done all the wiring for Jay
*  So he called Paul Greenwald and this was a Thursday night at like nine o'clock and he said can you come over here?
*  We're trying to watch a movie and the cable went out and I don't know there was a surge. So
*  Paul said I can't I got a date. I've been trying to get this day for months. I can't blow her off and Jay's like, okay
*  That's alright. We'll do something else. So in the official narrative
*  Nobody reported the surge or losing the cable, but in the official narrative Jay stayed there Sharon and
*  Vojchek and Abigail I think went to the daisy a club and then Sharon was there for a half hour and somebody took her home
*  And then Jay went to the club what I found out from a police interview with Paul Greenwald the kid who was called to ask
*  He told this to the police and then he confirmed it to me 30 40 years later when I found him and interviewed him
*  He said I went to the house
*  Either Sunday or Monday after the murders because my father sent me there to get a suit for Jay to be buried in
*  He goes I got to the house and I wanted to see what had happened to the wires since I put all the wires in
*  And I did a circle of the house and I found the wires
*  Cut he goes I picked them up and I looked at them and there were like four cables and three work
*  He goes these were deliberately cut I could tell by the gradation and and the angle and he told the police that
*  He said so the night before they were killed
*  Somebody cut the wires and it couldn't have been a gardener because it was nine o'clock at night
*  And he said from what Jay had told him about the power
*  So it's like all the full lights got really bright and then dim because that's what happens when you do
*  I don't know anything about electricity
*  the police
*  Didn't follow up on it or if they did I couldn't find a record and I found Alvin Greenwald and I said, you know your
*  Police report which I have
*  Completely up ends
*  The prosecution's argument that these people were random because Tex Watson the next night
*  Cut the wires at the Tate house the phone wires and then they went into the house and killed everybody
*  So unless it's a coincidence that 24 hours before the same four people at a different location
*  Had the house wires cut by somebody who might have gotten spooked by the surge or something
*  They weren't random they were being targeted so that raises, you know questions about
*  That undermines the the the randomness of it that they were strangers to their killers
*  But there's no conclusive thing that you can point to that says this is the reason why they were targeted
*  No
*  Yeah
*  What a book
*  What a journey. Yeah been on man. Yeah, I'm very
*  Happy for you. Thanks. I'm happy that you you did it
*  I mean that's it has to feel like an amazing accomplishment after all those years. Yeah, we have this book
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and again, I mean I more than anything in the world
*  You've been gotten to the end of the book
*  There's a murder in there that I think the Manson family committed that was covered up by the law enforcement because it screwed up
*  It would have screwed up the prosecution. I want that looked into
*  There's also at the end of the book. There are these text wallets
*  And audio tapes that I found out about in 2008 when Watson turned himself in when he found he was alerted in
*  Texas he was at his parents house
*  They called the police called the local sheriff who was Texas cousin and his parents and said he's wanted for questioning in these unsolved tape murders
*  This is November 29th. Nobody had been identified publicly as suspects
*  The police were just starting to figure out that these people had killed their victims
*  So two LAPD flew down to Texas
*  Watson was brought into the station
*  questioned by the LAPD
*  Put under arrest they had to extradite him so that the sheriff their Texas cousin put him in a cell
*  The family called up a lawyer Bill Boyd who had actually represented text on a college case when he stole a typewriter from a college in a prank
*  Bill Boyd told me in an interview in 2008 that that day
*  He had text tell him the whole story or Charles as he called him about how he met Manson
*  Why the murders were committed how they happened?
*  He said he spoke to me for 20 hours and he goes I've got all those audio tapes in a safe in my office
*  He told me this in 2008. He said he also described other murders that the family had committed that hadn't been connected to them
*  So right away when you know, I'm in 2008 I'm working on it that long I thought other murders that's important to me
*  But more important did he tell his attorney?
*  Why the murders really happen, you know, why they picked those houses, you know, this was the first account
*  That was recorded the next one was Susan Atkins about a week later after she had gotten her new attorney
*  That the prosecution planted they audio taped her telling her version which became the official version
*  So Watson's would predate that by a week
*  And when I found out that they were in that safe and he's telling me this on the phone
*  I thought why he he can't play that to me because that would violate Watson's attorney client privilege
*  But I thought I have to ask so I said is there any chance Mr. Boyd I could come down and listen to those tapes
*  And he said that's when he realized he shouldn't have told me he said oh well you I I couldn't do that without Charles Watson Charles permission
*  I go you still in touch with me. Oh, so I write to him every now and then he writes me
*  He didn't represent him at trial after he was extradited and I said, would you please ask so that began three or four months of me pestering him
*  He would never take the phone call and then finally after four months I called up and his secretary said I'm sorry Mr. Boyd's in China on business today
*  And I said well you have to tell him I'm not going to wait anymore I'm going to write to Charles and tell him what he told me
*  I go if there's other bodies I mean I didn't let them know that I was more interested in the motive story
*  But I said if there's I was interested in this too I go if there's other bodies or victims out there who have never been connected
*  Or even we don't even know if the remains were uncovered because there's a lot of evidence that there might have been people killed out in the desert and buried there
*  I go I need to know that and she said okay I'll tell him my phone rang like literally 30 seconds after I hung it up
*  And I had caller ID and it was from his Texas office goes this is Bill Boyd you cannot call Charles and tell him I told you that
*  I said Mr. Boyd you haven't called me back for four months he goes well I'm telling you now you can't do that
*  And I go well are you going to you know get his permission he goes yeah you just have to be patient I go I can't wait anymore
*  He says if you do that and you tell him I'll deny ever telling you I said it's all on tape I taped that call
*  He goes you didn't have permission to tape that call I go yeah you gave me permission at the beginning and that's on tape too
*  He goes god damn it you journalists and he hung up on me
*  You journalists? He lumped you in with all of them
*  He said my wife's a journalist his wife is a TV anchor
*  He goes my wife's a journalist I know how you people work I go you gave me permission it's on the audio tape
*  So he died six months later on the treadmill
*  Oh my god probably thinking about you
*  And his firm went bankrupt and then it wasn't until two or three years later and it's all in there the back story
*  But I finally went to try to get the tapes again and found out he had died
*  Found out that the tapes were in the possession of the trustee who was you know waiting for the bankruptcy to be resolved
*  And it took me three four months of back and forth and to try to get them to release the tapes to me
*  And I made an argument for why they weren't protected anymore again long story short
*  I was sharing information with the deputy DA in Los Angeles who I thought was friendly
*  He was until he wasn't and he was handling all the parole hearings of the Manson family guy named Pat Sakira
*  The woman who was in charge of the tapes the trustee said
*  If Sakira calls me and tells me that it's okay for me to release them to you and explains how it's not a violation I'll do it
*  I said I'll ask him so I asked him he said absolutely I want to talk to her
*  And I said great a day later I get a call from Sakira he goes you're not going to believe it she's releasing the tapes to us
*  I go you he goes yeah yeah yeah don't worry I'll let you hear them when we get them
*  She asked I knew right then I had lost any kind of control and sure enough number one
*  The trustee had to notify Watson's new attorney Watson put up a fight in court and it's in you can read about in the LA Times
*  I reported on that for about a year for about a year it went from the local court to the state Supreme Court
*  Where the judge finally ruled that the LAPD should have the tapes they sent two officers down to get the tapes in 2013
*  They came back and then nobody at the DA's office would talk to me anymore
*  The promise that had been made that I would be the first one to listen to them reneged those tapes
*  A million journalists have made Freedom of Information Act requests for them they won't release them they're locked up
*  Leslie Van Houten's attorney wants him he thinks it'll help her at her parole hearings because he thinks there's information on there to show
*  That she's been telling the truth all these years he's gone to the state Supreme Court through other courts they've locked them down
*  20 hours first account of how and why these murders occurred and they're not releasing them
*  I think it's because the truth is on there
*  Holy shit what is that truth?
*  I don't know maybe I mean yeah you've got a wide audience maybe other people will come forward I would just be happy if some paper like
*  The Time, LA Times, New York Times, Washington Post assign some reporters just to go through my reporting and see if I've made shit up
*  Or if it all plays out and then does a little bit of additional reporting
*  A lot of these people are dying you know they're getting old but a lot of them are still alive and they could be interviewed
*  Well I hope they do Tom
*  Anybody go get this Chaos, Charles Manson the CIA, the secret history of the 60's, Tom O'Neill, it's amazing, Tom
*  Let me say one more thing
*  Yes please
*  If people want to see the actual documents I have an Instagram and a Facebook page where I've put them up
*  There's also excerpts of my interviews with Bouliosi, Manson, Kay, some of the really important stuff where I put the audio tapes up
*  So what you can't get in the book or even in the footnotes you can see online
*  If you just Google my name, Manson and Instagram or Facebook
*  There it is right there
*  I'm asking
