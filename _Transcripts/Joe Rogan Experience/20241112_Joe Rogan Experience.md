# Joe Rogan Experience #2227 - Adrienne Iapalucci
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_kUi6BsGe4)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.
*  Thanks for the shirt.
*  Of course. It's pretty tight.
*  Is it tight you mean? No, no, no, it's like tight.
*  Nice. Nice.
*  I feel like they're gonna sue me.
*  For the shirt? I don't know.
*  Do you sell it? I'm trying to.
*  I don't think they want to sue anybody. I think they want to keep it on the DL.
*  Especially you.
*  Because you could just go on podcasts and talk about it.
*  Not if I'm dead.
*  I can talk about it until I'm dead.
*  Let's see. If they haven't killed, there's so many people.
*  If they haven't killed Malice, there's so many people that they haven't killed.
*  I'd be a fun kill though. They just come to the Bronx.
*  It's like so easy to just kill me.
*  Right. Anybody gets killed in the Bronx. Happens all the time.
*  Nobody cares. Yeah, probably.
*  They don't care.
*  They don't care.
*  A few people would be upset.
*  And then it would go away. Like Mom.
*  Like Epstein.
*  Yes. That kind of went away.
*  It did go away.
*  The guy who tried to kill Trump. Kind of went away.
*  Well didn't that guy get shot though?
*  Yeah, he's dead. But now he's gone. Poof, gone. No one talks about it.
*  Do you think P. Diddy is in prison waiting for the Clintons to just kill him?
*  Do you think? Every dad would be looking for them.
*  I don't think the Clintons were involved with P. Diddy. Do you?
*  No, but Epstein.
*  Was Epstein involved with P. Diddy?
*  No, I just feel like these pedophile rings have to cross points at some point.
*  The P. Diddy thing sounds like just complete unchecked depravity.
*  Like I don't even think he was gay. He was just fucking guys.
*  Maybe he's gay, but it seems like he's just depraved.
*  Because then he would just be fucking women.
*  Oh yeah, for sure. At least for like 10 minutes.
*  He's at least bi.
*  I mean, it might just be whatever drugs are taken.
*  Like I don't understand it.
*  When that whole, like, I think I had peripherally heard that P. Diddy had big parties.
*  But I never heard of freak-offs or any, I never heard of that stuff until pretty recently.
*  Like post-pandemic.
*  I think, Jamie, when did you first hear about like P. Diddy parties?
*  Ah, my mic's off.
*  I mean, I would think that he, I've heard about him having big parties.
*  Your mic has to be off because of Carl's breathing.
*  He's breathing pretty heavy still right now.
*  Oh my God, he's so cute.
*  He's adorable. Carl and Marshall, they go at it every time he comes here.
*  First time I heard, I don't know. I've heard of, I don't even know what rumors I would have heard.
*  I just heard, like, you know, he's had crazy parties. I didn't hear nothing.
*  Yeah, it was never like in the zeitgeist. It was never...
*  It's just weird too because he always had the white parties where you have to wear all white.
*  And I just feel like that's the worst color for body fluid.
*  Eww. Yeah, right? Just shit and blood.
*  Maybe that's how he kept track of who he fucked.
*  That person's already gotten it.
*  That person's already covered in disgusting stuff.
*  That's what he kept track of.
*  Oh my God. There's so many horrific accusations though involving young singers, young, like children.
*  Yeah, it's disgusting.
*  It's insane.
*  This R. Kelly looked like a decent guy.
*  Yeah.
*  It's so crazy.
*  It is crazy. And meanwhile, the guy was like hanging out with Oprah, hanging out with Obama.
*  Jay-Z.
*  Everyone.
*  Everybody.
*  I'm sure the Clintons were there at some point.
*  Maybe Bill.
*  Bill is so nice.
*  I went one time.
*  Was he?
*  He's so nice.
*  So charming.
*  He is and he's actually still kind of good looking. Like even for an older dude.
*  Yeah?
*  Yeah, why not? He's still so good looking and she's just so miserable.
*  Well, she's publicly humiliated and she thought that her big retribution would become president.
*  Become president.
*  Sure.
*  And then that would be it. All water under the bridge.
*  I'm a strong woman. I'm running this country.
*  And then America was like, nah.
*  I mean, it doesn't matter what color you are.
*  America does not want a woman in charge.
*  Well, that's not exactly true because she won the popular vote.
*  I mean, not Kamala though.
*  No, but Kamala was a terrible candidate.
*  The difference between her and Hillary is night and day.
*  Well, Hillary had a lot of experience too. She's been doing this for a long time.
*  Sure. She was Secretary of State and on top of that, she could answer questions.
*  Sure.
*  Like you could have a question with her about like what would we do differently if you were president about the Israel-Gaza conflict.
*  Sure.
*  She would have something off the top of her head.
*  What would you do differently than Joe Biden?
*  She wouldn't say, I can't think of a thing.
*  She would never say that.
*  No.
*  Kamala Harris is just not good.
*  She's definitely not good at interviewing either.
*  No. I mean, I don't know if she's good at running things because you'd have to be behind the scenes to see how that works.
*  But when it comes to like talking off the top of her head, what she's good at is a pre rehearsed speech that she reads off a teleprompter.
*  Sure. But if someone asks you a rogue question, then you have to be ready to answer it.
*  Yeah. When rogue questions like you have to be able to say what differentiates you from Biden.
*  You have to. That's like a pretty simple.
*  Just like, well, I'm still alive.
*  Yeah, that would be funny if you said that.
*  Right. That's what she should do. If she could be funny.
*  Well, I'm there. I can answer questions. I can look you in the eye.
*  Yeah. I remember what I'm talking about.
*  Yes.
*  I was surprised she didn't come on the podcast a little bit.
*  It seems like and this is all reports.
*  These are all anecdotal reports, right?
*  But it seems like her campaign was kind of chaotic, like no one could make a decision.
*  They had I don't know how many conversations with my folks, right?
*  But multiple conversations, giving different dates, different times, different this, different that.
*  And we knew that she was going to be in Texas. So I said open invitation.
*  Right. You said you can come whenever you want.
*  Anytime you pick a time. I will be here.
*  And you would have been the best person for her to talk to because you're not going to attack her.
*  You would just ask her questions. But that's the problem.
*  I don't know if she'd be able to answer those questions.
*  I'll ask her questions.
*  But I think they had requirements on things that she didn't want to talk about.
*  She didn't want to talk about marijuana legalization.
*  So I thought was hilarious. Why?
*  Like that's so because of her prosecuting record.
*  Oh, well, I mean, that is like that was her old job, though.
*  Yeah. And, you know, she put a lot of people in jail for weed.
*  Fifteen hundred, apparently.
*  It's not really that many, though.
*  Fifteen hundred.
*  Tell those guys those fifteen hundred together in a room.
*  Are they still in prison?
*  No.
*  Oh, OK. Then they're fine now.
*  Well, prison really builds character.
*  You go in there, you really figure out what kind of person you are.
*  I bet it does. Yeah.
*  But when you are held past your release date to fight wildfires for the state,
*  because Kamala Harris wants you to do that.
*  Sure.
*  I'm going to swipe of my pen.
*  Right. You guys.
*  I mean, it's not like the worst idea to just clean up the wildfires.
*  Well, you should probably pay people for all work.
*  Sure. You know, even prisoners.
*  That's just free.
*  I got a problem with all that.
*  I mean, I have a problem with slave labor in prison because it's essentially mandated.
*  Right. You have to have a job in some prisons.
*  But I mean, what else are you going to do in prison?
*  Like if you're not. Read books, do pushups.
*  Not have someone tell you what to do.
*  I'm going to want to do hair. I'm going to want to cook at some point.
*  You just do need a routine. Otherwise, the time never.
*  How many books can you read every single day?
*  That's true. That's true. Yeah.
*  How many yoga classes can you take?
*  You just need a schedule kind of just to like, I don't know, that just helps your day go by.
*  Like even if you hated it, you still need.
*  Like when I was on unemployment for a period, I'm like, I'm actually very bored.
*  You know what I mean? Like you like it for a couple of days, but you need that routine to kind of like,
*  I don't know, if I was in prison, I'd want a job.

*  This is my fear when it comes to automation, AI, and then ultimately,
*  I think everyone's going to have to have universal basic income.
*  I think all countries are going to have to have it.
*  I think the United States is going to have to have it too.
*  And people need a purpose. They need a thing.
*  For sure.
*  They need an identity. And a lot of people identify with whatever their job is.
*  They take pride in it. It means something to them to show up at work and have people say they do a great job.
*  You're very valuable to the company. The customers like you.
*  All that stuff is really good for people. It's good for self-esteem.
*  It's good for giving you a purpose.
*  If universal basic income is a thing, which I think it's going to have to be a thing,
*  it's going to be real weird psychologically for people to adjust to that.
*  I think there'd probably be a lot of riots. I don't know what else would you do?
*  Just riot with government money?
*  Yeah, I was thinking Trump might not win and there was going to be a bunch of riots
*  and I would be able to just get like a free computer.
*  I was kind of hoping for that.
*  Well, you can buy a computer, ain't you?
*  No, I want it for free.
*  A successful comedian.
*  Listen, a free computer is better than a computer you have to pay for.
*  Is it?
*  Yeah.
*  Wouldn't you feel guilty at all?
*  No, if they're rioting, everything's for free. That's the rule.
*  That was the rule during George Floyd.
*  But that's what I'm saying. During Black Lives Matter, I lived by a CVS that was getting broken into all the time.
*  I had like shampoo and conditioner for years.
*  Did you go in there?
*  Yeah, why not? I was in there when it was happening.
*  You're going to get arrested.
*  How?
*  Don't say that.
*  No.
*  These are all jokes, right?
*  Wink. They're all jokes.
*  Wink is all lies.
*  Listen, I was just supporting Black Lives Matter and that's how you do it.
*  That's how you do it. You get shampoo for free.
*  Shampoo and conditioner.
*  Yeah. The most racist thing I ever saw was a CVS that had everything locked up except sunscreen.
*  I mean, that's pretty much how it is in every CVS.
*  And why people don't buy sunscreen? Because we want to be dark.
*  So no one's stealing it or buying it.
*  Yeah. Good call.
*  Well, they do if they're worried about cancer.
*  If you're one of those people, it puts it everywhere, all over your face.
*  Meanwhile, you're putting toxic chemicals all over your face to protect yourself from cancer.
*  People do that and they're like smoking cigarettes.
*  It's like, what are you doing? Just get cancer.
*  Well, I was reading this thing where they were talking about that CVS defined as a way to protect yourself from cancer.
*  They were talking about that CVS defined this.
*  So what this person was saying was that people who spend less time in the sun are more likely to get deadly skin cancer.
*  Is it because your body's not used to it?
*  Yeah, you get cooked.
*  You know, your body doesn't have any melanin.
*  So you go out there and you get like fucking burnt to death and your body develops cancers.
*  But also you're not you don't have vitamin D.
*  So vitamin D is like a critical hormone and it protects you from a lot of things.
*  It's crucial for your immune system. It's crucial for a lot of different functions.
*  It's also interesting because one time we were at the cellar and Louie kept telling me that I needed vitamin D because I'm so white.
*  And I was just like, is that a real thing?
*  It just sounds like dick.
*  I was like, wait, what?
*  Yeah, you need vitamin D.
*  I was like, is that like a real thing?
*  Yeah, you're so white, you need some vitamin D.
*  But you need to get fucked by somebody that's going to help you.
*  That's the only thing that's going to help you.
*  That's the only thing that's going to keep me alive.
*  Imagine if that was true.
*  Imagine if like the only way you could maintain health is to get fucked.
*  I mean, it makes sense.
*  People that are homeless are just like figuring themselves all the time.
*  There must be something to it.
*  I think they're mentally ill.
*  Sure, but they also are like, I want to stay alive.
*  I want to prolong this homelessness.
*  Keep me alive as long as we can.
*  There's a book I read, Fingering Yourself for Health.
*  I mean, all the homeless people on 6th Street are just like fingering themselves constantly.
*  Yeah, there's a lot of that kind of activity.
*  Yeah.
*  With the homeless.
*  I think they just give up on shame on everything.
*  I think you're out of your mind.
*  You have to be out of your mind.
*  You're like, who cares?
*  There's this poor lady on 6th Street.
*  There's a gas station that I only go to if everything's gone totally wrong and I need gas for sure.
*  You just run out of it.
*  But you're like, there, you get out of your car, you're ready to fight people.
*  It's a sketchy gas station.
*  Oh, I guess.
*  There's this poor lady who her head, instead of being like here, her head is like, it's like it's broken.
*  Her neck is broken.
*  Okay.
*  And so her head is like down here.
*  She has to look at you like this.
*  She can't lift her chin off of her sternum.
*  Like literally down like this.
*  And she's just a bag of bones, just barely alive.
*  Like, okay, obviously we're not going to help homeless people.
*  Like there's no money in helping poor people.
*  Like, let's give them all a fit and I'll clean up the streets, do the kindest thing we can for them.
*  ODM?
*  Yeah.
*  If I'm on the street for longer than a week, please kill me.
*  It's not going well.
*  Some people have recovered.
*  Some people have gotten their shit together.
*  How many?
*  I don't know.
*  How many CEOs were like, I was on the street for years.
*  Zero CEOs.
*  And then I got some vitamin D.
*  Well, how many CEOs enjoy life?
*  That's the real question.
*  Just because something's difficult to do doesn't mean it's good to do.
*  Right?
*  Sure.
*  Like some people think that becoming extremely wealthy and running a major corporation because it's difficult to do that's something you should aspire to.
*  But those guys all die young.
*  They all have heart attacks and strokes.
*  Yeah, it's a very high stress position.
*  Insanely high stress.
*  And the hours are insane.
*  And you're probably fucking miserable other than time you're doing coke and banging strippers.
*  Right.
*  I think I would like the rich part.
*  And then I would just do something with like animals.
*  Oh, yeah, I love animals.
*  I know you do.
*  People forget.
*  Well, I brought Marshall just for you.
*  I mean, Marshall is so beautiful.
*  Like if I ever go bald, I told you I want like a wig.
*  I don't know how white women are now just wearing golden retrievers wigs because it's beautiful.
*  His hair.
*  But it would stink when it gets wet.
*  I mean, everyone thinks white people smell anyway.
*  Who gives a shit?
*  You remember the first time you heard that black people thought white people smell like dogs?
*  We love dogs.
*  I have never heard that.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Really?
*  They always think we smell like dogs.
*  It's like that's try hurting my feelings.
*  Well, I guess if you're around dogs, I think human beings smell if they don't wash.
*  That's all it is.
*  Like, I don't think there's a difference in the smell of black people and white people.
*  And this is coming from someone who does jujitsu.
*  Sure.
*  Maybe.
*  So I smell people like that close when their chest pressed up against my face.
*  I've never noticed a difference in human odor.
*  All I know is black people think white people smell like dogs.
*  Wet dogs when they get wet.
*  Maybe that's just like a fun thing to say.
*  I think it's more than one black person saying it.
*  For real?
*  Yeah.
*  I've never heard.
*  Jamie, you ever heard that?
*  Jamie, you ever heard it?
*  Well, I hang out with a lot of black people.
*  Maybe they always say it to you.
*  Yeah.
*  Weird.
*  I'm like, that doesn't hurt my feelings.
*  I love dogs.
*  Yeah, dogs are great.
*  They're amazing.
*  If you're going to smell like an animal, I mean, that's not the worst one to smell like.
*  Cats are kind of crazy because they never smell.
*  And they don't even take showers.
*  They just clean themselves.
*  I know, but if you get like one of those hairless ones, you have to like clean their nails,
*  and their skin and stuff.
*  The hairless ones are fucking weird.
*  They are, but I like them.
*  Do white people really smell like wet dogs?
*  See?
*  Black people, the smell comes from hair follicles when they get wet.
*  Hair follicles secrete an oil that spreads somewhat when wet, and a small amount of water gets in.
*  Okay.
*  Interesting.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's from Cora.
*  That sounds like a white person.
*  But that's hilarious.
*  Go back up to that.
*  Cora is one of those answer websites, right?
*  Oh, I thought Cora like a black lady.
*  See what I mean?
*  Look at all the Reddit posts that are still saying it.
*  I understand the Reddit posts, but here's my point.
*  Cora is like one of those, like you can ask it, like, how do you make a nuclear bomb?
*  Sure.
*  Like that kind of stuff.
*  And imagine if it said, do black people really smell like dogs?
*  What do black people smell like when they're wet?
*  I don't think they smell any different than anybody.
*  But the point is you could never have that question on a question webpage.
*  You can't?
*  They'll take it off?
*  No fucking chance.
*  But you could have it about white people.
*  Could you ask it what Indian people smell like?
*  I don't think you should.
*  But nobody cares about Indian people at all.
*  Indian people do.
*  Yeah, but you ever see what they're doing in India?
*  If the big Brahmaswami becomes president, you're going to have a real issue with this.
*  I don't even know who that is.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  You don't know who Vivek is?
*  I try not to pay attention to what's going on.
*  Good for you.
*  I really don't know anything.
*  Good for you.
*  That's so healthy.
*  I know, like, very little.
*  If you can exist like that, it's a good way to be.
*  You know, there's plenty of people in this world that are paying attention.
*  I know.
*  I'm not one of them, though.
*  I don't have a problem with that.
*  That's Ari Shavir, too.
*  He doesn't know what the fuck's going on.
*  Yeah, that's why we're good buddies.
*  Yeah, he has no idea what's happening.
*  He's, I mean.
*  You talk to him about laws being passed, he's like, what?
*  That's not real.
*  Yeah, Ari's the best.
*  He's like.
*  Ari's, but he's also so autistic, which is why, like, him even producing my special was
*  so good because he's so, like, focused and he knows exactly what to do.
*  Very focused.
*  Love stand up as an art form.
*  Love stand up.
*  He's the best at, like, not killing seats for the show.
*  He is the best person for that.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah, he knows how important that is.
*  Yeah.
*  His special that he did was the, the Jew special was so ridiculous because they had to keep
*  those candles lit and so they had to constantly light them.
*  I was there for it.
*  I opened for it.
*  It was so hot and he taped it in June.
*  It was so hot.
*  I was on stage, I did like 15 minutes, I'm like, oh, it's really hot in here.
*  Well, it's a fire behind you.
*  I know.
*  You think about all those candles.
*  How much fire is that?
*  That's a lot of fire.
*  It's crazy.
*  It was a crazy amount.
*  Did they have, like, fire extinguishers standing by in case some shit went sideways?
*  Probably.
*  I'm sure there were some, like, there might have been a fire marshal they had to hire
*  just to make sure.
*  Probably.
*  But even if the whole place goes on fire, what's he going to do?
*  He's like, well, there's a fire.
*  What's he going to do?
*  He's going to run away.
*  Right.
*  So what is he going to do?
*  I mean, you would need so many fire extinguishers.
*  No, they're little tiny fires.
*  They're a bunch of little itty bitty fires.
*  There's not, like, one major all-consuming fire like that.
*  What if they get to hold of, like, the curtain?
*  If you have fire extinguishers, how far back was the curtain from that?
*  Was there a curtain at all?
*  I'm pretty sure there was a curtain.
*  I'm pretty sure there was a curtain.
*  I'm pretty sure there was a curtain, yeah.
*  I mean, it looks beautiful, though.
*  Yeah, it's not as easy to light things on fire as you think.
*  And if fire marshals are standing by with a fire extinguisher, they put that shit out
*  real quick.
*  And that would actually be kind of funny.
*  Yeah.
*  They'd probably keep that on the show.
*  That would be fun if there was a fire.
*  What a stupid idea to put your fucking candles on stage.
*  That would be amazing.
*  Well, he was running that special for forever, for a long time.
*  And then, you know, the whole Kobe thing happened, and he stopped, and then he came back.
*  What's great is I was with him in, I guess it was Charlotte when the whole Kobe thing
*  happened, and he was sick.
*  I was like, oh, we were on the road.
*  I was like, just go to sleep.
*  And then I wake up, and I'm like, what did you do?
*  I was like, you're sick.
*  You're supposed to go to sleep.
*  And then I was like, oh, Ari.
*  And then the funniest part is people are like, we're going to kick your ass if you're ever
*  in North Carolina.
*  And he's like, I'm there.
*  And I'm like, all right, well, if you come to where I'm at, we're going to kick your ass.
*  Well, he was really into making fun of people when they died because everybody was really
*  kind to people when they died.
*  And he was always like, fuck them.
*  And some of them were really funny.
*  The Kobe one was not.
*  But some of them were really funny.
*  Sure.
*  I also don't think he knew.
*  He didn't know the daughter was there.
*  He was just doing it about Kobe.
*  Jimmy, your microphone is rubbing.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  But just he doesn't do that anymore.
*  Thank God.
*  What's funny is the Uber came to pick us up the next day and it's like just like a black
*  dude picking us up.
*  And he's like, I got to go to the bathroom.
*  He takes us to like a transient bus station.
*  Uber guy?
*  Yes.
*  Oh, God.
*  And I'm like, does this guy know about?
*  It's a setup.
*  I'm like, are we going to get murdered?
*  The guy leaves for like 20, 30 minutes to take a shit.
*  No way.
*  Yeah.
*  Before we're going to like the airport.
*  No way.
*  And I was like, this is crazy.
*  I would order a second Uber to pick me up where the first Uber was.
*  No, we were ready to get murdered.
*  You're ready?
*  We were just sitting there.
*  The time is now.
*  This is my fate.
*  This is my fate.
*  We're dying right now.
*  How did you die?
*  Because Ari Shafir decides.
*  First of all, for the longest time, Ari realized that he could not have a phone because he
*  would be addicted to social media and it was terrible for his mental health.
*  And that's what happened.
*  And so he had a flip phone forever.
*  Oh, I know.
*  And I was like, good for you.
*  Like David Tell still has a flip phone.
*  He does.
*  And it's brilliant.
*  Like the people that do it, Sebastian Younger, he came in here, he still has a flip phone.
*  There's people that rock a flip phone.
*  If he would have not had that flip phone, he wouldn't have done the Kobe stuff.
*  Oh, 100%.
*  But I think things like that ultimately are good.
*  Yeah, he's not.
*  He doesn't regret it.
*  If you talk to him.
*  He shouldn't have done it, right?
*  But now he knows he shouldn't have done it.
*  And that's just another layer of experience in life and just overcoming this.
*  Overcoming this horrific cancellation.
*  Should he not have done it though?
*  In hindsight?
*  Yeah, I think he's probably it's probably not a good thing to do to mock.
*  Oh, I love that though.
*  But he didn't mock the daughter.
*  He just mocked him.
*  True.
*  Yeah.
*  So I asked him, do you regret doing it?
*  He's like, no.
*  Of course he said no.
*  And nobody really like people were upset.
*  That's the whole thing with cancellations.
*  People are upset for like two, three days and then they forget.
*  Well, especially in this new cycle.
*  This new cycle is so crazy.
*  It's just no matter what happens, there's always something right around the corner that just covers it up.
*  Just a new thing to get upset about.
*  Yeah, just another wave comes in and you no longer it's fades.
*  Whatever it is.
*  Bridges, let me think about the FEMA person who got fired because if you had a Trump.
*  Yeah, if you had like a Trump thing on your.
*  Can you imagine that?
*  I know, but it's like if you have any signs that means your house didn't get hit hard by a hurricane.
*  No.
*  Come on.
*  No, because you could have a Biden sign.
*  Look, it doesn't matter.
*  It doesn't sign.
*  But that's what I'm saying.
*  If you have any sign secured.
*  Depends entirely on how the sign was.
*  If your roof came off, you think that sign is going to be there.
*  Bottom line is that's not what she was saying.
*  What she was saying is avoid all houses that have a Trump sign.
*  You cannot do that.
*  Oh, I know.
*  But I'm just saying what's funny to me is like if you have a sign and it didn't lift off the ground, like how hard was your house?
*  Could be flooding.
*  Your house could have been completely flooded.
*  You have no power.
*  No electricity.
*  No running water.
*  Yeah, I guess your house needs to be drained.
*  Like it's federal emergency management.
*  It's not supposed to be federal emergency management for whoever this one person who's in charge with ideologically.
*  Absolutely.
*  I don't.
*  I was making a joke.
*  Like if you have any sign there and it survived a hurricane, like your house is probably fine.
*  Right.
*  Also, I want FEMA funds to go to the fire festival.
*  Like that's all our money should be going through is white guys trying to get out of the house.
*  White guys trying to run a festival who fail.
*  Do you know that guy's doing another one?
*  I know.
*  Is it a it's not a fire festival.
*  He's telling if I think he's calling it fire festival too.
*  Is he?
*  Yeah.
*  And he's charging like a million dollars a ticket.
*  His move is to just charge an insane amount of money and see how fucking stupid some people are.
*  I mean, I love that.
*  The whole thing was nuts.
*  It's like one dude.
*  It's always like some guy who you think could be selling Bitcoin or pyramid scheme.
*  And now he's decided to put on a music festival because he wants to be cool.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like to party with people.
*  He wants to party with people.
*  But you got didn't he get like famous people to go?
*  I think a lot of people pulled out at the last minute.
*  Yeah.
*  Probably when they heard.
*  No.
*  But who was the guy that was like was like not Jadakiss who was Jarl rule was doing with him.
*  I mean, if you have trouble on anything, it's not going to be well.
*  Was Jarl rule one of the organizers?
*  He I think he was just like one of the faces of it.
*  I don't know if he put money in it or not.
*  Right. Like you gave him a piece of it or something like that.
*  I don't know.
*  He was there.
*  They brought all these influencers out.
*  And I mean, listen, if he pulled it off, it would have been pretty good.
*  I mean, he did have everyone post at the same time.
*  Like was that that orange box or something?
*  So like everyone saw it and they were like, oh, what's this?
*  And then all these like rich kids are there and they're like crying.
*  I mean, honestly, the fire festival was for all of us.
*  That's what it was.
*  Right.
*  For all of us to see all these kids crying and these FEMA tents.
*  And there's just it was amazing.
*  It was amazing.
*  See if you can find his videos or he's trying to promote fire festival to say he's walking down the street of New York City saying that all so many tickets are already sold.
*  And if you want to think they sold a lot of tickets, I'm looking to buy one and I can't find the website to buy them.
*  Not that I want to go.
*  I just want to see what might not even be real.
*  He might be completely insane.
*  There's a lot of press about it about fire festival to post on multiple websites.
*  This was all happening.
*  It could have just been a press release.
*  Right.
*  Where where is fire festival to get in Mexico on April 25th or 20?
*  Oh, my God. I hope the cartel this year.
*  No coming up.
*  Yeah. This year coming up.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  Who the fuck is going to go to Mexico for a fucking fire festival?
*  That's crazy.
*  Just go to Cancun.
*  It's so much closer.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Festival.
*  Go to Puerto Vallarta.
*  You don't have to go to fire festival.
*  What's the place that all the kids go to?
*  Tulum.
*  They love to party in Tulum.
*  Yeah. Have it.
*  Have it there.
*  I don't know why Tulum.
*  That's not one.
*  That's like one of the major places where they have those Aztec ruins, I think, or Mayan ruins.
*  I don't know why Tulum is like the big.
*  It's like we're like beautiful hippies.
*  And psychedelic people go.
*  They go to Tulum.
*  They do a lot of Instagram posts.
*  I mean, that's all.
*  Everything's about an Instagram post.
*  I was watching this lady and her boyfriend the other day were walking on the street and they had basically taken up the entire street.
*  The girl was sitting on this like marble bench and she was posing and you couldn't walk in between the two of them.
*  And he was like 12 feet away from her.
*  So it was like, like, what is this?
*  You're just stopping.
*  And it was a long photo shoot.
*  Like it went on for a couple of minutes.
*  It was fucking stupid as shit.
*  She kept changing her her pose and her face and the angle that he photographed her at.
*  I wanted to take his phone away.
*  Like, hey, fuckhead, get out of the way.
*  Yeah, they do that.
*  I was in CVS and they were doing a sketch and everyone's like, you got to get out of here.
*  A sketch.
*  Yeah, there's a bunch of people with cameras and they were trying to do a sketch and they were screaming.
*  And this girl was like this girl behind the counter is a nice girl.
*  And she's also like a little bit slow.
*  So she's trying to get these people out of there.
*  It's just like chaos.
*  I get why people steal in CVS because nobody helps you.
*  And you're like, I will just steal.
*  It's just you're better off stealing than waiting there for somebody to come help you.
*  It's just a nightmare.
*  The amount of people that I've seen working at those kind of stores that have like some sort of odd wound.
*  An eye wound?
*  Odd. Some odd like something like their head looks oddly shaped and like they get hit with a brick.
*  Like something off.
*  Well, that's where veterans go to work.
*  They send you back.
*  To CVS?
*  Yeah.
*  Really?
*  I don't know.
*  You just make that up?
*  I make a lot of stuff up.
*  There's so many of these fucking sketches and pranks that people are doing now on YouTube.
*  It's like everybody, if you look at kids today, like they did some sort of a survey where they asked kids like,
*  what do you want to be when you grow up?
*  And most of them said famous.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, you could get famous opening like unboxing videos.
*  Like, I mean, if you could do that, why wouldn't you want to do that?
*  I mean, I'd have a kid just to see if they could do that.
*  Well, you know that kid on TikTok, Keith Lee?
*  Do you know who he is?
*  He just reviews food.
*  No.
*  With sort of a monotone voice.
*  He's actually brothers with a, he was an MMA fighter himself and he's brothers with Kevin Lee,
*  who was a top UFC contender at one point in time.
*  He just does these like sort of monotone videos where he reviews food.
*  Is he like?
*  Super popular.
*  Wow.
*  Like how many?
*  It's like, why even go to school if you can just unbox a video?
*  One of a kind study shows that 27 million paid creators operating in the U.S.
*  11.6 billion of them working full time as creators.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, I mean, it's like.
*  Is that a number one job?
*  If you're from another country and you're like, why don't we just bomb America?
*  That might be.
*  That's crazy.
*  Isn't the number one job driving vehicles in the United States, which is one of the things they're really worried about when it comes to automation,
*  because that's one of the first jobs it's going to go.
*  I've seen those cars where they're operating.
*  There's no one operating them and they're just driving.
*  They're weird.
*  OK, number one occupation retail salesperson is three million home and health personal care is three million as well.
*  Three bit both of them at three million seven hundred thousand general and operations managers three million five fast food counter workers three four show them all.
*  What's interesting is the retail and the home health aides.
*  They're the same people doing both jobs because they can't afford to live just one job.
*  So drivers isn't even in the top 10.
*  That's interesting.
*  I thought it was like number one of the top ones.
*  So Cook's is two million seven and that's number 10.
*  Stockers order fillers to eight.
*  And so influencers was what one million.
*  That's what it was.
*  One one point eleven.
*  Eleven.
*  Wait a minute.
*  So that's more than that.
*  So what the fuck.
*  So go back to that chart again.
*  Eleven point six.
*  It's like the top four combined almost.
*  That's crazy.
*  So it's the most common job.
*  So why is it saying retail salesperson.
*  It's like literally three times more common than that.
*  I have to dig into where they're getting their data from I guess.
*  But wow.
*  Yes.
*  This retail has been the most common job in the U.S. since 1997.
*  Not anymore bitches.
*  That's crazy.
*  So that means that influencer or content creator whatever the fuck you want to call people.
*  That's me too I guess.
*  That's the number one job.
*  Number podcasting.
*  I used to have a joke back when it was just reality shows that there's going to be a reality show about a cameraman on a reality show.
*  Somebody's filming him.
*  Someone's filming the cameraman on reality.
*  What a crazy job.
*  You are a cameraman on reality show.
*  And then someone's going to say but who's the cameraman behind the cameraman.
*  Right.
*  And then it's going to be like two mirrors facing each other with the United States is going to be filled with just camera people filming other camera people.
*  I'm into it.
*  It was a joke but it's kind of true now.
*  Like once because I back when I said this this is like you know two thousand something when I was on Fear Factor there was no social media stars.
*  It didn't exist and social media itself didn't exist.
*  But now that it does now that you see the impact that it has and how many people are making a living as air quotes content creators it's kind of fucking crazy.
*  It's incredible.
*  Yeah it's a totally new market that emerged out of nowhere.
*  And according to that thing at least it's the number one job in the country.
*  Yeah I mean it makes sense.
*  People are making a ton of money off of it.
*  That's why people are like filming every single thing that they do.
*  I'm just putting it on Instagram or Tick Tock.
*  Well they learn from the Kardashians that it doesn't even have to be interesting.
*  No it doesn't.
*  You just have to have a new scene every five seconds.
*  It's just like something crazy if somebody's fighting like a fight.
*  That helps.
*  Yeah.
*  But it doesn't even that doesn't even matter.
*  All you have to do is just constantly switch angles.
*  Do you ever watch a reality show.
*  The scenes constantly change.
*  Just switching.
*  My wife watches that stupid fucking Kardashian show.
*  I watch it too but sometimes it's so monotone.
*  Like it's just one monotone person to another monotone person.
*  She just likes the clothes and the pretty houses.
*  I mean listen I've watched the Kardashians.
*  I get it.
*  But the point is every like five seconds the camera changes angles.
*  You never have like what like a podcast.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just you and me the only thing that changes is your camera's on when you're talking.
*  My camera's on when we're talking.
*  Sometimes it's both of us talking on camera.
*  I mean I wish Kris Jenner was my mother.
*  I mean the way she's made these kids so famous like could you imagine telling your kids to fucking have a sex scene and then release it.
*  Do you think that she did that.
*  Yeah she absolutely did that.
*  For sure.
*  I think so.
*  Really.
*  I'm pretty sure.
*  I reserve judgment.
*  I think she did and I think it was the smartest thing she could have done for all their careers.
*  Definitely worked.
*  Absolutely.
*  And then everybody has sex.
*  Right.
*  If you want to watch go watch.
*  Go watch it.
*  Yeah.
*  Like you would never think a mom would put that out there but it was like pretty brilliant.
*  My mom would never do something like that for me.
*  Well you know she's a little unconventional.
*  Sure.
*  Yeah it takes an unconventional woman to like release your kids sex tape.
*  She kind of turned her husband into a woman and basically made the entire clan super rich.
*  All even Rob is rich.
*  Super rich.
*  They're all rich.
*  Crazy rich.
*  Yeah for no reason.
*  Because of that sex tape.
*  Right but like that is kind of the seed.
*  It is.
*  Yeah.
*  Ray J was more famous than Kim when they did that.
*  Right.
*  And now Ray J is like nowhere.
*  I didn't know that.
*  Like if his mother also was on top of it with Chris he could have been a bigger star too.
*  Nobody gives a shit about Ray J anymore.
*  That's crazy that he didn't capitalize on that.
*  Because his mom wasn't like Chris Jenner.
*  Right but why didn't he figure out a way?
*  Because like what is.
*  I don't know.
*  What's unique about her way of thinking?
*  I think it's just Kim is very pretty.
*  That helps.
*  He's a good looking guy though.
*  He is a good looking guy.
*  Got a big dick.
*  I assume.
*  You know I never saw the video.
*  How dare you lie to me like that right to my face.
*  That he has a big dick?
*  No you never saw the video.
*  I didn't.
*  I saw the video but I didn't see his dick in it.
*  What did you see?
*  I think I saw it too late.
*  I see it years later.
*  Did you black out?
*  I see it years later.
*  I checked it out too late when the dick wasn't in it.
*  What?
*  The dick was removed eventually?
*  I think the dick was removed.
*  Come on.
*  I don't know.
*  I've been searching for it pretty hard.
*  I bet Jamie can find it right now on Pornhub.
*  Let's see.
*  Can you find it?
*  Pornhub is blocked in Texas Joe.
*  Oh no.
*  Well you know what?
*  You gotta have certain laws if you want to have free guns.
*  Why can't you.
*  Why is it blocked in Texas?
*  That's the weirdest thing.
*  It's not blocked.
*  You just have to have proof that you're 18.
*  How do you prove that?
*  You have to upload.
*  Your license?
*  Yeah.
*  You have to upload it generously that you're over 18.
*  You have to have proof.
*  Okay.
*  I guess.
*  Well I'm gonna go home and search it.
*  Well porn addiction for kids is a real thing.
*  I dated a guy that had porn addiction.
*  Yeah?
*  What happened?
*  I mean we broke up eventually.
*  He was also a little autistic.
*  And then he went to see a sex therapist and I think they were fucking so I guess she fixed it.
*  What?
*  He fucked his sex therapist?
*  Jesus Christ.
*  For real?
*  I mean that's what he told me.
*  I don't think he's lying about it.
*  What a bitch.
*  Yeah but you have to like, it's like any other addiction, you have to like stop doing it.
*  I didn't even know he had it.
*  I'm just focusing on the sex therapist.
*  Like how crazy is it that she's fucking her clients.
*  Maybe her boyfriend wasn't fucking her at all and she was like at least someone's obsessed with it.
*  Well maybe.
*  Give it to me.
*  Maybe that's how she cures you.
*  Because if you're horny, if you're like a healthy person who's just horny normally and the person you're with is not horny at all and you're exhausted by that but you're a sex therapist and then you're talking to some guy who's a good looking guy and he's like I wanna fuck all the time.
*  That's the thing with-
*  And she's like you know what I wanna fuck all the time too.
*  Sure.
*  But like with porn addiction you're so used to, like he would have like 300 screens open at once so one person to him is boring.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  So that's what like porn addiction is.
*  Wait a minute for real?
*  I'm exaggerating but you need like a lot of different things open and it probably has to get more and more progressive for you to like get off.
*  Wow.
*  Well that's where it gets real weird right?
*  Like you start getting into like the darker side of porn.
*  Like violent porn and choking and gagging, spitting and slapping and abuse.
*  Sure.
*  Tying people up.
*  That kind of shit.
*  Like cause if you're just getting your jollies, if you're not just trying to masturbate and have a little fantasy, you wanna like, it's gotta get darker and crazier and crazier.
*  It's gotta like really freak you out.
*  But that's why I think you have all those screens open.
*  You're watching all of it at once.
*  You're getting tiny dopamine hits from 100 choices.
*  Right.
*  So then like just having sex with-
*  And then your therapist calling you up, get over here.
*  I got 300 other therapists here.
*  You're a naughty boy, get over here.
*  Yeah.
*  So I mean-
*  How did she say, how did he say that it started with the sex therapist?
*  I don't know.
*  He didn't tell me like the specifics of it.
*  We had been broken up already and we like remained friends and he just told me that they started sleeping together.
*  Jesus.
*  That seems crazy.
*  That's like prison guards fucking the prisoners.
*  I mean if I was in prison I would try and fuck all the guards.
*  What else are you gonna do?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I would do everything.
*  I would become Muslim.
*  I would like become trans.
*  I would do everything I could do in prison.
*  Right. Just mix it up.
*  To pass the time.
*  Yeah, especially if you have a long sentence.
*  If you're there for life, I'm down to do everything.
*  Yeah.
*  I'll do license plates.
*  Of course.
*  I'm gonna do hair.
*  I'm gonna cook.
*  I'm gonna do everything there.
*  Of course.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's weird how many people are in prison.
*  I mean we went over this the other day.
*  How many people are in prison in the United States compared to like the rest of the fucking world.
*  It's like we have the highest percentage of people that are in prison I think of any country in the western world for sure.
*  I mean you got, China's hard to count because you have essentially slaves.
*  Well also in China they all live in like tiny boxes anyway which are prisons of their own doing.
*  Yeah.
*  Well like you wouldn't say necessarily that the people that make your iPhone are slaves.
*  But they're literally sleeping in dorms and they put nets around the building to keep them from jumping off.
*  Right.
*  So how do you get in prison?
*  How do you get in prison?
*  In China?
*  At least in prison they probably like give you less hours than the Foxconn workers.
*  Sure.
*  Probably get better food.
*  How many people?
*  End of 2023 the US had 1.8 million people in prison which is more than any other country.
*  China had the second highest number of prisoners with about 100,000 fewer than the US.
*  But the thing about China again like it's not just the amount of people in an actual prison.
*  You have to think about the actual people that are slaves.
*  US is the highest incarceration rate in the world.
*  724 people per 100,000.
*  England and Wales has an incarceration rate of 145 per 140,000.
*  And Russia has 581 people per 100,000.
*  So Russia's nipping at our heels.
*  Russian people are fucking crazy though.
*  US has longer sentences than many other countries which contributes to the high incarceration rates.
*  I wonder how many other countries have private prisons too.
*  That's the dark part.
*  Well that's how you make the money.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Profit.
*  Profit off of people.
*  I remember when I found out that prison guard unions were lobbying to keep marijuana laws
*  because they wanted people to be in jails.
*  Like what?
*  Yeah because they want to make money.
*  Money.
*  They need that job.
*  They need those contracts.
*  So many countries have private prisons including the United States has the most private prison in the world.
*  158 facilities in 30 states.
*  Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia.
*  Australia, high percentage of privatized prisons.
*  New Zealand, United Kingdom, Scotland, Wales, South Africa, Japan, Brazil.
*  When did they start with the private prison thing?
*  Like who?
*  What fucking monster?
*  Okay Google this.
*  What was the first private prison?
*  What fucking monster didn't see the road ahead when you allow people to profit off of people being locked up?
*  What monster didn't see you're going to just have people lock more people up?
*  1984.
*  These motherfuckers.
*  It's George Orwell.
*  Literally it's Orwell.
*  I would have thought it was before that.
*  No it's a fairly recent thing.
*  Prison used to be something that we used to have because we had to lock certain people up to protect them from society.
*  And instead it became hey I think I can make money.
*  I think I can make money off people in jail.
*  They're using people like batteries to generate money.
*  This thing says Louisiana privatized.
*  It's penitentiary.
*  I don't know if there's a big differentiation between that.
*  1844.
*  Privatized, which was run as a factory.
*  Yeah inmates were used to produce cheap clothing for enslaved people.
*  Wow.
*  That's crazy.
*  You're producing clothes for slaves.
*  I mean that is basically just Xi'an.
*  That's what they're doing in China.
*  Right.
*  All those clothes that are like two dollars.
*  Yeah that's weird right?
*  You can buy a total knockoff of a designer dress for like four bucks.
*  I know.
*  It's great.
*  I love it.
*  They're being.
*  I think you love it.
*  I think there's a documentary on that that I was watching.
*  My kid was watching and I walked in on it.
*  Was it like the Xi'an documentary?
*  Yeah they were talking about these people like they lost the contract because they weren't able to produce things as fast as this company needed them.
*  And it was just all about the knockoff industry over there.
*  So if you're a designer you make that top that you're wearing and people like it.
*  They'll just take that top and copy it exactly and sell for five bucks.
*  You know and you're like what?
*  It's fifty nine dollars on my website.
*  Why are there not knockoff iPhones?
*  There are.
*  Not only is there a knockoff iPhone, there's a knockoff Apple store in China where every single item is not really Apple.
*  But it works just as good.
*  It does not work as good.
*  I doubt it.
*  I mean why wouldn't they cut corners?
*  They're already lying to you.
*  I know.
*  Why wouldn't they put a cheaper chip in the laptops?
*  Wouldn't they put cheaper screens?
*  If you want to use like Gorilla Glass and AMOLED displays.
*  That's just expensive.
*  Use some cheap ass you know five year ago bullshit and just sell for morons.
*  If it lasts for a couple years that's great.
*  Five year old bullshit still works.
*  Yeah.
*  It does.
*  It's not great though.
*  I mean I drop my phone all the time.
*  Try to register with the Apple store and they're like nah player.
*  That's hated iPhone.
*  That's why you need riots so you can steal the stuff.
*  It all comes back to that.
*  Stealing all this stuff.
*  But someone's got to make the stuff.
*  Slaves.
*  Yeah in China.
*  In prison in China.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean what percentage of, let's ask this.
*  What percentage of our electronics is made in China?
*  Probably ninety five percent.
*  Well a lot gets made in Japan and South Korea.
*  Like Sony.
*  Huge.
*  Samsung.
*  Huge.
*  They're probably one of the biggest electronics makers.
*  They make everything.
*  They make refrigerators.
*  They make like smart refrigerators where you can like check your refrigerator with your phone.
*  See what the fuck's in there.
*  To make sure your refrigerator is like not doing something.
*  Yeah.
*  Checking on you.
*  Keeping an eye on that motherfucker.
*  What's going on in there?
*  What are you doing?
*  How many ice cubes have you made?
*  You lazy bitch.
*  Where's my fucking ice?
*  Look at ice.
*  Ice cubes from your refrigerator.
*  From your freezer.
*  Are they the dirtiest ice cubes of all time?
*  Like I don't ever want those in my glass.
*  I just remember all though I think Apple stuff is all coming from China.
*  You nailed it.
*  Oh yeah.
*  All the stuff that gets made actually gets made from Apple.
*  That's all China.
*  Laptops and computer monitor.
*  China supplies 92 percent of US imports.
*  Phones.
*  China supplies 74 percent of US phone imports.
*  So Samsung does not use China for phones.
*  And I don't know if it's an ethical thing or what.
*  But I think they make their phones in India and somewhere else.
*  Maybe Vietnam.
*  Is there a correlation between them like stopping killing baby girls in China with making all of this stuff?
*  Or like let's keep them alive so we can have them make these products?
*  No I think they just woke up and said we have like 85 percent men.
*  Right.
*  These poor women are fucked.
*  They have to keep fucking all these guys.
*  There's not enough women.
*  They have to live with like three or four guys just to balance it out.
*  Gross.
*  Take turns.
*  Competition.
*  They're not as highly competitive in China it sounds like.
*  Hmm.
*  They relocated some of the manufacturing from China's Southeast Asia to avoid high labor costs.
*  What?
*  Those slaves are expensive Adrian.
*  Samsung also hasn't been able to compete with Chinese brands like Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo in the Chinese market.
*  Interesting.
*  I've never even heard of those brands.
*  Yeah they make, Xiaomi makes like high end Android phones.
*  In the rest of the world Android phones are huge.
*  I know.
*  Because everybody uses WhatsApp.
*  They don't really give a fuck about my message.
*  WhatsApp is like big in the Hispanic community too.
*  Yeah WhatsApp is huge.
*  I have friends that only talk to me on WhatsApp.
*  I do too.
*  Yeah.
*  Like well Zuckerberg owns it.
*  You know he owns it.
*  But I don't talk to him other than WhatsApp.
*  He's a WhatsApp.
*  But he owns WhatsApp.
*  You talk to him on WhatsApp?
*  Yeah I talk to him on WhatsApp.
*  What does he say?
*  We talk shit about things.
*  Yeah he's like what's up?
*  He's a nice guy.
*  He really is.
*  He's a billionaire.
*  He's a nice guy.
*  It's when someone's like really rich like oh that guy's not a person.
*  Yeah but he didn't start out rich though did he?
*  No.
*  Of course not.
*  He vented Facebook.
*  Some people start, some people are rich and they like had their families had money the whole time.
*  That's weird.
*  Yeah.
*  That's weird right.
*  Because then you're insulated from birth and then you go right into a deeper layer of insulation where you're like completely.
*  And money.
*  Yeah yeah completely disconnected from people.
*  That's when you get into like Bill Gates category which I let's figure out a way to block out the sun.
*  You're so rich where you're like I really want to fuck shit up for everyone.
*  Imagine like I was reading this thing about Bill Gates's idea to block out the sun and oopsies.
*  Oopsies Jamie.
*  Sorry.
*  No worries.
*  It happens.
*  I'll clean it.
*  I'm a woman.
*  I'll clean it.
*  I know my place.
*  Like he would they were talking about Bill Gates has some plan to stop global warming and like shoot particles into the air to block out the sun.
*  And people like hey do you know how many fucking people are on earth you can't just come up with that idea and try it.
*  Like what about the rest of us?
*  You only need vitamin D.
*  But imagine being so ridiculous.
*  You're so wealthy that you think I could just block the sun.
*  I kind of love it.
*  I kind of love that this guy's so nuts.
*  He is nuts.
*  And then you're like I'm just going to stop like water from happening.
*  Like you're just going to like I love so many other things they can do that much damage to the world.
*  I think people should just stop eating meat and then he just like tries to get everybody to eat stupid fucking fake meat.
*  That's fine but imagine like blocking out the sun.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yeah. He's also buying farmland to do what?
*  Who fucking knows?
*  Probably grow his fake meat food.
*  Like GMO shit.
*  Yeah. Well fake meat is made out of plant protein.
*  And so you have to grow plants.
*  I never had it.
*  It's nasty.
*  I bet it's disgusting.
*  The thing about it is like if you want to have healthy vegetarian food go eat Indian food.
*  It tastes delicious.
*  It's good for you.
*  And it's vegetarian.
*  Like it just doesn't have to pretend to be a cheeseburger.
*  Right.
*  The fake cheeseburger stuff is all seed oil.
*  Just eat legumes and whatever you're going to eat.
*  Yeah. If you can do it.
*  Like if you can if you want to eat healthy and have delicious food Indian food is the way to go.
*  There's an Indian food restaurant in Woodland Hills I used to go to all the time.
*  There's this cool place it was like everybody spoke Hindi and you went in there and like you had to like just guess what you're eating and point everything was vegetarian.
*  That's pretty scary to me.
*  Oh super super authentic.
*  It was like there's this weird offshoot Indian community and so they had like this Indian grocery store and then in the back of the Indian grocery store they had this cafe and it was all Indian food.
*  It was really good though.
*  They use a lot of spices too.
*  Oh yeah.
*  They know how to spice the shit out of those vegetables but it was good.
*  It was like delicious vegetables.
*  It's pretty healthy.
*  It's very healthy.
*  It's like vegetables and like all that stuff's pretty good.
*  Also they use a lot of turmeric you know like curcumin and all those spices and like that's all anti-inflammatory turmeric.
*  I mean you have to be close to a bathroom but like it is pretty good.
*  Let's go.
*  You gotta be ready to go.
*  I'm gonna eat this on the run.
*  But that's my point is like if you want to fucking eat vegetarian if you want to eat vegetables only there's a way to do it that tastes good and you don't have to pretend you're eating a fucking burger.
*  Those burgers are nasty.
*  I guess you just feel left out.
*  Like what is the point of pretending to eat that?
*  Well it's because the people quit eating meat.
*  Right.
*  I understand that.
*  No they quit and then they want the meat back.
*  They wish they could have the meat.
*  Oh well you can pretend you're eating the meat.
*  It even bleeds just like a burger.
*  Gross.
*  It's all gross.
*  Just eat a burger or eat beans and whatever you want to eat.
*  It's also super duper unhealthy for you.
*  It can't be healthy to manufacture it like that.
*  It's so processed.
*  If you want to eat vegetables this is how you eat them.
*  Come on the ground clean them up.
*  Put some spices.
*  Cook them.
*  That's a vegetable.
*  You know running through fucking machines and glop it up with oils and extract things and compress it and shut the fuck up.
*  Ever see what Tempe looks like?
*  It's nasty.
*  I know my friend was eating it one time and I was like that looks disgusting.
*  Ugh.
*  I was watching the production of tofu like from scratch with all these machines.
*  Why would you ever think that's natural?
*  And tofu doesn't taste good.
*  I mean I know it picks up the flavor whatever it is but it's like on its own it has no taste.
*  No.
*  On its own it has no taste.
*  It's a crude source of protein that doesn't have a lot of amino acids in it.
*  It's not as bioavailable.
*  But you can live on it.
*  You can live on vegetables.
*  You can do it.
*  It's just not advisable.
*  You just don't have energy though.
*  No you're missing so many things.
*  You're missing creatine.
*  You're missing a bunch of amino acids.
*  You're missing vitamin B12.
*  There's a bunch of things you're going to have to supplement with.
*  You know there's ways people supplement that can mitigate some of that.
*  Algae is a good one because algae is kind of a life form that's different and you can get certain vitamins from algae that you can't get from just like plants that grow above ground.
*  This sounds disgusting.
*  It does sound disgusting.
*  You know what vegans should really consider adopting into their diet?
*  Mollusks.
*  Because mollusks are actually more primitive than plants.
*  You got to go over the fact they move.
*  Because Venus fly traps move too.
*  Would you feel bad about eating a Venus fly trap salad?
*  If you do, you're a cuckoo person.
*  You're not just a vegetarian.
*  You're a cuckoo person.
*  Now you think the Venus fly trap is smarter than like cabbage?
*  That's stupid.
*  That doesn't make any sense.
*  Do vegetarians not eat any vegetables either?
*  Aren't there some people that believe like all of that?
*  Oh, fruitarians.
*  That's a fruitarian.
*  So then what do they eat?
*  Well, those people eat cancer.
*  They die.
*  I mean, that's crazy.
*  That's so bad for you to just only eat fruit.
*  You're overwhelmed with sugar.
*  You're eating sugar all day long.
*  Sugar should be something you have every now and then, I think.
*  I mean, I think sugar is generally it causes all sorts of inflammation.
*  It's not really good for you.
*  It tastes great, but it's not good for you.
*  You mean like fruit sugar or like?
*  Even fruit sugar.
*  I think you should get fruit sugar in the form of fruit only.
*  You definitely shouldn't get it in orange juice.
*  Orange juice is no different than drinking a Coca-Cola.
*  But what if it's like 100% just orange juice?
*  Doesn't matter.
*  Your body's not used to processing all that liquid sugar.
*  Yeah, exactly the same way.
*  Maybe even worse because some like my daughter once got one of them little apple juices from Disneyland.
*  And she looks at she goes, Jesus Christ, this has 18 grams of sugar in it.
*  Tiny thing.
*  Yeah.
*  Like what is a Coca-Cola, Jamie?
*  Is it 30?
*  Let's guess.
*  How many grams of sugar do you think Coca-Cola has in it?
*  Probably about 40.
*  40?
*  38.
*  I say about 30.
*  What do you think, Jamie?
*  Like 30-ish?
*  39.
*  39?
*  OK.
*  That's it?
*  Sorry, that's what it is.
*  OK.
*  So what is 12 ounces of orange juice?
*  12 ounces of let's say fresh squeezed.
*  So you think you're eating healthy.
*  Fresh squeezed orange juice.
*  You still have to be better off having a fruit juice over a Diet Coke.
*  Or not a Diet Coke, a regular Coke.
*  Not much.
*  Well, there is, they're both fructose, right?
*  About 30.
*  30.
*  Yeah, real similar.
*  Real similar to a Coca-Cola.
*  You do get vitamin C. You get that.
*  But if you want orange juice, you should get it from eating oranges.
*  Because that's what your body knows what to do with that.
*  Your body gets a slice of orange and goes, I don't do this.
*  OK, so let me ask you this.
*  If you're drinking orange juice, how come your body doesn't recognize that as an orange?
*  Because it's going straight to your liver.
*  OK.
*  There's no breaking down of fiber.
*  There's no, and you're getting a dose of equivalent to like eating eight oranges immediately.
*  OK.
*  Your body's like, what the fuck is this?
*  That's why soda's so bad for you.
*  Sure.
*  Your body's like, what the fuck is this?
*  Well, I stopped eating sugar.
*  Totally.
*  I only have like fruit.
*  But like other than that, I don't have any like cookies or cake or any of that stuff.
*  How do you feel?
*  I feel better.
*  I mean, I lost a ton of weight.
*  You did.
*  You look great.
*  Thanks.
*  How much do you lose?
*  From the last time I was here, probably like 45, 50 pounds.
*  But I also was working out too.
*  How do your joints feel?
*  They must feel so much lighter.
*  They do.
*  But like I have a friend who's like losing weight.
*  It doesn't matter how much you weigh.
*  It doesn't weigh on your joints.
*  And I'm like, you know that's like my weight.
*  That doesn't make any sense.
*  I know.
*  But you just kind of have to let people think that because what am I going to do?
*  Fight with you about it?
*  Just OK.
*  She said it doesn't make a difference.
*  It doesn't make a difference how much you weigh, like on your knees.
*  A guy or a girl?
*  A girl.
*  Hmm.
*  And I was like, OK.
*  I'm just like I was staying at her house too.
*  And I was like, I'm not going to fight with you about this.
*  I used to notice the difference when I was fighting, when I would lose weight, when
*  I would compete.
*  So I used to weigh like a hundred pounds.
*  And I had to compete at 140.
*  And just that 15 pound weight you felt.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I felt so light.
*  I felt so light on my feet.
*  You feel a total difference.
*  Well, I work out with a vest.
*  I put a weight vest on.
*  So it's a 25 pound weight vest.
*  And I do like all these body weight exercises.
*  When I get that 25 pounds doesn't seem like much.
*  I get that thing off me.
*  I'm like, oh.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, my back, everything feels better.
*  Of course.
*  Your joints, everything.
*  You're overstrained.
*  You're overstrained.
*  You're overstrained.
*  You're overstrained.
*  You're overstrained.
*  You're overstrained.
*  You're overstrained.
*  You're overstrained.
*  I'm like, bro, if you could lose weight, you could kick through a fucking building.
*  But I think your knees are just like, we need a break.
*  Destroyed.
*  Right.
*  But they will get a break.
*  They're going to get a break because you're going to lose 400 pounds.
*  If you lose 400 pounds, sure.
*  I mean, if I was looking at his legs, I'm like, the muscle you must have in your legs.
*  You go upstairs.
*  You know, like, Ralphie was performing in the...
*  I don't know how many people are going to be able to do that.
*  I mean, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,
*  you have to go upstairs.
*  You have to go upstairs.
*  You remember the belly room of the store?
*  That's a fucking staircase, old school staircase.
*  But I mean, how often are you doing that?
*  Well, he's walking a lot because he was always walking.
*  Just walking.
*  Imagine if, OK, I weigh 206 pounds and I weigh consumed output more than the other
*  people here, is that going to be the best we can offer?
*  Yeah, it is.
*  Imagine if, okay, I weigh 205 pounds.
*  If I had to put on a, what did Ralphie weigh in his prime,
*  if you had to guess?
*  I have no idea.
*  500 pounds.
*  If I had to put on 300 pounds, imagine if I,
*  and I'm in shape, imagine if I had to walk around
*  the Comedy Store with a dumbbell on my back,
*  or a barbell on my back with 300 pounds on it.
*  Okay, but I mean you're not.
*  I can make it like 30 steps, then I have to put it down
*  and take a break for like five minutes,
*  and then try to pick it up again, and I'd be exhausted.
*  This dude's just walking around all day like that.
*  But if you're walking around that much,
*  you're gonna lose a lot of weight too.
*  He almost lost that much weight.
*  That's what you lost?
*  Yeah.
*  He weighed almost 800 pounds.
*  Yo.
*  And just walking up the stairs at the Belly Room,
*  he lost 300 pounds?
*  Just once, one time.
*  One time?
*  That's crazy.
*  Why are we not having all the fat people walk?
*  Wow.
*  He used to weigh over 800 pounds.
*  He underwent gastric bypass surgery,
*  and lost 350 pounds, but has struggled with his weight.
*  He blew out his gastric bypass twice.
*  Well, the thing is, with a lot of people
*  that get those surgeries,
*  if you're not figuring out the reason
*  why you're overeating like that, it doesn't matter.
*  You can still gain the weight back
*  if you eat small meals all day long.
*  I have friends that have gotten it,
*  and you just eat small meals all day long,
*  and you're just still gaining the weight back.
*  You at least maintain your weight.
*  You can't keep as much in there at a time
*  as a giant plate of food.
*  No, but if you eat little meals all day and graze,
*  you'll gain the weight back.
*  I know people that have had that surgery,
*  and you're like,
*  oh, you just gained a lot of your weight back.
*  Right, so they're not eating because they're hungry.
*  They're eating because they're crazy.
*  There's something wrong.
*  Right, it's like the same way people abuse anything, right?
*  Like if it's alcohol or sex or drugs,
*  it's the same thing, right?
*  You're trying to numb out and fill a void.
*  So if you don't actually address that,
*  you're not going to just stop eating.
*  So someone told me this.
*  Find out if this is true.
*  Does Bruno Mars owe the MGM a ton of money from gambling?
*  Is that true?
*  I've seen the story where someone claims they were there.
*  Yeah, I've talked to someone who claims it's,
*  someone who would know who claims it's true.
*  But isn't that crazy, if true,
*  that even a guy like Bruno Mars,
*  who's just super wealthy, super famous, super talented singer.
*  It doesn't mean you don't have issues, though.
*  Right, but the gambling one is a nutty one.
*  It is.
*  Well, my dad was a gambler.
*  He has no debt.
*  Because MGM probably made some sort of a deal.
*  Right.
*  Because doesn't he have like some sort of,
*  he has no debt with MGM.
*  Wink, wink.
*  So they have a deal.
*  So what is, they have some sort of a,
*  he has a residency there, right?
*  I think so.
*  The word is, I don't know if he's got a gambling problem.
*  My dad was a gambler and like he made no money.
*  It's the craziest thing to be a gambler when you have no real money.
*  Oh, it's a crazy one.
*  It's a crazy addiction.
*  It's an addiction that I first saw when I started hanging out in pool halls
*  when I was 23.
*  I became addicted to playing pool.
*  Okay.
*  I was playing it all the time.
*  I blew my knee out.
*  I needed to get knee surgery.
*  And when I blew my knee out, it couldn't work out.
*  So I had to wait for surgery.
*  And so like my ACL was all fucked up.
*  And so I just started playing pool with one of my friends
*  and I became addicted to playing pool.
*  And I would go there all the time because as a comedian, I didn't have a job.
*  I just would go on stage at night.
*  And during the daytime, I'd hang out in pool halls.
*  And at nighttime, I'd hang out in pool halls.
*  And I just got around these people that I had never known anybody like that before.
*  Just fully addicted to gambling all day long.
*  They would go to the racetrack.
*  They would go to off track betting.
*  My dad used to take me to OTV as a kid.
*  That's brutal.
*  And that's when they used to let you smoke.
*  You just come home smelling like smoke.
*  It's disgusting.
*  Me and my sister, we would hang out with my dad in the OTV for hours.
*  I feel like such a good dad.
*  Yeah, you're a way better dad.
*  It wouldn't be bad if my dad was gambling and he was like, you know, he was a mailman.
*  You can't do both of those things at the same time.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a crazy one.
*  Who was it that told us that the dad was gambling so hard they lost their house?
*  Fuck, I forgot the whole story.
*  You don't hear a story very rarely about a gambling addict who kills it and they retire in Vegas.
*  No, because you keep going until you eventually lose everything.
*  Yeah, it's a dark one.
*  Did you see Uncut Gems?
*  No.
*  You should see it.
*  Well, you might be too close to home.
*  It doesn't matter.
*  It's Adam Sandler's, I think, best movie ever.
*  And it wasn't even a comedy at all.
*  It's a drama.
*  He fucking kills in it too.
*  It's so good.
*  I have heard other people say that.
*  It's so good.
*  I gotta watch it.
*  But for me, having known those people, it's so filled with anxiety because it's a sports betting thing.
*  Sports bettors are the craziest ones because there's so many different ways to bet.
*  You can bet the spread.
*  You can bet parlays.
*  You can do all...
*  My dad, for a while, my dad was taking money from his pension, which like, yeah, so when he died, there was really not that much money.
*  My mom was forcing him to go to Gamblers Anonymous while he was also still gambling.
*  It's not gonna help.
*  If you don't really want to stop, right, if you don't want to stop, you're not gonna stop.
*  I think food is the hardest one because food addiction, you always have to eat food.
*  Right.
*  All the other ones, you can kind of just not do them anymore.
*  That's why I stopped eating sugar because once I start eating it, I can't stop.
*  Right.
*  So then once it's like out of your system, you don't crave it anymore.
*  Well, that's because your gut bacteria changes.
*  That makes sense.
*  Yeah.
*  What is it, Candida?
*  Is that what it is?
*  Is that what it is?
*  There's a specific type of gut flora that consumes sugar and it thrives on sugar.
*  And with people that eat a lot of sugar, it's very prominent in their gut bacteria.
*  And it literally changes your brain.
*  It changes your chemistry.
*  It changes your mood.
*  I mean, doesn't sugar also just like a breeding ground for cancer, like when you have cancer?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  One of the things they tell you if you get cancer.
*  Stop sugar.
*  Stop all sugar or get on a ketogenic diet.
*  So get your body to eat high fats.
*  Go into ketosis.
*  You eat a lot of macadamia nuts and things with, you know, things you get a lot of fat
*  from.
*  And just that's your body starts burning fat, which you feel so much better when you live
*  like that.
*  Your brain works better.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  You're just like in a brain fog.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  For me.
*  I mean, you know, I'm Italian, so I grew up eating pasta and bread and pizza.
*  It was like common.
*  And when I stopped doing it, when I went like on a carnivore diet, the first thing that
*  I thought that was really bizarre was I wasn't hungry during the day.
*  I got I never got this like famished starvation feeling.
*  Well, because isn't it like you're if you're eating stuff that's like high in carbohydrates
*  like that, your doesn't your blood sugar like drop really quickly and stuff?
*  Yeah, spikes when you eat.
*  It's like it's insulin.
*  Your body produces a ton of insulin.
*  And you want you want your body to run on ketones.
*  If your body runs on ketones, it's just like it works better.
*  Your thought.
*  One of the things that I noticed, like almost immediately was like when I came in to do
*  podcasts, I was much better at it.
*  My my brain, like just as a from a performance enhancing perspective, my brain functions
*  better.
*  I can form sentences better.
*  If I was eating like a lot of sugar, you almost get like that same hungover feeling as if
*  you drink like that were like if you binge eat sugar and then the next day you're like,
*  oh, my God, I feel so hungover.
*  It's similar.
*  Yeah, it's similar.
*  Like there's something to it's not as extreme because you're probably not dehydrated to.
*  But yeah, your body's like, what are you doing to me, man?
*  What are you doing?
*  It's not good.
*  It's not good.
*  Not at all.
*  But it's so delicious.
*  Like it is so fucking good.
*  Why are you eating it?
*  I know.
*  Why are you eating it?
*  God, that's how my dad felt gambling on the horses.
*  I feel so good.
*  And then what he so they would send us to Catholic school and he would like not pay like
*  tuition and then they would call me in to like talk to me.
*  And I'd have to go talk to my dad.
*  And he was gambling money away.
*  Yeah, my dad was always gambling.
*  I think people need some excitement in their life, you know.
*  Sure.
*  And it's like, why are you doing that?
*  What are you trying to numb out?
*  Because God knows what he was.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like everyone's kind of trying to fix their problems from their childhood or they're not.
*  There's that.
*  But I think with gambling, it's also its excitement.
*  Yes.
*  I'm addicted to just having a purpose and having excitement.
*  Your purpose is to figure out when the Knicks are going to win by 17 points.
*  Sure.
*  And if they win, you win.
*  And then, yes, I'm alive.
*  It like spikes.
*  Like you just like that feeling of like winning and then that feeling of losing.
*  That's the craziest thing about the Adam Sandler movie.
*  There's a moment in it, spoiler alert, where he does make this big win.
*  And so with this big win, he's going to be able to pay all these people off.
*  They're trying to kill him and he immediately doubles down and puts it on another.
*  And you're like, what the fuck are you doing?
*  Because that's the thing.
*  You're chasing that high constantly.
*  I had a friend who's a huge gambler and like he lost so much money and no matter how much he gambles,
*  he's up $15,000, he's still chasing that $8 million loss.
*  So it doesn't matter.
*  He's constantly chasing that big loss.
*  And like no matter how much he wins, he's like, yeah, but I still lost all that other money.
*  So I'm going to keep chasing this.
*  My good friend Dana White is a gambling addict.
*  And also if you're super rich, you just have more to lose.
*  Oh, yeah, he goes hard.
*  We went to visit him at Green Valley.
*  Was it Green? No.
*  River, Red Rocks, Red Rocks.
*  We went to visit him at Red Rocks.
*  Jamie and I went.
*  And when we got there, he was $600,000 down.
*  When we got there.
*  That's crazy.
*  Playing blackjack.
*  But at the end of the night, he stayed till like six in the morning.
*  He was $600,000 up.
*  So he won that money back and then he got him for $600,000.
*  That's crazy.
*  He's there all the time.
*  He loves it.
*  He loved but he's worth like, you know, I don't know what he's worth.
*  Hundreds of millions of dollars.
*  Right.
*  He can get away with that.
*  Sure.
*  Now my dad is making 40 grand a year.
*  But it's not even a wealthy guy.
*  You would think you're that wealthy.
*  Why would you want to gamble?
*  You know, it's just the why would you want to do nothing that replicates that feeling that you get when you're like winning or losing.
*  Yeah, it's a real drug.
*  For sure.
*  And it's a weird one.
*  It's a really weird.
*  It's like it hijacks like your human reward system that's built to solve problems and overcome adversaries and, you know, conquer and get conquered.
*  Like it's it's hijacking that little part of your brain.
*  I kind of want to gamble right now.
*  Right now.
*  Let's just fucking go.
*  If you were a gambler, what do you think your game would be?
*  Whenever I do it, it's just like slots.
*  And I really that's the dumbest.
*  I know because I don't really know how to play blackjack or anything.
*  I'm just like, I'm going to lose all my money.
*  Well, you want to learn, though?
*  I would like to learn.
*  Yeah, I did learn blackjack a little bit.
*  My friend was teaching me.
*  I think I could learn blackjack craps.
*  I'm like, you might as well be trying to teach me how to read, you know, the weird one to me is like someone who puts all the money on the red or black.
*  Oh, roulette.
*  Yeah, that's a nutty one.
*  It is because don't you have to get the number?
*  How do you even like how do you even bet on that?
*  It's such a chance.
*  I think there's a bunch of different ways you can bet.
*  I think you can bet red or black.
*  You can bet specific numbers.
*  I think there's a bunch of different ways.
*  But if you wanted to like bet at all, red or black, I think you can.
*  I know that like 100 grand on one roll.
*  I think it's going to come out red.
*  I don't know.
*  I just like the feeling you get putting say you put 100 grand down and then you lose and you're like, no, that's my children's tuition.
*  There goes our house.
*  But that thing, it dicks people.
*  I mean, that's the argument why casinos shouldn't be everywhere because people would just everywhere they would be falling into gambling addiction.
*  For the most I mean, casinos like there's one in Yonkers in New York.
*  It's so depressing.
*  It's just all old people that are there on disability just sitting there and they're doing that thing.
*  The slots.
*  The slots and you're smoking.
*  I know.
*  Just waiting to die.
*  It's very sad.
*  You're waiting to die.
*  Yeah, it's a dark thing that you just sit these people in front of those things and just they press buttons and all the lights are going on.
*  So the little brain is getting activity.
*  Ding ding ding ding ding ding ding.
*  My mother told me that my grandmother was like a big gambler and she also didn't have money.
*  It's crazy.
*  People who are poor gambling and she would lose the money all the time like the rent money.
*  My grandfather used to hit her.
*  Oh, I know.
*  I was like, I guess he didn't hit her hard enough to learn because she kept doing it.
*  It did work.
*  She just kept doing it.
*  My grandmother used to run the numbers for the mob.
*  Interesting.
*  Yeah, she actually went to jail.
*  She went to jail for like six months.
*  You really are Italian.
*  I didn't even know you're Italian.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  My grandmother, she was addicted to the numbers and she would always talk about the numbers like I was going to bet this that that but this one came through and I changed my mind.
*  She was always like change your mind.
*  That's gotta be the whole time where you're just like, should I do this number?
*  Should I do that number?
*  It was most conversations I had with her were about either ghosts, psychics or the numbers.
*  Do you I mean do psychics work because when you think they can predict the numbers?
*  Yeah, I think psychic phenomenon is an emerging property of human consciousness that's not quite there yet.
*  I think that language didn't develop overnight.
*  I think eyesight didn't develop overnight.
*  I think psychic connection between human beings is a it's a real thing that nobody I think some people are better at it.
*  They have more of a gene for it or more of a it could be like a biochemistry thing.
*  It could be a psychology thing.
*  There's there's something that you connect to sometimes where you know something.
*  Right.
*  But you don't know why you know it.
*  There's when you know someone's going to call and then they call you thinking about someone they call you.
*  I think that's real.
*  I think it's just not you can't put it on a scale.
*  I think the problem is it's too ethereal.
*  It's like too ephemeral rather as to it's not quite there yet.
*  But I think it's an emerging thing that's happening.
*  Would you want to know the day you're going to die if you could find out?
*  No.
*  Would you want to know how you're going to die?
*  No, no.
*  I'm interested in while I'm alive just living.
*  I would like to know the day.
*  I wouldn't want to know.
*  I don't want to know.
*  Because then I would just take a lot more chances.
*  You'd be freaking out the last few days.
*  Sure.
*  But like I would probably do a lot of stuff now if I knew I was going to die at like 70 or 80.
*  We probably are going to die at 70 or 80.
*  You don't know for sure.
*  Well, technology could come along and extend.
*  Because then I would try and see if I could die before just like run across the highway.
*  Really?
*  Just beat the system?
*  See if I could beat the system.
*  You can always jump off a bridge.
*  Imagine that.
*  George Washington Bridge.
*  If I was going to do it, that's the one.
*  That's the bridge to go off of.
*  Do people do that?
*  I'm sure they do.
*  But you got to do it when it screws enough people like Labor Day weekend or something.
*  Just hold that traffic up.
*  I had a friend who jumped off the Golden Gate.
*  I guess he died.
*  He did.
*  Do you ever see that documentary about the people that live?
*  No, I haven't seen it, but I've heard of it.
*  I know about it.
*  It's interesting because some of the people that lived are like as soon as you jump you regret it.
*  Yeah, of course.
*  It's like your body's like freaking out.
*  It's like, oh my God.
*  You have three seconds to think about life before you plummet 75 miles an hour into the ocean.
*  They always stop traffic too on the bridge.
*  Which is weird.
*  Right, because you're like they're already dead.
*  So you pop out of the water and land in the middle of the road.
*  Just go on the ground and look for them.
*  What are we doing up here?
*  Why can't I go over the bridge?
*  Why are you stopping traffic on the bridge?
*  I guess it's to make sure that nobody pushed them.
*  Look for evidence of fingernails clawing at the poles.
*  Sure, but the highway's fine though.
*  I agree.
*  Just look on the edges.
*  I think whenever they get a chance to shut things down they like it.
*  One time I got hit by a car, a drunk driver, and they shut the highway down.
*  All the cars are there and you kind of just throw like, it's amazing.
*  This is all from me.
*  We did this.
*  Yeah, fuck you.
*  It's kind of weird.
*  You guys are picking your kids up.
*  Yeah, sorry.
*  Because this drunk driver decided to hit me.
*  Oh, guess you're going to shake your pants.
*  Sorry, not going to make it home in time.
*  That's true.
*  Fuck yeah, it's true.
*  I had a drunk driver hit my car and then ask me if I would help them push their car off the highway.
*  Oh, that's adorable.
*  Yeah, he was so wrecked.
*  How drunk was he?
*  I don't know.
*  He went away in handcuffs, but like he had an Audi and it wasn't even his car.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  He was undocumented.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  I don't even know if he, did he have a license?
*  I don't know, but it was crazy the whole situation.
*  He was like, hey, can you push me off the highway?
*  I was like, probably not.
*  God damn, dude.
*  That's how people die too.
*  A buddy of mine from high school died that way.
*  He was changing his tire, side of a highway.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  It's so dangerous.
*  People don't fucking pay attention.
*  They don't, especially if it's late at night.
*  Well, especially now.
*  This was many years ago before cell phones when this kid died.
*  But this like now, the odds look like when I see people on motorcycles, I'm like, God damn, that's so risky.
*  It's very risky.
*  So few people are paying attention.
*  I see people texting all the time.
*  Everyone is texting all the time.
*  I would rather drive with drunk drivers than people texting and driving.
*  Because they're always all over the road.
*  All over the road.
*  And not only that, the amount of space you cover.
*  Well, you look down at your phone for like a couple of seconds and type in a word.
*  The amount of space you cover if you go 60 miles an hour is really crazy.
*  Of course.
*  And then you're also not paying attention to the other people who are texting and driving.
*  Exactly.
*  It really is just like chaos.
*  Maybe I'll get home.
*  Maybe I won't.
*  Why don't we all have bumper cars?
*  Let me ask you that.
*  I think.
*  Wouldn't it be better if everybody had a big rubber thing all around the outside of the car so we could just kind of bounce off of each other?
*  Probably.
*  That would be a good idea.
*  But then you also need people to die because we're just too overpopulated.
*  That's where fentanyl comes in.
*  Fentanyl. Exactly.
*  Give everyone fentanyl.
*  Like if you were going to fix the homeless problem and you weren't going to use fentanyl, what would you do?
*  I'm giving them fentanyl.
*  Because it's like a nice way to go out.
*  Right.
*  It's quick.
*  It is quick.
*  And you're so happy and then you're dead.
*  They have Narcan everywhere though.
*  They just bring people back to life.
*  But the thing is it's like.
*  I never see Narcan anywhere.
*  If you weren't going to.
*  Like if you were like for real.
*  If you were trying.
*  If you were just objective.
*  You weren't looking at this in terms of like what's the kind thing to do.
*  And you wanted to clean up the homeless situation.
*  Well you have to spend a lot of money on mental health.
*  Right.
*  You know you have to like care about the veterans.
*  I like I have a whole joke about this on my special about like we don't really care about veterans.
*  And I've dated a lot of them.
*  A lot of veterans that like come back and they're so screwed up.
*  Yeah.
*  And we're not like actually helping them.
*  No.
*  And a lot of them end up on the street and they're crazy.
*  But they need like a lot of you know like mental health.
*  And they have to.
*  You have to like kind of figure out how to go back into society.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Like I've dated several veterans and like they're crazy understandably.
*  You know.
*  Understandably.
*  You can't go to war for like eight years and then come back and work at Target.
*  It's just not a way that that happens.
*  Right.
*  So you would have to be willing to like help veterans.
*  You have to spend money on mental health.
*  And you have that.
*  But this is the problem is like doing those things doesn't really yield a lot of money.
*  So people don't want to waste their money into it.
*  That's what's fucked up.
*  Right.
*  They do whatever they can get away with.
*  And if they get away with like using the veterans and not paying for them to be better.
*  They just do.
*  Also everyone's like well they can go to a VA hospital.
*  It's like I've seen how hard it is to get services from there.
*  And that's a person that's not really crazy and messed up from war.
*  Right.
*  So it's like you're making it so hard for these people that go and serve the country.
*  I know.
*  I talked to JD Vance about this.
*  Talked to him about psychedelics.
*  What did he say?
*  Well he wasn't aware of it honestly.
*  And so he was interested in it.
*  And hopefully now that he's actually the vice president I could connect him with some people that could perhaps show him some things and explain to him all the different ways that they've figured out especially in other countries like in Mexico to help veterans.
*  Ibogaine is a big one.
*  Ibogaine, cell-cybin, ayahuasca, all these different psychedelics have shown to have remarkable effects.
*  Even for depression I think people take it.
*  They microdose.
*  Yeah.
*  Well not just microdose.
*  Like the Ibogaine one is I've never done that but what I understand it's like almost like a 24 hour.
*  You want some water?
*  It's like a 24 hour experience.
*  Thank you.
*  That shows you like a movie of your life.
*  I don't want to see that.
*  Well it shows you apparently and this is just me hearing what other people told me.
*  But it explains to you why you have these problems and shows you what developed.
*  Where the issue started.
*  And by seeing that you could figure it out.
*  You go oh okay well I won't do that anymore.
*  Now I get it.
*  Now I get what this hole I've been trying to fill is.
*  I don't need to fill the hole anymore.
*  But that's the thing.
*  I feel like I know what was probably wrong in my childhood.
*  I know that but it doesn't like fix me.
*  Right. It's different.
*  It's not just knowing it.
*  It's like seeing it at almost like a subatomic level.
*  Okay.
*  Like seeing the process.
*  Seeing what's going on inside of you and recognize that this is a very bad path to follow.
*  Not just knowing it and still doing it.
*  Not just like not being able to get out of a habit.
*  Not being able to get out of a pattern or behavior.
*  But to see like the source of it.
*  The path where it takes you and the right way to go.
*  And to see it laid out.
*  Where you go oh I could just do this and just like let that go and move on and be a better person.
*  Be a healthier person.
*  Be happier.
*  Yeah.
*  And so many people that I know have done that.
*  They've stopped drinking.
*  Stopped opiates.
*  You know opioids is a big one.
*  It's a big one that it helps.
*  Ibogaine does.
*  And Ibogaine is like completely non addictive.
*  Apparently it's a terrible experience and nobody wants to do it again.
*  Ibogaine?
*  Yeah.
*  You do it.
*  What is it?
*  It's from the iboga tree which is an African tree that has it's a very bizarre.
*  I don't know what category of psychedelic it's in but it's not technically it's not like psilocybin.
*  It's not which is mushrooms.
*  It's not like dimethyltryptamine which is ayahuasca.
*  It's something completely different.
*  Some different pathway.
*  But particularly effective.
*  Again I've never tried it but everybody I've talked to that has.
*  Particularly effective in curing addictions.
*  Interesting.
*  I've never heard of that.
*  Yeah.
*  I know quite a few guys.
*  My friend Ed Clay.
*  He actually opened up a place in Mexico because he hurt his back.
*  He's a jujitsu guy.
*  A lot of jujitsu guys fucked their backs up.
*  Like my back is all fucked up.
*  And then they probably get hooked on like the liitle shit.
*  Yeah.
*  You get an operation or you get a pill.
*  You know you need some pain pills because you literally can't tie your shoes.
*  Because your fucking back is flared up.
*  And the next thing you know you're hooked.
*  And thanks to the Sackler family.
*  Those sweeties.
*  They need so much money though.
*  Those fucking monsters.
*  We were just talking the other day about they started the Valium thing too.
*  They were responsible for the Valium thing in the 1970s.
*  Same family.
*  It's a family of demons.
*  Sure.
*  Just fucking monsters.
*  And no one's in jail.
*  I watched the documentary I guess it was about the Sackler family.
*  Was it the Netflix one?
*  I don't know.
*  There was a couple.
*  There was one on I think Hulu.
*  And then there was one also on Netflix.
*  Yeah there was Dope Sick.
*  I watched Dope Sick.
*  What was the Netflix one called Jamie?
*  Painkiller.
*  Is that what it's called?
*  That's the Peter Berg one.
*  Peter Berg came in and explained it all to us and talked about the documentary.
*  It's fucking great.
*  It's so good because it's like they're such demons.
*  And just to know that people like that exist and walk among them.
*  That's it.
*  Painkiller.
*  Well listen, speaking of Netflix.
*  Matthew Broderick fucking kills it in that too.
*  Go watch my Netflix special.
*  Yes.
*  The Dark Queen.
*  The Netflix special.
*  Tell her.
*  Where'd you film it?
*  We filmed it at The Seller.
*  Oh nice.
*  Nice.
*  That must be good for you right?
*  Comfortable?
*  Yeah just because I'm used to it.
*  But I gotta tell you like your club is amazing.
*  I love it.
*  Thank you.
*  I would definitely film something.
*  Well we love you too.
*  Yeah I would definitely film my next one there.
*  Everyone's been trying to get you to move here.
*  I'm not sure if you're going to be able to move here.
*  I'm not sure if you're going to be able to move here.
*  Oh shit.
*  I'm going to come here probably like a little bit in December and then I'm going to LA to
*  promote The Dark Queen and then I'll be here in January.
*  Oh shit.
*  I know.
*  Nice.
*  And I'll be seeing Marshall all the time.
*  So the last time I talked to you about this was in the bar at Mitzi's.
*  You, me and Bridget.
*  That's right.
*  Ari's been like.
*  Do we push over the top?
*  Well Ari was like said the meanest thing to me.
*  Want to see the text that Ari sent me?
*  Sure yeah.
*  He sent me a text.
*  Like Adrian's come to Austin and convinced her to move there.
*  He's telling everyone that.
*  He goes well fine just be a feature the rest of your life.
*  I was like alright Ari.
*  I get it.
*  I'll find it.
*  There's too many.
*  There's too many god damn...
*  But Ari is excited for the special he's like I think everyone's going to be really upset.
*  I was like I hope so.
*  Listen I want people to like it because I want to do this for healing.
*  For healing.
*  But for healing I don't want to be a drug addict.
*  I don't want to be a drug addict.
*  I want to understand what it means to be a drug addict.
*  Really.
*  I want to be a drug addict.
*  I don't want it.
*  I want to go into that career.
*  I don't want to start a business.
*  There's too many goddamn
*  But ari ari's excited for the special he's like, I think everyone's gonna be really upset. I was like, I hope so
*  Listen, I want people to like it
*  But I also know that like it's triggered topics that people are gonna be upset by of course, but that's your specialty
*  I know it's weird. You like doing that, but that's the thing. I think people think i'm trying to like be dark
*  It's just kind of who I am. Well, you joke around like that off stage as well, right?
*  Yeah, like and I think nothing of saying it
*  Well
*  If you were raised by a guy who took you to a smoke-filled off-track bedding when you were a little girl
*  When little girls want to go to the park and hang with their friends and instead you're around a bunch of fucking gamblers and degenerates
*  I mean, yeah, my uncle was a hell's angel. Like it's just my whole everyone's crazy in my family. Yeah
*  So it's like the way you make fun
*  Yeah
*  And I had a friend in grammar school that killed himself and we all went to the funeral and then went out after and all
*  Of our sense of humor is so dark and you're like, oh, that's also where I got it. Where was this?
*  Uh in the bronx the bronx. Yeah
*  Well, the bronx is that's a high sense of humor type of place because there's just so much fucked up things going on
*  Right and everyone's like kind of poor
*  Yeah, and they have the darkest sense of humor because they've experienced the most
*  My mom also has a dark sense of humor. Really? Yeah, so like it's it's just that's kind of passed down. I think
*  Well, I think your mom probably experienced a lot of fucked up things too obviously and she was married to your dad so that helps
*  But like my dad cops have the most fucked up sense of humor joke around with cops once they get comfortable with you
*  Oh, yeah
*  They see the worst shit all day long
*  Of course. Yeah, they have the most fucked up sense of humor sort of firemen 100%
*  Yep, anyone that has like a high
*  Anyone that has a high p what is it ptsd? Yeah, and I date a lot of guys with ptsd
*  That's your thing and then I just give them more
*  It's a cycle of ptsd
*  All should be hospitalized and institutionalized. Do you meet guys after shows?
*  Like how do you meet them?
*  Like they kind of have to know what you do before they see you otherwise they're gonna go. Oh, Jesus christ
*  I mean i've had people like that
*  I think the tour preparing for the special was hard because it was just people coming out that didn't know my sense of humor
*  And if you don't know that and you're taking a chance on me
*  I'm not like that person to take a chance on right or I think sometimes they're like supporting a woman and i'm like
*  I'm not the right woman to take a chance on and support
*  You're just not gonna be happy
*  You're gonna be so mad at you. I've had people walk out. I did that military joke in texas
*  Yeah, and like 20 cowboys just walked out and I wasn't even saying anything bad about the military
*  I'm like, we just don't care. We don't care about them
*  Some people are just dumb and they see it as they're this is my chance to make a protest
*  Let me just get up right now
*  But they they hung in so long through the show whereas like that one was it. Yeah, it was probably 50 minutes in
*  Did you crack jokes about jesus at all? Sure and they were fine with that
*  Maybe they were on they didn't walk. Maybe jesus put them to the edge of their sheet
*  It's interesting because both sides have woke things they're upset about
*  Oh, yeah, you know I walk people about ukraine the middle east
*  I was doing jokes about the middle east and this lady was like next
*  I used to have this joke about the second coming project
*  The second do you know what the second coming project was?
*  No, it was a thing that they were trying to do remember when dolly the sheep when they first cloned dolly the sheep
*  Yes, well the idea was that they would take a genetic material from the shroud of turin and they would clone jesus
*  Great do it my joke was well
*  The cloning is not an exact science
*  Like if you want to do it now like they had to do like 20 dollies before they got one dolly like pro is real
*  a lot of them come out all fucked up like
*  What happens if you clone jesus and he comes back with down syndrome?
*  And so this the whole joke is about following jesus around and he's you know wearing a hockey helmet and
*  Turning dog shit into cookies. So did they actually do it? No, they never did
*  It's kind of a bullshit thing but um this lady goes next subject and I just kept going on with it
*  I was like, no religious people are so weird to me. It's not even a religious thing
*  It's just some people just they don't want to hear wild things
*  They want to don't want to hear things you're not supposed to say they don't hear them all day at work
*  They come out at a comedy club and they want to sort of apply
*  Their sensibility but like if you're willing to believe a wild story like that
*  How about believe this other wild thing could happen too?
*  Well, the thing is it's not it wasn't totally a wild story. I think it was people that were ignorant as to the science
*  That were proposing it because they thought this would be the pathway to bring jesus back
*  What is jesus going to be doing anyway?
*  Well, who knows?
*  I mean depending upon what that means, right if that is the pathway let's let's just imagine
*  Okay
*  Everybody is thinking. Um, if you're really religious you believe that one day we'll have the rapture and jesus will return
*  Okay, so
*  if
*  God created us in his image and god instilled in us an insane sense of curiosity that has led people to create things
*  like genetic engineering
*  And cloning and then we have an understanding of genetic material
*  Not where we are now
*  But maybe in a future sense where you could literally get a cotton swab from a person and reproduce them
*  Sure, like they that's all they need or cotton swabs all they need for 23 and mate, right?
*  You get a little swab in your mouth and they sell your data to china and then
*  But that i would never do that. I did it. I just want to know what's going on. Those are all things. What did you find out?
*  Um mostly italian, um some irish, uh, one percent asian 1.6
*  African one percent asian one percent asian 1.6 African. Yeah, I think the asian is probably like gangus khan shit
*  I think gangus khan just fuck so many people. It's just gotten to so many people so many different places crazy. It's crazy
*  Yeah, that guy fucked everybody he had um
*  There we've talked about it before but I always forget the number
*  There's a certain percentage of people on earth that have his dna and it's astounding. It's an astounding number. It's pretty cool
*  Well, he also killed 10 of the population while he was alive. Yeah, that's why he was like repopulating them
*  Well took a lot of slaves sex slaves they called called them wives back in those days it was different
*  But when they would conquer people he'd just take their wives take everybody's wife
*  And I mean it sounds like the thing you should do
*  That was his move
*  It's not bad. It's interesting all these years later and you know, he's thought he's not thought of as a monster
*  He thought it was like an historic figure
*  Yeah, I mean it was like hitler times 100 like sure he was fucking insane like
*  They used to light bodies on fire and then use them as catapults they would launch them onto roofs to burn the roofs down
*  That's uh, that's how they would scare people just take victims crazy
*  A crazy way of like doing that. They did so many insane things
*  One of the things they did was when they would capture a city
*  they would take the generals and all the all the different people and they would
*  Create a platform and lay all these people out and then stack the platform on top of them
*  Then they would all climb on top of the platform and eat
*  So they would eat lunch while they were crushing these people to death slowly
*  That's crazy. Were the people dead already? No, no, no, they killed them that way
*  Yeah, I think that's how he killed royals
*  That was his move for killing royal people like instead of just slaughtering them outright and hacking what they would just kind of crush them
*  They had a bunch of different ways that they would kill people they would take
*  When they would capture people they would use those people at the front of the line and pushed them towards their own army
*  So they would sack a city capture a hundred thousand people
*  Take those hundred thousand people and put them at the front line and press them to go further into the city
*  And those people would just get slaughtered in front of them and they would eventually
*  Kill everybody there. That's crazy. It was so crazy that there's a guy named dan carlin
*  He's got an amazing show called hardcore history. He's got this one episode called the wrath of the con
*  It's not it's five episodes
*  But this one series and it's all about kingis khan and one of the stories is about the shah of charisma
*  Um, this shah is making a he's making a trek to jin china to like to see like what's going on over there
*  Like what do you guys got talk to the king and see what's happening in your your whoever the fuck's running your city
*  And as they're going there, um, the roads were so fucked up
*  With decayed bodies that they had abandoned the roads because all their wagons were getting stuck in the mud
*  Of decaying people and they looked in the distance
*  They thought it was a snow-covered mountain that they were looking at way in the distance
*  It turned out it was a pile of bodies
*  They killed a million people and just stacked them on top of each other in the middle of the town
*  They killed the entire city. They killed everyone. That's crazy. And there's no one to clean up the bodies
*  They just left the bodies they didn't give a fuck they just kept moving it's wild
*  Imagine living back then. Yeah, I know you're
*  Your wheelbarrow is getting stuck in someone's head. I know yeah
*  If people were taking gender studies in class today
*  Back then back then they were fucking just running for their lives
*  It's crazy. Yeah
*  I guess that we get to do stuff that's sometimes so dumb and like people are like just fighting to stay alive
*  Well, it's also interesting that like over time that becomes less and less acceptable
*  Like the horrors of gaza when we find out about it today, like everyone's outraged
*  Back then wouldn't be the same type of horrors obviously because they didn't have missiles but horrors are just horrors. It's just sure
*  Yeah, you're just killing people. Yeah
*  It's so it's way grosser today
*  Well, it's because we also have photos and everything of it right from like back then they they saw it
*  In real life, which is way worse. You had to be there to see it, right?
*  Right, but if you were alive in 1200, let's imagine you and I were alive in 1200
*  How many people do you think we would have seen get slaughtered with swords and arrows and shit in front of us by now?
*  Probably a ton become desensitized. It becomes a it becomes a thing like when I first started watching a walking
*  Uh, what is it? Yeah walking dead walking dead. You're like, I can't believe they just did that and then two episodes in you're like
*  Oh, this is normal to me. Yeah, it's got to be kind of been like back then you watch someone's head
*  Get blown off and now you're like, oh, yeah, that's just like a tuesday
*  Yeah
*  people get real accustomed to things and if you're real accustomed to barbaric living and slaughtering people and
*  Lighting them on fire and launching them and catapults onto the thatched roofs of these houses and watch them burn, right?
*  You can't imagine not doing that if that's all you say what you do. Yeah, that's what we do
*  That's just what we do. Yeah, they didn't wash they wore their clothes until they rotted off of their skin
*  Yeah, I mean I think if they're like catapulting dead bodies, it's like who cares what you're wearing
*  Sometimes they just lived off the blood of their horses. They would just drink the horse's blood and that's what they sustain themselves with
*  But then you just need your horse
*  To like yeah horse keeps eating you don't kill them
*  You just cut a little nick in their neck and you just suck a horse's blood. Mm-hmm
*  Yeah, that's what they would do they would take it and put it in a jug you really could survive like if you were just
*  Somewhere by yourself. Yeah, you could you I don't think I could but I think you could survive
*  I would need stuff. See the thing about horse you need stuff
*  You need you need physical things like you need shelter and knives and you need something you start a fire with
*  You need something that you can hunt with sure, but if I had that same stuff, I would be dead and you would thrive
*  I wouldn't thrive
*  You would survive for a little while. I didn't know you could drink horse's blood
*  Yeah, but you got to keep that horse alive and then you have the horse is gonna die
*  The horse is eating dead people. It's dead. The horses don't eat meat
*  They don't know they do occasionally eat the birds. What if they're starving? They won't eat like a person
*  No, no, they're not even interested in rotting bodies. They're they're herbivores, but they do occasionally
*  So much there's this really fucked up video of this horse following this bird or as a cow
*  Following this bird around I've seen horses do it too where they found like a ground nesting bird and they just eat it
*  And the mother bird's like flying at them pecking at them like shut the fuck up. I'm eating your baby
*  At least she tried deer do it all the time
*  Deer do it. It's so bad. Like they had this net that they used to catch birds
*  Um, and um the deer found the birds in the net
*  And so the deer would just go up to the net and feast like like a grapevine, right?
*  Like a buffet eat all these birds
*  And that's when we sort of understanding that if a deer catches a bird slip and they just eat them
*  Yeah, why wouldn't you because they're eat plants? It's like, yeah, but like a bird is kind of like caviar to them probably probably
*  Yes a little foie gras
*  Don't mind if I do
*  Yeah, have you ever seen cows eat birds no find a video
*  Eat grass and they eat birds. It disturbs the shit out of people who are like peaceful. They're like, you know, I think
*  The less suffering we have the better but also a bird can fly away. It's kind of their fault. Well, not babies
*  Survival of the fittest you're dead. You're now dead. It's probably nature's way of keeping why wouldn't you put your birds?
*  Why wouldn't you put your bird dust higher?
*  It's on the mom look at this look at this cow finally. Yeah, he's going right into his mouth. Yep. Yep chomp chomp chomp
*  Oh yum. Yum. Yum. It's so weird that they decide that they want to eat that
*  Just weird. It's weird that they just decide look at the right. Why wouldn't you just eat the kid?
*  Yeah, if you're gonna eat that bird kid comes with people people have guns they figure it out after a while
*  You think so? They know the guns are coming. They know that people can kill them
*  I definitely think they know that people are in control. I don't think they feel a sense of uh power
*  Also, you can't eat that kid in one gulp, right people are gonna know right, right if you could just eat it in one gulp
*  Yeah, it's like who knows what happened to the kid. I don't know what happened to you
*  She says I didn't eat nothing. I'll help you look. Yeah
*  Let's all look
*  You have a shoe in your mouth. I'll help you look well
*  That was a legitimate concern for people hundreds of years ago. Your your kid would get eaten
*  Sure, if it's out in the yard wolves, I mean, that's like the big bad wolf. That's what all that shit was
*  Little red riding like your kid survives cholera and then it just gets eaten
*  I can't believe right like that's not even that long ago that people were dying of cholera
*  How many years you think that was?
*  Who knows? I mean how many different fucking diseases killed people just because of poor sanitation?
*  That's what a lot of that stuff came from. Sure a lot of that stuff came from poor sanitation
*  Let me just think about how many people were just dying
*  In these cities because of the plague because they throw their shit out the windows
*  I mean rats and bugs and yeah, I think I would learn pretty quickly if I threw my shit out the window once that like
*  That's not great
*  I think you would think that but there's people in india that shit in the street to this day
*  It's like I mean I watch a video where there's like a parade and they're just throwing shit
*  Like that's part of the parade that doesn't is that in india? Yes cow dung festival or something. Yes
*  Cow shit's like different kind of shit. It's gross, but it's not like human shit
*  I'm sure you don't think anyone's mixing human shit in at this dung festival. Yeah, I bet they're not I bet they're like
*  Hey, let's let's spice it up. Yeah, but it's not as clean as you think maybe oh
*  Jesus christ just throwing at each other
*  Imagine like this is what you sign up for and they're all smiling. I don't get the appeal
*  I don't know
*  Maybe you know maybe how like, you know, you if you eat a lot of sugar you get that candida
*  And maybe if you play with shit enough you get that shit bacteria
*  I mean their teeth look so white because they're covered in shit. They're just covered in shit
*  guys
*  Shower up. This is ridiculous
*  We have to deal with the infections with the cow. How are they not what is going on here?
*  We won't get any infections from the cow dung. He says wait. What does he say?
*  What was his statement the coronavirus and other viruses but back it up before that
*  Okay here heaps of cow dung are brought in one place. We all play in it
*  We have had to deal with the coronavirus and other viruses
*  So we believe we won't get any infections from the cow dung, okay
*  I mean you see this and then you're like, you know what? It's not that bad that we're doing unboxing videos
*  I mean, these are kind of these guys are basically
*  Content creators they are content creators, but they don't know that
*  They don't know that right we're watching these videos. I mean
*  Can you imagine just being in there and just throwing shit at someone? How do they not know now though?
*  It seems like it's just a teenage. I don't think that's an old video either. Do you see when um,
*  Like they give amazon tribes starlink and they give them phones. I just thought of amazon like that. I order stuff. Oh, yeah
*  Not the other one
*  I just want regular amazon that brings I order stuff from amazon
*  it's like a three dollar thing and somebody's driving to my house and dropping off like
*  Whatever it is floss. They figured it out. I never buy toothbrushes from the fucking store
*  I just I know click a link bam, but it's like so
*  I'm spending such a little money for stuff that someone's driving to my house to drop it off. Eventually. It's just going to be drones
*  I mean
*  Drop it off at your head drop it off at your house
*  And then there's people that's that's the those are some of the grossest people people that steal people's packages
*  Especially during the holidays don't even know what's in there. That's the fun you get in you're like this could be a tv
*  This could be an iphone. It could all it could also just be toothbrushes
*  There's so many funny videos of people getting busted, you know, i've seen them. Yeah
*  People are just stealing videos for like christmas if you live in a neighborhood where someone steals your packages
*  That's such a shitty feeling there's fucking people in your neighborhood that are clocking what's getting dropped off at your house
*  Yeah, chris rock used to have a bit about um
*  Putting uh if you bought a new tv
*  You had to be careful putting the box out on the street in the garbage because people know you have a new tv
*  And they want to break in your house to steal your tv. I mean now tvs are like worth nothing. They're worth nothing tvs
*  I remember in 1994
*  Uh 94 when I first moved here. I got a big tv for the first time it was fucking big
*  It was like this big 1994 was a great year. It was like 24 inches
*  But it was like yeah to pick it up like it was a giant ass tv
*  Like it had a whole back to it. Yeah, it was humongous and then it was one of those years like 94 95
*  They came out with a plasma tv and it was
*  20,000 and it was like 40 inches and flat and because it was flat it looked like shit
*  It didn't look good because it was 40 inches and flat. It was like
*  $20,000 I remember thinking that is the dumbest thing like i'm paying
*  $20,000 for this space behind the tv. Yeah, I don't care about the space behind the tv
*  Yeah, there's like six feet between the tv and the wall. What do I give a fuck?
*  There's an extra 12 inches of tv behind it. What are you stupid? You're gonna pay $20,000 because it's flat
*  I guess people want to hang it on the wall
*  It was a thing to let people know you had money. Yeah, you had a plasma tv, right?
*  See if you can find a plasma tv
*  From 1995 ish. They looked like shit. I think it was must have been 96 because that was when I first bought a house
*  They looked like shit
*  And they were
*  $20,000. I was like, this is crazy. They were so heavy those big tvs. Oh giant might not have been 20 grand
*  I might be exaggerating but it had to be like eight or nine and this was like again
*  95 ish how much did they cost back then? I remember the that tv right there the silver one where it like comes with its own
*  Stand kind of yeah
*  Yeah, that's when you go over to the person's house. That's that person has the uh, the super bowl party
*  Yeah, you gotta help have friends help you carry that in
*  So it's fujitsu in 95 fujitsu introduced the first 42 inch and it was how much money?
*  Price, I know I had it right there
*  Right there, uh sample price for the 42 inch jeep was
*  1000 or 1 million yen, but fujitsu aimed to sell it for about 500 000 yen per unit
*  What is that in dollars? What's 1 million yen?
*  In dollars
*  like 15 000
*  6000 so 6 500 bucks. That's still a lot of money. So it wasn't 20 grand. I exaggerated
*  A lot of money, but it was just the regular tv was like 100
*  How much is a regular tv? It wasn't that much money?
*  But if you had that you were the man like oh bobby must be doing really well in hollywood
*  Look at this
*  flat-screen television
*  Oh 10 grand by the year 2000 prices had dropped at 10 grand. Oh prices had dropped to 10 grand
*  So maybe it was what they started at?
*  Interesting see if it says up there. Oh 14 15 000
*  Okay, one of the first flat plasma tvs. I think it was a phillips that I saw
*  It was available at four sears locations in the us for 15 grand. Is there sears anymore?
*  I don't know. I haven't seen a sears forever
*  I remember when I was like a kid
*  I got like a sears credit card and I just bought like my ex-boyfriend at the time like rims for his car
*  That's what you just spend your money on. I don't even
*  I've sears is almost like the
*  The bernstein bears effect like the fact you said sears I was like, oh, that's a thing like I forgot about
*  But how could that not be a thing like sears was huge
*  Really, but do they have any lo there's no locations though
*  I mean, it's giving me a store locator, but it's not showing me on that
*  But that's a weird one like sears like that had left my memory until this
*  And then you saying it like even though I said sears available at sears then you started going sears
*  Oh, I remember sears and then I was like, I remember sears too. Do you remember nobody beats the whiz?
*  Do you remember that store? Yes. Do you remember crazy eddies? Yes crazy eddie was actually crazy. Yeah turns out there's nine left
*  Oh, wow one in puerto rico eight on the in mainland
*  interesting
*  We should take a road trip just to go to a sears. We should go the one in puerto rico
*  We should bring tony
*  That'd be amazing
*  First of all puerto rican's were not upset by I mean i'm sure somewhere but like my friends are like i'm still voting for trump
*  Puerto rican's can take a joke. Yes. They are some of the best shit talkers on earth. Absolutely
*  It's common in puerto rican communities. Just have fun and joke
*  Absolutely. It's not a super sensitive neighborhood. I was a super sensitive
*  Ethnic group no, but most people didn't care. They're like, I don't care. It was a stupid ding to do it there
*  But it turned him into a legend
*  As long as trump won
*  If trump didn't win we were gonna have to hide him for real. Yeah, I was gonna hide him
*  I was gonna move him to thailand or something to thailand. Yeah, he's gotta get out of the united states for how long though?
*  a while depending on how bad sideways things go if comel aris becomes president of the deep state takeover and they completely censor all social media
*  Remove everybody's guns force vaccinations on all your babies. Everybody gets a sex change
*  Who knows just in thailand and he's in thailand with lady boys
*  Just drinking his life away because he can't believe he fucked it up for one
*  Shitty laugh he could go live in puerto rica
*  You know, there were stories that were uh, ready to be published if trump lost blaming it on tony. That's crazy
*  Yeah
*  Yeah blaming it on that one joke in mass square garden where the facts is and tony will tell you
*  Actually puerto rican's voted 26 percent more for trump, which is true. They probably did than ever before
*  Yeah, well people were fucking fed up people were fed up. I didn't even vote none of this makes any sense
*  I mean, I think honestly most people right now their main concern is like they can't even afford groceries
*  Exactly, so they're like whoever I think is going to help me with that
*  Listen, I don't know what is true or not true. But like people who are like I can't afford to feed my kids
*  It is so crazy. I was watching this guy on msnbc and he was dismissing that
*  in terms of like
*  When people think a certain way like people have like a particular if they're a leftist or if they're a fundamentalist christian
*  They have one thing in common and that thing that they have in common is they want everyone to think like them
*  Sure, and this guy was saying that about like young people listening to podcasts and they're getting air quotes
*  radicalized
*  And that we need something that can do this from a feminist perspective
*  And teach young men feminism though. The whole thing was so strange
*  But one of the things he said that was the most strange
*  he said instead of like these minor grievances like the price of eggs or
*  Someone is teaching you some your kids something in history that you don't agree with instead of those minor things
*  What's major then man food for kids?
*  Also, like food for your family history and in history
*  Well, you know, he said something you don't agree with like what I don't know what that means, but education is primary
*  It's one of the most important things for kids. You got it for the view of the world
*  They have to be correctly informed
*  It really helps if you have a good education sure and then if you have food if you can afford eggs
*  That really fucking helps and this so this idea that these are minor issues and the important issue is connecting men to feminism
*  Listen you can do that if you want but like most people right now are like I can't afford to pay for groceries for my kids
*  I don't even have kids but like people are like I can't afford to buy groceries
*  Of course people are making more money now or like I can't save any money. Yes, everything's more expensive people are fucking out of touch
*  I'm clearly out of touch
*  Clearly, but I remember when I was poor. I understand it
*  I really do and I know what the fuck is going on and I know people are saying hey
*  This isn't a minor deal
*  This is like one of the biggest deals you guys fucked up the economy and you're gaslighting everybody and telling everybody you didn't
*  You guys have spent billions of dollars on a war that nobody agrees with hundreds of billions and you're gaslighting us
*  Yeah, I just also like these teachers that are just like spending all their own money for supplies. It's like what are you doing?
*  Crazy, why do teachers not have supplies for kids, right? And you're right. They are the future generation
*  So if they don't have food and they don't have they're not like being instructed and you know learning stuff and you have these schools
*  Where there's so many kids to one teacher the united states is like someone who owes you money and they say they don't have it
*  And they keep buying cars
*  Right, that's what it's like kind of like how did you have the money to spend all this money on another country?
*  When you don't have any money to spend on the education of I mean homelessness the veterans
*  Let's just pick education like how much could they fix education with a hundred and seventy five billion dollars
*  You shouldn't have a teacher that needs to buy supplies
*  Right and imagine this imagine if companies were incentivized like what if they got
*  Government grants based on how well the kids performed in the school districts. That would be great
*  Yeah, like literally make it like haliburton for schools like, you know haliburton
*  They blew up iraq haliburton comes in and cleans everything up
*  Have something that profits off these places getting better and the better they do in terms of dropping in crime
*  Education rates graduation rates college rates everybody gets more money figure that out
*  Figure that out. I mean they just want more money for prisons
*  They do that too. That's if you don't send it out spend on education
*  Then you could just have these people have to turn to crime and put them in prisons
*  And that's how you'll get money. There's a bunch of things they did in the 80s that still fuck with us today
*  And that's one of them. That's a big one
*  Then the 80s must have been so wild
*  Because there's no computers
*  And it's just like tv in the newspaper and everyone's running wild and reagan's the president. So nobody thinks anything's real
*  He got a fucking movie star as the president
*  JFK is dead. Nobody still understands that one reagan's was reagan's wife the one that was called the throat goat
*  allegedly
*  Yes, give her her flowers. I think she is the well, I mean
*  You could bestow that upon someone to besmirch their memory you could do that
*  It's hard to say is that necessarily a bad but also the kind of gal that can capture up a president
*  Probably knows how to get things done. Yeah. Yeah, that's not necessarily a bad thing good for her
*  I think it's a good thing. Yeah, it's a I mean every guy would agree sure. Yeah, it's a good skill for a lady to have
*  Then there's a problem. How'd you learn that?
*  Unless you're a savant first dick you suck. You're just like wow
*  Somebody had to just figure that out
*  They're like classes back in the roman days you think so? Oh, yeah
*  Probably probably guys showing each other how to suck each other off. Everybody was blowing everybody back then
*  They're just you know throwing bodies on fire and then also there's throat goat classes what their balls smelled like back then disgusting
*  I can't even imagine. Jesus christ. You'd probably put shit on their balls. You couldn't smell their actual balls
*  You're like i'd rather smell straight shit
*  So gross that has to be the worst mouth you ever see how they wipe their asses where in the roman times
*  Yeah, they would take a sponge that was on a stick. It was a communal sponge. Why did I just see this on like instagram?
*  Yeah, it's like just I think i'm I think i'm all set. I went to pompey
*  And uh, I took my family there a few years ago
*  It's really interesting because these people died like instantaneously and then they've sort of uncovered a lot of it
*  And one of the things that they uncovered was like this communal like shithouse
*  So it's just like these holes around this like a horseshoe pattern. These
*  Yeah like that
*  So these holes these dudes just sit there and just shot
*  into the ground so it's like kind of a
*  Toilet kind of idea, but I mean, I don't think there's any water and there's the sponge. That's the sponge
*  Look at the word. They had a name for it. How often do they zylospongium? How often did they change the sponge?
*  Oh
*  They couldn't change it enough even if you had your own sponge. It's not enough but like a month you're dunking into that fucking
*  Okay, hold on a second academics disagree to its exact use
*  About which the primary sources are vague
*  It has traditionally been assumed that a type of shared anal hygiene utensil used to wipe after defecating and the sponge is cleaned in vinegar
*  Or water sometimes salt water other recent research suggests. It was most likely a toilet brush
*  Yeah, I mean, they're probably cleaning a toilet and also your asshole. Yeah, maybe it was all those things
*  Middle of the first century roman philosopher seneca the younger reported that a
*  Germanic gladiator died by suicide with a sponge on a stick according to seneca
*  The gladiator hid himself in the latrine of an amphitheater and pushed the wooden stick deep into his throat
*  Yo
*  Did he take that sponge off first? No, he wanted to die that way. He wanted to suffocate himself
*  That's how much he didn't want to fight in the gladiator wars. He also shit stick
*  Means a thin steak or stick used instead of toilet paper for anal hygiene and was a historical item of material culture introduced through
*  Chinese buddhism and japanese buddhism a well-known example is I'm not even not even going to try to say that word
*  Where'd it go? Oh
*  I'm not even going to try to say that word
*  Well, an example, uh dry shit stick from the chan zen
*  I'm not gonna say that word in which a monk a monk asked
*  What is buddha and master yun men un man answered a dry shit stick?
*  buddha is a dry shit stick because everybody got a shit stick that had
*  Everybody else's shit already on it and you just smear an extra shit on your butt. It's like i'll just have my own shit
*  Yeah, you're dunking it in the water
*  But how clean is it really get and then it's just soaked in shit water and you're taking that and you're wiping your own asshole with it
*  I am glad that I was not I am glad I was not born during that time
*  What do you think people in the future are going to be saying about this time though?
*  What are they going to be most shocked that we did that was so stupid?
*  I don't know because if we're looking back at pompey, what was pompey what year did that go down?
*  67
*  67 ad yeah, it's pretty wild when you're there
*  It's it's weird because you get to see some of the bodies they preserved that are just completely frozen in place like the ash
*  Overwhelmed them and they're just like like almost like a little stone statue 79 79 ad
*  Can you show me some of the photos of the pompey victims?
*  So there's like people that are like just piled on top of each other like that's it like right there
*  They just were overwhelmed by ash
*  Just volcanic ash the volcano the heat and the gases just killed everybody like almost instantly just completely overran the town
*  It's pretty insane
*  Because it's just weird that
*  people
*  Don't know that
*  Like when they're building these cities they don't know that that can happen look look at that
*  I mean, I wouldn't know that that can happen. No, no one knew back then but I mean
*  We know now look look at that. That's so crazy. That's what it looks like
*  I mean, that's a human being that was just literally turned into a statue in place
*  Fuck
*  There was one where these two guys were embracing
*  And someone tried to say that it was uh, perhaps they were lovers and someone on twitter was a very funny comment
*  They're like jesus christ imagine dying in front of your friend. Then everybody finds it like oh I knew he was gay
*  Imagine like jerking off
*  Right you die in the middle of it. You have your dick
*  You have your hand on your balls and you're just fucking now frozen in time like that forever at least nobody knows who you are
*  That's true. Yeah, those are the guys. I don't know those people. Yeah, that looks
*  That's on the way down
*  Yeah
*  Fucked up way to go
*  Instantaneously like that's bob and tom and when I was a kid, um mount saint helens blew up
*  What year was that jamie?
*  Mount saint helens was in the pacific northwest and it was a big deal because it was an actual real volcano that killed people
*  In the united states and we were like, whoa
*  Like what I thought volcanoes were like in other countries 1980. So I was uh, not even in high school
*  Yeah
*  That was uh, that was a crazy one. How many people died from mountain elves?
*  57
*  Yeah, they they knew it was an active volcano, but they didn't think
*  But how's like people live on the side of active volcanoes like in hawaii
*  There's a bunch of people that live on the side of an active when I was in hawaii
*  I think there was um, one of the volcanoes did go off. Yeah, it happened when I was there, too
*  At the big island the big island is very active. There's crazy film of
*  Just lava overcoming this mustang have you ever seen it now there's a mustang parked in front of the street and the lava
*  Is coming from this eruption and it just slowly consumes the street and eats this car
*  Right in front of this dude's house like these people have been living there chilling their whole life coming home from school
*  Hi mom, i'm home. Does your insurance cover that?
*  probably not
*  They try to cover as little as possible if you live on the side of an active volcano like it's like hey
*  I'm gonna get volcano insurance. Yeah, that's uh, that's up to you player
*  But I want I want to have my expensive car. Yeah, I had a friend who um,
*  He had some crazy situation. I think he had like
*  Flood insurance, but he didn't have damage from water from a hurricane insurance
*  So like your roof can get destroyed from a hurricane and you don't have insurance for that
*  But you have insurance if like your pipes break like he got fucked in some sort of a weird loophole
*  What's weird to do with stuff like that anytime it's like an adjuster if you get the right adjuster
*  They can do whatever you want
*  But you have to get an adjuster who's gonna do it
*  Like I used to call and do like appeals for um health insurance stuff
*  And if you kind of sweet talk someone they might just put it through for you
*  You have to just keep calling back
*  Until you get an adjuster that's gonna give you what you want or you have to charm them in person. Yes. Yeah
*  That's what because they're just regular people right and they could decide
*  Absolutely, they hold so much power sometimes that's a crazy power to have right?
*  You can get your house fixed right or like your car is totaled and we're gonna pay for it or we're not
*  Yeah, or you're gonna have a shaky ass car for the rest of your life
*  As you take it on the highway you ever had a car that's fixed that really probably shouldn't have been fixed
*  I mean what my first car I had was like a ford tempo
*  And I remember the steering wheel like came off in my lap
*  As I was driving it and I was just like picked it up and just kept driving
*  He put it back on. Oh, I should not have been driving that car. Oh my god
*  When you're a kid and you buy shit boxes like the chances of those things just completely falling apart as you're driving are so high
*  My dad also would just like want to paint a car
*  So he would just like start painting a car and prime it like half of it and then he would give up
*  So we'd have like a two-colored car as a child. It's like so embarrassing
*  Yeah, if you have a poor car
*  Oh, yeah, we had poor cars. Yeah, poor cars all the time
*  And then my mom got into a car accident and we got a car with that money
*  Oh the ford tempo was like five grand
*  I had like bright red pleather inside
*  Bright red pleather. I remember. Yeah, that was driving that car me my friends on the highway and i'm like, oh
*  Yeah, it's like the steering wheel just came down but it's still connected
*  So I just pick it up and like make the turn
*  Oh, so like the thing that adjusts the steering wheel dropped off
*  I don't know. It just like fell in my lap when I was driving
*  And I just picked it up and like still drove it
*  Jesus Christ
*  There's a lot of those cars out there that's why we need inspections adrian very important my dad though knew a guy who would just keep
*  passing that car
*  Yeah, those guys are a problem. Yeah, but that's what i'm saying
*  It's a person that's not an adjuster,
*  but if you know them, they'll do it for you.
*  Yeah, my friend was telling me about that
*  for muscle cars in Los Angeles.
*  There's a place you can go in the hood,
*  and this guy will completely pass any car.
*  I was like, that sounds like an FBI sting.
*  Yeah, but there's so many things like that.
*  Yeah, well, especially in New York.
*  Yeah, I mean, yeah.
*  New York is all about knowing a guy.
*  All about knowing a guy.
*  It's all about what you can get away with.
*  Yeah.
*  New York City is disgusting,
*  and I've lived there my whole life.
*  I hate it, but I can't imagine living anywhere
*  permanently for the rest of my life.
*  What do you think is gonna be the hardest adjustment
*  about moving here?
*  I don't know.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I mean, I can't live here during the summer.
*  I can't do it like flying brooches.
*  Whatever those things are, I just can't.
*  I'm out.
*  Jamie, do you experience a lot of flying brooches?
*  I just see them out.
*  It was like 105 degrees here when I came last June with Ari,
*  and it was just like, we were in his house.
*  He got a really nice Airbnb.
*  He probably brought them with him.
*  There were a lot of crickets this year,
*  but I don't think that's different.
*  I mean, I was in the room in the bathroom,
*  and there was one like this big.
*  A roach.
*  Maybe they're cicadas, whatever they're called.
*  Oh yeah, cicadas are very different than roaches.
*  They look like roaches, though.
*  People eat them.
*  Sure, people eat people.
*  Like, it doesn't make it cool or right,
*  but like, you can eat whatever you want.
*  No, but I mean, it's like a delicacy.
*  Like, people enjoy it.
*  Sure.
*  No, like, I know a lot of, I know a guy who does it.
*  God bless.
*  That's not for me.
*  My friend Ryan Callahan, he had a recipe
*  of how to cook cicadas.
*  Don't they look like big roaches, though?
*  They're like a bug.
*  Anyway, I go to get Ari to kill it,
*  and he's like, oh, it just flew.
*  I'm like, what?
*  That is like a new fear unlocked.
*  It flew?
*  It probably was a cicada.
*  It probably wasn't a roach.
*  It might not have been a roach, but like, forget it.
*  That's what a cicada looks like.
*  I cannot.
*  Fucking cool.
*  They're fucking cool.
*  See if you find cicada recipes.
*  See if you can find Ryan Callahan's cicada recipe.
*  My friend Ryan, he would cook them
*  with like teriyaki sauce and bake them.
*  Yeah, apparently, look, I've gone to Mexico before,
*  and at certain resorts in Mexico,
*  they'll serve you like fried crickets.
*  Sure.
*  Have you seen that?
*  I've heard about it.
*  Yeah, fried crickets are grasshoppers.
*  I forget which one.
*  But they're good.
*  They taste good.
*  They're probably crunchy.
*  Yeah, crunchy, and it was kind of salty.
*  It's pretty good.
*  It's actually not bad for you, like, legitimately.
*  It's protein, right?
*  Yeah, it's the same kind of animal protein
*  that you get from a lot of different things.
*  But protein from cicadas is apparently particularly good.
*  It's like, because they're big, I guess.
*  Probably a lot of protein, those little fuckers.
*  I mean, I just remember being outside on like a bar here,
*  and they were just...
*  That's all it is for you is the bugs?
*  The heat's not great.
*  You can handle the heat?
*  I can handle the heat over those bugs.
*  Just stay away from the bugs.
*  I don't run into them.
*  You can't, they fly.
*  Adrienne, I'm telling you,
*  you're hanging out in the wrong spots.
*  I'll show you where to go with the bugs.
*  Sure, we have them in the poor places.
*  But like, the bugs are just,
*  I can't deal with the flying around.
*  Just don't go where the bugs are.
*  It's not that big of a deal.
*  Mosquitoes are a pain in the ass sometimes.
*  I don't care about that.
*  I mean, yeah, it's not great,
*  but like, those big things I can't.
*  Like Lady Bird Lake, if you go around there,
*  you're gonna just kind of be a lot of mosquitoes.
*  They're all over the fucking place.
*  But that's also what the bats keep in check.
*  Have you seen the bat emergence before?
*  No.
*  Oh, it's fucking cool as shit.
*  Bats are actually pretty cute.
*  Well, there's the bridge, right?
*  This is South Congress Bridge.
*  And if you go by the South Congress Bridge,
*  there's people every night
*  that are waiting for the bats to leave.
*  Because millions of bats leave.
*  So as billions of critters have emerged for seven years.
*  So is this Ryan?
*  I think so.
*  Okay, so you're showing,
*  so you peel off the skin of these little fuckers.
*  That's not Ryan Callahan.
*  I don't know who that guy is.
*  I could find a video of him doing it then.
*  Okay, but so this guy's just showing how you cook cicadas.
*  So he's basically taking away the outside area.
*  And he made a cicada taco for this kid and this lady.
*  And they're eating it with a, hmm.
*  She said she's freaking out, whatever.
*  She said it's not bad.
*  What was I just talking about before that though?
*  We're moving on to something else.
*  Oh, what I'll miss about being here as opposed to New York.
*  Yeah, we talked about, oh, the bats.
*  That's what we're talking about.
*  The bats eating mosquitoes.
*  Show the bats emerging from the South Congress Bridge.
*  It's really crazy.
*  I've seen, I've only done it once,
*  where I went out there and watched it happen.
*  I would like to see it.
*  It's like a million bats.
*  It's like the sky fills with bats
*  and they kill all the fucking mosquitoes.
*  They're death for the mosquitoes.
*  Why are they not eating the cicadas also?
*  That's pretty cool though.
*  Yeah.
*  I've never seen the photos of it.
*  It's pretty badass.
*  I've seen it live like that.
*  And if you go under that bridge, you hear them.
*  You hear them.
*  Shhh, shhh, shhh, shhh, shhh.
*  Little flying rats clinging to the roof.
*  What else do they eat?
*  They can't eat just mosquitoes.
*  Mosquitoes.
*  That's it?
*  They're mosquito killers.
*  They keep the mosquitoes in check.
*  They probably eat a bunch of bugs.
*  I'm sure they don't only dine on mosquitoes,
*  but they're a significant factor
*  in keeping the mosquito population down, allegedly.
*  That's what I read.
*  Let's find out if that's true.
*  I think it's true though.
*  I think it's true.
*  I think that's one of the main things that they help with.
*  He lives in, I guess, the country,
*  and he's trying to put up those places
*  where bats will come to eat the mosquitoes.
*  I guess you put up those little bat houses or whatever.
*  But pheromones in them, I guess.
*  And he feels like he can't get them to come there,
*  because he has a lot of mosquitoes,
*  because he lives by a lake.
*  Yeah, I bet bats, it's hard to get them
*  to move into new areas.
*  Because I bet wherever bats live,
*  if they live by a lake, there's probably plenty of bugs.
*  Why would they take a risk to go somewhere
*  where they're not sure if resources exist?
*  I mean, they could just fly.
*  Right, but they live under this bridge,
*  and they've been on this bridge forever.
*  Well, yeah, I don't think he's gonna get these bats.
*  But you know what I'm saying?
*  Like, when bats find a spot that works,
*  they're not migratory.
*  Right, they're just gonna stay there.
*  Yeah, they're just gonna stay there.
*  So to get them to go to a new spot,
*  he's probably gonna have to bring bats.
*  We actually had a bat expert on the podcast.
*  Do you know what I need?
*  I need an expert for pantry moths.
*  We'll try to find you one.
*  I mean, I have pantry moths for the last three months,
*  and I can't get rid of them.
*  They do migrate.
*  Where'd they go?
*  They migrate seasonally, flying south for the winter,
*  and then returning north in the spring.
*  Interesting.
*  Yeah, that's how I heard about it,
*  because there's a bunch more in Houston.
*  Right, so they probably,
*  because Houston doesn't get as cold, probably,
*  but they probably have an established range,
*  is what my point is.
*  It's like bringing them to a new range,
*  like to your friend's place, is gonna be difficult,
*  because there's not a history of them being there.
*  But I wonder if, what was that dude's name?
*  What does it say?
*  It says they eat between 10,000 and 30,000 pounds of insects,
*  including mosquitoes, every night,
*  on their nightly flights, and harmful agricultural pests.
*  They gotta be eating nuts like that.
*  So Austin's bats, they're fucking huge.
*  They really, they come in handy.
*  But, fuck, what was I asking about other than that?
*  Merlin Tuttle.
*  Yes, that's his name.
*  Merlin Tuttle, so he is a bat expert,
*  and he lives in Austin as well.
*  Fascinating dude, he's been studying bats his whole life.
*  He's a scientist.
*  Is there still new stuff to find out about bats?
*  Sure, yeah.
*  I mean, bats carry a lot of weird diseases.
*  That's one thing, you know?
*  Like, and there's crossover diseases.
*  That's the coronavirus, essentially,
*  was a bat disease that they took and fucked with,
*  and made it vulnerable for humans.
*  So they've done a lot of work with bats and diseases.
*  One of the craziest stories, though,
*  there's these two doctors, or two scientists, rather,
*  and they were in Africa, and they decided
*  to set up photography to film these bats
*  as they were flying out of the cave,
*  because there's a certain cave in Africa
*  that has some fucking insane number of bats.
*  It's just filled with them.
*  And when these bats flew out, they shit.
*  So these guys are on the ground,
*  in front of the bat cave, filming,
*  and they didn't take into account
*  they were gonna be covered in bat shit.
*  Just millions and millions of bats shitting in their face.
*  And they died.
*  They died of some crazy hemorrhagic virus
*  that just raged through their system.
*  If you imagine you are a human being,
*  and you're essentially intravenously taking in bat shit
*  into your system, it's going in your eyeballs,
*  it's going in your mouth.
*  It's going through the blood-brain barrier,
*  the bat shit's getting into your blood,
*  and it's circulating through your whole body.
*  And you just develop a horrible hemorrhagic virus.
*  So you can't play in that shit like you can play in cow shit.
*  No, I don't think so.
*  I think bats eat a lot of living organisms, unlike cows.
*  He's turning these crocodiles orange.
*  Bat poop has turned these African cave crocodiles orange.
*  I mean that orange crocodile looks pretty cool.
*  That's a pretty dope-looking crocodile.
*  I'd like a pair of boots.
*  Yeah, no shit, right?
*  Like natural.
*  Nice.
*  Natural orange crocodile from bat poop.
*  You know that bat guano is a very potent fertilizer,
*  because bat guano has like,
*  I think it has high levels of nitrogen.
*  I think that comes from them eating all the insects.
*  So that like, there used to be wars over bat shit.
*  And that's where the term bat shit crazy comes from.
*  You did not know that.
*  Guano was like a very expensive commodity,
*  because people needed it to grow crops.
*  So if you could get-
*  That's crazy.
*  Bat guano is apparently a very potent fertilizer.
*  They have a 4,300-year-old poop core
*  in a Jamaican cave that they've been studying.
*  What?
*  5,000 different species of bats have been shitting on for-
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Oh my God.
*  Depositive in the-
*  Wow, sequential layers by generations of bats
*  for over 4,300 years, and it's two meters tall.
*  That is so crazy.
*  Largely undisturbed and holds information
*  about changes in climate
*  and how the bats' food sources shifted over the millennia.
*  Wow.
*  Imagine going to Jamaica for spring break,
*  and that's where you go.
*  That is so crazy.
*  That's so nuts.
*  I'm trying to find a picture of it, but I don't see it.
*  You know what I'm really fascinated with
*  is things that existed only in myth,
*  but that every culture has, like dragons.
*  Like I had this guy, Forest Galant.
*  He's a wildlife biologist,
*  and he thinks that there's a real possibility
*  that dragons were an actual thing.
*  And that-
*  Well, when they have lived,
*  like when dinosaurs were around?
*  No, no, they lived alongside humans.
*  That's why there's all these records
*  in all these different cultures.
*  And there's Chinese culture has dragons,
*  Japanese culture has dragons,
*  ancient Europeans have dragons.
*  Like dragon is a real, not a fire breathing.
*  That seems to be bullshit, but maybe even-
*  What would their purpose be?
*  Well, they're probably like a crocodile that flies.
*  There was probably more than one kind
*  of really dangerous reptile that they called dragons,
*  like Komodo dragons.
*  Right, Komodo dragons.
*  Giant lizard, they called a dragon, right?
*  Crocodiles, dragons.
*  The question is whether or not one of them actually flew.
*  Cause we know that pterodactyls were a real thing.
*  And if pterodactyls-
*  I mean, they probably were real then.
*  Nah, I think it's probably something like that.
*  You know, some kind of like enormous bird type creature.
*  I only want a dragon if it's going to like
*  just have fire come out of its mouth.
*  All the time, yeah.
*  That's the only kind of dragon I want.
*  Stick it on your enemies.
*  Yes.
*  Shut the fuck up.
*  You know?
*  Send it to your house.
*  Like when you're in Game of Thrones
*  and that lady's standing there,
*  and then you see the dragon's head slowly emerge behind her.
*  I never watched Game of Thrones.
*  I know.
*  How dare you.
*  I know.
*  It's so good.
*  I keep trying to get into it and I can't.
*  The new one is, meh.
*  No, but I mean the old one.
*  The new one's two seasons in, the old one is so good.
*  It's so good.
*  It's so good.
*  It makes you want a dragon.
*  The lady who, was her name Venerus?
*  Who had the dragons?
*  Is that her name?
*  I haven't know it.
*  You didn't watch it either?
*  Could you not get into it?
*  It's too busy playing video games and golf.
*  Bring me your puppy.
*  Ew, what are you into reality?
*  Bring me your puppy right now.
*  Bring me Carl.
*  I don't like fantasy.
*  Not that kind.
*  Yeah, I don't really like fantasy like that either.
*  I don't know, like sci-fi stuff a little more.
*  Have you seen Three Body Problem?
*  No, it was on my list to watch it and start it.
*  Dude.
*  Is it good?
*  Really good.
*  It's good.
*  By the guys who made Games of Thrones.
*  Or the gals or non-binary folks.
*  Whoever the fuck it is.
*  Whoever made it.
*  Whoever made Game of Thrones.
*  Well that's a thing that you repeat
*  without looking any further.
*  I don't know what producers or whatever,
*  but the point is it is a really, really good show.
*  Like really fun and science fiction.
*  And my wife was not even into science fiction.
*  She loves it.
*  I gotta check it out.
*  I really want Carl.
*  Little Carl.
*  Isn't he adorable?
*  He's so cute.
*  Yeah, he's gotta rest up for Marshall
*  in about 15, 20 minutes.
*  He's gonna meet Marshall again.
*  Marshall is just happy right now.
*  Oh yeah, he's happy when Carl's nowhere near him.
*  He's like, Carl, please, I can't.
*  Especially if he doesn't have a toy
*  where they can play Tiger War.
*  If they can play Tiger War, it's cool,
*  but Carl is just a psycho.
*  Oh yeah, as soon as I came in,
*  he was just like biting my sneaker.
*  Yeah, he just wants to bite.
*  He wants to play.
*  He's still so young though.
*  Yeah, he's a little baby.
*  But he's also a crazy dog.
*  He's like a little torpedo.
*  He launches himself through the air at Marshall.
*  Like if he was a person, he'd be a dictator.
*  He's like nuts.
*  He'd be a gladiator.
*  He'd be one of those dudes fighting in Rome.
*  Yeah, he'd be one of them dudes fighting.
*  He'd be like that.
*  He wouldn't be the guy that killed himself
*  with the shit sponge.
*  No, no way.
*  He'd be killing people with the shit sponge,
*  just plunging it right in their throat.
*  But you imagine if today was the lion fight,
*  you're like, I don't wanna do this.
*  I'd rather choke to death on a shit stick.
*  Imagine how bad your life has to be.
*  Yeah, I think you were like,
*  I'm just gonna off myself with this shit stick.
*  Imagine that's all you have to kill yourself
*  is a shit stick.
*  I mean, how bad your life has to suck
*  to take this fucking sponge covered in other people's shit
*  and just bypass your gag instincts
*  and stuff it down your hole until you die.
*  Imagine you don't die right away either.
*  You definitely don't die right away.
*  You're just like ingesting those fumes.
*  Yeah, you're rolling up in the middle
*  of killing yourself by stuffing it in your neck.
*  I think someone thought that would kill them
*  and they just tried smelling it until they died
*  and it didn't work.
*  Nah, they're probably used to that kind of smell.
*  It's like smelling salt.
*  I bet that shit wakes you right up.
*  You want some?
*  No, I used to work at a place that...
*  I'll do it, but I'm not gonna do it that close.
*  Oh.
*  That's what people do with the shit stick.
*  That was their face. Oh my God.
*  That was the biggest one I ever got, ever.
*  Oh my God.
*  I thought it lost a little bit of potency from the other day.
*  Yo.
*  It's like a delayed reaction to you.
*  Yo. Oh my God.
*  That one hit me harder than anyone I've ever been hit.
*  I thought it wasn't even that close to me.
*  It's like chlorine, but the most chlorine.
*  So I worked at a place that did abortions.
*  It was like an OBGYN and they used to have that stuff
*  to wake people up.
*  Oh fun.
*  Oh God, that is so bad.
*  Gets addicted though.
*  You wanna try it again, don't you?
*  No, I don't.
*  You don't? You sure?
*  I'm not a gambler. I'll give you a couple minutes.
*  Doesn't matter.
*  I'll do it from further away.
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
*  Let's do it again.
*  Let's do it again.
*  Let's do it again.
*  It's one of those things where everybody does it
*  and they're like, what the fuck?
*  That was so bad.
*  And they're like, let me do it again.
*  Let me try it again.
*  Let me try it again.
*  Everybody wants to try it again.
*  Oh, that's brutal.
*  Yeah, it's rough.
*  It's rough stuff.
*  What do they use that for besides?
*  Weight lifters.
*  Oh, if they get knocked out.
*  No, no, no.
*  They take it right before they power lift.
*  Why?
*  Apparently, I don't know the actual science.
*  Maybe Jamie can look it up.
*  The idea, I think, that is it shocks your system.
*  It just jolts everything alive.
*  And then you're like, fucking, ah!
*  Then you can lift more weights.
*  Allegedly.
*  That's crazy, because I didn't even have it
*  that close to my face.
*  They used to use it with boxers,
*  but they made it illegal.
*  They would put it under a boxer's nose.
*  To wake them up, right?
*  To wake them up.
*  Yeah, if they got rocked and hurt,
*  they would snap them back.
*  I don't even know if it works.
*  Lots of athletes use it.
*  What is it, though?
*  Is it legal for them?
*  They're using the smaller versions, but yeah.
*  Why can't boxers use it, then?
*  I don't know that they can't.
*  I don't think they can.
*  I think smelling salts are illegal in between rounds.
*  I think it actually was an issue
*  that somebody brought up,
*  because I think someone was asking why someone,
*  it was one of the fight men in the UFC,
*  one of the, excuse me, one of the cut men in the UFC,
*  was holding someone's nose open
*  after they got rocked, like with his finger.
*  But it was just to create more airway.
*  It says that because they can mask more serious injuries
*  and cause further harm.
*  Right, right, right.
*  That's what just in boxing is why it's illegal.
*  Yeah, that makes sense.
*  So if you get rocked
*  and then they give you smelling salts,
*  you might think you're okay,
*  but really, you're still fucked up.
*  The worst injury from them is what this is backing up.
*  When I was looking into it is whiplash.
*  It's not like burning your nose.
*  That's hilarious.
*  How is it from just going like that?
*  It's from the jet,
*  because you can't not react that way.
*  That's hilarious.
*  And people that are more hurt can get fucked up more.
*  You need to do some neck exercises, homie.
*  You get whiplash from that.
*  That's ridiculous.
*  You want to get more money?
*  So you just do that for whiplash?
*  Take a couple blasts of that.
*  What is that stuff?
*  It just smells like ammonia.
*  I think it is ammonia.
*  Yeah.
*  That's all it is.
*  It's just ammonia in crystal form.
*  But this is this company.
*  This product is called Ah.
*  This is the strongest one we've ever tried.
*  I've smelled it before too,
*  but that is very strong.
*  It was like here and I smelled it.
*  Yeah, this smelled so bad
*  that it smelled inside the seals container.
*  It had a sealed plastic container on the outside.
*  I could smell it through the container
*  before it was even open.
*  Then once I unsealed it and opened the bag,
*  while this was sealed and with a top to the lid,
*  so there's the top that's sealed over the bottle
*  and then the lid on top of the top.
*  And you still smelled it through that.
*  Still smelled it through that.
*  With the plastic seal,
*  you got to pull the seal back and everything.
*  Once we opened it up, it's insane.
*  Whatever the fuck is in,
*  whatever it does to your system.
*  Get it in crystal form.
*  No, okay.
*  You do it first.
*  Okay.
*  Why would you go that close?
*  That's pretty close.
*  Get in there, girl.
*  Big breath, big breath, big breath, big breath.
*  I smelled enough.
*  That was nothing.
*  I don't care.
*  I'm not gonna breathe in it.
*  I'm gonna lie.
*  I'm gonna pretend I'm doing it.
*  You did it.
*  You had the full experience the first time.
*  That first time was brutal.
*  Doesn't it wake you up, though?
*  It does, for sure.
*  Yeah, so if somebody had rocked you,
*  if you're in there with some girls boxing you up,
*  just peesin' you up.
*  And they just smell that.
*  And get you in the corner, you're like, whoo.
*  And then all of a sudden, they're feeding you.
*  I can see it making you angry, too.
*  Yeah.
*  I would think it'd probably be good to mask
*  any symptoms of you being hurt.
*  They should've had that on the shit stick.
*  Yeah, imagine just swallowing a bottle of that
*  to kill yourself.
*  Yeah.
*  But that's better.
*  Probably take a long time.
*  You don't think you would die from that right away?
*  It's ammonia.
*  I wonder.
*  Okay, how much ammonia would you have to consume
*  for it to be lethal, Jamie?
*  I feel like a cup.
*  This is not even a cup.
*  Well, that's in crystal form, though.
*  I think it'd be prolonged.
*  I mean, it's the amount of time you're probably doing it.
*  But if you just down this whole thing,
*  it should kill you.
*  I just swallowed it?
*  Yeah, the whole thing.
*  I feel like we shouldn't be giving anybody any ideas.
*  Probably not.
*  People who were eating Tide Pods don't.
*  They were, right?
*  That's a crazy time.
*  I think China did that to us.
*  I think they tricked us on the internet.
*  Yeah, they got some fake people to pretend to eat Tide Pods
*  and talk dumb kids.
*  Remember when they were locking up detergent
*  because kids were eating Tide Pods?
*  We were like, I don't know, man.
*  If you're eating those Tide Pods, you deserve it.
*  Yeah, we're always gonna have kids that do stupid shit.
*  There's no way around that.
*  Tide Pods is probably one of the top.
*  I'm lucky Tide Pods weren't around when I was a kid.
*  You would have definitely been eating them.
*  I know somebody who would have ate them.
*  There's always that one kid in the neighborhood
*  who'll do anything to get attention.
*  They do feel cool though.
*  They're like soft and detergent.
*  Oh, sorry, Tide Pods.
*  What are you saying, Jim?
*  This is probably how this got into sports.
*  They thought it counteracted head trauma.
*  Right, yeah.
*  Like 50 years ago.
*  Wakes you up.
*  But I mean, fully, if you were knocked out,
*  which I mean, I know it would wake you up,
*  but they thought it fixed you.
*  Right, they thought it brought you back.
*  Well, they didn't know shit back then.
*  I still smell it.
*  I mean, when do you think they figured out brain damage?
*  When they start figuring out
*  if you get punched in the head too many times,
*  you lose your ability to communicate.
*  I think they probably knew it pretty early
*  and they were like, I'm betting on this game though.
*  Let them keep it in each other.
*  Well, they definitely knew about it
*  because boxers were washed up
*  even in the 50s and the 60s,
*  but I don't think they understood the extent of it
*  until probably like the 60s and the 70s.
*  People started discussing being punch drunk,
*  punch drunk boxers.
*  I think boxers knew about it,
*  but I think the general public,
*  it wasn't really a big thing.
*  What about football people?
*  Concussions and stuff.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  They get it real bad.
*  All of them, all contact athletes,
*  your head getting jarred like that.
*  But I think for us, the big one was Muhammad Ali
*  because Muhammad Ali was such a cultural hero.
*  And to see Muhammad Ali in the later stages of his life,
*  unable to communicate and shaking is very disturbing
*  because as much as they try to tell you
*  that had nothing to do with boxing,
*  like come on.
*  It definitely did.
*  Of course it did.
*  You jostling your brain around.
*  But there's also trauma induced Parkinson's
*  is a real thing.
*  Right.
*  And so when you see people that are,
*  Freddie Roach, he was a boxer
*  and now he's a famous trainer.
*  He has trauma induced Parkinson's is a shake
*  that he tells you is from his career as a boxer.
*  Just something that happens to people.
*  And so when you see it happen to someone like Muhammad Ali,
*  you're like, fuck.
*  Right, because this guy's like the sign of strength.
*  Oh, not just a sign of strength,
*  but the way he would talk was so different
*  than any other boxer.
*  He was so fast.
*  He was so funny.
*  Like Howard Cosell called him truculent once.
*  He seemed very truculent champ.
*  He goes, whatever truculent is, if it's good on that.
*  That's a great answer.
*  He had so many funny things that he said.
*  He was the first guy that was like talking shit
*  in a funny way and getting the whole world to pay attention.
*  He said one of his opponents, I forget who it was,
*  he goes, if you ever dreams he beat me,
*  you better wake up and apologize.
*  That's funny.
*  He just said some funny, funny things he would say,
*  but also refused to fight in the Vietnam War.
*  He said, hey man, fuck you, I'm not going over there.
*  Yeah, good for him.
*  Yeah.
*  And then lost his title, lost his ability
*  to make a living for three years because of it.
*  Like the prime three years of his career
*  was taken from him because he refused
*  to fight in the Vietnam War.
*  So he was a lot more than just a fighter.
*  He was like a cultural icon who defined rebelling
*  against a corrupt and evil system.
*  And then eventually at the end of his life,
*  he was a victim of the sport that made him famous.
*  And we watched it.
*  And that's the first time we ever watched someone go
*  from just celebrated for the way he talked
*  to being unable to communicate at all.
*  This gives two very different versions
*  of when it was discovered.
*  Ancient Egypt.
*  Yeah.
*  1848 Phineas Gage, a railroad worker,
*  survived a traumatic brain injury when an iron rod
*  shot through his skull and destroyed much
*  of his left frontal lobe.
*  Gage's personality changed dramatically
*  and his case considered a landmark in the study
*  of brain damage and personality.
*  So we have pictures of that.
*  Yo, let's see the pictures.
*  Oh boy.
*  Oh boy.
*  This says it went right through.
*  Oh my God.
*  He didn't apparently feel much pain.
*  Oh boy.
*  He was throwing up for every 20 minutes,
*  but he was lucid and remained talking the whole time.
*  So he just made his hair part over the hole in his head?
*  He had obliterated his left frontal lobe.
*  Oh boy.
*  He survived the accident of a 13 inch railroad rod.
*  Is that the rod that he has in his hand?
*  Yeah, I think so.
*  Oh, cri-
*  He kept it?
*  That could be a gun or something.
*  No, that looks like the rod, dude.
*  That's the thing that went through his fucking head
*  and he lived.
*  And now he's keeping it.
*  Oh, that's what it looked like.
*  Oh my God.
*  Wait, so it didn't go through his eye?
*  It went through his head and destroyed his eye.
*  What do you think that,
*  what did it say it did to his personality?
*  So this was like the first study in psychology,
*  it's changed psychology.
*  Right, what did they say?
*  How did they say it affected his personality?
*  Phineas Gage on second thought, that's interesting.
*  What does that say on the top?
*  The title of it?
*  First of all, for a profane and hostile afterwards.
*  A re-examination of the famous case
*  of a man whose personality changed
*  from a grievous brain injury.
*  Uh-huh.
*  Okay, wait a minute.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  Yeah.
*  I'll go across that.
*  Yeah.
*  All right, I'll find another way.
*  Yeah, it's hard to know.
*  This is a funky site.
*  The dude who runs that site's funky.
*  I mean, I bet he wasn't a good time to be around.
*  Well, it does definitely dramatically change people.
*  Like I was reading about this guy
*  who developed an ability to see mathematics
*  in like geometric form.
*  And it's called acquired savant syndrome.
*  So this guy started creating like geometric art,
*  like apparently had no interest in mathematics at all.
*  And then I think he got mugged.
*  I think he got beat up
*  and then developed some bizarre mathematical ability.
*  I mean, that's better than the people
*  that have like traumatic brain injuries
*  and become pedophiles.
*  Like definitely pray for the mathematic genius.
*  Well, I know quite a few comics of Adam.
*  Roseanne Barr, Kinnison, both got hit by cars.
*  Both changed their personalities dramatically afterwards.
*  It's probably like quite a few people
*  just got knocked in the head
*  and then just became a different person.
*  It was really weird.
*  It's a sketchy thing.
*  Oh no, your joke was about somebody taking medicine.
*  Oh, the joke about, yeah, the Parkinson's drug.
*  That's true, that's true.
*  It's so crazy.
*  Yeah, it's called a dopamine agonist.
*  And apparently with some people,
*  it completely removes their inhibitions.
*  Right, he was gambling.
*  Gay sex just went off the rails.
*  And what do you say he lost like 600,000 or something?
*  Somewhere in the neighborhood of that, yeah.
*  Lost everything.
*  But then when he stopped taking the drug, he was okay.
*  Got back to normal.
*  He's like, what the fuck was I doing?
*  He won in court, which is the craziest thing.
*  Yeah, he lost.
*  He sued GlaxoSmithKline.
*  But he lost more money.
*  He lost as much money as he gained back
*  and he was also raped twice.
*  No, raped once, I think.
*  He was raped.
*  He was raped, he was raped.
*  Yeah, he picked a guy up off Craigslist.
*  I guess he didn't see that.
*  He just became addicted to gay sex and gambling.
*  It's crazy to stop doing that and then you're like,
*  wow, I remember all those dicks I took.
*  Yeah.
*  That was a crazy time.
*  Well, he was a different human.
*  His brain, we don't think about it this way,
*  but your brain is essentially this functional ecosystem
*  of all these different things.
*  Dopamine and serotonin, all these neurotransmitters
*  and then the blood that's flowing through your body.
*  It's all operating on this fairly regular schedule
*  of what's available to use
*  and how you interpret consciousness
*  based on the chemicals.
*  And then all of a sudden, you introduce this new shit
*  and this new shit makes you wanna suck cock and play bingo.
*  It's just crazy that both of those things
*  are the same in this guy's head.
*  Well, it's just wild impulses.
*  I'm sure you had probably other impulses.
*  I don't know if you got more violent,
*  but that sometimes happens where people can't control.
*  Someone cuts you off in traffic
*  and you might be like, oh, that's a fucking idiot.
*  They just fucking can't take it.
*  They just wanna just drive someone off the road.
*  They just lose their impulse control.
*  That happens to people with CTE as well.
*  A lot of people with CTE, they have a very short fuse,
*  very short fuse.
*  Didn't they think that happened on Aaron Hernandez?
*  Yeah, they said he had the worst CTE,
*  I think that they had ever diagnosed
*  and he was alive in 28.
*  So he wasn't, well, he's dead obviously
*  because they did an autopsy,
*  but I mean, he was alive at 28 before he killed himself
*  with the worst CTE they had ever seen.
*  So it hadn't even killed him,
*  but it had destroyed his brain.
*  I mean, his brain was destroyed.
*  It was just filled with holes.
*  That's crazy.
*  Crazy.
*  And they said that when they studied football players,
*  there's some extraordinary number
*  of football players that have CTE.
*  It's in like the high 90%.
*  And this is not just college,
*  this is high school, college.
*  There are all those people
*  that have those high CTE counts,
*  they're not killing people either.
*  Some of them are.
*  You know. Not a lot.
*  No, not a lot.
*  But the thing about it is, first of all,
*  when it's over, there's a lot of them
*  that went up killing themselves.
*  That's a big thing that happens with fighters,
*  it happens with soldiers also,
*  the PTSD compounding the fact they have brain injuries.
*  A lot of heavy depression.
*  So 345 former NFL players
*  with chronic traumatic encephalopathy,
*  out of 376 former players studied.
*  So out of all those people studied,
*  only 31 dudes didn't have it.
*  So it's 91.7%.
*  Among those diagnosed in the last year,
*  two former players who once represented the teams
*  paired in the Sunday Super Bowl,
*  former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback.
*  Could you do me a favor
*  and just Google Aaron Hernandez CTE results?
*  Yeah, he had the second highest you could have.
*  I don't know what the stage is, but stage three,
*  worst you've ever seen in someone that young.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, that's what I was gonna say.
*  He wasn't playing as long as some of these other people.
*  That's what's crazy.
*  Range of symptoms including emotional and behavioral changes,
*  memory loss and depression.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, it's nuts.
*  It's not since 91% of players.
*  It's crazy too that you just keep playing football
*  because you make so much money from it.
*  Well, I think Aaron Hernandez was a violent dude already.
*  There was a lot of abuse in his childhood
*  and there's a lot of crazy stuff.
*  I think there's a lot going on with that guy.
*  Right, so he might've been a little unhinged to begin with.
*  I murdered a bunch of people, right?
*  At least one.
*  So then you've murdered at least two.
*  They think you murdered two.
*  Yeah, I think it was two.
*  But I think one is confirmed.
*  How many people did Aaron Hernandez murder?
*  I know why I thought it was three.
*  Should've charged for one.
*  I mean, dudes playing in the NFL.
*  He was acquitted of a double homicide.
*  Playing in the NFL, superstar, also just gunning people down.
*  With one of the worst examples of C.D.
*  They've ever discovered.
*  He was guilty of first three murder
*  and sentenced to life in prison.
*  Did he hang himself?
*  Is that how he died?
*  Did he hang himself?
*  I believe so.
*  Imagine an injury, like that dude with the rod
*  through the brain and now all of a sudden
*  you're a totally different person.
*  All your life you've been one person and then gone.
*  That person's gone.
*  That's kind of fun.
*  Maybe not.
*  There's only one way to find out.
*  You would try, you'd want to know how hard do I have
*  to get hit in the head to be really good at math.
*  You don't want to overdo it.
*  No, you don't want to.
*  You're like, keep pushing me.
*  I still can't figure this equation out.
*  One more kick to the face, please.
*  I think we're right there.
*  I think I'm starting to see geometry.
*  Yeah, that's crazy.
*  But it doesn't happen to everybody.
*  That's what's weird.
*  No.
*  Some people make some great comics.
*  Some people just make some brain dead.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a fine line.
*  Between genius and brain dead.
*  In everything there's a fine line.
*  All right, should we wrap this up?
*  Let's wrap it up.
*  It was really fun.
*  Yeah, thanks for having me.
*  Thanks for being here.
*  You're very funny.
*  I really enjoy your comedy.
*  I love the risks you take.
*  You just go for it.
*  It's fun to watch.
*  It's great.
*  It really is.
*  It's fun.
*  It's a different thing than anybody else is doing
*  and people love it.
*  I think there's reason for that.
*  And I think you're like one of those people
*  that they have to find out about you to appreciate you.
*  And that happened with a lot of people.
*  That happened with Stephen Wright.
*  That happened with Mitch Hedberg.
*  People had to know what they were coming for
*  to really appreciate it.
*  Do you remember that story?
*  I don't know when Mitch Hedberg did his special
*  for Comedy Central.
*  It took so long because he was bombing the whole way through.
*  You never heard that?
*  I mean, he's a genius, but his special,
*  he was not doing well and they kept filming it.
*  And finally he's sitting down on those stairs
*  because I think he had been at it for a while.
*  And you watch that special and it's hilarious.
*  He's like a genius, so funny.
*  But like, yeah, in the room it just was not going well.
*  Well, it all depended with Mitch on also who,
*  is there a complimentary opening act that makes sense?
*  Like he would have guys on the road,
*  he would have a middle act on the road
*  that the club would provide.
*  That dude would be doing backflips and singing songs.
*  Right, that's not a great person for you to follow.
*  It's terrible.
*  And so people didn't know who he was back then.
*  It was just who's the headliner.
*  Oh, there's a guy named Mitch Hedberg.
*  Why does he have sunglasses on?
*  Why is he staring at the ground?
*  But once they knew who he was,
*  then they would come to see him and then it was awesome.
*  And I think there's a thing like that with you.
*  Well, what's funny too is like Louis directed it
*  and he's like, let's do this thing.
*  At first he was like, let's do this thing
*  where nobody knows you're filming a special.
*  He's like, you're just going out there
*  and usually half the crowd loves me
*  and half the crowd doesn't.
*  So I was like, let's do one show like that.
*  And that show I tap dance the whole way
*  and it was so brutal.
*  The first two shows we did,
*  I was like, the first one was okay
*  and the second one was so brutal
*  because none of them knew who I were.
*  They didn't know I was doing a special.
*  They just thought they were coming for a regular show.
*  And I'm up there for an hour.
*  And people, like there was like seven people
*  that liked me, but like we all left so dejected.
*  Like Louis was like, I can't even watch this.
*  And Ari, I seen Ari being like so depressed.
*  And then I went home that night and I was like,
*  I'm gonna have to quit comedy.
*  Oh my God.
*  And then the next two shows the next night
*  were amazing, but like, yes, I'm not for everyone.
*  Yeah, you're not for everybody.
*  Not even my biological father.
*  Well, you're for me.
*  I appreciate you.
*  Well, thank you.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  My pleasure.
*  So one more time, Jamie, show it.
*  It's available now, Netflix, The Dark Queen.
*  Tell people your Instagram, all that jazz.
*  It's just my name, Adrienne Appalucci.
*  Spell it though, cause people like,
*  sure that's Appalucci must mean A.
*  I know.
*  Well, also too.
*  I first, this funky I.
*  But everyone always thinks it's an L.
*  So that's why I was like, we need to use
*  a font where it's an I.
*  So it's A-D-R-I-E-N-E.
*  And then the last name's I-A-P-E-A-L-U.
*  Have you ever thought about
*  just changing your last name to an A?
*  Just put an A there.
*  I mean, everyone thinks it's an L.
