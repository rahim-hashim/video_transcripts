# JRE MMA Show #88 with Frankie Edgar
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [January 28, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtIa_UQ09Ko)
*  Boom what's up, Frankie? How are you? Good to see you man. Good to be here. Good to have you
*  We talked about this many times we have and you know my buddy Chris LaGuard
*  I got a shot him out cuz he got me listening to you
*  You know years ago and he's been telling me to come on this podcast for forever
*  So I'm fine. I'm glad to finally get it done. So shout out to Chris. I know he's listening. Hi Chris
*  So you got your own podcast now? I do me and Roger Matthews from Jersey Shore fame
*  He was the ex-husband of Jay. Well, so we the champ in the tramp
*  Champ in a tramp. Yeah
*  That's hilarious. That's hilarious. So what's happening man? You just got off of the
*  Chan Sung Jung fight. Yeah, and what's next? What are you up to? I'm gonna go down 35. Yeah, you know
*  How much you walk around at I'm probably like 56 right now Wow, you know, so for 45
*  Well Marlins gotta be bigger than you right Marlon is about a little bit bigger than me
*  Yeah, I think so. I think he walks around a little heavier. He's a little bit more of an eater than I am
*  That guy I can't I have a hard time believing he makes 35 sometimes you look at him
*  He's so Jack got such a small waist though
*  I mean, he's so his legs and shoulders are so big but his waist is kind of small
*  So maybe that's how he carries it. So have you done a cut like that before? I haven't been but I mean my last fight
*  I think I was you know getting down to 45 got down to like forty four point five
*  I mean, it's only eight and a half over where I got to be for to make 36 and it was such an easy cut
*  For this last time so it's you're you're an interesting situation man
*  Because like you won the title at 55 and you didn't cut any weight at all and a lot of people were like well fuck
*  Man Frankie Edgar can do because you the thing about you at 55 is you were so durable
*  Like that was one of the craziest things about some of your fights like the Grey Maynard fights. Yeah, fucking amen
*  Who reffed those fights? Um, Eve Levine both of them. No, the first one the first one
*  I think was Josh Rosenthal. Well, shout out to both of those guys because a
*  Trigger hungry referee who's got an itchy trigger finger. They would have stopped those fights now
*  I think nowadays some of my stop it. Yeah, you know, yeah then I feel like they let it go a little more
*  I mean, of course, there's still sometimes let it go a little it all depends
*  You never know you never know it all changes. It's such a weird thing, right?
*  It's like the referee is trying to help the fighter
*  They're trying to make sure that the fighter doesn't take unnecessary damage
*  But you know more than once you see fights stopped we like all that guy wasn't done, right?
*  He was he was getting through a bad patch and that's part of what a fight is about
*  It's like trying to figure out how to survive for sure. I always want to benefit the doubt
*  I you know, I don't want to get unnecessary punishment, of course
*  But I'd rather get the benefit that I I've never been turned off even with Ortega and
*  Shansung Jung fight I got right both those fights even though I got rocked in my other fights these fights
*  I kind of was more coherent. I'm not complaining about the stoppages or anything like that
*  You know, I could see why they stopped it but in the great fights even the Benson Henderson fight where I got upkicked
*  I don't remember any of those fights, you know, I remember like three four rounds of those fights
*  Just because it was so wild because of getting hit. Yeah, because I got hit and I kept getting hit maybe maybe that's what I remember
*  The Ortega fight I got rocked pretty good and I remember in my head saying alright, just your time left
*  Let's get through let's get through it. Obviously didn't make it to the end and
*  You know, but I did I remembered being coherent even this last one would would a Korean zombie
*  I remember the ref saying, you know, you got to do something down there got to do something down there
*  And I was you know, I was trying to do my best my body
*  Maybe wasn't reacting the way I needed to be but yeah, you know, I never been turned off
*  You know, I don't know if that's a good thing or not. But I know if it's a good thing either
*  It's like some people say if you get turned off
*  It's better because then you you don't absorb as much punishment or I heard that argument
*  But then if you do get turned off your body gets turned off easier next time. That's that's pretty true. Yeah
*  Guys that get cracked it can kind of continue to get cracked and get rocked a little easier
*  I'm hoping that's not the case for me. Well, it's it's not it's more of the actual knockout itself. Yeah
*  Yeah, I think a bit like a bad knockout. Yeah, it's crazy that you have had a bunch of fights where you don't remember
*  Most of the fight like that. That's a thing that a lot of fighters don't necessarily talk about but it's a reality of
*  Hard fights, yeah the my second favorite gray were Eve Levine was the referee I
*  Remember, I think the fourth round mark my coach Mark was like, you know telling me we got one more round in my head
*  I'm like one more round. What happened to three and four?
*  I didn't remember at all. And also I when I dropped me I I rolled my ankle really bad probably a grade two sprain and
*  I remember in the fourth round coming to and my ankle was hurting me. I'm like what happened?
*  I have no idea what happened my ankle and even got walking back
*  You know, I was that's kind of you know, I don't know sometimes you get rocked you get depressed for some reason
*  I noticed that even in the gym when you get when I get rocked
*  They get a little bit of depression going on for some reason like what does it feel like when you say depression?
*  Like my middle bolt, you know, you're just down on yourself, you know, I was emotional
*  I think I was crying after the great fight in the in the locker room
*  I think they have camera back there and there's a video of me in the second fight when you stopped him not the second fight
*  But the the second well that was the second fight not the third fight the third fight you stopped
*  Second fight you want right the fucking fights that you had with gray were so crazy. They were so he was so big
*  Yeah, he's a big boy. I'm so big for 55, you know, and you were a guy didn't cut any weight at all
*  Nothing. I was literally you eat breakfast on weighing day Wow
*  That's crazy. Yeah, we did you ever think back then about dropping down or were you just like fucking I'm the champ
*  Yeah, that's why I was like a champ. Why should I go down? I mean, I'm winning. I'm beating these guys
*  Even the Benson Henders fights, they were super close, you know, I could have went either way and
*  But I just felt you know, I'll go down now. I lost two in a row here
*  But you know, what more can I gain from here?
*  Let me go down to 45 and that's that's when I fought Aldo for the for the 45 pound belt
*  When you think about it, like if you had a chance to do it all over again
*  Like if you had to engineer your career all over again, would you do it exactly the same way?
*  Would you fight a 55? Well, you definitely would against BJ, right? Yeah, I mean I
*  Can't you can't go back and change those right? It all worked out for me, you know, I got a world title
*  I had a pretty you know, I'm continuing to have a pretty good career
*  There's always things you wish you could do differently, you know
*  You just I can't be that guy that's gonna say I wish I did this wish to do that things went the way they went
*  Well, they went pretty fucking good. I mean, yeah, I'm not complaining. You know, I'm the BJ Penn fight
*  I remember the first one in Abu Dhabi. I was there for that one. I was like, holy shit
*  You know that was that was a big victory man
*  And yeah, I want those big yet if the second one was probably even better just cuz I you know more
*  Definitely one, you know, and I felt like to like, you know
*  BJ had my back and in that second fight and you know, I thought BJ gets your back back then you're in trouble
*  And I would defend I think it reversed them
*  So I kind of showed a little bit of all my complete skills in that fight and all the guys
*  That I've ever seen fight. I've never seen anybody who controls people with the legs the way BJ does
*  He's got the craziest dexterity his legs. He does I heard when he was younger
*  He could stand up and put his leg over his head standing up. Jesus Christ
*  Yeah, I don't know if that's true like just lift it up and put it back there
*  Just like not even grab it not even grab put it over his head. Oh, that's true
*  I've seen him jump out of the pool too. That's pretty wild. Yeah. No, he's incredible athlete
*  Yeah, and his his physical talents were unusual
*  But he worked on it like this other thing a lot of people don't realize like there's some great videos of BJ stretching
*  And he would stretch with bands
*  So he has all this crazy like he would grab his foot like put it on his chest
*  He's got bands and he's stretching the shit out himself. So it wasn't just natural ability
*  It was also like he realized well, he realized that his legs were like other arms like he could cuz he when you're in his guard
*  He would just those legs would come up and just pinch you down and and his mount
*  He would cross his legs underneath dudes and his back mount was incredible. Yeah, he was one of a kind
*  I think you know on the ground and just as a fighter, I mean I looked up to him coming up
*  You know, he was the man licking licking blood off his
*  Off his hands, you know, I mean I was actually with him. We were it's did the UFC gym 10 year anniversary
*  I was just now up in a concord
*  And BJ was there so I was hanging out BJ. He's a good dude, man
*  We get along really well is uh, is he is he done fighting or was he gonna do?
*  I think he wants to fight. I don't think Dana wants him to fight but I'm pretty crazy brawl in Hawaii
*  Yeah, yeah
*  People are also like oh look at people you're getting mad at a fighter for fighting, you know, come on
*  Is it that surprising?
*  That is a funny way to look at it, right? Like if a singer get a fight
*  What is he doing a fighter fighting? It's like a basketball player having a pickup game. Yeah, exactly
*  Can't get mad at him for that that is kind of weird when you stop and think about it, you know
*  I mean is that and that's the nature down in Hawaii. I think a lot of people get down
*  That's how they get down out there. Yeah, they get down. Yeah tough motherfuckers in Hawaii
*  Yeah for sure
*  You know that fight that was so sad to watch like that dude clipped him with the left hook and dropped him and bounced his
*  Head off the concrete was like fuck did he say hit me? He said yes
*  He let the guy hit him and then he came back
*  He went out he flashed out and went down and then I don't know if the video was continuous or what but later
*  Is a video of him having the guys back and smashing him
*  It's like god damn it. Yeah, you gotta be Kevin. You never know what happened in the street fight, too
*  So yeah, guys go home open the trunk come right back. Yeah, I mean should throw someone their head and they don't wake up
*  You know, that's a big one. Yeah, you know that happened to a buddy mine in Long Island Kevin James actually the the comedian
*  His his buddy
*  They're working together as bouncers and he was working with this guy and this guy got in a fight with a patron
*  Punched the guy knocked him out the guy fell banged his head off the ground died
*  Wow, dude wound up doing jail time Wow and that happens
*  I heard a story of some wrestler kind of same thing got into a fight picked guy up
*  So I'm gonna head and end up in jail. Oh my god
*  Do you imagine a wrestler like a yo, Romero fucking suplexing you on the street?
*  Fuck that it's over forever. Absolutely. Yeah, he'll flatten the top of your head
*  Yeah
*  Another freak man. Oh, he's the freakiest freak. Yeah, and all the freaks you got like Brock Lesnar
*  Who's like got some freaky Viking jeans like for sure? Yeah, I see don't make any sense
*  You see you ever see photos of him when he was in high school dude, I got a freak in high school. Wow
*  Yeah, we he rushed he was a senior when I was a freshman and we're at wrestling nationals together
*  I remember just looking neck being next to him like damn. How the fuck is this guy even real? Yeah
*  This looks like an action figure. Yeah, he was
*  He was the biggest physical freak I think I've ever seen but then you got in Ghana who I think is
*  More of a physical freak. Yeah. Yeah, you know in Ghana
*  Because I'm a hundred percent positive and gone was on the natch that guy is all natural
*  Yeah, just salt mines or whatever dirt man Sam. Yeah
*  He's got a photo on his Instagram today of him chopping wood everything. He does terrifies me
*  He's so fucking powerful man that guy I have it all the guys I've ever seen the heavyweight division
*  He is for sure the most powerful that uppercut he landed on Alistair over him was
*  Man, I thought he decapitated him. Yeah, it's like his head flute. It's like the back of his head touched his back like there is yeah
*  What is he's breaking rocks? I guess what is he doing hitting a stake into the ground?
*  That motherfucker has power
*  Or
*  Yeah, he has like the most ridiculous punching power it has to right. Oh, yeah, man
*  Well, he's a natural
*  270 plus and apparently he's been lifting so he's even above 265 right now. He's gonna have to cut weight. That's way
*  Yeah, that's why this guy's fighting next a rose rose strike is badass. That's a really good fight. See you Kate one guy
*  I don't know where he did his kickboxing career pull up a
*  Jarzino Rosen strike
*  Try spelling that good luck
*  You got it really?
*  I
*  Don't know how you fucking spelled that correctly
*  But Rosen strike the thing that's scared me about him when he's fighting Alistair was like he was walking right through Alistair shots
*  Which is the craziest and Alistair's no joke. I mean how takes people out left and right?
*  Dude when he was on the sauce and he fought Brock that when he was uber EAM
*  Here goes so he fought in a bunch of different organizations
*  danger zone
*  Yeah
*  Does it so slam?
*  Where's he from?
*  Rosen stroke, right? Let's see
*  It's a surname Suriname. Sorry. It's not where I said Tyrone Spong. Yeah. Yeah
*  Yeah
*  Yes, pong was supposed to fight
*  usik
*  In a heavyweight fight when usik moved up to heavyweight and boxing, you know Tyrone Spong is all yeah, it's all boxing
*  Is he oh, he's doing only boxing. Yeah. Did you see his last?
*  He was supposed to fight
*  I'm thinking a big baby Miller was supposed to fight
*  Johnson that's right. Yeah, Joshua, right Josh anybody's tested positive. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
*  Tyrone tested positive to yeah, that's what I was thinking
*  Tyrone tested positive before he was supposed to fight usik, but he said it's bullshit
*  And then I think he was actually cleared of it, but it was too late. They'd already set up this other fight for usik
*  He's a dangerous guy. I think there's a lot of people that are gonna avoid Tyrone Spong. Yeah, he is hard
*  He hits fucking hard and he's a savage. He is he's you know, his last did you ever see his last kickboxing fight?
*  He broke his leg. Yeah against
*  Turkish Tyson right Gus gone. What's his name?
*  Turkish Tyson, right? Oh Jesus, why can't I remember his name? He's in USC now, right? Yeah, you made me forget his name
*  What happened? Gohan sock go go come go come sock. Yeah, Jesus Christ. It's early
*  Saki
*  He's had a tough transition to MMA, but he's still a bad motherfucker and in fighting and kickboxing man
*  He was one of my favorite guys ever to watch sock. He had the nastiest left hand
*  He would throw like left hook left hook left hook, you know
*  Like left hook to the body left hook to the head left hook the body bang bang bang
*  You know like fast as fuck for and for a heavyweight
*  ridiculous hand speed
*  Yeah, I mean, I feel like all these athletes are just getting better and better as it goes, right? Oh, yeah for sure
*  It's kind of crazy. Yeah, we guys are athletic as hell, too
*  When you stop back and think about your first fights in the UFC when you first got started
*  Like what what stands out as being like real different about seeing the younger guys coming up today?
*  The other guys just more complete hmm and they're they're more athletic I think back when I first started we were just guys
*  I wanted to fight we were tough guys, you know, the wrestlers always did well because we're you know competed our whole lives
*  But now these kids are polished right away. You seem like 20 year old kids with crazy skills. Yeah, they're polished
*  They've been doing it for five years already. You see that kid Edmund Shabazzian. Yes. Yeah fucking incredible
*  He's like I think he's 21 now right and he is just a fucking murderer man, yeah, it's crazy
*  It's it's amazing that I'm 18 years older than some of these kids. You know, I mean
*  When you think you're gonna not do this anymore
*  I don't know, you know, I always have three three roles is as long as I'm enjoying it
*  And I want to do it as long as I'm competitive
*  I don't want to lose fights to guys
*  I think I should be able to beat and as long as my body holds up so and how old you know 38
*  So for the lighter weight divisions, that's older. It's older. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I feel good. My body feels good
*  I mean always always little injuries here and there
*  But I enjoy it it's still fun, you know, my last couple fights didn't go the way I wanted to you know
*  What Holloway obviously I thought I gave him a pretty good run
*  It was very good fight he's a big dude
*  It was tough to kind of close that range and I was in on some of his some of his legs
*  I just couldn't really move him
*  He felt like he was part of the part of the cake a tree, you know
*  and then you know took that fight with crane zombie and obviously didn't go as I expected but uh
*  Yeah, I got to bounce back from this one
*  When you think about your preparation like between when you first started to now like as you get older
*  Is there anything that you do differently? I
*  Don't spar as much I think I would spar three days a week always
*  Five rounds, you know for five round fights six rounds sometimes now
*  I kind of do two days a week that was a little push push and pull for me and mark and mark
*  What wants us always sparring a lot? Oh, really? He's big into sparring and I I kind of am too
*  I feel like the best way to get in shape for a fight is by fighting, you know
*  And we have good sparring partners. We're not trying to kill each other, right?
*  You know, but our team when I first started it was me and a couple guys that really weren't in UFC now
*  It's you know, it's a bunch of hammers. Oh, you guys that Mark Henry camp is insane
*  I mean, yeah, he's a special guy. There's so many like top flight guys come to him from all around the world
*  Yeah, you know like Zabit Zabit is I mean how you get from Dagestan to Jersey? Yeah, they all they all they all do this
*  They say they're coming. They all fly to Moscow
*  They stay at Moscow for a couple days and they go to Brooklyn stay at Brooklyn for a couple days and they come down
*  So they said are coming the next day. It's usually three days later. That's the rounds they make
*  Why why do they go to Brooklyn first? I don't know. There's a big dog is think community up there
*  I guess they guess I don't know if they take them shopping or something
*  But I never knew Dagestan was a place until I heard it could be yeah
*  I mean, I mean I've maybe heard about it, but I didn't it didn't it didn't feature in my mind
*  It's like a prominent martial arts spot. Yeah. Well, I knew
*  Satie of the wrestler he's from Chechnya right there and he was
*  Remember watching him when I was in high school and this guy was just unbelievable
*  I think he won I don't know how many world championships like 10
*  He was in 10 straight world championships with Olympics and Worlds and he's a Chechen fighter and that's that area this past world championship
*  Ossetia Chechnya and Dagestan, which is like the size of Georgia the state
*  Won the world's just people from that area would have won the world championship in wrestling Wow
*  I just can't fathom that what they just hard people man. Yeah, you see that basketball game that they play
*  You see Harris's yeah, yeah Harris production shout out to will yeah, well, it's the man wills man. I love that guy
*  He's he's a cool dude. He's a great guy and he gets embedded
*  He does he goes to Dagestan he hangs out with them. He eats with them
*  He plays that crazy basketball game with them and he's like a he's a semi-professional player, too
*  Yeah, he's a huge guy. He could have been like a real
*  I mean had a bad knee injury when right college, but it's hilarious watching them play that basketball game
*  Where they grab a hold of each other and drag each other's the mat and submit each other
*  I think I I found the bed, you know, but at least I dribble the ball
*  It's like rugby
*  Slash basketball slash MMA. Yeah, that's probably my only way to get it score some buckets though
*  Weird though like it seems like they might have invented it right? It doesn't has to be has to be do you think like I mean
*  I wonder if it's prominent in Dagestan or was just that camp
*  They get it wrestling they play handball they called handball or used to call gator ball where we have like soccer nets or like
*  Field hockey nets and it's kind of the same thing
*  We you let three steps you pass you could pass the ball no dribbling and then you know
*  It's a bunch of wrestlers playing so we're all tackling each other and everything
*  So we kind of always just do that, but we never did it with basketball hoops
*  So I guess that's that's a little different. Well, we'll said that that's how they warm up
*  They just get out there and like for one hour. They'll play this crazy basketball game. Yeah. Yeah, and then they go train
*  That's what we have we see that with the handball or gator ball
*  We used to call it it kind of makes sense that that would be a good way to warm up, right?
*  Because it's competitive you're running around a lot. It's fun. Yeah fun
*  It's just doing the same old routine
*  But it's interesting that even him even Khabib with that crazy camp and all those
*  Monsters that he trains with makes his way down to aka to train. Yeah, America that is something
*  I always wonder even the guys that come to us. I'm like
*  These guys are all so good. Why don't they just train with each other at home?
*  But I think they like the the fact that they're locked in when they get here
*  Yeah, you know, they have no distractions and and the co I think they come here for the coaching. Yeah, I'm sure
*  I think it's just a different look a different perspective is probably beneficial, but just the fact that
*  You know so many elite fighters from all over the world still want to do their camps either at ATT or with you guys or
*  Aka or you know, there's just so many different places that they travel to have you ever gone somewhere for a camp?
*  Or you just locked yourself down?
*  No, I've always did all my camps in Jersey early in my career though before I mean mark
*  I had mark even before I started training Ricardo and Hanzo and those guys I I went out to aka actually with Thompson
*  I stayed with Johnson Johnson. Josh is the man. I love that dude. Yeah, he was
*  I know I heard I was listening to him a little bit. Um, yeah, he opened his house
*  I stayed his house for a little bit man. He was he's a super good, dude
*  He was kind of a veteran at the time when I came in so he helped me out a little bit
*  I said a couple couple weeks there hanging out at aka and I just wanted to be home
*  I know I wanted to be staying Jersey
*  Yeah, well with your family and everything like that
*  I get it
*  But I think there is probably a benefit for a fight like a lot of great boxers used to go to the Catskills, right?
*  And they would do their training right there and then like a lot of guys today
*  They go to Big Bear, right?
*  Triple G goes up there and a lot of other fighters have their camps up there De La Hoya always did his camps up in Big Bear
*  It's like something about a camp that's very attractive to someone thinking about always locked down in right, right?
*  Yeah, you like it. Yeah your tunnel vision. Yeah
*  Yeah, I I
*  Need I need my family around me. I need my friends around me
*  You know, I feel good in Jersey and I kind of I felt like I built I built it
*  I built it up, you know, that's why people come come to me now, you know
*  Not only me obviously for Mark and Ricardo probably more so for those guys
*  But I showed them that it could be done here and that's why you know
*  We have that the you know the atmosphere that we do I think that is true
*  I mean you definitely were one of the most successful pioneers of MMA coming out of there. Yeah. Yeah
*  So, you know, it's cool to see all these young guys come and train with us and we have a pretty good team now
*  Plus Eddie Alvarez is there and he's you know, been he's a pioneer as well. So
*  When you see Eddie go over to one FC, does that any of that ever look attractive to you?
*  I mean for sure
*  You know if I actually I only have one fight left on my contract now, oh, yeah, you know
*  But I've been in the UFC. I'll be it'll be 13 years. I've been in the UFC coming in February
*  We see mindy mouse went over there. Yeah, my mouse, you know, I mean money talks, you know
*  Yeah, especially this point exactly exactly. Yeah, but I mean honestly if I was being straight up
*  I word I want to finish my career. I do want to finish in the OC, you know
*  I mean I felt like I got in the UFC 5-0, you know, yeah pretty much grew up here. That's crazy
*  So it'd be nice to finish it here, but you know, everything has to make sense
*  Well, you know, you're still near the top of the heap, right? I mean you just fought Max Holloway
*  How long ago was that in July? Yeah, it's not that long
*  You know, obviously the fight with Korean zombie. I mean, I feel like I didn't get a chance to get going
*  He got me a good shot
*  He does hit hard, you know, and you know, I was really down on myself. That was tough. That was a tough one
*  I was really down on myself for why I you know, nobody takes loss as well
*  No one competitive yeah, no one competitive and I definitely took it pretty bad and Christmas is right here and in my head like I
*  I took the fight on short notice
*  But in my head I never once took a fight and didn't think I was gonna win
*  How many how many weeks notice you take it off two weeks? I was in shape. I was training, you know
*  Not like I was training for a fight, but I was training pretty good
*  And I just believe in myself. I thought I was gonna go there
*  You know put this dude away and come home and enjoy Christmas
*  But it turned out to be the opposite, you know and a little depressing during Christmas time
*  You try to be nice with your family and you know love them with your family
*  But you know what's waiting over my head is I just got fucking TKO'd. Yeah
*  Yeah, that's uh
*  Did the emotional side of fighting like the emotional side of losses?
*  like when you see guys just weeping in their locker room and like remember the hardest one for me was Aldo after
*  McGregor knocked him out and he was just in his locker room just weeping like god damn that dude as a tough one
*  So you know, that's
*  That's gonna stay like an infamy. You know what I mean?
*  Yeah forever and always Connor's by the worst guy cuz he's gonna tell everybody about it
*  Everybody's gonna want to cover it and it's just the way it goes. It was such a picture-perfect punch
*  Yeah, I mean he slides back boom drops that left hand in there. I was in the crowd and I was I
*  Was told I was getting the winner of that fight and then when it went down like that
*  I just knew that wasn't gonna happen really. Yeah, I just felt it like I thought I thought Aldo was gonna win back then
*  We didn't know much about Connor. I feel like at that point, you know
*  So I thought Aldo was gonna win and I was gonna get a rematch with him
*  And then when when when Connor did that and then hear him talking about go, I'm gonna go up to 55
*  I'm like damn there goes my chance
*  Yeah that
*  Aldo fight was crazy because I think that was the first time that anybody ever really
*  Disrespected Aldo because Aldo was the fucking man for so long
*  I mean he done the crazy thing about Aldo is he still only 32 years old
*  Yeah, like we were talking about that with the Marlin fight, right? Which you know, is he really you know, you know, yeah
*  Well, they've been following him since the WEC, yeah, I mean he was like 20 then so yeah, I mean he was WEC champion a long
*  Yeah, you know
*  I mean you go back and think about when he knocked out cub Swanson with that flying knee
*  That was a long time ago. It's like a double knee. Yeah
*  Yeah, dude. He was so fucking athletic my explosive
*  Oh, yeah, I don't know. When did he stop throwing leg kicks? I don't know man
*  I wonder I would like to ask him
*  I wonder if like he's got injuries or something like that
*  I know when we fought the first time he threw a leg kick and then I took him down on it on the second one
*  And then he stopped that's the last time he threw a leg kick in both our fights
*  It's crazy because if you watch his early career like watch the Uriah Faber fight
*  It is one of the most horrific displays of destroying someone's leg you've ever seen in a fight. Yeah, it's so fast
*  Oh, man, just no loading just now. Yeah, that's the thing. No loading. He would just just whip those hips in right
*  Well, you know, he was a soccer player like a really good soccer. Right you ever seen videos of him play soccer
*  I seen him juggle the ball and he's like a pro. Yeah, like he could have been a professional
*  And I think soccer players first of all their legs are so conditioned because they're doing all though
*  They're basically sprinting all the time. They're running up and running miles a game
*  I heard yeah, and they're going left and right left and right
*  They're always side to side like they apparently have the highest instances of ACL blowouts. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense
*  Oh, yeah, but because of those legs, you know, although just he was like a whip those legs
*  We just crack that's what I thought when him and Marlon were gonna fight
*  We're gonna see some crazy leg kicks, but neither of them really, you know got him off. I wonder I wonder why all those stop throwing
*  Leg kicks. I really wonder like wonder I mean he's has got really something
*  Right, you know some injury. Yeah, maybe a hip injury
*  You know could be a lot of those kickboxer guys as they get older their hips start falling apart
*  You know, it's it seems to be a big issue with some guys like John Wayne par needs a hip replacement, right?
*  Yeah, I mean he just had his last fight. He won in a boxing match. Yeah, I saw that which is great huge for him
*  He's such a good guy to follow. Yeah, he's such a good energy good positive, dude. And so is his whole family
*  He's just like he's just yeah, great daughters got like 30 fights. Her daughter's a beast. Yeah, she's a beast man
*  I think she's like 14 now. She's a crazy. Yeah, he's he's something special but the poor guy
*  He's been fighting over the last year or two with a really fucked up hip
*  Yeah, like me is falling apart man
*  They're like you got to have a hip replacement the whole inside is just torn apart. All right
*  I'm not looking forward to the future man
*  I'm just you know what I'm looking forward to the future with regenerative. Well, yeah. Well, yeah. Well, you had stem cells
*  I had some stem cells on my shoulder. Yeah, we talked about
*  You don't give it enough time
*  The thing about the stem cells is it really takes like four or five months before it actually kicks in
*  And starts healing things and a lot of guys like yourself. I mean, you know, you don't gather any dust
*  That's the problem but the one in my shoulder it did help it helped a lot and I bet you know early onset arthritis and
*  They did the Wharton jelly. Yeah, and I got that and like six weeks later, you know, I don't know
*  I want another round. I feel like I don't know if it works like that
*  Yeah, another round would definitely help. Yeah, but I think really Panama's the place for you right here
*  Yeah, go down there and get that super sauce. Yeah, my neck's jacked up to a little bit
*  So I wonder if they get I don't know if they help that stuff. What is up with your neck?
*  I got a I guess stenosis
*  Your discs are shrinking. Yeah
*  Yeah, my discs and the holes where the nerve run through is kind of so I got it's tightness
*  Uh, actually was kind of like a little bit before Holloway more and more so after I got epidural on my neck
*  And I was getting the tingles down my arm weakness in my hand a little bit
*  And the epidural really didn't work, but I just did therapy and it got better but it still bugs me a little bit
*  There's a place they I think they have an office in Dallas they have one here in Santa Monica and then there's a place in
*  Germany it's called lifespan medicine and they do this procedure called Regenekin right and Regenekin is what you've heard of it
*  Yeah, Kobe Bryant rest in peace
*  He went to Germany to get it back in his day and so did Peyton Manning went out there
*  Right, but your other athletes and Dana Dana actually went out they do it in US now. They do in US now
*  I've had it a bunch of times
*  I had it done on my neck when I had a bulging disc that was doing the same thing
*  My hands are going numb that kind of shit and it fixed it
*  I also had it recently on my lower back because I was getting
*  sciatica same shit that fixed it it's it's basically more
*  Potent version of platelet rich plasma, but they heat the blood and they add something to it
*  And it's just a radical anti-inflammatory and it's you know, it's good because it's also it's your own blood
*  You know, they take your own blood out spin it and do this procedure to it
*  And then it takes like 12 hours
*  I think 10 or 12 hours for the it to become this they it looks like this yellow
*  Serum and then this yellow serum they inject into all your discs
*  I'm telling you I had my friend Dean Del Rego down there Dean had a real fucked up neck from a car accident
*  Some lady he rides motorcycle some lady fucking clipped him and he went flying fucked his neck up to the point where we're
*  He's a comedian
*  We're hanging around the comedy store and he gets nervous if anybody comes near him like he's worried someone's gonna accidentally bump into him
*  Because he was in so much pain because he was like real stiff
*  And so I sent him to that lifespan medicine place and dude
*  He was fixed up like within a week or two. He was back. Wow. Yeah
*  I would love to just be like a pig cushion, but he'll get me everywhere
*  Well, they can do crazy shit now, but it's a lot of money
*  Yeah, you know if you want to travel to all these different spots, it's but it's there's real
*  Benefiteness my hope is that it's like cell phones
*  Remember when fucking cell phones were giant and they cost a billion dollars
*  It was so expensive and now you can get a cheap phone like I saw a flip phone the other day a Best Buy for
*  50 bucks Wow, I was like you can get a phone for 50 bucks. That's amazing. Yes. Hopefully stem cells goes that route
*  That's what I'm hoping and I'm hoping that see the problem is like healthcare providers
*  Like if you have insurance like insurance doesn't want to cover any of that shit
*  I know it doesn't make sense. They want to cover a surgery but the surgery is 30 grand. I
*  Always wonder like what's the politics behind that? Is there they I'm sure there's some yeah someone's got money
*  You know, so there's always goes I think the hospital is deal with the insurance companies and everybody's working together
*  And they're all making money
*  but
*  They don't want to cover these things because they're treating stem cells like it's a drug and so they're they're they're treating it
*  Like what you're doing is you're taking a drug so these drugs have to go through the same evaluations that the FDA has
*  But if they do that, it's kind of literally cost hundreds of millions of dollars
*  Both FDA didn't they just say CBD is no good. They're so crazy. Those people are awful
*  If they said that anybody who said CBD is no good. You're awful. Yeah, that's so good for you
*  Yeah, the Oxycontin I think is FDA approved
*  I mean like come on. What are we doing here? Well, I think that's the same thing
*  They think of CBD as an untested drug, right?
*  Regardless of how many people have positive effects from it and positive benefits from it the way they look at it
*  It's like this stuff is in competition probably with like non-steroidal anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen
*  Yeah, right, but CBD so much better than all those things. Yeah, I imagine I mean it's natural to like yeah
*  Do you do it you take it? I have yeah, I take it. Yeah, how much you take?
*  I mean, I'm I need to be a little more consistent with it, you know, I'm just like
*  You know my wife I'll go get stuff done standard. How do you feel? I'm like, I feel pretty good
*  I don't know how I always feel pretty good. So I'm like such a bad gauge on that stuff
*  There's a problem with really mentally tough guys because mentally tough guys don't even think about what things feel like they don't fuck it
*  I'm good. I'm just gonna go. Yeah
*  Look at Kane like Kane literally destroyed his body because he was so mentally tough
*  Yeah, oh, yeah
*  Cuz he's such a fucking savage that he'd like he had everything blow out on he did his knees his shoulders his back
*  His neck everything's fucked up when I was went to aka
*  This is before he was in the UFC and I went out there and I seen him sparring with I think Paul
*  Bantello some other like UFC guys and they were just rotating on this and he was just
*  Putting these dudes away and there was we're going to go on to a know
*  Like who is this kid? That guy's gonna be good. No shit before he came to the UFC
*  There was so much hype around him. Everybody was like this motherfucker doesn't get tired
*  Yeah, like he's the heavyweight. You don't see that not like him. His cardio was insane
*  I remember when he fought Big Ben Rothwell
*  He would put it on guys and they would have that hundred yard stare where they were like what the fuck?
*  Like what is happening to me? How is this guy not tired? It didn't make sense. He was like a lightweight
*  Yeah, yeah, but 240 pounds 140 pounds and
*  Great wrestling great jiu-jitsu great everything. Yeah boxing's second to none
*  Yeah, you know and just surprised you with his body, right?
*  Cuz he didn't look to put up with that guy eats a lot of burritos, right? Yeah
*  Yeah, dude to this day. I think in his prom
*  I think he was I mean there's like the argument is him and fador
*  Those are the two arguments and then steep a for his accomplishments, right?
*  I mean, I would have loved to see steep a versus
*  Kane when steep a wouldn't came was in his prime. Yeah, that would have been great
*  That would have been amazing. But you know, it's like
*  This that that model of the heavyweight list the came Velasquez model
*  I don't know if anybody else could do that
*  Like I don't know. I think his his cardio was almost like supernatural
*  I think you know people always ask because people say I've got good cardio and you know, I could push always and they're like
*  You know, what is it from? I think it's all mental more than anything
*  I don't know. Maybe some people are born that way
*  I feel like even the summertime and when I wrestled in the summer
*  I wasn't like in wrestling season shape. I was gonna be the guys in better shape just cuz just your mind
*  It's just my mind. Yeah, I think it's most of its mind. Everybody's like do you get tired? I'm like fuck. Yeah, I get tired
*  I just keep going. I think everyone gets tired. Mmm, can you see some guys that
*  You know are really really good and they're just scared to get tired. So they're scared to push them
*  I seen that in wrestling a lot. You kind of see them in may, you know
*  Some guys where they're just scared to get tired so they don't push it too hard. Yeah, that's real, right? Yeah
*  Yeah, yeah, there's some mind game going on where you don't want to drain the battery, right?
*  You don't want to like it seemed like Marlin against Aldo. There was a little bit of that like yeah
*  Yeah, easing off the gas right especially after this fight. Oh fight. Yeah, you know, I was in I was in the corner from Marlin and
*  It was going great that first round. I'm like man. This is great
*  Paces like how Marlon likes it, you know wasn't too crazy and then so who don't turn that on and I just seen the look
*  And in Marlin's face, I'm like in the second round he got up and looked at me and I was like, you know
*  I'm trying to pump him up like dude. Come on. Let's go
*  But I just see dude's eyes first round looked like Marlin was gonna establish himself as the best pound for pound fighter in the world
*  Yeah, I mean he even looks so good
*  He was his kickboxing was off the charts that fucking left leg switch kick that he has to the head is like a whip
*  It's crazy the way he does it. Yeah, it's so light and effortless. He just swings it up there. Yeah
*  It was when Marlon Edson came in the camp my legs hurt for for a good couple months
*  No Edson's terrifying his switch kicks the fastest shit I've ever seen in my life. Yeah, it doesn't make sense
*  I don't even know how he moves that quick. He's he's a freak. He's like he's super tight, too
*  That's why he it's like a rubber band
*  You know, I mean let's snaps as it goes fast super tight like in what way like
*  Just like not he's not very flexible. Really? Yeah
*  I mean you could do wheel kick and do all that stuff cuz I think it's just he was doing since he's a kid
*  Right his body's made for that. But as far as being like a flexible guy, it's not very flexible
*  I mean, I'm not very flexible either, but I'm not kicking like him. That's interesting. I would have thought that guy would be real flexible
*  Yeah, no, what about Marlon? Marlon's probably a little bit more flexible. He's still he's still not very flexible either. That's crazy
*  How's he throw that switch kick to the head like that? I just think their bodies from doing it forever
*  They're like made to do that Wow. Yeah, and they're there wheel kicks like crazy
*  Yeah, but as far as like touching their toes, you know, we'd go to yoga together and you hear Marlon
*  How often you do yoga I try try to do it once a week when I'm not in camp when I'm in camp
*  I don't do it as much cuz I kind of takes away from something else
*  I try to do it once a week hot yoga hot. Yeah
*  I love it. I love it and everyone that's never done it. They need to fucking do it because everyone's like yoga
*  My brother's hard as shit hard as shit. No bullshit. I've been in some yoga classes that if my boy wasn't in there
*  I might have walked out cuz I'm not I'm like, I'm gonna see me walk out the place I go to they don't let you leave
*  Yeah, really? No, I can't leave you just make a commitment when you hear if you can't take it to sit down
*  Yeah, and really and try to rest it off, you know
*  Try to take a couple poses off try to get your heart rate back down, but it's hot as fuck
*  I've done some yoga me and my wife
*  Went to the yoga class once was me and her and it was so hot and the lady's like how you guys feel with the
*  Eat and I'm like
*  Please Renee say say it's too hot
*  It's one of the most underrated difficult exercises because you think of it as like housewives or moms, right?
*  I like a bunch of gals bunch of hot girls and yoga pants. Yeah, I'm only dude in there sometimes
*  Yeah, me too. Sometimes well, there's more guys in my place now. Well, you're starting to see this
*  Sometimes it's actually half and half. It's kind of interesting. Yeah, I mean it's it's I think it's great for you
*  Yeah, it's so my I too like when I say I'm done fighting. I'm sure that's something I'll do more often
*  Well for me too, it's like a 90 minute meditation session, too
*  Yeah, it's all you're thinking about as those poses all I'm thinking about is concentrating on keeping them
*  Maintaining a steady breath and then holding the positions as long as possible. Yeah. Yeah, and I like just it's like, you know
*  The instructor or yogi is giving you
*  Positive affirmations, I mean so it's a little wonky but you know, it's always like a good a good message
*  Yeah, sometimes some of them go a little bit crazy. Some of them try to give you life lessons. Yeah. Well, yeah
*  So well, well and then also like oh, this is your lower intestines is getting no, it's not what do you mean?
*  Yeah, over. Yeah. Yeah, it's massaging your descending colon. No, it's definitely not. It's definitely not you're just stretching stop
*  I
*  Sweat like a maniac in there. Yeah, it's great. It's definitely good for you
*  Oh my god, you can lose amazing amounts of weight in there
*  but I just think like for maintaining strength in your joints and
*  Strengthen it always feels to me and maybe this is just my head but like it's
*  Helping all the connections like shoulders and hips and knees and like all the other stuff that doesn't
*  Necessarily get the same kind of workout when you're just doing regular stuff right weight training or kettlebells or kickboxing whatever
*  you you're working out like
*  Holding your leg in one certain position and like leaning forward and just maintaining that
*  Static holds. Yeah. Yeah, I feel like it tightens all your connections up and it also increases your range of motion and it does opens
*  You up, you know, I feel so much better when I'm doing yoga and I would like to do it more often be honest
*  I just I don't want to miss hitting pads and all that stuff. That's the thing, right?
*  It's like for a mixed martial artist. There's so many skills to
*  Concentrate on there's so much if you're a boxer, what are you gonna do? You got to run and you got a box
*  Yeah, that's it. Right. Yeah when you're a mixed martial artist god damn you got to think about everything
*  And you don't want to overdo one and under do another, you know, how do you know what to do?
*  You know, I came up with a
*  Formula and seems to work. What's your formula? I got you know, just my schedule is I do jiu-jitsu Monday Friday. I spar
*  Either well used to be Tuesday Thursday Saturday. I'll wrestle
*  Wednesday and
*  Friday and then strength and conditioning between all that Jesus. Yeah, just hearing that makes me tired
*  But what what is your strength conditioning schedule I do that Monday and Wednesdays Monday and Wednesdays
*  Yes, and when you do it, do you do it before MMA training?
*  Like I usually do grappling or wrestling before and then do that after really? Yeah, why do you do that?
*  That's just the way it kind of worked out for me. So do you do it the same day?
*  I mean, I mean the same time of day like noon like you'll do your now. I'll just do it morning
*  I'll do jiu-jitsu and then at the afternoon all
*  So you give yourself a chance to recover? Yeah. Yeah
*  Although it's like it's like ten and two so it's quick
*  Just enough to eat. Yeah, it's enough to eat and drive, you know, Jersey's a commuter state. So I drive everywhere man
*  I know there's only I don't think any none of the places I train are in Tom's or in my town
*  So right I'm always on the move home what jerseys got a lot of fucking traffic too. It does but it's like it's not predictable
*  Yeah predictable traffic, you know, I mean, you know, if you miss the rush hour, you're good here
*  You never know what wait in until see that I've been coming home from a comedy club at 2 o'clock in the morning
*  I hit pump it above our traffic. Yeah, that's crazy. It looks just too many of us
*  I was actually I didn't even realize I stayed right across the street from the comedy store. Oh which place?
*  Mandarin Mandarin Mandarin
*  Mondrian right? Yes. Why can I see that when someone says something wrong? Sometimes you go, how do you say it right?
*  Mondrian yeah, that is right across the street. Yeah, I didn't realize till I woke up the next day
*  I'm like, oh shit. I should have went there last night
*  Yeah, it's anytime you want to go there even if I'm not there just let me know I said it
*  So when you are in Tom's River like what is a typical day for you when you when you leave your house like
*  I got on a Monday morning like what what time do you get going? What time do you eat?
*  Yeah, I get up like eight o'clock. I guess not an early guy
*  Get up at eight. I'll eat something. I'm out of the house by 830 845 get the Ricardo's for like 10 a.m. Practice 930 practice
*  Practice for two hours drive back home, which is like about 45 to an hour
*  And when you practice and you practice in with the ghee no no gig never
*  Not in a long time. Yeah, Ricardo actually believe it or not told us not to really yeah
*  He said the ghee will always be there. He said you always go back to the ghee when you're done
*  He's like right now. It's just not applicable for MMA
*  I'm so glad he said that yeah, man. That is I don't know hopefully don't get mad for saying that
*  Well, that was a giant problem with like so many Brazilians were so connected to the ghee that they would be offended if you didn't
*  Yeah, with the game. I get really mad at you. That's what I thought when I first went to him like I'm a
*  But I did a lot of gay stuff now. You know yeah, we did a little bit
*  You know mess with it. It's it is good for you. It's good. It's great for defense
*  I think it's good for people like myself where I use a lot of wrestling and athleticism for my jiu-jitsu because it kind of
*  Takes that away and makes you you know pay attention to technique
*  Yeah, it makes you concentrate on defense because you can't just muscle out of things right
*  And with a lot of fighters, you know, especially like real explosive guys
*  They get used just janking out things and you know when someone's got collars and grips on your sleeves, you can't
*  Systematically think about what you're doing. Yeah, you got to apply pressure
*  You got to have good position you have you got to be patient, too
*  You can't expose yourself because you're impatient. You just want to get out of a spot, right?
*  Yeah, that is that that's the positive aspect of the gi the negative aspect of the gis when guys
*  Go from the gi to MMA and they're looking for those handles and the handles are there. Yeah
*  But Eddie always told us just do the gi but don't use collars
*  Don't use collars and sleeves. So my gi game was really just no gay in a gay
*  Yeah, honestly probably when I did the gay I was most I didn't grab as much as someone so he wasn't used to it in
*  Desperado times I'll grab the gi. Yeah
*  Get fucked up
*  but for the most point I think it's you're better off just using over hooks and under hooks and cable grips and just
*  Working your your same positions that we do in no gi so then you're doing the same game always
*  Yeah
*  But I'm glad Ricardo said that because they have such an accomplished Brazilian jiu-jitsu artists like him
*  Who's got this gigantic school and who was a accomplished fighter himself?
*  And now as a judge right to have him say that like yes
*  Yes
*  For a long time people got so connected to this idea that you need to do the gi in order to be good
*  In MMA, which is no gi. Yeah
*  Yeah, I mean, you know even like Gary tone in and Gordon Ryan
*  I don't think those guys are in the game very often it very rarely. Yeah
*  Yeah, I think why I think that Gordon Ryan has done some matches recently in the game
*  Maybe Gary tone it too. I mean they know how to use it. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, but it's uh, you know
*  It just makes everything
*  More you know, it's just there's so much more friction so much
*  There's so many things you can do in the game. You cannot do in an MMA fighter or in a no-gi contest
*  Yeah, it's really just not applicable at all. So
*  That's good. We don't I figure when I'm old I'll put the gi on you know, yeah
*  Yeah, well, it's you could I mean this guy's in my jiu-jitsu class or in their 60s. Yeah, still rock. Yeah, that's what's great
*  You know, he's nice and slow
*  It's uh, it's something I'll definitely do in the future
*  So you go there you do that class and like how far you're driving a lot all these different?
*  Yeah, how much time you do in your car a couple hours a day? Oh shit
*  Liable fucking car. Yeah. Yeah
*  Yeah, I do I got a pine belt smudge ship. So I get to drive a nice Ram or Silverado
*  Oh, you got a deal with yeah, I drive it for the demo. Oh, that's turned in for a thing
*  I got a Cadillac CTS V2. I know you're in the closet. I love CTS V. Yeah, those things are beast
*  Yeah, it's fun. I got a little stage two tune on it and stuff. Really? Yeah, it can move and move
*  That's a fast car. That's a good Italian guy in Jersey car. Yeah, it's perfect
*  It's right. So
*  So how have you ever thought about living somewhere where everything is you just so connected to Tom's River you'd never move
*  Yeah, I mean it well now Nick Atone is in brick too, and he has a huge facility in brick
*  So what's where we do a lot of our sparring? That's like 20 minutes away
*  So that that's uh, you know, he's been there he's been there for now a couple years and he's like a 30,000 square foot gym
*  Oh really two full cages punch a match base. Oh, wow. It's a ring. It's a phenomenal facility
*  What's it called Nick Atone's mixed martial arts academy? Okay, cool. That's awesome, man
*  It's amazing that these gyms are they're so good now
*  It's like it was so hard in the beginning to find one facility that had this kind of place
*  Even the country is only a couple gyms whether it was an aka or Jackson's or when I first started I
*  Graduated college and it was like in May graduated college
*  I wanted you know ultimate fighters the first season ultimate fighter was on I think was
*  They had the finale in May. I watched it with my teammates. I'm like dude. I'm giving this a try
*  You know cost check was uh was on the on the season
*  He wrestled for Edinburgh's of Clarion were in the same conference. So I see him. Oh my god, man
*  He's doing pretty well, I'm gonna give this a shot
*  So I found a place to train and Kurt Pellegrino actually had a gym in in near my town
*  So I called him up. I knew him to wrestling. He's like he's like I'm actually moving to Florida
*  He's like but you can come train here for a couple days before I go
*  I'm a guy so I came there and a new guy was taking his gym over and so that's where I ended up staying and it's
*  Gym was no bigger than this room here. Wow, you know, and you see all these young kids have this 30,000 square facility
*  I'm like dude, you guys are fucking spoiled man
*  Yeah, it's a different world now, I mean it's there's only
*  There's no other sport like MMA where if you go back to like the 90s and then you look at it today
*  It's unrecognized. Oh, yeah, it is. It's
*  Just martial arts is
*  Changes like you say it all the time, you know how quickly
*  UFC or MMA change martial arts forever. Yeah, we'll never look at it the same way again
*  Martial arts have evolved more over the last 20 years than they have over the last 20,000
*  Yeah, and that's just I don't think anything that's done that
*  Go back and watch UFC one and then go watch UFC 246
*  it's like what the fuck man like everyone is so evolved now and
*  Even you know across weight classes. It's just it's just such an interesting thing that we figured out how to do it
*  Right. Yeah, I mean shit even when I started 2005 to now it's changed a whole bunch
*  Yeah, no for sure. Yeah, I mean 2005 was when the Ultimate Fighter was on right?
*  Dude, how crazy is it? Diego Sanchez is still out there throwing. It's amazing. He's the last of the Mohicans
*  It really is right. He's the last one on that show. Yes. Oh for sure. Yeah
*  I mean Stefan Bonner's long gone right for his Griffin's long gone. He's working for the UFC now and
*  Fucking Diego Sanchez still still still screaming. Yes. Yeah in cartwheels. He's a special dude, man
*  He's crazy. Yeah, he's a wild motherfucker man. He is he's a
*  His outlook he was kind of strange on the show. I'm gonna go. Oh, yeah, but just like he's straight a different different personality
*  He's weird definitely weird, but he's also got a mind like a fucking bank vault. Yeah, tense
*  Yeah, I mean his his wills unbreakable that guy does not quit. He's lost before he's been stopped before but
*  You ain't getting him to quit. I remember when he fought BJ just kept coming
*  Yeah, his head split open with the head kick crazy. This guy's nuts. Yeah. No, I mean in all of his fights
*  I mean, he's he's an animal. I mean, yeah, and he's such an entertaining guy
*  I mean you think about some of his fights that he fought even at 170 against guys like Jake Allenberger Martin Marvin
*  Yeah, and Campman had his face hanging off
*  media giant cuts all over Diego's face and in the third round Diego's chasing him. Yeah, just chasing him down like god damn
*  He's tough his willpower second to none. I think it's insane. It's insane and he's still out there
*  He is still out there throwing his yeah
*  It's it's impressive. I mean these guys are setting the bar high, you know, yeah real high
*  Yeah, and it's interesting like Diego. I've always thought was like a guy who could have benefited from a 165 pound class
*  I feel like the UFC
*  I've been saying this forever. I'm a broken record, but I think they should reorganize the weight classes and put weight classes every 10 pounds
*  Yeah, there's too many big gaps like the 85 to 205 pound gap. That's crazy. Yeah, that's so big
*  Yeah, I mean if they have time look they have
*  Plenty of fighters right and there's plenty they just should move some of these weight classes around
*  I think this could do even though Sanios to him in Kessa, you know, I think those signs surprise 65 pounder
*  Probably he looks so much smaller than Kessa to kiss. How the fuck did he ever make?
*  Man I seen him, you know after he made I'm like dude, which you were always a 70 pounder
*  Yeah always I've just was really impressed how he was able to control Rafael dos Angios
*  I mean I didn't get to see that the fight I was actually flying down here
*  But yeah, I seen you know highlights. I mean, I think he took him down five or six times. Yeah, man
*  He's a fucking he his arms are so long
*  They were in positions where a lot of guys would have to kind of like hold on but he could reach all the way
*  Clamp his hands together. He like oh what an advantage that is. It's like when I train with the beat
*  That's all I feel like six two. Yeah
*  Can cover my head and my toes and he's only you know, it's only half of him
*  He's got the weirdest style man because his style is like, you know, he does like scissor takedowns
*  But it's got like a lot of wheel kicks and 360 roundhouse kung fu, right? It is kung fu, right?
*  It's a real kung fu, but also with wrestling
*  Santa oh, yeah, I think it's it's it's a form of kung fu. Oh, yeah. It's kung fu. Yeah. Yeah, he's
*  He's one of the more unusual guys in the in the sport. Yeah, he is. He's got a quiet demeanor, too
*  Yeah, well, it was Abraham Lincoln. He does he does
*  As soon as he walked in that's what everyone said well
*  Everybody says too that you haven't even seen what he can do like in the gym
*  You see what he could do and like I was talking mark about him
*  And he's like dude
*  This is like back before Zabeeb had really made a name for himself and he's like that fucking guy
*  He goes the real deal super super talented. Yeah, I was really impressed with Calvin cater though in their last fight
*  Yeah, you know, um that third round who seemed like is a B kind of lost some steam
*  Yeah, well, I started coming on a little bit was digging to the body a lot to got great hands
*  As good as anybody
*  It's by me might be one of the best jabs in his fucking right hand to the right hand that he knocked out llamas with
*  Dude, oh man. Yeah Calvin. He's on another level when it's striking
*  Particularly with his hands like he does a lot of training with boxers. Yeah, so here dude
*  He's a Boston guy, right? Yeah, and only getting better, you know, he's going to yeah
*  He's he's just beginning to get into the top tier of guys, you know
*  I mean he beats Shane Burgos with that beautiful knockout and
*  The Ricardo Llamas knockout was just spectacular
*  So llamas had you know fought for the title llamas was a top guy and then the Zabit fight when Zabit is like right there
*  At the very top of the heap at 145 and who knows what the fuck would happen if that was a five rounder
*  I know because Calvin was putting it on him
*  He was at that point and when Zabit took him down the third he basically just hung on in the end
*  Yeah, just found the way. Yeah, just yeah
*  Calvin's dangerous he's dangerous and getting better and he's boy. What a fucking division man your division found five
*  They you're leaving the division that you're leaving. Yeah
*  35 no fucking sweeter. Let's be real, you know killers there too, but you'll be a bigger guy
*  Yeah, I mean, I still don't think I'll be the biggest guy either at 35, but I'll definitely be you know much more
*  Comparable to the rest of them. Well, it was interesting because even when you're fighting at 55
*  A lot of people are saying that you should be 35. Yeah, I like you buying might be right
*  I give you weighs 55 a lot of the guys that weigh 55 compete at 35. Yeah
*  Shit what's his oh my god
*  Lockhart George Lockhart was on oh, yeah, and he's sitting on here and he said I can make 25 so slow down George
*  I don't know about 25
*  25 yeah, you look like TJ Dillshaw. Yeah, that was a mistake. Yeah
*  That was out of all the there's only two well he his was real bad all the way up and to the way in
*  TJ the way he looked you know, he looked like
*  Like he was starving to death. That's what he looked like he did
*  Cheeks were sucked in his face was sucked down. It was really bad decision
*  No, even because he had to you know, they take the APO to try to train. Yeah, it was just terrible
*  You know 35 he was the fucking champ and like a really good fighter at 35
*  And to take that stuff. I don't know, you know Cody
*  Cody Cody Garbrandt was accusing him of taking it even before then
*  He said he didn't Cody's actually training with us now, too. Oh, is it? Yeah. Oh, that's a good move for him
*  That's a very good move for him and mark been working together. He was out. He's out for a week
*  He went back. He stole you know, he's still at a alpha male, too
*  That's right
*  You know
*  He was talking to me about that and mark was like giving him some
*  Real good pointers on some of the things that he does or exposes himself right how to make sure he's more protected and make sure he's more
*  More elusive more difficult to read right do some different kind of things
*  But yeah, he's been with us for a little bit now. He went back to alpha male
*  But he's coming back and finished camp with us. So got sick hands. He's got some of the sick hands
*  I got you know, I try you know see Marlon see all these guys but Cody's hands are so fast man
*  Yeah, he's fast as fuck and he could there is he can come back man. He can come back
*  He just you know, he had that fight with TJ lost lost the rematch and then lost again to Pedro Munoz
*  So you're like goddamn like he's just so game but all three of those fights. I mean he was he was in him
*  Oh, yeah, he had those guys rocked. I think you know and that Pedro Munoz guy has a chin made out of steel
*  Steel and you know and he knows it too. He's like he's like I'll stand in front of anybody
*  Yeah, he has that belief in himself and one of the nastiest guillotines in the game
*  Yeah, that guy's got a fucking sick clamp. He gets a hold of your neck. Whoo. Hey me trouble. Yeah, it's um, it's a
*  Fucking that division that whole division that you're about to drop down into. Yeah, that's just as scary as a division you're in now
*  Yeah, you mean you can't go anywhere nowadays. Yeah. Yeah, there's no picnics. There's no there's no easy
*  Nothing easy even for the ladies. There's no there's no easy ladies divisions
*  It just they just every way clash is getting deeper and deeper and that's just the progression of the sport
*  You know, I mean, you know, even when I first started it wasn't at you know
*  Maybe the top five top ten now you got top 20 or you know, some something good some dogs, you know
*  Yeah, what do you think you're gonna do when you retire? I
*  Don't know I don't know I I have I'm involved with UFC gym
*  I have one in North Brunswick, New Jersey one of Riverdale, you know kind of partnered up with a couple guys
*  I'll definitely stay involved in this sport. How does that work?
*  Does the UFC contact you and say hey Frankie you want to be involved in one of these gyms? Um, I think we sought them out
*  They sought me out type thing
*  You know that process took took a while to get to where we're at now
*  I started like inquiring about the UFC gym back in 2014 2015. They must be popular as fuck though, right?
*  They're all I want a trainer to UFC. Yeah, you would think I think some people are just
*  They think when they think you have siege in America, I'm not wanting to go fighting anybody
*  But it's not even like that you see Jim's a family atmosphere, man
*  You don't have to go take a fight class. You can go just train and or take a martial arts class
*  Yeah now when they have these UFC gyms, do they have?
*  Like sparring classes jujitsu classes. They have everything. Yeah, they have everything. Yeah, so it's just like a fight gym
*  It's like a fight. No, it's more I'd say it's more like an LA Fitness like LA Fitness fucked a fight gym. Yes, exactly exactly
*  It's this love child LA Fitness in a fight gym. Yeah, and do you train at those places? I do some from time to time
*  Yeah, you know, but I'm always you but usually go up there and teach a class or seminar stuff like that
*  When you train with mark where you're true with mark his basement really? Yeah or a little or like nicotones
*  But but you mostly his basement we start out in his basement. How big is his basement? It's big. He lives me
*  He owns a pizza ray. He does pretty well me. He's got he kills it with the pizza business
*  He has amazing
*  No bullshit. It's some of the best pizza in Jersey and no bullshit
*  That's a big statement cuz Jersey Jersey get great pizza and his is very good. No, I'm not lying
*  Where's it at?
*  New Jersey Pino's pizza Pino's Frankie sent you
*  And so his basement he has decked out like a gym. Yeah, it is it
*  It's start. Yeah, he's got like whole workout stuff. You got a full, you know full basement pretty nice house
*  Then he put mats on the thing and you know, but you're like of our posters are up there. So it's cool
*  Yeah, but I started with mark and literally in 2005 and that's we started in the basement
*  Now did you have any striking experience before that none just just see sideboard walk. That's about it
*  So what was it like going from just big straight wrestling to learning how to strike and wrestle together
*  It was it was learning process, you know early in my career
*  I was able to take everybody down in those early fights, but I had some pretty good fights even before UFC
*  I fought Davidius
*  something Davidius he was
*  this
*  Ukraine type fight. I don't know he fought WC
*  He beat some good guys. So he was decent. I was able to take him down
*  I fought Jim Miller actually my last fight for UFC and I was sure yeah, we had a crazy fight
*  so, you know, I had good opponents right away, but
*  striking, you know
*  Something I really liked I was always in the boxing growing up. I was always in the fight and I you know jerseys
*  You know, I'm not from the hood or by any means but everyone fights where I'm from, you know
*  It's kind of like see someone goes to see so I look for fights. That's kind of nature of it
*  Yeah, I mean you hear Joey Diaz talking about it. So, you know
*  Jim Miller is a fucking beast. He is a beast. I'm so glad he's healthy now because that guy struggled
*  Yeah, so long with Lyme disease. Yeah, my wife has it actually does she really dealing with it?
*  since
*  2007
*  Everybody gets it in the East Coast. Yeah, it's crazy
*  How many people have you know, and it's just they say that there was a we did this
*  This we looked at this map online of all the areas in the East Coast where Lyme disease is prevalent and how what percentage?
*  Of the ticks have it. It's bananas. Oh, yeah
*  You it's it's my wife's neurotic with it too because you know, she's had to go through a bunch of you know
*  Treatments and whatnot and is it still with her right now? It is it's not as much but she's got like a bunch of issues
*  like autoimmune stuff, I think you know and
*  She's caught she's doing she's does the IV treatments the sunlight therapy
*  It's like when they take the blood out running through UV then put it back in you
*  Oh, yeah, she's done a lot of a lot of stuff and she does she's starting to feel better
*  With Jim, I think he changed his diet. I think that was a big one just really started eating clean
*  Yeah, my wife eats pretty clean. She's she's a you know, kind of holistic ish type person
*  Yeah, um the the the Lyme disease thing is fucking terrifying because for a long time
*  They were diagnosing it incorrectly like people didn't know whether it was
*  And people would come in with all sorts of aches and pains and if they didn't have that big bullseye mark on them
*  Where the the tick bit them the doctor really had no idea what was going on and some doctors didn't have a lot of experience
*  With it, right? I got it when I was young. Did you yeah, but I've seen the tick
*  I got our medicine right away and and I was fine
*  But they say if you don't see the tick and then you just don't know you have it and then if you don't get on
*  Medicine right away, then you're fucked and it's in you for probably ever. Oh
*  Yeah, I'd say like it's not even that Lyme disease. It's the others the other diseases get attached to it. Yes
*  Well, there's a thing called more jellins. Have you ever heard of more Jones?
*  Yeah, well jellins is a disease that a lot of people think is like a like a psychological disease
*  They think that like you're imagining things because they would imagine that like fibers were growing out of their scabs and they'd scratch
*  Themselves like crazy, right? But I had some good insight
*  We did a television show called Joe Rogan questions everything and we we had some
*  one of the conversations I had was with a doctor who has Lyme disease and that's when things got interesting because
*  He was aware of it
*  Not just as a person who has the disease
*  But also as a doctor and he said one thing that all these people that have more jellins have in common is that they all
*  have Lyme disease and he thinks that Lyme disease is not just one thing that it's a host of other things that are attached to
*  Lyme disease like
*  non
*  identified pathogens, yeah, and that some of them have
*  Some sort of neurotoxic effect that changes the way you see things
*  So he was seeing things like that weren't there like he was seeing worms crawling around on his eye that weren't more even there
*  Weren't there and he realized like okay, this is probably what more jellins is like these people are thinking that things are growing in their skin
*  But there's nothing there, but it's really because the Lyme disease and all the other
*  Toxins and pathogens that come with it are fucking with your neurology. Yeah, they're fucking with your brain
*  Yeah, yeah, my wife said brain fog is probably the biggest thing that that bothers her, you know
*  And she went through a period where she was always tired and it's crazy because my wife you would never guess it because she's super
*  High-energy she works out every day, you know, just pushes through it pushes through it
*  But it's definitely something she has to constantly treat you remember when people had chronic fatigue syndrome
*  Yeah, it would always talk where'd that go? Yeah
*  I know this is not like a thing that everybody always had but it's an excuse that excuse
*  See that's that's you this he's mentally tough
*  How do I feel I feel good let's go that's it I feel good
*  You know, I mean my wife
*  it's
*  Shouldn't it's just expensive to haul these damn tree. Oh, yeah, and
*  Well Marcus Davis all of his UFC money. He spent treating his wife for Lyme disease. Yeah, he wound up
*  He's a prison guard now is he really somewhere? Yeah, I think he's still doing that, you know, he's good buddies with Delagrate
*  Yeah, yeah, Delagrate. It was keeping me posted on him, but he wound up
*  Like his wife got it real bad. I think he spent more than a quarter million dollars. Yeah, just treating her not that much
*  I mean, I know that's my wife's not telling me but
*  It's fucking bad. My friend Steve vanilla
*  He and his son got it and the doctors didn't recognize it the doctors
*  He was like, I think it might be Lyme disease
*  The doctors didn't think so and his son started getting Bell's palsy. So fat half his face and his son was little
*  I think he was like four or five half his face was going numb. Yes
*  That happened to my wife actually she knows palsy to one time. Yeah, I think she got a flu shot
*  She said and then came home. She got Bell's palsy. She's yeah
*  Yeah, it's a fucking creepy disease man
*  It is because no one seems to know what to do with it and you know
*  They had a vaccine for a little while but the problem with the vaccine was people were and this is including my manager's dad
*  took the vaccine and
*  got
*  Lyme disease from the vaccine I keep hearing this with vaccines or even flu shot like
*  I'll get the flu shot and they get the flu, you know
*  I've heard that people get sick when they get the flu shot
*  But then I've talked to people that are vaccine people and they're like no
*  You probably were already getting the flu and the flu shot that you got was the wrong one for whatever flu was in the area
*  Well, I also heard too
*  They give you the strain from last year and then there's the new strain this year. So it's not even really helping you
*  Well, I think there's multiple strains each year and I think they're basically just head yes bet
*  I don't take flu shots. No, hell no. Yeah, but I I think they do work if you get lucky. Yeah
*  I mean I believe in vaccines for sure, but I don't think that it always works in the flu shot case
*  I'm not sure because like sometimes sometimes they just get it wrong. Like they have the wrong strain, right? Right? What do we know?
*  No, I know it's a fucking touchy subject any morons
*  With that with the lines these my my way there's a conspiracy theory that that's the government
*  In the wild well, there was a conspiracy theory that it there was actually
*  Look this up Jamie because there was actually something about this they were talking about recently where
*  They were looking in there was they were investigating the idea that Lyme disease
*  Was a biological warfare weapon that
*  Accidentally got released but this is through like legitimate channels. They were investigating
*  Yeah, it wasn't like some fucking tinfoil hat job. They released on the East Coast
*  I guess right now where they wanted to release it. I think it got out
*  I think the idea is that somehow or another this disease had accidentally escaped their labs or while they were in the middle of
*  Treating people is a tick the only way you can get Lyme disease. I believe so. Yeah, and it's the ticks
*  I think it's deer ticks
*  I think it's places that have a high population of deer also have a high population of these ticks and then when
*  People get it. It's less, you know, most of them don't realize they have it until it's too late
*  Yeah
*  so you don't realize you have it and then you miss the early rounds of antibiotics which can knock it out and
*  Then you get this chronic state like Jim Miller has and your wife has and yeah my buddy Steve Rinella that had it
*  He was fucked up. I mean bad for at least six months when I saw him
*  He looked like he had lost and he's a slim guy
*  but he looked like he's a lot he had lost 20 or 30 pounds and
*  It was just said he'd just been dealing with the the Lyme disease and it just killed him
*  I mean not killed him but just just just really diminished eat a body. Yeah, yeah, it's fucking
*  It's a weird disease man because you you can't find anybody who doesn't know anybody who has it
*  He's cut yeah, everybody knows a brother or cousin or a wife someone has it it's great
*  I love running the woods and trails but like in the summertime
*  It's like man, you just I'm so nervous to get ticks or my kids. I don't my kids going out in it
*  Well, I think it takes 24 hours for it to set in so like once you once you do come back if you have a tick
*  On you just have to remove. Yeah. Yeah, so we do every time we go in the woods tick checks
*  How do you get him off you though? If like it's what if it's like in the middle of your back and you're by yourself
*  Yeah, I guess she's like one of those back scratchers or something
*  Like here it is was Lyme disease created as a bio weapon. Is this a legit website?
*  It's yes how stuff won't how stuff works. It's not
*  Unlegit, but that's that's legit how stuff works is very legit. I just sort of read through the whole article
*  It's sort of unproven but there are some people I believe that think that this is a thing
*  It just would be very hard to do is what the end look at us
*  Ticks as weapons issue made headlines back in July 2019. Thanks to the US House of Representatives
*  Chris Smith our New Jersey
*  Republican, New Jersey who introduced legislation legislation directing the Department of Defense to review claims that the Pentagon research ticked base
*  bioweapons in the mid 20th century
*  The amendment passed Smith said he was inspired by a number of books and articles suggesting that significant research had been done the US government
*  Facilities including Fort Detrick, Maryland and Plum Island, New York to turn ticks and other insects into bioweapons
*  Imagine if those cunts created a fucking disease and now everyone knows has it what the fuck because it's mostly out there
*  That's what's fucked up. Yeah, it is. It is a lot lime isn't lime a place in Connecticut. Yes
*  Yeah, what is that why they named it lime disease? I mean, I think that's why they named it that
*  You've heard of the Rocky Mountain tick. Yeah, it's not kind of the West Coast version of well, it's Texas
*  It's I think or the Lone Star tick that's that's different Lone Star. It makes you not like meat or something
*  Yes, alpha gal alpha galactose. It does something. I think that's the word
*  It it makes you allergic to me to me
*  Yeah, so you literally go the rest your life and you can't eat meat if to eat like chicken and fish shoot me
*  What is that? The first cases of it were there in 1975? Yeah, the goddamn government they're creating bioweapons
*  I'm not surprised no
*  I talked to the Soviet Union guy when I was doing that television show and he was saying that they they had all sorts of
*  Bioweapons that they were developing over there gotta be giant pits filled with anthrax
*  Other ticks in other countries or limacies in other countries. That's a good question
*  That's a very good question. That would that would like sort of
*  Explain while we're in conspiracy. Well, have you seen the coronavirus stuff? Yeah
*  Conspiracies about it. Yeah, what's the conspiracy? There's like a level four
*  Bioweapon facility opened in Wuhan
*  Not too long ago and I before the suggestions are and I don't know I'm I'm not saying it the suggestions are online
*  Something might have leaked just like this. Have you consulted with Sam Tripley or Eddie Bravo?
*  From who from Sam or Eddie I think Sam's retweeted some stuff. Oh, of course, of course he has I've seen other stuff online too
*  Well, I mean, I think whatever news out there. There's always some conspiracy theory that goes with it, right?
*  That's true. Even if it's like lock look
*  I saw conspiracy theories that Connor threw the fire cowboy through the fight with car people
*  It was a fixed fire and I had my cousins like oh, I can't believe cowboy would do that. I mean do what?
*  Crack do what people are crazy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I I was upset at Stephen A Smith and now yeah, he made a video
*  Come on
*  listen
*  Stephen A Smith, I guess I should respond right
*  You're very entertaining guy I like you a lot and I appreciate the props you gave me in that video
*  But you're wrong. Yeah cowboy got cowboy got fucked up with those shoulders in the clinch
*  He had Connors arms tied up and they're in tight spaces
*  Connor dips low and slams this bone of his shoulder into the nose and he's at the beginning of the round
*  Connors a fucking super explosive guy
*  Super explosive all muscles fucking pulled tight the beginning of the fight and just bang bang
*  He got off good shots and cowboy was confused. I think he was flustered flustered
*  I don't think that those shots maybe rocked him
*  They broke his nose and that could rock you I guess well
*  He's got blood pouring out of his nose
*  So he's not breathing out of his nose now and then all of a sudden he's like fuck
*  My nose is already fucked up and he hasn't even punched me yet, right?
*  You know it was it was unusual
*  like I could see if someone has a peripheral understanding of the sport and
*  You see that happening like come on man or even guys like Mike Bisping like Mike Bisping was like fucking shoulder strikes
*  Come on shoulder strike, but that said Mike Bisping is without a doubt
*  One of the toughest human beings has ever walked the face of the planet like if you lost an ear
*  But I got another yeah, yeah
*  He doesn't give a fuck he fought a giant chunk of his career against the best fighters in the world including winning the title with
*  One eye yeah, Michael Bisping is a fucking died-in-the-wool savage. Yeah, so if he's like
*  Just shoulder strikes that said the shoulder strikes didn't end the fight
*  The shoulder strikes definitely got him off on the wrong foot then cowboy threw a kick to Connors arms and then Connor
*  counter with a head kick rock cowboy bad
*  I'm good. You see his legs go and then Connor hits him with pistons
*  I don't get so hard people could say it was a work. He broke his fucking orbital bone
*  Yeah, and then but Stephen A Smith said that he felt like
*  Cowboy quit he did not quit he got smashed
*  You got to say someone quit and again their nose broke and rocked and a broken orbital. You can't say he quit
*  It's also who you're talking about
*  You're talking about a guy was the most fights in the UFC the most finishes in the UFC the most head kick knockouts in the UFC
*  The most the most bonuses in the UFC
*  Cowboy is a fucking legend. He is a tough as tough as they come he's lost before
*  every human can lose especially you're fighting guys like Darren till and horror a Maz of it all and
*  And these fucking animals that he's fighting
*  He's fighting the cream of the crop or Connor and Connor broke it literally broke his face
*  He broke his nose and he broke his orbital bone
*  So so Stephen A Smith responded and then Connor responded. Yeah, I seen that Connor told him to apologize
*  Yeah, and Connor's right. Yeah, he is right. I mean give right give Connor the credit a little bit
*  I think the problem is Stephen A Smith who's a very entertaining guy and is very knowledgeable about other sports
*  this is not his wheelhouse and also that style of
*  dismissing athletes and putting people down like
*  That's how we kind of made his name that's how he made his name and it's fun to listen to he's he's a fun guy
*  To listen to yeah, he talks great shit, you know, but I wonder I mean
*  I'm sure basketball players are kind of saying the same stuff
*  We're saying when he's criticizing basketball players though or football players, you know, I mean, I'm sure I'm sure I mean
*  I don't know too much about that. Jamie. You're a sports fan, right? Do they criticize him too?
*  He's respected for sure. Yeah. Yeah, but that's it to the show
*  He's on it's like every day he's got to wake up and give his take and they got to talk about it for an hour
*  Yeah, and a lot of the take it's like the controversy is like good. Yeah, they got shocked. Yeah talk about yeah
*  And he had a radio show for three hours. He did after that. So like yeah, he talks all day long, right?
*  Yeah, and he you know, and he's entertaining. That's what people like to hear like to see hear somewhat passionate
*  You ever hear him and Teddy Teddy Atlas. Yeah argue after the Conor McGregor Floyd made with a fight. Yeah
*  Teddy has like Conor McGregor
*  Made the best chef in the world be a fucking fast food cook
*  That's it basically how they're like back and forth the two of them yelling and arguing. It's very entertaining. Yeah
*  I just think that's it. That's his position. All right. I just think that this sport demands more
*  appreciation more respect and it demands a
*  Higher level of reverence to the athletes who literally put their lives on the line. It's different
*  I don't think you have to say the guy quit to describe describe what happened
*  No, you could just talk about what Connor did that was so special
*  He looked the guy finds tricky ways to do things and those shoulder strikes
*  Look, we've seen guys do shoulder shrugs before but we never saw anybody do it successfully
*  but you got to think about the UFC is a
*  lot of what happens in the UFC is
*  Someone out of all these fights finally does something and then other people start doing that thing
*  Like you remember when no one was throwing front kicks to the face. Yeah
*  Yeah, all of a sudden Anderson knocks out Vitor who's like one of the elite of the elite strikers knocks him out with a front
*  Kick to the face and you're like what no fuck and then you see everyone trying it. Nobody ever did it
*  I don't remember anybody ever even in kickboxing people very rarely threw a front kick to the face
*  Just wasn't you know, they would teep right the same body
*  Yeah, but that even teeps to the face was something more like a range thing
*  All you are like pushing his face right like you very rarely unless someone caught it perfect
*  So I got get knocked out with like a snap front kick with the ball of the foot now
*  I'm like an uppercut the way it comes off. Yes, dude. It's a fucking devastating technique when done correctly. I mean
*  Justin buckholz got a ko with it outside of the UFC. That's devastating
*  Leota Machida did that jumping front kick to Randy Couture? Yeah, not a Randy Couture with a fucking front kick to the face
*  That's a legit technique, but then you see everybody doing that like low calf kicks, right?
*  Yeah, first guy I ever saw do it was Benson. Yeah Benson really Benson Henderson really got into those low calf kicks
*  Those are rough man, but now everybody throws those kicks you gotta think of how many years went by before people were not throwing low calf kicks
*  I guarantee you now when people get tied up in the clinch and someone's holding someone with double over hooks or whatever
*  I don't remember how Connor had a hold of our cow
*  When someone's tied up in the clinch you can't strike you're gonna see guys
*  This is a bone man. It's a fucking bone right there. That is something to distract them
*  You know to move to something else but this where your shoulder the top of your shoulder. That's fucking hard
*  Yeah, yeah, you know, it's not the ideal thing to strike with but when there's nothing else there. There's something there
*  Yeah, it's I could see how Stephen Smith would not think that that was effective I could see but for me
*  It was clearly effective. There were hard shots. There's a lot of power behind it. There's a lot of explosion
*  Connor dipping his level and coming up and slamming into it
*  It was correct kind of crazy, but even if you take that away the head kick and the punches to finish
*  I mean, yeah, he's not quick. He got beat down
*  He got beat down smashed by a guy who rises to the occasion
*  Look Cowboys had problems in the past with these really big fights and yeah, he looked nervous as fuck and he talks about it
*  Oh, there was a video that they played which I don't think they should have played
*  Before the fight because he had to hear that so they're playing a video of him
*  Describing how nervous he gets before fights and how he throws up right?
*  I want to stop and also about how he's kind of faking it. Yeah, I'm pretending like he's fine, but he's not inside
*  Freaking the fuck out they played that before he fought. I'm like, why are you doing think about even more? Yes
*  That's what I was thinking. I was I was saying fuck. He does not need to hear this
*  That's why I'm in the locker room when I'm in the locker room and the TV's on I'm always like turn that volume down
*  I don't want to hear anybody talking about my fight turn that shit down
*  Good for you. Good for you
*  I mean, I'm cognizant of that when I see a guy in the locker room and I'm talking I try to pump him up
*  Yeah, I want him to feel good. Yeah show up. Yeah. Well when you come out man that biggie song
*  Biggie that's a there's something about
*  Some fighters and songs, you know, there's like there's a connection to those guys every time I hear that song
*  I think about you. Yeah, man
*  I started in 2009 when I fought shirt was the first time I ran out to it and I was like man the most shady
*  Frankie baby, you know, I was like this is it
*  Dude biggie's probably my oh, he's if he's not my all-time. He's like top three. It's like not my all-time, but he's right up there
*  Yeah, I think biggie might be my guy too. I seventh grade
*  I got that ready to die cassette tape and listen to this thing. I listened it so I couldn't listen to it no more
*  You know, yeah
*  Well, I was on news radio or was doing a sitcom and I remember I listened to that fucking hypnotized song like ten times in a
*  Row. Yeah, I was like god damn. That's a good song. Yeah, he's his flow was so entertaining
*  He was he could tell a story better than anybody. Oh, man. He was a special dude. He's a special dude
*  The feud between him and Tupac the fact that both of those guys got murdered like crazy, right? Fuck man. Yeah, like oh
*  God how good would they have been as they got older? I know and the biggie only pocket least had
*  Thousands of CDs mixed tapes, you know come out after his death, but they only had two albums really, you know
*  So they didn't have much much material. Isn't that crazy that pock put so much shit down. Yeah
*  He walked man. He was uh, he was like an activist too, you know
*  His everything was a kind of politically charged and everything well he was
*  Unbelievably prolific. Yeah, like he wrote so much he he like
*  After he was dead they released like five hours. Yeah, it was crazy stuff
*  Yeah, where is all this shit from I remember then they did the Cuba Cuba recording. That's why I remember they had the hologram was it
*  Yeah, that was so creepy, right? That was so creepy
*  I was like, what is the future gonna be like we're gonna see Janis Joplin up there
*  Yeah, you know like legitimately they're gonna be able to do that in the future
*  That's true
*  like they're probably gonna be able to write new Janis Joplin songs and have her singing in a hologram and you won't even be able to
*  Tell us not really her they just put I just listened to the radio yesterday
*  Chester Bennington from Lincoln Park his first band he was in when he was like 18
*  They had recordings of him that they just put new music to and re-released the music
*  I thought like gray days or no gray or something like that
*  I heard it so I didn't listen to it myself, but I heard it's not bad. That's a bummer. He was a bummer
*  I know that was a bummer
*  One of these guys takes I don't know just like a lot of artists seem like they're conflicted in some ways
*  It's one of the reasons why they're so good. Yeah, like when Chester would sing it was like he was wailing
*  All right, like screaming, you know, there was something about his his the the the angst and the anger and the energy and the emotions
*  And his voice that was why he was so good. And you know, sometimes I like Lincoln Park
*  He's just listening cuz they jamming. Yeah, and then you start listening some of the words like man
*  This guy was going feeling it for a while. Yeah, he was going through some shit for sure
*  Yeah, it's just it's so hard to believe when someone like Chris Cornell or someone like him takes their own life
*  I think they were good. They were good friends, right? I believe so. Yeah
*  I think one of them didn't he kill himself on his birthday or something like that. I think so
*  Yeah, something sad like that. But again two guys with us insane voices. I mean Soundgarden
*  Damn he was good. Definitely. Yeah
*  Damn but it's like it's almost like those guys that have that insane and women too that have that insane
*  Emotion in their voice like they're just so they're so torn and I afflicted. Yeah. Yeah, that's I mean
*  Pour it out. You could see you hear it in her in her voice. Their hearts pouring out. I think that's what it is
*  Yeah, yeah
*  Yeah, it's um, I don't know man. It's a bummer
*  It's a bummer. But the Tupac that they don't do that anymore, right that fucking hologram the Tupac hologram was built like Marlon
*  Marlon Marais
*  Little bit yeah. Yeah, he was way more jack than Tupac ever was like this Tupac been doing fucking CrossFit
*  Yeah, it's been doing f-45 for the last five years while he's in hiding
*  Yeah, I'm getting after it
*  Yeah, um, there's a lot of guys that yeah, there it is. Like look how
*  Jack Jack looks like Wiz Khalifa looks now. Yeah, Wiz Khalifa. Yeah, there's a good video the other day
*  Wiz Khalifa hit in the bag. Like I'm like goddamn Wiz Khalifa. Wiz Khalifa's got good technique
*  He does like does the Thai Thai fights or he doesn't yeah. Yeah, he's doing a lot of Muay Thai
*  But he's got crazy abs man. The two is fucking jacked. He is got no fat on him and he smokes weed all day
*  my guy
*  All day is weed legal in New Jersey now, how's it work medical is yeah
*  You have to have like a real problem, right? No, I just have headaches. Can you have headaches?
*  Yeah, I get that
*  There's Wiz Khalifa. Yeah, he trains hard man. Yeah, that's cool
*  It's always good when these guys do do this stuff brings light to our sport. Yeah Snoop trains, too
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, there's there's some videos of Snoop training and sparring online. It's awesome. I love it
*  I love it. I mean, it's just great for you, too
*  Even if you don't ever plan on fighting, um, it's to me
*  I mean, you know, I'd rather hit pads and kick a bag than run on a fucking treadmill man
*  Oh, it's so much more attain these people people realize that they would do to like it a lot more, too
*  Do you run at all? I do run I like to run I but I don't run for my camps or anything
*  I was never like to work. I just enjoy running. Well, you know for your endurance, you know
*  When you when you would train
*  How much of you did you do any cardio specific workouts or was most your cardio done through fight training?
*  I mean I did my strength condition stuff would be a little cardio based, you know
*  Just like circuit training and stuff actually started working with a new strength conditioning guy
*  It's a young kid man. He's 24, but super passionate really into into how do you find something like that?
*  You know, I just actually Todd Frazier who's actually my podcast. We just dropped released episode today
*  He's a champ of the tramp champ in a tramp
*  He he's a professional pistol player from my town and I asked him where he was doing his offseason training and he took me out with
*  This guy this guy does our give your RPR a reflexive performance recovery or something. No reset performance recovery
*  What is that? He does like these certain things that just resets your nervous system, I guess like a bang on your back
*  Bangs on your back in your back and then do you do a test and like you're you're you're stronger in a weird way
*  Yeah, it's RPR
*  Reflect I'm probably so real
*  That's someone I'm not a voodoo guy
*  I'm not a voodoo guy and
*  Yeah, but he has one where I chopped it that my inner thighs
*  I'll go up and down like four times and then he'll do some more tests
*  I'll help make me go like a V like a sit-up position and I'll try to push me down flat before I did the test
*  Pretty much couldn't stop and then I did the test. He almost put his body on me and I can hold them up really
*  I don't know if it's mental
*  But I always feel I feel good
*  I'll come in the I'll come in the training and I'll be like, yeah
*  I'm you know
*  I feel a little shoddy and he puts me to these tests and some hurt like sometimes he goes up and down your
*  Stardom on your ribs and like it's supposed to make you feel uncomfortable
*  And you're supposed to relax and kind of wakes me up gets me going
*  Hmm, and the idea is that it jumps your reflexes up? Yeah. I mean again dummy, but yeah
*  I don't know it either. I I know for sure that like deep tissue work does a lot, right?
*  Deep tissue massage the way he explained it to was like I couldn't do it to myself
*  Like what one of them where he kind of goes and he hits up my IT band on my left mama inside and outside of my
*  Thigh and it hurts to the point where I'm like, I'm like you're almost writhing in pain
*  You know, I'm trying to relax and do it but you can't do it to yourself
*  It's like he says you can't tickle yourself because you know the pressure you're giving yourself
*  But someone else could take you so someone else that do this to you
*  Isn't tickling like do you don't have control?
*  Like cuz like I can do the the same pressure that someone would tickle me but it's but you do but you know the pressure
*  You're giving yourself. That's what was explained to me. Okay, so like you don't know what you're
*  The pressure they're giving to you and I think that does something your nervous system
*  What do you think tickling is from do you think it's from like evolving to get away from bugs?
*  Like you see you feel something on you like yeah. Yeah, doesn't that make sense? Yeah, I got spiders on you or some shit
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, I'm yeah
*  I think everything has to go back to that stuff has to or why do you hold your breath when you're when you're like nervous
*  Or you know, like people say I gotta breathe breathe
*  I hold your breath by cuz like you're in the middle of the woods and something's fucking hot and you're like
*  You don't make any noise maybe or maybe just your body's just panicking cuz so much pressure
*  You know, like, you know so much adrenaline so much freaking out your body just
*  But I do
*  Body tenses up
*  Yeah, that's a thing about fighting right where guys when they're swinging in a big like big exchanges
*  They don't they don't breathe and they get tired right? Yeah. Yeah, like, you know, I don't know
*  You have those coaches that are like, okay guys breathe. I don't want my coach telling me to breathe in the corner
*  No, I'm like I know how to breathe
*  Right. Well, does that drive you crazy when you hear corners that don't give good advice?
*  Yeah, thanks. Get up man. Get up. I know shit
*  Kick his ass. Oh, that's why I was lucky to have you know guys that pay attention to detail like Mark Ricardo man
*  Those guys are uh
*  Top-notch technical. Yeah, yeah cool. They're not giving you that, you know, sometimes you do you need to like sometimes some guys
*  I think Mark got some flack for the Marlin fight where he was in the corner
*  He was like your mother raised you blah blah blah, you know, and someone's like why is he talking about his mom?
*  It's like cuz he knew he didn't need technique. He needed some motivation at that point
*  Was Marlin too big did he lose too much weight to get down to 35 and was he depleted or was it a so
*  Who'd oh just steamrolled him? I just think the moment, you know, I think Marlin hit him with some good shots and
*  He hit him with some good shots and the head kick the right hand
*  Yeah, and I think the fact that sudo just took it and kept coming forward. I think kind of
*  Just demoralized Marlin a little bit like it doesn't put him away in my eyes
*  So who do was not going to be able to take much more to the legs? Oh, yeah, no way
*  I thought I for sure and I first round I'm like this fights not going the distance
*  Yeah, I thought Marlin was gonna keep chopping at the legs
*  But Marlin let's a hood. Oh close the distance
*  And once he let's a hood. Oh close the distance and get a hold of him started hitting him with knees and I was like
*  Oh Jesus Christ. Yeah. Yeah, so who does and even like I mean
*  Marlin it was in that tie clench to him. I'm like dude Marlin knows how to deal with a tie clench
*  Yeah, and he just wasn't even reacting to it. He's like kind of letting him hit him with the knees
*  I felt like almost it's like I felt like he was just depleted
*  It seemed like he didn't have the energy to fight the kind of fight that's a hoodo was willing to fight
*  Right, especially so who do at 35 right so who do at 25? He's draining himself a little bit
*  But so who do at 35 was much healthier. Yeah, and just fucking guys just tough as shit, man
*  He has a winner's mind away. He's a winner. He's got a winner's mind. Yeah, you know and
*  His the videos that he makes are pretty ridiculous super
*  Triple-c come on bend the knee. I mean, I guess that's you know, everyone's got a stick now
*  You know, I guess they do because it keeps him out there. It's it's just
*  It's weird because this sport is part of that right? It's like part. There's it's part
*  Promotion, but it's also performance. It's like guys like Connor the perfect blend. Yeah, like he's just just being him himself
*  But Connor's like it's entertaining. It's funny. Yeah, some of these other guys man. It's just so forced and it's rough
*  But look like Colby Covington Colby Covington
*  Shit talked his way to a goddamn title shot. Yeah, he really did
*  I mean, yes, I was asked but he's also very good very good
*  You can't not be good you have someone was willing to they wanted to cut him before he fought in Brazil
*  Do you know that? Yeah, it was the last fight on his contract
*  He's going over there to fight Damien Maia and he just talked mad shit. He said I'm gonna get them on black them
*  He's like, yeah
*  That was what that's what did it
*  I mean, that's literally what did it and then that character just took off you go and look at the early versions of that character
*  He had nice suits like he had like a real crisp suit like Connor would wear but then later he's got these
*  Cheap suits. It's like it's part of the fun of it. Yeah, he's wearing bullshit. He's playing through a character
*  Fuck man. He he fucking figured it out. Well about Connor. He's kind of made a little 180 type flip on his personal
*  He's still funny still, you know mouthy and stuff
*  But he's not be and he seems like he's trying to clean his image up a little bit
*  You think with cowboy you think that's it?
*  Maybe it was cowboy cowboys kind of easy to get along with and whatnot or maybe it's just that he's been
*  Dealing with so much, you know with the Khabib fight
*  Hitting the old guy
*  Over there, yeah, he's like, you know, he's got a proper 12. He's got a total line a little bit
*  Yes, right, I mean you gotta think proper 12 is an enormous amount of money for him
*  I mean, he's making shit tons of money. I was in Vegas that fucking those billboards were everywhere
*  Yeah on cars and shit. He's he was sponsoring the Bellator cage too. Was he? Yeah good for him. Good for him
*  Yeah, I wonder but I also think I don't think he felt like he needs psychological warfare with with cowboy
*  I feel like he thought from the beginning that he had a giant advantage over cowboy
*  Yeah, you know like if you go back to an old press conference or talking back and shit to each other
*  He's like as stiff as a board right right? Yeah fucking break in half
*  I think he just felt like this fight. Look I could just be a nice guy with this guy, right?
*  But with Khabib, I think he felt like he had a fuck with him
*  I feel like he felt that he had to get Khabib emotional the same way
*  He got Aldo emotional, but that shit didn't work that motherfucker's a he's a vault
*  He look in his eyes you just see nothing but doom yeah, he's
*  He's uh, it's just those people out there. That's they call it the step where they're from right at the step
*  That where it's good would be considered the step. Well, Mongolia is a step, right? Okay, isn't that close to there?
*  I think I don't know is it the hard part of the world though
*  Yeah, know that did you see when he won when the fucking they have a video the streets the streets?
*  Everybody lights on their cars honking their horns fucking screaming out the window. Yeah, dude shoot machine guns up there. Yeah
*  Yeah, he's he's a fucking terror man, and I am so interested in this fight coming up with him and Tony Ferguson
*  I am so interested in that fight. That's a crazy fight. Whoo. That fight is everything to me that fight
*  I don't know how
*  Dana White is doing these press conferences talking about matching up Connor and Khabib
*  I'm like, hey, hey
*  We got about our hands the boogeyman because the boogeyman is right now a big bear
*  Fucking doing kicks on trees and shit and wing chunk dubby and rocks doesn't he build his own gym. Yes builds his own gym
*  He does Eddie Bravo you talk to him about it because he does his camps like he helps when he's jiu-jitsu, right?
*  He he talks him through it
*  Eddie Bravo will talk you through it rather he goes up there
*  He'll he'll get a house up there like rent a house or he has a place
*  I don't know which which what is but then he builds everything he builds the racks for the bags
*  He builds the fucking he mats the rooms. He does everything himself. He is a unique human being
*  Yeah, and you want to talk about cardio that guy is the freak of all freaks because he never even seems a little tired
*  Not at all and keeps coming forward keeps coming forward never seems even a little tired and everyone he fights
*  Looks like they got they got mauled by a leopard
*  You're right everyone's faces hanging off like look at this shit that he does
*  Headstands and stuff in the breakdancing, right? Yeah
*  But he's always doing this kind of shit like weird kind of exercise. Look at this just standing only on his head
*  That's a good way to blow your discs out. Yeah
*  There you go, that's how he gets the gnosis
*  Like look at this shit he does but that's every kind of training where and like no one's telling him what to do either
*  No, he does on his own you like guys who've gone to camp with him say it's like, okay today
*  We're gonna run hills like he just decides like what we're gonna do in carrot different, dude
*  Yeah
*  Well, and Eddie told me that his cardio is fucking ridiculous
*  Like they'll be doing these hill sprints and he'll do these hill sprints with his other training partners and he's lapping them
*  He runs all the way up and all the way down and then although and then passes them as they're still up the first time
*  He's a freak. Yeah, that's interesting fight. It's a fucking great fight
*  That's why I don't understand why Dana is not like considering the fact that Tony Ferguson would win that fight
*  But he think he's implying that Khabib's already got this one. They're talking about Khabib versus Connor because look that's the money
*  Yeah, yeah, ching ching ching from what I hear could be won't won't won't fight him
*  He said he fight it for a hundred million dollars. That's what he said. Yeah, then he's gonna fight him. I
*  Think his dad said that his dad said, you know that he'll fight Connor for the same amount of money that Connor made fighting Floyd
*  But I don't know if you could get a hundred million dollars in the UFC
*  Do you think that flight that fight Connor Khabib will be big a big problem is Dana
*  Sane some of these big as could be but Connor Floyd
*  That was a pretty big fight. Yeah
*  Floyd brings a different thing to the table, right Floyd brings all the hardcore boxing fans and the fact and
*  Yeah, and he's the best boxer of all time
*  I mean you stop and think about the amount of times that guy's been hit over a period of 50 fights
*  It's insane
*  Yeah
*  His defensive skills and his ability to size up an opponent and figure out what the guy's doing and then start to break him down
*  Systematically best there is he's the best. He's the best
*  He's like there's been guys that have been incredible and they're they're like up in his level
*  You know like all-time great fighters, but in terms of not getting hit, I don't think anybody's been as good as Floyd
*  Yeah, no, I agree. So to have Connor
*  Going there and fight him a guy was never had a professional boxing match
*  But is fucking up everybody in MMA and all these people think he has a chance and there's all this hype behind it all his craziness
*  And the fact that it was this sort of crossover fight. Yeah, it had a lot of time ever. Yeah
*  well
*  Basically, Tony Tony Randy that was ridiculous though. I don't think James Tony even trained MMA for that
*  No, I was on that car. That's my full BJ second time. Oh really? That's right. That's right
*  Yeah, as soon as Randy ankle picked him. I was like, oh, yeah, it's over
*  You have that fucking animal on top of you Randy Couture in his prime. Oh
*  Or he looked up to Randy big-time coming up. You know, what a great guy he is. He is I still see no run into him nowadays
*  Super solid guy was so calm when he got into the cage. It was so crazy
*  Like I remember he was like the for one of the first guys ever like he's getting ready to fight
*  They're ready to announce him. He looks over at me and just links and gives me a big smile
*  I'm like this guy all relaxed and shit just saying hi to people
*  He loved it loved competing loved being in there man and didn't even start fighting until it was in his 30s
*  Yeah, yeah, and he's just wrestling. I was maybe that's why I was able to fight so long too. Yeah. Yeah, maybe yeah, maybe
*  Yeah, it's um
*  It's kind of crazy when you think about his career too, you know light heavyweight champ heavyweight champ
*  Came back and won a beat Sylvia. That was crazy when he dropped Sylvia with that right hand
*  I was like what the fuck I was worried about him in that fight
*  I was like you think about like guys like Chuck Liddell knocking him out. What is Tim Sylvia gonna do?
*  He's enormous
*  You know and Tim Sylvia back when there was no testing
*  Sylvia farrico Rodriguez people forget
*  Tim Sylvia was not like this doughy guy back then, you know, like when he when he fought
*  Do you remember that fight we fought Rico? Yeah, that's scary Tim Sylvia. Oh, yeah
*  He had a back like a fucking brick wall. He was huge and he had a cut weight to make 265
*  I remember he had to come back to the scale like he missed it the first time that was back in the old days. Yeah
*  Yeah, Rico
*  McGowan I was wrestling in my junior senior year high school
*  Like 98 99 our manager on a team said her brother fought in UFC
*  I'm like, this is what you know, you see wasn't as popular
*  I'm like get out here your brother for UFC and it was Rico Rodriguez
*  It was her stepbrother and I ran into him one day. He's like I used to date my sister back in the day
*  I'm like a little bit
*  Rico Rodriguez was a bad motherfucker. Yeah, he was one of the first real high-level jujitsu guys and he's still around Jersey
*  He's still around Jersey. What's he doing these days?
*  He was coaching, you know, I feel Jamal Patterson. He's one of his black belts. Oh, yeah his place. Yeah
*  Oh, no shit coach in wrestling or just like that. Yeah. Yeah
*  Yeah, Rico was a beast man. And you know that guy fought a giant chunk of his career with a blown-out ACL
*  Oh really? He had no ACL
*  He just like rehabbed his knees or rehabbed his legs like built up his muscles down strong. Yeah
*  Yeah
*  like I think they say your
*  Hamstring is like a big part of it like if you strengthen your hamstring up
*  Most people can't do it like most people when the ACL is blown out like they they can't they can't compete
*  All right, yeah Rico Rico could that's why supposedly dos angios has a blown-out ACL
*  Yeah, oh, it does he yeah, supposedly he's been fighting. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I heard
*  I need to talk to him. Yeah find out if that's a fact. My knees always been
*  Always been good. Yeah, thank God never had any problems none
*  I mean, I've had LCL tears MCL tears but never surgery or anything. No meniscus surgery. Nothing. No Wow
*  That's rare, right?
*  Everybody's knees are fucked up. Yeah, especially a wrestler never wore knee pads in my life here. Really? Yeah
*  What if that's why no no can't be
*  But uh, like, you know, this pink just got his knee completely replaced. Yeah, that was scary
*  I was like goddamn he's only like 41 and don't they only last ten years. Yep
*  Thanks, I'll try the stem cells first I think or is it maybe I don't know past the point of that
*  I don't know. I mean they wanted to do that to my mom
*  they wanted to get my mom near placing but I sent her down to Panama and
*  She's fine. Yeah, dude crazy. It took eight months. I was really worried that it wasn't working because like I talked to her
*  You know afterwards and I talked to her up to like six months
*  She wasn't feeling anything different and then she started to feel better and then like eight months later
*  The pain went away. It was gone. That's amazing. Yeah, and then I sent her back again and then the second round
*  She's doing but here's what's weird
*  When I saw her for Christmas, she looked younger
*  Really? Yeah, I was like you look great
*  Did they just inject the stem cells in the knee or did they put them in both knees and they also did IV and they
*  Do it for three days. So you just get barrage down. Yeah, they just fill you up and then you walk out of there like
*  I
*  Wonder if that stuff helps out Lyme disease. I bet it would yeah, they say it has to go to the brain barrier or something
*  Right. Mmm. I don't know the blood brain barrier. Yeah
*  Well, I mean it's they inject these stem cells intravenously
*  So you have to talk to dr. Ruird and yeah, he'd probably be able to explain it
*  But I mean I think anything that boosts your immune system and helps your overall body and the idea of doing it intravenously
*  Is that your body knows where to utilize it your body knows areas that are troubled
*  It's weird that your body has some strange innate intelligence to know knows we need to yeah
*  That knows where the injuries are like how is that working? It knows what's wrong with your brain? Like how's that working? Yeah, that's wrong
*  Like what? Yeah, what is it doing tracks? I guess it attracts it right? Yeah, it's where it needs to be
*  Yeah, I'm really excited about the future that shit because I think you know
*  I talked to dr. Jeff Davidson from the UFC and he just got back from you know, dr. Yeah. Yeah, he's awesome
*  He's great. He's the one who got me into stem cells in the first place
*  He's the one who hooked me up with the one on my shoulder
*  Me too. Did you do dr. Roddy McGee or did you know I did do Roddy McGee way back
*  I had stems the first time stem cells was in my groin. Hey, yeah
*  but uh, it's Warren muscle some I had like a
*  Sports hernia. Oh, wow. I had the same surgery oosman had
*  Yeah, yeah
*  Damn same we went to the same guy too. This guy dr. Myers
*  He was great actually invented the surgery if you call it a sports hernia, he gets mad at you because it's not a sports hernia
*  It's a core muscle injury. Mm. Well, what is it? How's it work? I think they cut my the the tendons in my
*  Thighs and also my abs cut them completely off and then resold them together. Whoa
*  It was it was it was painful for a one week super painful maybe two weeks super painful
*  But I literally six weeks later. I was kicking a heavy bang
*  Really? Yeah, it was amazing. You do you do physical therapy the day you get out the next day. I'm a physical therapy
*  Wow. Yeah, and it was bad
*  Like I had this I probably I was dealing with it for like two
*  Like two years it would come and go I would get flamed up where I couldn't even cough down there
*  You know, it was pretty bad more than one time went to get finally get checked out and get the MRI I
*  Went to the doctor by myself drove to the city and came home
*  I didn't eat anything like I had to park my car and walk to the damn doctor and was like
*  You know a couple blocks in the city took me forever to walk in her so I didn't stop and eat
*  I just kind of come home. I parked my car and I called my wife Mike. You gotta help me get a car
*  I can't I can't get a car. I get a car. I'm walking. I literally passed out while I was walking
*  Whoa, she caught me. I had to crawl into my house. Holy shit
*  I was like damn so I got that surgery and it was the best thing I've the probably best surgeon I've had
*  That's crazy that it was that bad. Oh, so so painful so painful. It's probably because I wasn't didn't eat
*  That's why passed out all that stuff right? But yeah, that was uh, that was rough when I hear about a guy like you pass now
*  I'm like, okay. Yeah, this is a motherfucker that never passed out my life. I never passed out my life. That's the first time
*  So they detached the tendons yeah ligaments the is it tendons must be tendons must be tendons
*  Yeah
*  They cut the ones here like up my thigh and then I guess like you have it connects on three points like by your legs
*  So what was wrong though? It was tearing it was like playing like it was pulling each side was pulling the other side
*  So I was getting tears everywhere
*  And so when they do that they cinch it down again, and then how's it better six weeks later?
*  That next day I go there and I start doing like the foot foot exercises they put the bands on I'm doing all that stuff
*  I guess they just just strengthens up Wow
*  But it's crazy that six weeks later. I would think that's not a lot of healing. Yeah six weeks later
*  He told you you'd be good to go six weeks later. Yeah, so how quickly after that could you have fought?
*  January um
*  I'm trying to think I fought that may I thought surgery in January
*  I thought that may the first time Usman came in here. He had a bag on his waist that was draining
*  We had a like uh yeah, yeah, he had both sides. I only had one side. I think
*  Yeah, I was like what the fuck is that like he took him a long time to recover after the do my my downstairs
*  Was all jacked up my balls are so fucking big really oh my god. He's well up huge. Did you take pictures of course?
*  Right I got when your balls are gonna look like that again
*  There's a hockey player Sydney Crosby member
*  I told you he recently got this surgery and Odell Beckham a popular NFL receiver just got this last week
*  Really a doctor in Philadelphia. Yeah, Dr. Myers. Yeah
*  Everybody imagine one dude specializing in the guy's not even like a surgeon. I think it's kind of crazy what he's not like a
*  He's like a he's not a surgeon for like orthopedic not an orthopedic doctor he created this surgery though
*  That must be a surge athletic pulled. We just that's on right say it again athletic
*  poobolgia
*  Poo-ball-gea why do you say why don't have it when they invent a name? Yeah, I invent that name
*  Why poobolgia?
*  Pull ball what does it mean? What does poobolgia mean growing disruption? Oh?
*  Also known as growing disruption yes sportsmen turnia or ternia, but he told me he's like it's not a sports hernia
*  Persistent groin pain during exercise when there's no evidence of clinically detectable hernia athletic poobolgia is not a true hernia
*  But it's considered an overuse injury
*  which the external oblique muscles and surrounding tendons and or traverse abdominis or
*  Internal oblique muscles are worn down or partially torn so this is pro
*  Okay, conservative treatment consists of rest medications or physical therapy of conservative treatment fails surgical treatment
*  Maybe could suggest it as an alternative the procedure may be performed using a
*  laparoscopic or open anterior approach
*  Polypropylene or polyester mess is suggested mesh is suggested to correct the identified abnormality
*  However, there's no data from randomized studies to confirm effectiveness of this surgery
*  Whoever that is that you're getting that thing off of
*  Which way so some doctors just figure something out yeah? Yeah, he's killing it too
*  I mean the vert you know I don't know a bunch of athletes
*  But there's a bunch of famous athletes that went through that guy
*  It's crazy that I didn't know that that was a persistent injury and then all these guys have it
*  Yeah, I never even heard of that before yeah
*  Didn't know what it was until it happened again
*  That's probably one of those things are being too tough for your own good right like a little bit of an injury
*  I just kept pushing through
*  Just almost before I thought that I got an epidural in there that was crazy
*  Literally they go through probably by my pubes. Hey that way. Oh Jesus needed was like
*  six inches long
*  I'm in the doctor's office. I got my junk's practically out you know
*  And he's putting this thing in I'm like
*  And also he puts the medicine in when he put the medicine in that's when it flared up
*  I'm screaming fuck take it out take it out. He's like hang on hang on
*  That only lasted for like a couple months, and then he came back
*  So epidural just kind of numbs it right yeah, it does I've had several in my back have you yeah
*  I back surgery was 18 actually you did yeah, what kind?
*  Dysectomy oh so a little bit of a meniscus or a little bit of the
*  Yeah, yeah, they cut it out
*  Pretty good it does work good, but there's ways around that yeah for certain injuries 18 a question
*  I was an 18 year old I know a lot of people that I had it in my neck
*  And they were talking about me doing that but for Jennekeen cured it
*  Yeah, they were talking about doing it like I went to one doctor
*  And he was like you're probably gonna have to get the disc trimmed that was eight years ago
*  Yeah, what's that was a twin ah maybe yeah, yeah at least at least
*  Let's say at least five years ago six years ago. It is I've no pain in my neck now
*  You know another thing though the iron neck I fucking love that thing yeah, that's I've been seen
*  I see people using that I got around out here you want to try it. Yeah, yeah, dude. It's the shit
*  It's the shit you put that thing it is the single best thing I've ever used for developing neck muscles and for jiu-jitsu and wrestling
*  It's fantastic too because it's attached to a bungee cord right right so the bungee cords a 50 pound cord
*  And you put this halo on and then you pump it up like a Reebok pump
*  You know yeah, you pump it up
*  And it gets tight to your head and then you can control the amount of resistance when you turn right because it's it's it's actually got
*  Resistance when you turn so you pull back so your neck is holding this 50 pound cord back this way, and then you're doing this
*  I
*  Seen someone had that attached to like you know gym equipment. Yeah, and then their shadow box. Oh, yeah
*  Well the idea is it's like your neck is constantly resisting this like when dudes are trying to snap you down pull your neck down
*  Are you trying to posture out of triangles and shit right like when do you ever work out your neck in that way?
*  Yeah, and most people when they work out their neck
*  They put one of them harnesses on which is you know does something
*  But a lot of doctors will tell you that that's not a normal action for your neck
*  To be lifting weights with and you could do some damage to your I don't know if they're right or right
*  Yeah, I don't know, but I know the iron neck you don't have to do any of that shit you so you it's basically just
*  The muscles in your neck and you're not making your neck hold weight at a weird angle like this way
*  It's just straight your neck is always straight, and it's turning
*  It's just the muscles are getting exercised and everything gets stronger. I know Cory's into it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, Corey Anderson
*  Yeah, he loves talking about yeah. Yeah, I was just wondering if it's good if you're tight
*  You know if your neck is bad well according to them. They've had people that had neck injuries
*  They rehabilitated it with that because it strengthens all the area so like say if this is just me talking
*  But if you have an area where you have an injury and it keeps getting hurt if you strengthen all that area around that
*  It's not gonna be as mobile right so you're gonna have more control, and it's probably gonna protect it more
*  Yeah, just make sense yeah, but I'm a big fan of that product
*  That's I love when so and that was a football player that figured that out mate. Oh really yeah
*  What was the gentleman's name that figured the guy who came and he gave me a bunch of demonstrations and shit?
*  but it's a great for football players as well and
*  They and his idea was that it was also gonna help prolong people's careers because it'll prevent more concussions because you're not
*  Sure your neck is and you're not gonna get your head snapped as easy
*  You're gonna be able to withstand and much more impact
*  You know it's they find it's it's so interesting that all these people that are involved in
*  Athletic equipment they figure these things out like what what do you how do we strengthen a core better?
*  How do we strengthen the neck better? How do we do this? How do we do that? You know glad there's people smarter than me out there
*  Well, you can't be you can't be on top of everything Mike chop
*  Say his last name Jolly Mike Jolly that didn't sound like you said that the first time my voice
*  Okay, yeah anyway Mike explained the whole thing it's it's a very impressive piece of equipment. I love it
*  Yeah, I mean all that stuff you'd have reverse hyper to it. I got all that's great. That's great. Yeah, that thing's the shit
*  Yeah, I want to get a belt squat you even belt square belt squat
*  We don't have one but we saw that when we were there they wanted they offered it to us the Westside barbell
*  Come down put it in here. We'll probably get it's great cuz yeah a lot of load on your body without having to load your back
*  Yes, yeah without fucking your back up. Yeah, and guys do shadow boxing and shit with that. Yeah
*  Yeah, yeah
*  Oh really increase your ability to punch and to push off of stuff. Do you ever use the it's like a wheel
*  I forgot these like centrifugal force you pull up on it. It makes it
*  Shit a wheel. It's like a wheel that wraps around
*  So you could do lifts and the more the quicker you go up the faster pulls you down
*  Hmm. I feel like they had that too. Didn't they have that at Westside barbell?
*  He's got all kinds of crazy shit down there that guy Louie Simmons. He's a mad genius psychopath. Yeah. Yeah
*  I've watched some of his stuff. He seems pretty nuts. He's nuts and having him like
*  Show me all of his stuff and like got we did a podcast with him, right? Right? Yeah, let's do it. Yeah, it's pretty cool
*  His place. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah sitting across from him at his desk
*  He told me that he got his shoulder replaced and then the day got back to the gym. They made him max out benchpress
*  I was like what the fuck man?
*  Like they told me to do it. I do it like
*  Animals crazy talking steroids ain't bad for you. I've been on steroids since the 60s
*  Yeah, they never get off. That's the thing. Yeah, you can't
*  No, but I mean everything's on there who was telling us this was it Rob Kearney was telling us?
*  This that he he had his bicep replaced his bicep tendon because his bicep tendon blew out
*  and so he had his arm in a sling and
*  He waited lasted like a week and he got tired of it and just straighten his arm out popped it off so he could
*  Lift again
*  What man so it was both of his biceps are you know, there's me and this is the bell squad
*  Yeah, my stupid fucking paperboy hat
*  That's a cool machine man, yeah very cool there's Louie
*  Yeah, he's got I mean everything what is that thing
*  Different to yeah. Oh, what does that thing do? I don't know. It's more for like football players
*  I guess but he was showing it's like it's a belt squat. I think oh no, it's like a thing you hit
*  Yeah, I think you have to have the belt on. Yeah. Oh, okay
*  So you put the belt squad on and then you hit that thing, right?
*  Hmm. Yeah. Well those guys man that Westside barbell bunch of fucking animals down there
*  Yeah, he's like the trains like the world's strongest people, right? Yeah
*  Yeah, there was a bunch of freaks like that dude who's in there working out while we were there super strong human beings
*  And yeah, again, I'm happy there's people out there that are smart
*  They could figure those things out like Louie Simmons invented that reverse hyper because they told him that he needed to get his disc fused
*  Right. Yeah, it's like oh do I really?
*  Hmm
*  Hold my beer. Yeah
*  He figured out like the best way to decompress your lower back and to strengthen that area
*  Decompress your lower back and to strengthen that area. It's that machine. So it's great
*  Sometimes I feel like I wait till my back hurts to use it
*  I try to do it twice a week. I try to get in here twice a week and just do a few sets
*  I gotta make a little more
*  Consistent with that because it strengthens your lower back in a real weird way. That's hard to reach any other way
*  It is and I like how it gives you the traction to yes the like yeah, it gives you traction
*  But it gives you like what do they call it active traction, right? So it's like decompressing active decompression. Yeah, it's awesome, man
*  I love it. I love those teeter things to hang by your ankles like
*  Yeah, I'm with them too. I got the inverted table, which is great. We hang by your ankles, but then I got another one
*  What's the other one called the decks the decks? That's my favorite. We hang by your waist
*  It's just just from your waist. I feel like when you hang by your ankles
*  It's great, but it's like the weight is going from your ankles and your knees
*  Yeah, by the time you get to your back and how much compression you're right? Yeah, it's definitely something
*  But I think the decks really targets the lower back amazing
*  I see the people have the ones that lay down and then they attach that on and pulls them apart
*  Yeah, I haven't done that one. That's the decks the decks decompression one. I fucking love that thing
*  So you grab a hold those handles and then you let go and then you're you just drop down and it's all the weight is
*  Like decompressing in your lower back and then you could do the yeah
*  Yeah, you could do back extensions on it. Yeah, I think that's what they're called
*  Yeah, you could do those on it, too
*  You don't mean you could definitely get a workout on if you wanted to but for me
*  I use that after I'm done working out just to just I feel like if I'm real consistent with that with that and the
*  Inversion deck in the reverse hyper I keep my back healthy. Yeah. Yeah, I got I got a
*  Photo therapist get stretched out like once or twice a week and I do a RT active release therapy. Oh, yeah
*  That's great. Yeah now when you like when you see like there's different schools of thought when it comes to strength and conditioning and the more
*  radical strength school of thought was the Marlboro, which sort of school of thought which
*  You see Nick curse on does with who's doing with half held Osan just and a lot of guys
*  Where you concentrate almost entirely on strength conditioning and the idea is like you already know how to fight
*  Like you know how to fight and the real thing that fucks with guys when they're fighting is their conditioning
*  And so they're putting these guys through these
*  radical
*  Pliometric and explosive exercises and then just like push and that comes first
*  That is more important than anything and that's when BJ was at its best
*  If you go back to like BJ when he fought Sean Shirk, right BJ when he fought Diego Sanchez
*  He was training with Marv. Yeah, I'm I think I'm on the opposite side of that
*  I mean conditions never been an issue for me. Maybe that's why I have this take
*  I feel like I want to feel good on sparring days. Those are the most important days
*  I need I need to feel good. So I feel like sometimes you spend you put yourself out training condition
*  You come to spar the next day
*  You're not gonna have a good performance that day
*  Yeah, I could see both ways of the way right I could see both
*  I mean, I think there are probably some guys that maybe
*  That are afraid to get themselves tired that you got to make them get like it
*  It's not gonna push themselves that much when they're sparring if they're scared to get tired
*  But you could push them hard as hell when they're not worried about getting punched or worried about winning anything
*  That's the good thing about strength and condition. You can really push yourself without hopefully getting hurt as well
*  I think a lot of strength condition people they
*  they just want to
*  Put the cool videos up and right so, you know put the chains on and do this and flip the tire
*  I just want to keep it simple man. I want to I heard someone say you want to leave a strength condition working out
*  Feeling better not worse. Yeah. Yeah, that's that's like the Pavel Tatselin idea
*  You know that you you you don't ever go to failure. Yeah, and those kind of things
*  You're just trying to strengthen things out, right?
*  Yeah, it's it's interesting because the sport is so new fairly new that there's all these different schools of thought about the right
*  Way to do it and you really don't know and so why you're going through your camp
*  You got to go. Wow, I hope this guy's right. Yeah, you know and why there's definitely a right way in a wrong way
*  But there's also your way in my way and they could both be right. Yeah, right
*  Yeah, but I mean some guys like
*  long slow running sessions
*  Some guys like hill sprints some guys like mostly plyometrics and organized
*  You know Tabata drills and things like that for strength and conditioning and then this guy's like Nick Diaz
*  Just likes doing triathlons and shut up. Yeah, but this new guy I'm with it's like
*  Much more detailed my last time you just think I was great, you know, I'm never not in shape
*  So but he was just kind of just go and we just just work out this guy
*  Everything's planned out way ahead way ahead what I'm doing. So what kind of stuff is he have you doing?
*  All different types of modalities, I guess, you know, he kind of switches it up I do the
*  It's another thing too. A lot of it's breathing stuff for warm-ups and whatnot
*  I can't remember the name of it
*  It was along with that RPR stuff I was talking about
*  but yeah, it's a lot of it's
*  Breathing before and after and hold breath holds. I've been doing a lot of that stuff and also it's like long condition
*  Yeah lung conditioning for to warm up and and to cool down too. Yeah breathing exercises are very underrated
*  You know, like if you look at like what Hicks and Gracie used to be able to do that kind of like fire breathing
*  Yeah, you know like if you can literally strengthen your lungs there was this dude that I used to do yoga with his name is yoga
*  Ray and
*  That was wasn't his full name. Who's an elite singer in a band. I forget the band. I'm trying to remember right now. God damn it
*  Anyway, we always just called him yoga ray, but he had amazing cardio and he had amazing cardio
*  Specifically because of his breathing exercises like he didn't do cardio. He's just doing yoga and jujitsu
*  But it's a guy would never get tired. Yeah, because he would do all these like radical breathing exercises
*  So his lungs were like a strong muscle. Yeah, that's what they always work your diaphragm. Yeah
*  Yeah, so what other kind of exercises you have you do this different like with him?
*  I did he's really pays attention my body position and stuff
*  I got I because my back is bad
*  I try to stay away from deadlifts and this and that but since I've been with this guy I've been able to do all
*  That stuff really? Yeah. Yeah, just because of making sure that you have better technique technique
*  You know
*  Kiwi says you get if you want to feel your abs and your hamstrings if you feel your abs and your hamstrings and all your
*  Workouts your back's probably safe. So he's always he's always touching me making sure up make sure he's a fire
*  I make sure he's a fire and you know and so making sure that your abs are firing
*  Yeah, you know, we're hope like Sam doing a bench or something
*  I'll put like a towel underneath my back and like I'm trying to pull it out
*  Make sure you keep it pressed pressed on the floor so I can't pull it out. That's protecting your back
*  So he's just like really cautious and just knows a lot about exercise physio. Yeah. Yeah
*  Yeah, yeah, and so you go to him and you say a couple days a week two days a week
*  Yeah, do you do any like cryotherapy or ice baths?
*  No, I've done cryotherapy a couple times. It's just I'll have somewhere super close to me
*  I feel like if you want to do it you got to be
*  You got to do it almost at least three times a week. Yeah, I think even once a week's not enough really the benefits of it
*  Yeah, it's uh, it's fucking awesome
*  I'll tell you that I love doing it
*  I would I would suggest anybody that if you can get into one of those things do it do it whenever you can
*  Yeah, but apparently ice baths really good, too
*  Yeah, I've done ice bath probably ten years ago and my dick hurt for like a half hour after that. I'm like, yeah, I'm good
*  That's hilarious what about sauna yeah, I do the sauna I love the sauna
*  I don't have one of my house. My wife has like a little teepee sauna
*  It's like a red light one. You can go in and your head sticks out. Is that good? You lay down?
*  It's not bad. It's not hot enough
*  I feel like right it's gotta be hot my wife sent to the the red light one as opposed to the heat one right to me
*  I think you got to suffer for you really get the benefits. I think so, too
*  Yeah, I mean I don't know about infrared sauna cuz I never really done that but Laird Hamilton was saying that he had some skin
*  Issues that he got from infrared
*  But but he does some wacky shit man
*  Like that guy puts an air salt bike inside of a sauna and then puts oven mitts on and because you hot
*  Yeah, and he's sprinting in there. I'm like Jesus, bro
*  Yeah, yeah, it's nuts. Yeah, that's a freak. He's a real freak
*  We have the Russian Russian Banya kind of but you know in Jersey. They have like this 200 degree sauna in there
*  She's crazy 200 degrees feels like it at least and then they beat you with sticks
*  Yeah, I did that the one time. Yeah, and I was with some of my Russian buddies. So they were talking on for me and everything
*  They're like I would give them the real treatment
*  And do you go in the cold right after they do because that's what they do right?
*  Jump in the water cold water cold. Yeah, I did it all I did like they
*  Got some more value of who should be in UFC. He's not so Dana get this guy some more in he will wait class
*  He's a 35 er. He's tough man. He's uh, he was
*  WSOF guy very good only has one loss and he revenges loss, but um, he's been training with us for a long time
*  We're World Series of Fighting is what professional fighting league? Yeah, yeah
*  That's where Rory is now huh, yeah McDonald went over there. Yeah, that's interesting
*  He's actually gonna come on here with Eve Edwards. I'm gonna talk about it. That should be fun
*  Yeah, he's uh, he he was at Bellator right and then he was a bellator
*  lost his title or excuse me lost a fight to gay guard Musasi and then lost to
*  Yeah, Douglas Lima beat him in the rematch lost his title there
*  Beat Lima he had some good fights over there, you know, but I think he just got a big offer from the PFL
*  They're looking for a big name. Yeah, they're giving away a lot of fucking money
*  I don't know how long they could do that for right a million dollars for people who win like if you win the tournament
*  Like seven people won the last dance, you know, how do they do that? Yeah, that's a lot of money
*  It's Kevin Hart is behind it. Is he? Yeah, I think he's an investor Kevin Hart is yeah
*  Sure Kevin Hart invest in everything that guy is he's such a genius in terms like he is dude he is I don't know
*  How he sleeps I don't know where I don't know how you sleep though either
