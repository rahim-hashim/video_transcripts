# Joe Rogan Experience #1461 - Owen Smith
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [April 22, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrNZUaaaEtI)
*  Owen Smith hey hey how you feeling? I feel good man I'm excited we cheers
*  cheers man come on man salute yeah we just tested Owen yes negative it's
*  apparently been some controversy about this so just let me let everybody know
*  right away there's no shortage of antibody tests what we're using there's
*  no shortage of them people saying why are people on the front line there's a
*  lot of people it's just misunderstanding and confusion these tests there's no
*  shortage of I understand some people in some places have a hard time getting
*  access to the test that's not the case here so I've taken upon myself to test
*  everybody as they come into the studio this is not taking away from anybody
*  that's on the front lines it's not taking tests away from any medical
*  workers the test that they would use for them particularly the they're using
*  swabs I mean look man those fucking people that are working in those
*  hospitals and the medical workers those people are legit heroes yes you know and
*  if I found out that there was something we were doing that was somehow another
*  taking away from their ability to be tested I would never do it you know so
*  people got upset apparently because well also people writing articles about
*  things because they there's you know it's like it's a hot topic right and
*  their own to yeah I get it I get it I'm not meaning I'm not mad I get it you
*  know but when I posted that Donnell and I were Rona free people like someone
*  someone posted some story well they did his what's hilarious I'd go out of my
*  way to not read comments and these motherfuckers are writing stories where
*  they're taking comments from Instagram and using them as quotes just some
*  random magoo that's posting something just one of them said that we were low
*  key flexing that we had tests that's just someone just looking to use the
*  term low key flexing and they don't have any place for it so I think he's low key
*  flexing he's got a corona test so it's a it's a test that tests you for
*  antibodies and you were laughing at my face the entire time
*  little nervous but it's thinking of there also there was something that I
*  shared with you earlier today there was a new study that Jamie see if you could
*  pull up that study it is out of I think it's out of UCLA is that what it's out
*  of it's it says early antibody tests indicate far more cases and a much lower
*  mortality rate right so they think there's at least 400,000 people have
*  been infected in in California so the mortality rate is way way lower than
*  they previously thought it was at least in California you know it obviously
*  varies there's a crazy disease it's crazy doesn't make any sense it varies
*  depending upon what your physical condition whether or not you've been
*  smoking whether there's apparently a great benefit to exercising regularly
*  even while you have it if you catch it exercising but then there was this
*  fucking crazy thing what does that guy's name the Fox thing put up we'll do the
*  first it's LA Times and it's got the subscription blocker on it oh these
*  sons of bitches here I'll send you another one okay there's a there's one
*  on la.com I belong to LA Times I can give you my look at you I support
*  journalism I do too but not LA Times I like that every it's like movies there
*  I get it I just I don't have the time for that here it goes early antibody
*  test indicates far more COVID-19 cases lower mortality rate there's a decrease
*  in the number of deaths study indicates that there could be hundreds of
*  thousands of people could be infected without knowing it that's what's so
*  weird about it let me ask you this question though can you explain mortality
*  rate this is like yes the amount of people that get it how many of them die
*  so if it's a high mortality rate is yeah right like Ebola right vicious
*  mortality rate yes really but rabies the worst 100% yes rabies is like 99.9
*  99% the only time that they if they catch it before the the symptoms set in
*  you survive but if they don't catch it before the symptoms I didn't like if you
*  just get rabies you don't get over it on your own every black person I know
*  always crosses the street when they see a random dog communities and and people
*  don't have their dog they should go it's okay safe like I've been bitten by dogs
*  it's like I'm gonna take your word for this nobody loves dogs more than me I
*  love dogs but random dogs like you never know what someone did to that dog you
*  know you never know how people treat that dog and I've had a bunch of sketchy
*  dogs I've had dogs that I got from the pound that were super sketchy you just
*  knew I came home once one of my dogs killed my other dog oh my living room
*  man my living room was a goddamn crime scene I'm like oh yeah I've had some
*  bad experience I was a rescue dog as well yeah I've had some bad experiences
*  with dogs when I was a kid we adopted a dog that had distemper a Doberman and he
*  started like his eyes were like glazed over he's a snarl at us barking on us
*  I'm like oh Jesus Christ I couldn't I couldn't yeah we I grew up in apartments
*  so we we couldn't have dogs and then uh so I had a cat named taco my dad gave
*  him to me and I went to go visit him in the Bahamas he gave me a cat I think he
*  knew it would piss my mom off so I had a cat growing up cake from the from the
*  Conliff bakery that they uh that they have over there and and a cat my mom
*  was pissed see if you can find this conversation Jamie that they're so and
*  it's it says they're joking but it also has a question that says that they're
*  joking no but that's mediate says they're joking right yeah every other
*  website is not saying they're joking it doesn't sound like they're joking I
*  think they're trying to come up with some sort of a cover for it but let's
*  let's play what what he said it's John Roberts who is a correspondent for Fox
*  and then who is the other guy the other guy who works for the New York Times
*  okay so now let's it says apparently joking I doesn't sound like they're
*  joking play play what it says because John let me explain it here John Roberts
*  comes in and it's gonna play an ad before this Jamie so kill the volume
*  John Roberts comes in and when he comes in he's not wearing a mask and he tells
*  the other gentleman you could take the mask off and he tells them about this LA
*  study go ahead play it there
*  USC everybody here's been vaccinated anyway USC and LA County Public Health
*  come up with a study they found that there are 7,000 cases in California but
*  they really believe that there are anywhere from 221,442 thousand people
*  who were infected really so that makes it 0.1
*  study
*  so it's you just in case you tell her
*  well put your right one so the hoes so here's here's what's weird about that
*  one that guy says well we've all been vaccinated here anyway now maybe he was
*  joking maybe he's got a weird sense of humor long joke it's a weird joke weird
*  yeah now they have done some trial vaccines there are some vaccines that
*  are in trial there was a woman in Seattle she was the first person to get
*  tested and I sent this stuff to Matt Staggs earlier today and he sent
*  something to me there there have been several different there's 70 coronavirus
*  vaccines right now that are under development with three inhuman trials
*  okay so there there have been some things going on right now and the first
*  person treated with the coronavirus is in Seattle there's an article about that
*  what she's talking about getting tested but this this guy's saying we've all
*  been vaccinated like I don't know what that means it's hard to tell people
*  people have weird sense of humor right like if you listen to comics right and
*  if you took some of the shit that we say terrible people yeah they're eating
*  babies they're raping old ladies you know like we say ridiculous shit all the time
*  and we get used to it right maybe they say ridiculous shit too I don't think so
*  especially look what they are look what they're dealing with right now right but the other guy
*  coming in saying you don't have to wear a mask so Roberts comes in with no mask
*  on yeah it says you don't need a mask to take the mask off yeah well that study
*  is weird man because okay maybe maybe the I believe the mortality rate is
*  correct I believe that it's way less deadly than they thought it was but they
*  had to prepare for something that they thought was gonna be real deadly because
*  it's real deadly in Italy so but the question is like there's so many
*  questions why is it so deadly in Italy is it because they're older people is it
*  because they smoke why is it so deadly in New York City like is it because
*  they're stacked on top of each other is it definitely definitely definitely
*  that has to have something to do no distancing they're also okay so I you
*  know I have an office and I get uber eats and when it's things started popping
*  my uber eats driver was an older black man he's walking like mad close to me
*  like what's up he goes black people can't get this I'll be all right and I'm like
*  whoa man what you talking so I get the thing not gonna lie part of me was like
*  okay but I like why am I taking advice from this this the uber driver guy then
*  personal friend of mine his dad who I also know black ski trip he started this
*  organization and they went to Idaho and they came back and a lot of the they
*  were older gentlemen but a lot of them got infected with the virus two of sense
*  passed away from it so they're in their son it's in the it's in the LA Times is
*  the first article his son did a day-by-day social media post to try to
*  turn the the narrative that black folks you can catch this this is what's
*  happening to my dad he was like 61 I want to say and so I so that's why I was
*  very nervous in the face when we took the test it's like I want to have the
*  confidence that man had walking in the room but I'm also very I'm more of safe
*  than sorry then the I can't wait to be at that space you can take your mask off
*  you know what I mean I need I you know cuz I have two young children I'm just
*  like yeah I'm just I'm more on the caution side but I'm not telling anyone
*  what they should believe when I believe but just for me I'm just like I'm hearing
*  about what it does to you like just just hang about what it does to your lungs
*  and how to expand it makes it hard for air to get through we need a ventilator
*  and all and then you like what if you're gonna collapse which is what happened to
*  one of these gentlemen and then it's just it's a wrap but up but it is like I
*  don't know I don't know the specifics of how anything else plays out but I am
*  also hearing stories from the other side of people who are who are like fairly
*  you know within my six degrees who are succumbing to it so I'm just like I you
*  know that's great and but I am I'm not I'm not there yet like you know I mean
*  like I think so I am more like first of all anybody could catch it but second of
*  I think that if your immune system has any holes in it that shit gets in right
*  and and it can fuck you up look at Michael yo Michael yo is a healthy guy
*  he's strong he lifts weights all the time right he's relatively young I think
*  he's 45 right you know Michael yo is in good shape he's not overweight yes are
*  you serious real bad I didn't know that hospitalized for a week said he thought
*  he was gonna die he scared the fuck out of me right when when I heard it was him
*  he was texting me said I would call you right now but I can't talk I was like
*  wow yeah man because of what it well it like physically does and so when I was
*  going to the grocery store like that that's when I was the most horrified
*  because that's when you kind of get a temperature of how everyone is and so
*  when I went early on people like you six feet away like people were joking and
*  then there was something happened and people started kind of taking it as
*  serious as you know yeah people could and and yeah I mean I'm just I have a
*  very cautious mom I'm just a safe I'm the most reckless on stage but it's true
*  about you yeah I never thought about it that way like you're like a real safe
*  guy off stage yeah man yeah man it's just I've seen it could almost be like
*  a funny movie right every time one of my friends go fuck it man I'm just gonna
*  live in the moment now what happened to Tommy Tommy gone gotta be careful I mean
*  it's just like I have so many just stories of memories from my childhood of
*  people man fuck you gotta live for now gone you know what I mean so it's just
*  like and I you know so I'm back and forth on that moment so when I saw him
*  walk in that guy looked like he was in shape he worked out he was like and
*  there are a lot of people in Trader Joe's lines like him you know what I mean
*  like yeah when you're standing line is like you don't need a man like those
*  people and it's just like it's not for me man I don't know what I don't want to
*  bring anything home to my young kids so if it was just me in the crib I would be
*  trying to get last days puss yeah but I'm married happily married so my brain
*  I'm not I am super cautious like single away single people are fucked right now
*  right if you live by yourself in an apartment you're not allowed to leave you
*  can't go to work anymore so you just sit in the apartment going crazy
*  crazy can't fuck anybody all the news outlets though if you fuck someone it
*  better be just one person yeah real careful yeah yeah y'all go together like
*  it's a wrap that's your person it bothers me this the restrictions on
*  personal liberties I think it's I think I'm very here's like here's what I'm
*  happy about I'm happy that so many people have done the social distancing
*  thing and quarantined and kept away yeah almost everybody I know almost
*  everybody knows just staying home my kids are home doing home school yeah all
*  my friends kids are home doing home school they're staying home from work
*  everyone's staying home and we don't go anywhere you know I come here I go home
*  that's it that's my lot just stay put stay put just let let the fucking dust
*  settle yeah it's great in that way but it's also scary for all these fucking
*  people that have businesses it's scary or for people that have compromised immune
*  systems oh gosh yeah this is the weirdest time of our lives yeah I think
*  but we were talking earlier I think that the planet needs this break yeah because
*  soon as we stayed in for like a week it started raining in LA like LA has the
*  best air quality in all of the world right just to stay in the house for a
*  freaking couple of weeks yeah yeah I mean it's kind of crazy and is it is
*  weird man I'm curious to see what happens on the other side of this but
*  like our industry as far because you had a life a tour that was supposed to pop
*  off yeah like that kind of stuff is just like I sold out show in Vancouver
*  last night in an arena couldn't do it we moved to talk to her look that's the
*  last of the worries my health is fine I'm worried about health more than
*  anything right and I'm worried about the economy I'm worried about people that
*  like my friend Adam Perry Lang who owns APL restaurants like my favorite
*  steakhouse in LA he's he's spending most of his time cooking for hospital workers
*  and bringing food to them so that's giving him a sense of purpose through
*  all this and they're doing like curbside pickup where people can order food
*  online it's an amazing steakhouse but they might not live they might not make
*  it and I was texting with him last night I'm gonna get him on the podcast soon
*  and he was saying that for his friends in the restaurant industry it's so
*  grave it's like everyone is barely hanging on and they might drop off left
*  and right we might lose half our restaurants oh yeah you know yeah did
*  you hear about what happened when they did the small business loan and then
*  it's like Chris steakhouse got it and none of the waiters got it none of them just
*  go straight straight to the business they I think the idea is look if you give it
*  to the waiters and the business goes under the waiters won't have a job when
*  the business comes back so they keep the business open the waiters will have a
*  job when everything comes back we just need more we need to figure out you know
*  these people have to be able to work and if they can't work we got to figure out
*  a way to sustain them and I don't know nobody's ever figured this out before
*  nobody's ever had to do this with they they burn through that small business
*  loan shit and like that yeah they were saying us the because it was supposed to
*  be for companies 500 employees or less but you know Bill Gates Jeff Bezos time
*  to step up which are doing yeah how much money would Jeff Bezos have left if he
*  gave everybody a thousand dollars listen he would he would be if everybody
*  everybody in this country in this country a thousand dollars he gave
*  everybody a thousand do the math Jamie I'm gonna say how much more on is that
*  billions or trees well it's a thousand million is a billion so be 300 billion
*  so he'd be broke he'd be broke he'd be broke instantly crazy imagine if you did
*  that just became a hippie so I'd give up been an asshole it's like people don't
*  remember Bill Gates the old Bill Gates right people see Bill Gates now I see
*  a guy who's wearing an outfit he wears an outfit it's like he's got a suit it's
*  like spider-man like he puts on a spider-man this is my really nice rich guy
*  thing I've got a sweater bitch it's a hundred degrees outside why you got that
*  sweater with a shirt underneath it it's secretly ventilated and yeah does he
*  ever have a t-shirt on does Bill Gates ever rock a t-shirt I heard he had a
*  house where when you walk into a room it recognizes like how you like the
*  temperature like you wear a band yes you had a clip you wear a pin yeah it
*  would change the temperature it would make coffee at the to like and I was
*  like my I was single when I heard about this I wish I had that cuz that's how
*  the girl know it was over it's cold yes change the settings on you yeah you
*  walk in it changes the artwork flips over right right but uh I mean yeah he
*  called this though he called Iowa we weren't ready for a pandemic like years ago
*  15 2015 yeah yeah well he set it up he's the mastermind behind it he's like one
*  of the Incredibles like the bad guy and in I'm just confused by his outfit
*  because it's like he's dressing up like mr. Rogers on purpose he wants you to
*  think of him in a different way he's a savage man he was the most ruthless
*  motherfucker when he was running Microsoft that's why Microsoft got so
*  huge right they were take no prisoners businessmen yes take no prisoners he's
*  but he's pretending like he's you know I kind of love that shit though like when
*  people because you just have to know how to look for it right like like I don't
*  I don't trust anybody that doesn't cuss on stage you know those motherfuckers is
*  like right something's going on right those are the ones who do freaky shit
*  oh yeah ballgags yes oh look at that he's got a t-shirt there come on man that's a
*  button-up t-shirt with a collar everything has a collar though but
*  that's a long time ago that looks like about 15 years old it's a nice career
*  look at that crew why is like the forest guv
*  factor Luda took over fear factor after me where's that connection like a lot
*  of money and he's like I'll take it yeah amazing amazing man like I don't know
*  I'm a big fan yeah I like a lot man I wasn't a bit about him in my act yeah I
*  was in a restaurant he owned and he just he was like walking through shaking
*  hands I say Luda my friend Jeremy raw shout out to Jeremy directed his first
*  video Jeremy and I went to college together and he directed his first two
*  and it put Luda on the map so I've always been a fan of Luda but I've and
*  I'm what I like about his career is that he's like he's not somebody you would
*  think of but when he's in there you don't mind that he's there right I mean
*  like when I was watching the fast and furious movies I was like alright you know I'm the biggest fan in the world of muscle cars of those 1960s muscle cars and I never watched one of those fucking movies oh you got to just watch it on mute man because you'll get to you'll get the best of both worlds.
*  Get the fuck out of here all that jumping over bring us some 1969 chargers. It's ridiculous man.

*  Yes it's out. It's out. Yeah we were talking about last time folks that comedians we a lot of us keep our old old notebooks right and it's like three years ago right close to it.
*  Yeah so three years ago Owen you got a hold of me and you said do you have any old notebooks I'm doing this show and I'm like oh shit I saved a bunch of them and I found some from like 1992.

*  It was called the funny firm and then it became the fallout and then it literally fell out like later. But I moved to Chicago in 95. And what I loved about the room is you could perform downstairs and then you would run upstairs and perform. And then you come back downstairs and do another one.
*  So on a Saturday night you could do six shows because they would do three shows. This is right. Wow. Yeah. Right when they started papering the room and all of that. So I went to audition you know I go just let me do a guest set. He hired me. He goes do the rest of the night. I was like bet at the end of the night he pays everybody but me. And he goes I got spots for you. And I was like I'm supposed to get some money and like two other comics. Dwayne Kennedy and Ty Phipps they go. That's bullshit. And they gave me some of their money and I never forgot them for that. I went home that night.

Some guy with fabulous like long hair. Some group. So then we're going to do curls. It's like really. It's her partner. That's the weirdest thing when a guy and a girl together and they say this is my partner. It's my partner. Are you guys in business. Right. Are you just fucking like what. What is what is a partner. This is my partner. It's like a man said that to me once.
*  Yeah I was talking about this. Yeah I was doing this thing with my partner. I'm like first of all I think are you gay. Right. If you're if you're first of all you know if you're gay in 2020 why aren't you saying my boyfriend or my husband. Right. You know partner. I know it's a woman. You're talking about a woman but you're not in business together. Your partner. Yeah. I want to have vacation with my partner like. Yeah. What is that partner. Yeah. You guys have a firm. As a very firm.
*  Yeah. Yeah. As a married man I'm like man have some courage man. Get in there. Get in the game. Stop. Don't get in the game with everybody. No no. Some people you got to live with for a little. Yeah figure it out. When people say I don't want to live with somebody I just want to get married. That's a mistake. That is where it happens. Yes. That is that have a happy ever after shit is for the movies where it is real is when you live together and you and it's little shit. It's little shit man. How you squeeze the toothpaste. Right. That shit over time.
*  Clean up. How you do the toilet. Things than you ask them to do. Yes. Yeah. Somebody keep in score or whatever like who cooks who does dishes. Can you load a dishwasher. Can you complain about stupid shit. Man I feel like we talk about this all day. All day. And then how do you deal with it because you ain't going nowhere. Right. It's like you know what the big one is. One bathroom. Oh if you if you if you only have enough money for one bathroom you shouldn't be in a relationship. Or you got a
*  really know each other like you spent so many nights. Yeah. Together like so many weekends together. You stay at her place or she stays at your place. You want that one bathroom. Yeah. There's a reality when you walk in the bathroom right after a girl takes a fucking rank shit.
*  And if it's cold out then you got to open up the window and you're like oh good Lord. So you're sitting there smelling her shit freezing. Yes. Trying to take your own shit on top of her shit.
*  Oh. Y'all not gonna make it. You need to make it two bathrooms. Yeah. Yeah. It depends. For me I was like it depends on the chemistry of the person. Yeah. There's some people that a little thing will set you off. I mean like I can't. But then there's another other people that there's you like them so much that little thing ain't shit. The same thing. Like there's some dates I'm sure you went on when you were single where a girl just did one little stupid thing like this is over. Yes. Yes. Yes. But like if you really were into her.
*  That same thing like whatever. She's having a rough day. Now I was fucked up. She found his hair. I can't man. I'd be nice to it. Oh thank you. And then they out. Yeah. Yeah. Certain things you just you know for me. So I think yeah. People that insult you. People that like you and then they try to like put you down to try to fuck with you.
*  Yeah. Well just like they're doing it to try to like diminish you in some sort of a weird way like and they're not even funny. Right. Oh. So you're into. Oh yeah. But sometimes people grew up like that. Yeah. Their mom and their dad did that to each other. And so they don't know how to behave. No. In a relationship. And that's what that's the definition of love. Yeah. What's that. What's love like to you. Yeah. And if it doesn't match what it looks like to you. Y'all ain't gonna make it. Exactly. The. Yeah man. I was all over.
*  The place with that. Like I've had. I remember I dated this one girl. She smoked a lot of weed. Right. Didn't mind that. But she also smoked cigarettes. Damn. Pick one. Like you know I wish it was just a weed. So then she was like I'm a quit when I'm 30. Well you're 27 now. I got a way out. So I couldn't like and then that's a weird but I was still OK. Because she was she was fun. This is like the closest she was mad fun. And then she had like student loan financial shit on top of it. I was like I'm out.
*  But real talk she got it together when she got on the other side of 30. And did she. Yeah we're friendly now. But I still it was a gamble like I got a. Yeah. No financial shit. That could be that becomes your debt is your debt. They don't tell you that. No. That becomes your debt. She was like she was a serial degree person. Like she had like degrees. So her her ship was high. It wasn't like. Oh so it wasn't like hundreds of. Yeah. Yeah. I was like dude that is the best.
*  The biggest goddamn scam going because no matter what happens in your life you have to pay back those student loans. Yeah. If you owe money to any you can go bankrupt. You know you can go bankrupt. And you don't have to pay back your business folds. You can go bankrupt.
*  But Sally Mays like a. They don't give a fuck. You owe student loans. You're paying those 13. Yeah I pay that shit. Do you know there's people today that have Social Security docked for their student loans.
*  Imagine you're at the end of the game and you're Social Security they're taking your Social Security to pay off some bullshit debt for a loan that didn't do you any good.
*  Because here you are collecting Social Security broke as fuck. And they take some pending on it. You probably take a good sized chunk. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. And you never get paid off. You're just going to die. And that's going to help you die quicker.
*  Because you're going to be thinking about it. All day just at the park trying to feed the pigeons. Damn extra degree. Fuck. Yeah man I paid my shit off. I was so happy and I don't really use it. I kind of use it. What was your degree. I was finance. So you say finance if you had money.
*  I was finance student and I studied Japanese for like a year. Really. Yeah man I was going to go over there and a director named Christine Swanson she just directed the Clark sisters movie that came out on Lifetime did over like 11 million million million views.
*  Her and her husband Mike Swanson they were they were dating at Notre Dame at the time.
*  They were like you should take that like they would like sit down and like look at me and check in with me and just go you should do this and I would do it.
*  So they were like you should take Japanese and I started taking Japanese and I liked it. I really enjoyed it and I learned
*  I was getting like these culture classes because I was going to go over there.
*  And and I and I I'm an asshole. So I would like mimic the teacher but I was literally but she enjoyed it because I was actually saying it natively.
*  So I wasn't being like a dick because I enjoy like I just noticed how she was saying it. No one else was saying it. So I go I'm gonna just say it like her. So she'd be like
*  You know I'll be like come on. Why like I would like lean into it. She was like oh you know.
*  And you know you're gonna go to the sky. You see this name like you would just like
*  I just say what's going on these days. You've been busy like it's just like it's how well are you good at this. I got into it because it's also like it's I was just fascinated by
*  Why Japanese literacy rate was like so much higher than ours is because their alphabet. They have three alphabets and so there's
*  His hit a gun a katakana and kanji and kanji is what everybody gets tattoos of. So I was just fascinated with like the art of it and shit. And so what's the difference in three alphabets.
*  So katakana is more syllabatic like it's like how you speak. So so I could write your name and cut in katakana. I think hit a gun. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm rusty. So I could have messed up just now you got and I'm also drinking a little scotch. But what am I drinking whiskey.
*  But um, but uh,
*  But and so one is one is per syllable. So you can take like American words and write that in Japanese and in the Japanese person go. Oh, that's how they pronounce names. Right. So, so if your name is
*  I don't know. D'Artagnan you could do that in Japanese.
*  Who the fuck is named D'Artagnan?
*  They just go with a cat named D'Artagnan. They would be like D'Artagnan. You know they would go.
*  Or was he a knight?
*  No, and then um, and if uh, but but kanji one kanji could mean several different things. So you have to know in the context in which you're using it. And I'm left handed. So I naturally would look at stuff from right to left. And that's how they
*  Read this way. So their books go the opposite way. And so I was kind of like in my son can't say like the letter L right now everything is W. So I'm like he's like naturally like he should be learning Chinese or Japanese now. I think just because the way is his tongue and stuff is forming. He's he'll be like a yellow, you know, and I'm like, we will make fun.
*  All kids do that. All kids. But I'm like maybe. So but when I was learning it, I just got really into it because it took like a lot of like detail to like figure it out and it started sticking with me. And then I started doing comedy in college and I started on the weekends. I would drive to like Des Moines, Iowa and do a funny bone and come back. And they were like, you still want to go to Japan? I was like, no, I know what I'm doing. Like I found what I was going to do. So I just didn't I never went. So I kind of.
*  That's a trip I've always wanted to take and see how much of it like comes back to me because I was I was pretty good at it. And I loved. And then and then I started learning Chinese and Chinese is is monosyllabolic. So like Ni hao ma is hello. But if you say Ni hao ma like that, like I called you a horse. But what?
*  Yes, like it's like Ni hao ma like how you say it's like very specific in how you say things. So one is hello. The other one is same thing. Ni hao ma is hello. But Ni hao ma is that way. But if I go Ni hao ma and like drag it down. My kids used to watch Ni hao kailan. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's hey hello. Why Ni hao ma instead of just Ni hao? You can say Ni hao. And that's the thing. You can say Ni hao. What is the difference between Ni hao and Ni hao?
*  That's just what I learned in the class. It's more formal. Yeah. And yeah. Good evening. Yes. You learn everything is you learn. That's the only thing I don't like about learning languages in school. You learn you. You never learn how you speak. You know, you always learn how you would write a letter and how you would be like, you know, grammatically correct. Right. But so so now like people are doing these things where you just learn what you need to know because I feel like humans we only we all say like the same 20 pieces of like bullshit. You know what I mean?
*  Like if you can learn that you can probably learn eight languages. If you could just figure out you know what y'all getting into. Right. Is it fun? Where the bitches? Can I drink? You know, but I always where are the bathrooms? May I see a menu? What are your pronouns? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm they them. You're they them. Do they have they them in Japanese? Um, I don't remember. It was um, my goodness.
*  Now I'm gonna get reamed because I'm rusty on it. But it was like, how would how would I say this? They did have it. But it was the way honestly, the sentence structure and the way my three year old speaks is the way you would structure a sentence in Japanese.
*  He was say, he won't say the subject in the verb all the time. Sometimes he would put the verb last because he'll be so excited. So he'll put adjective, adjective, like a bottle. Great. Good. You know, you see it. And that's kind of like how you would say I'm like this dude is like, in my head, I'm like, that's how you would speak. So if I was to say something in Japanese, I would say, um,
*  so they were asked, What's my name? And I would go.
*  Hold on. What is my name in Japanese?
*  It's not Owen? No, it's it's oh, it's already No, but I'm something Smith. It's like you can't say Owen Smith. You can, but it's like Sumitsu desu, Sumitsu desu ne. Desu ne desu ka. So that's what desu ka. desu ka makes it a question. And it's at the end. So you put you put that at the end. Desu ne is
*  Period so you would say so it's like you're saying so it is right, so if I go so if I go
*  So desu ne that means it is good. So desu ka? I'm asking is it good?
*  Desu desu and and and and it depends on what part of Japan you are how you lean into the desk
*  But your name wouldn't be Smith. It's sumisu sumisu sumisu
*  Yes, and so and you were right su me su
*  You know that's so it they would say they would change Smith because it's Smith
*  But it's sumisu how they pronounce it is su me su me su sumisu Smith and su is
*  Spelled tsu so it's not I think I
*  Don't know I'm rusty. This was over 20 years ago
*  So you would have to change the way your name sounds that's so strange sumisu desu ne
*  It was will be my name they were asked sumisu. Yes
*  Sumisu
*  Make them say Smith don't don't give in
*  This is how they take over
*  Yeah, but I was intrigued man the noise that you make that means you it was amazing
*  I remember two things that opened my mind learning Japanese
*  For you're studying it for like a year a year and a half and in economics learning economics
*  How did that how'd that help you?
*  It was it because it's like a science and it's like a cause and effect and so
*  It's the same way. I approach my bits
*  You know what I mean?
*  It's like economy like if this happens then it affects all this shit
*  And it's all tied to the one thing you can't judge which is human behavior, right?
*  So you don't know what people are gonna do and people try to kind of try to control it all the time
*  Because it has direct effects on the stock market and how you can make money and shit
*  So like so like something like the girl when when the corona virus dropped I was like I
*  Go this is gonna fuck up
*  All these things mmm, and then seeing how people react to all these things being taken away
*  Fascinates me. You know, I mean, it's like but that is
*  That is what economics is because when you're thinking about stuff you always go. Well, what if a pandemic happened?
*  Well our system where are the holes in our current system, but when people are just
*  Being intellectuals about it and just like talking about it is sounds boring
*  But when this shit is happening in real time, this is what the economists talk about all the time
*  It's like it's if this then then what but it's just a deeper
*  Thing and so it's the same kind of way when you take a bit you just go
*  What if I'm talking about?
*  This anything you just you just go
*  Like I was I'm at home. So I was watching something where oh my son loves this cartoon called
*  What's the name of this cartoon he watches
*  Blaze it sounds like they but it's blaze and the monster machine and they had like this one
*  It's a the episode is it was a giant meatball
*  Rolling down the town destroying the town and they had this one
*  I was clearly like black rollerblading like monster truck with an afro going get down
*  Get groovy get down get meatball
*  Meatball and then the meatball rolls over my son loves that right? So
*  What I do with him is now I pretend
*  That that guy was on the phone with somebody else and I'm like, hey Steve, what you doing?
*  I'm just rollerblading get down and then and then so now my son doesn't I'm saying get meatball Steve
*  No, Steve get out of there
*  So then we pretend that we have to break the news to Steve's family that he got ran over by John
*  Meatball
*  That we work with Steve and he's about to go rollerblading for lunch, you know, I mean so it's just it's the economy of
*  Steve we're going going roll bait. You know, that's kind of played nobody does it
*  You know, it's nice outside and then he gets pummeled by the meatball. So it's like everybody who knew Steve
*  How did he feel about Steve? So it that's kind of like what I'm ripple effects
*  Effects and that and that's kind of like how I would I would think of bits in my head sometimes and then are you paying attention
*  To how economists are looking at the future?
*  Sometimes like right now like with me. I don't even I haven't read any
*  Prognostications other than it's bad. It's great depression. Yeah, all the all of that is true
*  I mean, well where I get lost is when they just start talking about like injecting money and fixing things, you know with money
*  I'm not I'm not I'm lost in that. I'm more I'm more
*  Into like the personal like what happens to us like like how do we I'm fascinated with that shit like the human nature of what?
*  You know gonna happen like how are things gonna change on the other side of this, right? Right?
*  You won't shake hands or you want to be you know, you know, right
*  How many people are gonna keep wearing masks keep wearing masks? Um, and then like I was I had a a classic
*  Like racial thing happened to me yesterday
*  I was with my son three years old and it's uh, this guy was working out with his shirt off in the park
*  this is big guy, he looked kind of like ridiculous and
*  My mama you said weights. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, two dumbbells no shirt on he's just in a park in the park
*  just doing these dumb workouts and
*  Me and my son see him but my son is he knows about the social my son is three man
*  He's on this little scooter. I'm on my bike to keep up with him because he's fast as hell
*  And then we were coming back where I'm walking my bike
*  And my son has his scooter and we see there's like either BMW or Audi we see the doodoo lights go on and
*  I don't think anything ever did not look and it's the guy and he's like doing it
*  Like right in front of us like you know what I mean? So it's classic
*  like did you think I'm gonna break into his car with my son or
*  Like you had all day to lock your car man
*  Like you could have just done it when you didn't see us and so like a partner was like why you do he was like
*  Doing it so he could so I could see he was doing you know I'm trying to say like I'm walking and he's like
*  like literally like locking his door and it to me it felt like
*  Cuz I had on a mask I had on the mask
*  And I was reading stories about how most black folks are afraid to wear masks as we look like yo
*  So part of me was like I scared this motherfucker. That's cool
*  But what a partner is like word with my son like I was like do I engage with him?
*  What do I let it go?
*  Like what do you do and I I let it go because I was with my son and it just felt it just felt ridiculous
*  I was like, but I feel like we're reverting back to like
*  Those paranoid things to like oh man black dude in the mask, you know lock my thing and it was like a
*  I was like what point would I prove in in?
*  I'm not gonna change them. You know, what what do I do? So I just my son didn't even see it
*  I would not have seen it if he wasn't so just like clumsy and odd with it
*  Like it just felt like
*  Cuz we had passed him several times you could have he could have locked his car when we were gone
*  You know just done it and just kept it moving but it was like it was like letting you know
*  Yeah, yeah, that's what it felt like to me. I think people are losing their minds. I think so
*  I think that's a lot of what's happening. Yeah. Yeah, their behavior patterns are all off because they're so under duress and stress
*  You know, there's a lot of people that are acting real strange sometimes, you know
*  I'll call people up just say hi. Yeah, you know, like how you doing you hanging in there and that there's a lot of people
*  Just seem real weirded out. You know what? It gets me man is at night. Yeah gets me at night
*  Yeah, cuz during the day I'm like everything's fucked up. But you know, we're maintaining I have faith in human nature
*  I have faith in society that will pull together but at nighttime, I don't have any fucking faith
*  That's we not performing either man. There's that I have any definitely that but it's also at night
*  There's something about the darkness where I'm like, I just you know
*  And I do a lot of my really fucked up thinking when everyone else in my house is asleep. Yeah, you know
*  That's when I that's when I spark up that's when I write my best shit to it was when everyone's asleep
*  Yeah, so when everyone's asleep, I'm sitting around thinking like man, what if this keeps going sideways?
*  What if we get a solar for there? What if the grid goes down? What if the earthquake hits? What if the fucking?
*  Volcano under Yellowstone blows what if this what if asteroid hits? What if a worse disease catches on?
*  What if there's a war between us and China over this bullshit?
*  There's a crazy letter that Germany wrote to China yesterday crazy the head of Germany wrote some letter
*  Directly to the head guy in China talking about the only reason why you're in power is because of surveillance and what have you done to
*  the world like what you guys have done because you because of your
*  Disgusting pride and you you've hidden the facts from people
*  You've tried to distort the reality and because of that hundreds of thousands of people are going to die
*  Whoa, it was it was deep
*  It's reading this letter like you never read a letter like that where a one world leader is shit. Not another world leader
*  Was it
*  Wasn't there a head guy the the oh the head guy in Germany is a woman right is Lamar who is it?
*  Editor of a prominent German newspaper, okay
*  Well
*  The articles it's right it's correct, you know because they
*  China never they don't admit any fault ever whenever anything goes wrong
*  They cover everything up and there's so many people that criticize the government in China, they just wind up getting ghosted
*  They just disappear they vanish. Yeah, they'd never hear from them again. No, no one knows what to do
*  I mean, that's that's how they run things over there. What scares me is that and we give into that kind of
*  Like they have apps on their phone right now that give them a social score, you know
*  So like if you jaywalk you lose points. Oh, yeah, I've heard about that. Yeah. Oh, yeah, and the guy
*  Yeah, some guy said his social score is really bad and people it's almost like Minority Report
*  Cuz almost like a black mirror. Yeah, yeah like that
*  It's it's scary and if we give into that kind of surveillance over here, right?
*  There's a real dark end to all that stuff. There's a real dark end
*  The the bright side is you're like, oh, well, maybe everybody would keep their shit together and be nice
*  Or maybe the government will be watching every goddamn thing you do all day long and hold that over you and then they'll use
*  That in order to gain more political power that's just as possible and more likely
*  Well, if they have your social score is like manipulated or wrong
*  The downside is a lack of freedom and that's the whole reason why the United States is so innovative
*  The whole reasons is this this
*  we have this
*  Spirit over here this spirit of freedom, you know that we can do more we can get more shit done
*  We can we can come up with ideas
*  We celebrate this sort of creative the sort of creative spirit that we think of when we think of the United States
*  We think of freedom we think of creativity
*  There's so much innovation done over here the moment you start clamping down on people and taking away freedom
*  You're also gonna take away that creativity. You're also gonna take away that innovative the thought mentality
*  You're gonna make people scared and you're gonna do it just so you can control them and it's fuck
*  It's the worst like one of the one of the things about the United States that makes it so great
*  Is that we have the ability to criticize our government
*  We have the ability to talk shit and that keeps people in check even Trump like even Trump
*  Like as much as he hates it
*  He has toned down a lot of his rhetoric because of the criticism that he's faced
*  You know, and that's it's important. It's very important. Yeah, I mean he has the
*  That's one thing this virus is making everybody have to do their job
*  Like you realize like a lot of his people were like acting in positions like
*  They weren't really you were truly vested if you're acting in it
*  But like it's making everyone have to actually do their job
*  I wonder if he would do it again all over again if he knew how hard it would be and how much we get shit on
*  Oh, you know, I don't know. I think it was so funny when he presented to me was like
*  It was like like the hot new nightclub, you know what I mean and like everybody was in there
*  You know what? It's like like a nightclub and you can pretend to be who you want to be and you could just you know
*  I mean and watered down expensive drinks and it's just all happening
*  Then the coronavirus comes and that's like when the lights come on in the club and you get to see
*  You know how fucked up shit really is and and
*  So it was when the whole country just kind of like said alright
*  We're gonna go with Joe Biden regardless of how lucid you feel he is or how sharp you think he is
*  When the whole country was like we're just gonna go Joe. Just made me think like Trump is like a fancy a
*  Nice resort like hotel like who doesn't want to stay in a nice hotel, right?
*  He's like, I'm rich from this and everyone's like I want to do that
*  but after a while you get tired of spending $21 for internet and
*  $40 for pancakes and you just want to go home and Joe was
*  Kind of it felt like he represents home
*  You know what I mean? Like people really I feel like people Joe Biden to me feels like a schoolhouse in a third-world country
*  That's gonna collapse and kill all the kids
*  Like a schoolhouse that is made by people who skirted all the rules of how to of construction
*  He's an old dude with dementia, but I think he's gonna be propped up by so many a
*  Different people who are gonna vote like President Obama's gonna come out and endorse him and the president
*  I want to come out and take over. Okay
*  But if he doesn't you got Joe Biden who is the leader of the country who can't form sentences
*  Listen, man, there's 320 million people in this country. Tell me that's the best the Democratic Party can do that's crazy
*  That's what I'm saying. What I'm saying is I feel like to everyone he was he represented home
*  That's what I'm saying because he's familiar he was standing next to the guy that we all
*  Felt more comfortable with especially in situations like this. Did you see Obama's endorsement video? I didn't is straight-up gaslighting
*  Just gaslighting say pretend you put it up you can find it. I don't know if we could play is it long or is it?
*  Like he's he doesn't believe a goddamn word
*  Look he knows Biden is doomed. He knows he's doomed. So you think he's gonna lose
*  It's not a matter of whether or not I think he's gonna lose
*  I do think he's gonna lose but even if I thought he was gonna win he shouldn't do the job
*  He there's no way he can take the pressure of that position with the cognitive decline that he's already showing
*  But there's no buts you just want the Democratic Party to be back in control I get it no no
*  I wish listen man. I wish
*  Like I say man like when you're and when you're in a nightclub you don't care how stuffs going down
*  Right, but when you come out, I don't understand this nightclub analogy. You know, it's an analogy
*  Damn, I'm trying to give you an example to me just the way that Trump is handling
*  Every any kind of criticism anything is unsettling. It's like dude. Just calm down man. Like you got the gig
*  You're right. You're in charge. It's kind of like I was talking to Keith Robinson. He had this amazing point
*  I don't know. It just made me laugh. He said
*  there should be some type of test you have to pass to become president because
*  For any other thing you have to take a test so you have to have degrees or whatever
*  But to be in charge of everybody else
*  And you're in charge and you control the nukes
*  Everything and it's like a backwards thing. And so that guy who's in charge of everybody else is
*  Just it's like man. I just wish he
*  Didn't call so much just wasn't the way he he was, you know, I mean
*  I wish he could just take the thing is that's who he's always been
*  That's my point and he hasn't changed at all once he got into office and people did expect him to yeah
*  He's always been the guy that if anybody says anything about him, he talks mad shit about that person
*  He's never lied Rosie O'Donnell or whoever it is that he's been in feuds with right?
*  He's never lied to you in the way and so it's like you respect all of that
*  But it's just like in times like this one is requires some empathy
*  When it requires you to look in the camera and say I feel for the people that are dying not
*  Give me credit. It's like don't do the give me credit stuff now. It's a credit stuff. It's ridiculous
*  Come on
*  And so I feel like so what I'm saying is I feel like having Joe come up there and play those notes
*  It feels like people
*  How everyone just all of a sudden overnight goes Joe Biden's our guy it felt like everyone's like I just want to I think it's like
*  Was on pills and you couldn't sing the national anthem cuz she forgot the words
*  Fucking way man, I can't be president. He can't talk
*  He can't hold a sentence you give him a couple minutes on CNN and he can't keep it together
*  But what is it gonna be like after a year in office dealing with international politics the economy the environment?
*  But all these different things what I'm saying is he's gonna have
*  People so did Obama but look how old he got how quickly right Obama's brilliant
*  Obama's a brilliant articulate guy. Yeah, he started getting gray hair his skin started sad because he was actually reading the memos
*  Crazy right that's my point my man Trump has an age
*  But if Biden starts reading those things to be dead in a week and then who's gonna be the vice president Elizabeth Warren
*  Who they're gonna put in there? No, they're probably I don't know who they gonna pick
*  It's like they said he wants to pick a woman of color
*  So he said a woman of color for the Supreme Court. Oh, is that what he said?
*  For vice president he should he should should he or should he pick the best person
*  He should pick the best person who will probably be a woman of color
*  Why would it be a woman of color though?
*  The most would it be because they're underrepresented and it would be a good thing for the country or would it be a good thing for?
*  The country because it's the best person for the job
*  Both
*  both best person for the best person for the job I
*  Feel could be a woman of color and the best person for this country could also be a woman of color
*  It could be because a
*  Lot of policies kind of stop
*  Before consulting the people of color and a woman of color can see
*  Hey, well, we live leaving out this group. Let's figure this out
*  All right, but what if it's a male of color who's better qualified for the job?
*  But that's my point what is what all the qualifications for this job is what I just said there's no test
*  You have to take it's just a popularity contest. Well, if that's the case and
*  The only reason why women of color would be would be what why would you want a woman of color?
*  I think everyone would just feel better
*  It was a woman of color in charge. Hmm. I I feel like what did Chelsea Handler say when she did her whole thing?
*  Remember, she just she just did a whole thing about
*  Something on Netflix and she was like we and she went on Ellen
*  It's like we need to start listening to women of color. Like it was like yeah, you probably should I think
*  I'm not the right person to be talking about this, but I feel like you know, they say Stacey Abrams is in the running and
*  I don't think she'd be a bad choice
*  but I've watched how she just puts things in context and she is
*  Very smart and very sharp and she is
*  Not thrown like she would be extremely qualified. Well, I'll tell you who could actually be president who Michelle Obama
*  She's not going to do it. No, but if she wanted to do it, she could be president
*  Why do you think she could do it? First of all, she's brilliant. She's articulate. She's well known
*  She's she's a powerful person like she speaks really well, right?
*  She obviously was for for rather two terms. She was the first lady. So she's accustomed to the public eye
*  She's accustomed to speaking publicly
*  Dude if she stepped up and decided she would run for president, I think she'd win by a landslide
*  Because it's a popularity contest maybe not beat Trump
*  I should say but win the Democratic nominee by a landslide. I really think you think she would lose as well though
*  I don't know. I don't know how it works. It's complicated right and especially when you're dealing with
*  Electoral college like look Trump lost the popular vote, but he won the Electoral College vote
*  Right and that's why they say Joe Biden was the best bet because Joe Biden
*  So Pennsylvania it was a swing state and Joe Biden is the only person out of the Democratic nominees
*  Who did not say he was against fracking?
*  he was like
*  You can't you can't be again
*  You can't you can't do it all at once and then they had they had the clip of the fracking protest and he's like go vote
*  for somebody else man, right?
*  Joe was like go vote for somebody else and so
*  Trump they they were saying that Trump does not feel like he could beat Joe in Pennsylvania because that's where Joe's from and he also
*  Supports he has an end with you know, the coal miners and the fracking industry just like, you know Trump
*  So when it comes to those Electoral College
*  Votes Trump doesn't know it knows he can't beat him
*  That's why I hence the whole Ukrainian get some dirt on them just announce something's happening
*  It's like thing that was kind of like the narrative of that. And so when it comes to electoral
*  Votes that whole Midwest game that whole Michigan Michigan Biden is right there and that's what I'm saying
*  Like people is man. I don't know. I don't know what what's gonna happen once people start hearing him talk on the campaign trail
*  But I don't know. I don't know how I don't know how brilliant or articulate Trump is like I don't think I think everyone
*  I think as far as brilliance. It's a matter of being able to control crowds and have these exciting rallies
*  He does arenas dude, he does sold out arenas and he kills
*  I'm not this is not
*  Objectively, I know you want a Democrat to win right and you want a woman of color to be the vice president
*  You want I would love that I would love for I'm not saying I would love for things to feel
*  Like that I don't say back to normal but I would just love to feel like
*  When the president speaking they are right now that is not like those horrible question
*  That's a nasty question this question you should just like come on man. Yeah, it's it's bad in those ways
*  but
*  What I'm talking about is his ability to excite his base and the ability to get people behind him
*  He's a unprecedented ability and depending upon how he handles this coronavirus crisis
*  It could swing left or right it really depends entirely upon who
*  Biden picks because you remember when George W was president. It really was like President Dick Cheney
*  Right. Dick Cheney was in that fucking vampire underground bunker. Yeah getting fresh blood pumped into him every day and
*  Calling all the shots. Do you remember there was one point in time where Cheney was consistently in the bunker?
*  He was in the bunker for like weeks at a time
*  He was in the bunker for like weeks at a time and they were saying he's in a they even told us he was in a bunker
*  But just in case anything happens like why isn't Bush in a fucking bunker? He's the president
*  Dick Cheney was out there calling the shots
*  I mean it was one of the most transparent times when you see the connection between
*  Industry and government where you have a guy who was the former CEO of Halliburton a company that
*  Rebuilds countries after we blow them up getting no bid contracts to rebuild a country that we blew up while
*  He's making the decisions to blow up these countries. Yeah, it's crazy. It was crazy
*  It was crazy and like you couldn't stop it, right?
*  but if someone comes along and
*  some powerful speaker someone who you really I mean
*  There's there's several choices apparently and if they pick someone and I'm sure they're grooming someone right now who you get excited about
*  You go. Okay this person this person could step up if if Biden lost or if Biden lost it
*  Right or Biden died which is also possible, bro
*  There's a there's a photo of him that was on the New York Times yesterday
*  Well, you can see like where they gave him the fucking the face
*  Like he's he's talking and it's like skin is unnaturally pulled up and back and it's like oh Christ, man
*  Maybe 20 years ago, maybe 20 years ago, but not now. This is crazy
*  Hey, man
*  I don't know is like when he was talking about all the stuff he would have done if this crossed his desk
*  Like, you know and just just just what just having an awareness of how the government works well what well
*  The what was it the pandemic agency was closed down at my and Trump but what I love about Trump he was honest
*  He was like nobody thought this was gonna happen. Like he literally is true. He just said it so he's like get rid of him, but
*  Then there's there's like all types of protocols and you find out where the money is for this
*  like Joe had a just a knowledge of where all that stuff was and I feel like Trump talks to
*  Lawyers like what can I do? What can I do? Sure? What can I do? What can I do?
*  And he just goes, you know, then he takes his stance based on what he is known
*  He's know he's gonna be protected legally, right and he doesn't equate that he's president of all of us
*  You know what I mean? And so I just feel like that's what's missing and he is incapable of doing that
*  I know when Pence had the mic and Pence was getting popular it ate at Trump and he's like man
*  Let me come into these how does that guy?
*  Get popular how does first of all you want to talk about a vice-president?
*  I don't know what that guy's voice sounds like do well people were just happy to hear somebody not yelling back at people
*  He's like we're gonna have that by the end of the week
*  Did you ever see there's a woman who has one of them pink pussy hats on and there's there's a bunch of people that are
*  Yelling impeach Trump impeach Trump and she's running like yay President Pence
*  Yeah, if Trump gets impeached and
*  Yeah, she's like yeah, maybe we should not impeach him and they're like, yeah maybe yeah, yeah, that was so funny
*  It's become so it's become so emotional right like and and and and I feel like Trump's a businessman
*  So he he's not approaching this
*  Any emotion and it's just it fucks with people because they like yo, you know
*  Well, the good thing that he did was block travel from China. That's a good thing
*  It's safe thousands of lives really did a lot of people were saying you're crazy if you're doing that
*  But there's also there's so many fucking people that are going saying that he actually didn't they were saying that people were still coming from
*  China, so what do you mean? He actually did? I don't know. I just heard that's what I'm saying
*  I was saying conflicting with they definitely blocked he blocked travel. Yeah, but they were saying people were still coming
*  Well, maybe some people had loopholes because of diplomatic reasons or right business reasons or whatever
*  But they did look man
*  There was a video that Eddie Bravo had on his page of Nancy Pelosi in
*  February telling people to go out and go to Chinatown
*  There's no worries just go out mingle and then they confronted her Chris Wallace confronted her on Fox News and she was just
*  Bullshit in her way out of this while she was blaming the president. Look everybody got this wrong. Everybody got it wrong
*  Yeah, everybody did four and a thirty thousand people have traveled from China to us since the coronavirus surfaced
*  Right, but when but but the coronavirus surfaced and this is just a this I think this is just an article about
*  What yeah, I understand the article is recent, but this is an article about when the coronavirus surfaced which was in January
*  That's just letting people know how many surface here made it over to America, but that's not how many people came to America
*  This is since Chinese officials disclosed the outbreak
*  Including New Year's Eve in two months after President Trump's so those restrictions 40,000 40,000 since the president's imposed restrictions
*  He's been so what kind of restrictions were those the bulk of the travelers who were of multiple nationalities arrived in January at airports in Los
*  Angeles San Francisco, New York
*  Chicago Newark and Detroit all places fucked by coronavirus
*  Directly from Ruhand have you seen all the shit that points to the fact that this came from a lab
*  Yeah, you know what's so funny I was talking to
*  But they were like this is a chemical thing that just got out of hand they were like they fucked up
*  Well, they were working on how to mitigate viruses. That's what they were doing
*  they're working on and they they had viruses in this lab in Wuhan and
*  They think it came out and that's one of the reasons why they think China immediately blames it on the wet market
*  They said whenever China blames it on something always look
*  Deeper
*  There there are a ton. There's a ton of
*  Scientists that are pointing to that. There's one French virologist Jamie. I'll send you this there's a French virologist who
*  Identified HIV and this French virologist was looking at this disease and he was like this is not a disease that came from nature
*  No, this is a disease that came from a lab. Did you see that that Facebook video where the this some series on
*  Netflix
*  What is it? It's a series on Netflix
*  That takes place in China
*  That like two or three years ago. They called the coronavirus and he like played the
*  Thing really? Yeah, it was like episode 13 season 3 or something like that of this show. Jesus Christ
*  Man, they knew this stuff was happening. Well people knew that it was always a possibility
*  I'm on this text thread, but it's here now and it's just like the the reset of like oh, that's nothing
*  That's interesting. Like what is doing to our TV industry? Like it feels like everything has become YouTube, you know
*  You know, I mean like all the time
*  Everybody's look trying to do you right now everybody
*  Thing is they're trying to do it but they're they're not adapting right?
*  They're not adapting to the fact they got no audience. So they're doing these whack-ass monologues, you know, who's doing it?
*  Well, who Bill Maher? Yeah bill audience and having fun with it. He's having a great time
*  He's also he has here French virologist. I'll send you this right now. Jamie. Hold on a second
*  Bill Maher has some great fucking rants. I mean these are I've tweeted twice to him that where I said Bravo
*  Yes
*  Are you playing it?
*  On my phone. Oh, where's the sound coming from? I just sent it to you. Yeah
*  His fucking shit has been great. Yeah hilarious. And also, you know, he's he's pushing all the buttons
*  You know, he's he's doing comedy. He's doing like real edgy comedy while he's pointing out how crazy this all is. I
*  Appreciate him right now. He's a guy who's on the left that I really I really like the fact that he doesn't give in to all the
*  craziness he doesn't give in to the the lunacy of
*  left-wing policies he's still he's still like
*  Rational yeah about it all although clearly left-wing biased. He's still rational
*  Yeah, but it still goes with comedy, but it was one. Yeah, I watched I don't know man
*  I like him a lot and I watch like a butts coming. I watched snow cuz I watched some of his stuff and
*  I feel like it's two things
*  He should have me on this show basically cuz he's always he would have you on a show
*  He's always talking about kids. You know what the fuck you talking about and he's always talking about
*  Um
*  But but I love I love how he attacks it like he knows but it's like dude
*  That's your shit. Yeah, that's not it or he'll be talking about um, he did this whole rant about
*  Why can't we call it the China disease? Yes, and I was listening to a
*  Chinese American on
*  On the daily
*  Talking about her experience of feeling like being an Asian American
*  He was always like a probationary experience as long as I did the right things and stayed out the way people left me alone
*  But when this came up just her going outside people are like you fucking Chinese
*  you know and and it's kind of like so it's to me I
*  love watching him because it's because it's also these blind spots that he just
*  His whole rant was really about stop these wet markets you can do it he didn't have to do the
*  Well, here's the thing about just when they called it the Chinese virus
*  They don't call anything a virus based on the country. They would call it the Wuhan virus
*  Yeah, just like they call Lyme disease Lyme disease
*  That was one of the examples that I used or like, you know SARS or MERS or some Middle Eastern respiratory
*  He didn't make that point. He didn't say call it the Wuhan virus
*  Right, he was like he was like and that's what I'm saying
*  The problem is that he's trying to do comedy and he's trying to make a point at the same time and
*  Really the right way would be call it the Wuhan. Yes, if they called it, but when they called it kovat
*  19 then it becomes the whole world's problems
*  That's one of the difference between that what that journalist in Germany was saying to the head of China
*  Mm-hmm, you know he was saying that and then the Chinese guy was saying hey, this is the whole world's problems whole world's pandemic, but
*  Yeah, kind of but it did come from a fucking if it did if it did come from a lab, you know
*  Right, we should call it the lab created Wuhan virus. There you go, but it's more specific
*  Here it is
*  Inaccurately claims the novel coronavirus is man-made and contains genetic material from HIV
*  Okay, so this guy is Nobel laureate Luke Montagne. Yeah
*  Speak French and I didn't get there. So how do we know that this guy's correct? It says
*  I
*  Know make analysis and can make that a little bigger
*  It says indicates the virus has a natural origin
*  It was not engineered the so-called unique protein sequence insertions found the two towns in 19 corner rise can be found in many other
*  Organisms not just HIV but that doesn't mean it's organic or natural in origin
*  See, I think that we are right now in this period of conflicting information and you're gonna get it bouncing back and forth
*  From protocol, but I've read multiple sources that seem and from
*  Respected scientists that seem to indicate that there's a distinct possibility that came from that lab
*  One of the things they're saying is the actual bats that they sequenced the genome when they when they found the genetics for this virus
*  The bats that tested, you know that where where this originated from were the same
*  They're from the same exact location as the bats that they do research on in this lab
*  And the lab is four miles away. I mean, it's not it's not outside the realm of possibility
*  And we're in the wheelhouse right there. Yeah, obviously I'm a moron. I don't know shit about viruses
*  Yeah, other than what I read but when China says oh definitely a wet market nothing to see here. Sorry great point
*  Look deeper. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, maybe it was a wet market. Maybe it wasn't a wet market
*  Yeah, well the wet markets are fucking gross, you know it is
*  But that's also a sad thing about you're trying to feed a billion people and you're feeding them wildlife
*  You know a lot of what they're eating is wildlife. They're equivalent to like squirrels and yeah exactly
*  Yeah, just they're eating whatever they they can eat
*  Yeah, you know pigeons were brought over here as food from where from other countries from Europe. I believe you know palm trees
*  We bought over here. Yes. No, they're not native at all to California crazy. LA is palm trees
*  Like Cubs wants and he's got fights in UFC. Yeah, he's got so Cal
*  Tattooed on stomach with two palm trees like bitches are
*  It's like it's almost it's like once you know stuff you can't I know it and it's like sometimes I know it's a weird one
*  Palm trees are a weird one. Yeah, you're like what how many they bring over here? Yeah, they steal all the palm trees
*  Yeah, yeah, that's oh, that's a weird one. Yeah, they normally in climates with
*  Hurricanes and shit because they could withstand they withstand the fuck out some wind. Yeah, right. What's the last time you saw a palm tree the fellow?
*  What take what we they just take it yeah wind yeah, they're not worried about wind at all
*  No, how crazy is that that a plant evolved to be able to handle the winds right? Right?
*  And so my brain is working like, you know
*  The palm trees that couldn't stand it, you know
*  They're telling a man you better wins are coming dude, I love Hawaii
*  I love how he's like fuck you. No one's coming here man. Stay out. Yeah, stay out. We got some beautiful islands
*  We're just gonna sit tight and eat fish for a couple weeks. Yeah, you're gonna find the Applebee's
*  Fucking Fridays
*  None of that I proposed to my wife in Maui. Did you really best one of the best times of my life?
*  I love it there. I love it there. I go to Hawaii every year to bow hunt. Oh, yeah, the night
*  Yeah, man. Yeah one tenth of my meat that I eat is from a year comes from Hawaii
*  That's dope. No, it's crazy. I will say to anybody listening if you're not married yet
*  Keep a nice file of photographs of before y'all had kids because I sent my wife a picture of us in Hawaii and it like made
*  her weak
*  Well, everybody feels like that now like everybody's like a prisoner yeah, yeah
*  You see how Ellen got in trouble for saying that what did she say? She said it's actually a hilarious joke
*  She goes I feel like I'm in prison. She goes I've been wearing the same clothes for ten days and everyone's gay
*  That's a funny joke
*  But then people like Ellen needs to be educated about the realities of prison like yeah, but also it's just a joke
*  Okay
*  You can't jokes can't coexist with the need to be factual at every turn
*  They can't this is not gonna. It's yes. You're right. You're right. She should be
*  Sensitive about but how do you know that she's not also sensitive about?
*  Incarceration and look incarceration is fucked up
*  It's fucked up and I don't know what the solution is, but I do know that it's not gonna rehabilitate anybody
*  I mean if you get rehabilitated while you're in prison all the people that I know that have been in prison
*  They write that's up to you. Like you know they'll offer you classes
*  But you're dealing with so much chaos while you're in there and so much so much danger and so much so much fucked up shit
*  Like if you get rehabilitated because that you're strong. Yeah, you're a strong motherfucker
*  But there's people that like one of my favorite examples is Bernard Hopkins Bernard Hopkins
*  Who was one of the greatest boxers of all time and also one of the ones who had the longest career of all time
*  I mean at a lead world-class level was beaten world-class fighters deep into his 40s. Yeah fought his last fight
*  I think it was 51
*  Bernard Hopkins did a stint in jail and when he came out one of the things that the one of the guys in the jail
*  One of the guards said you'll be back. Mmm, and he's like the fuck I will
*  And his discipline was legendary, you know, he's never wanted to be back the executioner. Yes
*  So a friend of mine Dan and green he did a documentary
*  about it's a group of guys in Philly called the executioners and
*  it's a fascinating documentary and
*  He I think he either took the name or adopted it or whatever Bernard Hopkins did from them. Yeah, it was a bunch of
*  cats from
*  you know
*  Troubled area but they found boxing and and started having success as the executioners
*  They were wear the mask in the ring and all of that and no sure not kind of like adopted it
*  And well, you know he abandoned it later on his career because people are trying to figure out why he's so good this late in
*  Life, so he became the alien. Yep. So it's be hopped alien on Instagram
*  Because like people like how the fuck are you beating the shit out of everybody when you're late for yes
*  Yeah, he's like I'm an alien yeah decided that the key was just super technical and disciplined and never never
*  Did dumb things inside the ring just did everything technically and always aired on the side of defense
*  He was his defense was impeccable. That's how I live life off stage
*  You know a great example that is like the difference between Roy Jones jr.
*  Who I think is one of the greatest of all time if not the greatest Roy Jones jr. In his prime was fucking untouchable
*  But then when Roy got a little older and a little slower
*  Bernard and him fought twice
*  They fought once and Roy beat him by decision and they fought later on when Bernard was actually older than Roy and
*  Bernard beat Roy by decision pretty decisively because Bernard's fundamentals and his technical ability was rock-solid
*  Whereas Roy never I don't say never threw a jab rarely threw a jab would leap in with a left
*  Yeah, cuz his left hook was so preposterous a kid could get away with crazy shit hands down moving around
*  He's the only fighter on record for compu box that won an entire round of a championship fight without having one punch landed on him
*  Do you know crazy that is whoa?
*  Against a world champion against Vinny pazienza they fought an entire round where pazienza didn't land one punch
*  I would quit I would if I was Vinny he would never quit Vinny pazienza would never fucking cool
*  He would die before he would quit and he almost did Roy Roy beat the fuck out of him
*  And when Roy was stopping him Roy dropped him was beating his ass and looked at the referee
*  He was like, please stop all this right and the referee was like keep fighting
*  He's like, okay, and he went bang bang and then put him away
*  But he's like I didn't have to do that right like he's letting him know like this fight is over man
*  This fight's over. Let's stop this stop this guy
*  Man not one get the name of one when I live in Chicago
*  There used to be a spot on the north side where on Thursday nights, they would put a boxing ring on the entire
*  The floor right and when you walk in if you have beef for somebody you could sign up
*  And you and you would go and it was all these like thugs and these gang dudes and whatever try to fight and you would see
*  how out of shape people were like in real time like in the ring and then they would always end it with a
*  Professional or like an amateur professional and you could you can try to fight him if you want and that's when you would see
*  The importance of fucking technique because you would have all these these dudes who look like they could put in work
*  But man that dude just stand in just jab jab like but it was so solid. He would never get tired
*  just be knocking these dudes and
*  You would all you would stand on a second
*  And if what happens is people start fighting really hard for like the first 30 seconds and they get winded and they don't throw punches
*  You could throw lemons at him
*  Talking all that shit and it was like the funnest Thursday night we would do it every Thursday
*  And go and that's when I that's when I first started getting into oh shit technique is everything
*  like it's every that professional would just step up there and
*  Just like not be fazed and I'm talking about on the street if you saw any of these guys you'd be like
*  I ain't fucking with that dude, right? But he knew after 45 seconds. They can't it's a rap
*  They're gonna be winded. They're gonna be tired and then he's
*  Next it was amazing to watch so when when you talk about that guy didn't land a punch in it god
*  And he's a world champion. I mean he's in an elite boxer and
*  It's how your brain work Roy Jones jr. Was Roy Jones jr. When he was at his best was people forget man. They forget
*  There was a Nas song with said the new Mike Tyson's Roy Jones
*  Yeah, and people forget there was a time and Roy had a song about it. It's called y'all must have forgot forgot
*  You know, what's crazy is that I was just thinking about that in terms of like our business like because my wife and I we
*  Were trying to recall an old TV show and we couldn't really figure out the details of it
*  but being in like writers rooms and shit, you'd know how much people pine over certain things and
*  Arguments happening all this shit just trying to get a show on the air and then 20 years later
*  Like no one remembers
*  Like what is so important to us today, you know, right it's like
*  It's like they got this Jordan doc coming back on again. So people are like, oh shit Jordan was this is a new Jordan documentary
*  Right. Yeah, it's the last day. Yeah, yes and follow them for Jordan said you're not gonna like me after this. Yeah
*  Yeah, he didn't give a fuck
*  He's like that's who I was. That's how you win. That's how you win six. Yeah
*  Well, I've always said that like greatness and madness are next-door neighbors, yeah, and they borrow each other sugar
*  That's what I that's my saying put that on a t-shirt man. That's that's true
*  Every great person I've ever met is mad
*  They're mad cuz in order to get to that place further than anybody goes
*  You you got to be out of your fucking mind and you have to have a drive inside you that's different
*  you got to be able to sacrifice relationships and public perception and and and even
*  Your own well-being. Yes, there's people that get to those points
*  Those people are just they're not and maybe it's not a good idea to get to those points because you only live in those points
*  For ten years, right and then after that you got to live with yourself
*  Yes, and it's hard for a lot of people to heal. You know who's healed Mike Tyson. Yes. I love him
*  Love him. Love you know, he's how he's healed marijuana seriously. Yeah, you want to smoke some Mike Tyson weed right now
*  About this one Mike Mike Tyson weed man, my kids gonna be like daddy why you so
*  Daddy is tripping
*  Mike Tyson
*  Yeah, that dude is amazing
*  So give us that cool gold box over there if you can see it in the corner, oh
*  Yeah, we'll both get our own joint thank you otherwise we would share a joint share a joint
*  Tested positive. It seems like a bad. I tested negative. I mean, excuse me a pot
*  I mean in a good way positive. Sorry you tested tested negative. I'm sorry. I meant like she's behind Joe like
*  Even though you're good seems like in poor form to share a joint. Oh, it's nice. Mm-hmm
*  This um, we're done lighter what happened this lighter Jamie you've been here firing up joints from behind my back
*  Thank you, sir
*  But Mike Tyson was
*  In his prime the ultimate destroyer and the ultimate guy who was completely focused only on greatness
*  But then after a while
*  You know after his
*  You know his career was over and he had to settle in and realize who was now
*  He doesn't even like working out and what he said to me was that he goes
*  I don't I don't want to feed my ego. Mm-hmm
*  He goes if I start working out again, I'll start feeding my ego. That's self-awareness like a motherfucker
*  Like that's why I don't have a six-pack
*  Real I'll be fucking don't don't give up your joke, but that joke that you do is brilliant. It's one of my favorite jokes
*  Thank you, man. Yeah, man
*  That six back joke is genius. I think I'm gonna release that shit
*  We got to do something Owen. We got to let people know
*  Yeah, I mean I've been telling people as much as I can you one of the best comics alive. That's a fact
*  Thank you, man. I gotta tell you man notebooks came out really good, Joe. I
*  Worked my ass off on that shit. You'd have been laughing at me. I did stop-motion photography
*  so like the graphics when you'll see I
*  Wanted to do like this paper crumpling and uncrumbling to show like, you know names and all that stuff
*  So I while my kids and wife were asleep. I set up stop-motion photography and crumpled the paper. Oh, wow
*  You did it all yourself all myself put it in and then I had a hell of a direct hell of a editor Matt Silfin
*  Big shout out to my man. Matt. So what are you using to set all that up?
*  I have a tripod that leans on cuz I've always I like I like cooking and I
*  I
*  Was going to do like food videos, but for my family to show them like shit that I'm making
*  I don't want to be on the internet doing
*  like
*  But I but I do wanna so when I make stuff people sometimes think oh, how did you do that?
*  What do you make so I would challenge down there? I was send him pictures and be like who'd be son?
*  Yeah, that's right. He cooks a lot. He cooks a lot to what kind of food you go
*  I would do so I would do I went on this whole bit this whole like I
*  Would make shit so I would make my smoothies are incredible
*  I would make my own almond milk and all that shit and people how do you how are you doing that shit?
*  So I would do that and then I would make like my breakfast foods are crazy like
*  My wife loves like how I put that together. I make shit from scratch because I'm a from scratch
*  Like what guys yeah waffles pancakes. Oh, that's right. Yeah, I could I could tell you what goes in it right now
*  I could like looking your thing and be like, okay, you need you know saying I could hook that shit up
*  Whatever man, whatever and you know, whatever it is, but it all but I'm big on plating and making it look good and shit
*  So you're like a chef in disguise. I'm a quiet chef and have you ever cooked any wild game?
*  No, man
*  No
*  I don't you got but I just got to see it once and then I'll get so many ideas because I guarantee you I could
*  Take a recipe that you love and just even like heighten it you'd be like damn
*  Okay, I'm doing that shit. And so I was gonna do
*  Sometimes my wife would take a picture
*  I'll take a picture and like send it to like my mom something and my mom is like competitive as fuck
*  How'd you do that?
*  Did you put the thing on the thing and I get it from from them?
*  They're like their foodies before it was foodies like my aunt sissy could
*  Bite a piece of dessert and be like they didn't use cinnamon like she like she can taste that shit and I will watch
*  I grew up watching that so I like doing it. So so basically I bought a tripod
*  For but I was able to use that for the stop-motion photography
*  so I did that for all the the lower third titles and all of that stuff and I had to
*  Realize that cooking is an art. I had I had to change my perceptions and I didn't realize that I had a misconceived
*  Idea misperception. I didn't understand that until I watched Anthony Bourdain's TV show the first one no reservations
*  Yeah, and when I watched that show and his
*  enthusiasm and passion for
*  For great chefs and great cuisine and I think a lot of it also was like that
*  He was enthusiastic about other people's work. Yeah, and then I was realizing like this
*  okay, this guy is not just a chef himself, which he was but also like a
*  fan of the art form and so all the great masters like he would go to their places all over the world and and and
*  Film with them and eat with them and cook with them and drink with them
*  And then I realized like oh, this is a this is an art form that you
*  Don't see it doesn't last very long and you eat it. It's still an art form. Yeah, but it's an art form
*  It's like oh, yeah, like drawing right like your son's three when your son draws
*  Yes, like it's cool to see someone draw something, but it's also different than
*  You know, whatever
*  Leonardo da Vinci, you know, whatever some someone who's amazing at it like you go. Oh, there's levels
*  There's many many many many many many many levels even to food. There's like some food. That's just I'm hungry
*  I just need to eat right but then I
*  Guess what happened was civilization got settled into the fact there was enough time which we can get enraided by barbarians and fighting off
*  Sabertooth cats like okay. Okay. Okay. What if I make it pretty like what if I add a little bit of this everything and then
*  Put a little fucking balsamic drizzle on it. Look at that little sprig of parsley
*  Yeah, yeah
*  Look what you did and then they started turning what was like an essential thing into an art experience
*  Yeah, well cuz you
*  You eat with all five of your senses right first you you hear it cooking right
*  Then you smell it. You know shit
*  Then you see it and that's the whole plating of it right what's the other two senses you taste you taste it last
*  Yeah, see here. What's the other one feel you touch feel it and you touch it. Oh sure texture and you go and so
*  So it is it's a dance man. It's the whole and I love that
*  Aspect of it and for a while I I had gotten into
*  Plant based stuff
*  To see and so it's like a fun thing when you can basically make versions of your old comfort foods
*  Mm-hmm, I would be like hey
*  Or I would make stuff without like a specific ingredient like do a substitute thing and it tastes great or look great or whatever it is
*  so
*  So that's that's the stuff that I was into. Mm-hmm, but I also like
*  Flipping like
*  We my wife and I did joke about doing a psycho doctoring it up like we'll just take like
*  Take I don't know. We'll take like I don't know canned chili, but then size it up
*  So when you eat it, it's like this shit could be like a $25 bowl of chili now, you know what I mean?
*  Doctoring stuff up. It's like my thing too. I could take a frozen pizza and
*  Do some shit to it and you'd be like you get you know, it's cool to me, too
*  Is that food is so specific to the culture like I went to Thailand for the first time ever last year
*  Yeah, and you know, we actually took a Thai cooking class at this one place
*  And so you got to understand like how they do things like just very little dairy
*  like everything is like coconut milk and these different spices and curries and the way they cook and it's like you like oh this is
*  Was opposed like Mexican food which is so recognizable to Mexico the mole and
*  Chorizo and all the different styles of creating Mexican food. Yeah. Well, um for a while I did raw food
*  Raw we did raw food. It was fantastic. It was the best shape out best really best I ever felt in my life
*  Yeah, just raw vegetables. Um, it's
*  Did you not see seeds no, I didn't do more on me but but I went down this deep dive I was learning how to make dishes
*  And every meal has four things a fat a acid a salt and a sweet
*  So even if you don't eat raw food, I was just like looking at plates like so if you get calamari, right?
*  The frying and that's the fat, you know what I mean?
*  Mm-hmm
*  And then the salt is obviously the salt in the batter and the sauce you put on it
*  The sweet is the dipping sauce, but they always give you a lime wedge
*  I'm like why do they do that and that's the acid part
*  so every meal should have those four components and then you just learn like how you tease the tongue and stuff that you do to like
*  stimulate the tongue and excited and so
*  What I learned when I did the raw food thing is that I don't love barbecue potato chips
*  I love the seasoning that's on the chip. Of course, you can take so you can take anything
*  Not anything, but you know what I mean something chippy. Yes, and but if you can conjure up those same seasonings
*  I won't miss barbecue potato. Oh, I will fuck up
*  bag of vinegar salt vinegar vinegar chips sea salt and vinegar
*  Yeah, fuck those chips. Tom's got the best ones. I think I feel like I can't stop. Yeah, like I'm in a trance
*  I'm in a vinegar and salt eating trance. I'm like barbecue savory like but I would eat any chip
*  But it's like the chip by itself
*  That's where the sum is equal is way greater than the the sum of the parts the total is way way because like salt by
*  Itself is okay vinegar by itself. That's fine chips by themselves
*  Yes, yeah, I haven't seen you get no salt and vinegar almonds have you had those I'm scared
*  These are my brand sriracha's yeah blue diamond
*  Oh, yeah, I eat the shit out of these but I know there's all kinds of spices in here that I need right
*  Why am I eating this but it's probably look this this is the I haven't I can't read this without my glasses on but that
*  List of ingredients to me that's all not just almonds
*  Look at all that shit look see if you can read that look at all that shit
*  Those are the sriracha almonds which are goddamn delicious. Yeah, but I the first one's a little weird would be corn maldextrin
*  That's the first ingredient. No, no, I mean like the first one. That's a little funny
*  It's the almonds vegetable oil sugar salt corn maldextrin sugar is a high number that's not good either. Yeah
*  Really better off raw
*  Raw almonds. Yeah, that's what you're really wrong with
*  Yeah, wrong is a dope little bit sugar. How many grams of sugar does that you say?
*  How big is a serving though? Like how many servings? Oh, yeah, why do they do service like that?
*  28 nuts is a ounce so that's six servings. Well, I eat six servings now grams
*  Cuz I eat six servings
*  How many teaspoons gotta be a lot of it's a lot of calories too when you find out how many calories are in almonds
*  You're like, whoa six grams of protein. Yeah. Yeah, it's good for you. Oh, but you know what's bad for the fucking environment
*  You care if you care about the environment, you're not supposed to grow in a plant here that could never survive without being drowned
*  That's what almonds are these motherfuckers just suck up all the water their whores
*  They're mean they kill all the other plants. They're like fuck you. We're trying to make nuts
*  I don't know. I'm just kidding about that, but they're drinking all the water. They're eating bitches
*  Thirsty is they're like that somebody pointed that out like if you really care about the environment
*  You wouldn't be buying all the others from other countries. Oh, yeah, like what do you do?
*  Where's that avocado coming from? How's it getting here by truck? You're supposed to be eating what's around you
*  And you're supposed to live where shit grows
*  That's right, right
*  Just drove here 500 miles with your food. They're car to us. We have world hunger of you people live where the food is
*  We got deserts in America too, we just don't live in a mass hole
*  Yeah, do that line alone a lot of our food comes from California
*  Yeah, the farmland between here and
*  San Francisco is crazy
*  Republican go up there you see these you know anti-abortion
*  billboards and
*  Pro Trump billboards and oh my goodness. It's like a different world
*  It's so crazy because it's the world of the people who have to work from fucking dawn
*  To like 7 p.m.. And they crash they go back to the farm again
*  They're always trying to keep it together. Yeah fuck man when it comes to like farmers
*  There's one thing you get a lot of you get a lot of religion and so I'm not it's not a value judgment
*  It's just but you get a lot of religion and you get a lot of Republicans you get a lot of that
*  It's not that common that you get a liberal
*  Certainly some organic farmers that are like real progressive liberal people they understand the importance of growing your own food
*  But like mass farmers like when farmers are growing corn to feed cows like that those kind of farmers
*  It's nothing wrong with that. They need them that those fuckers are a lot of those people are Republican
*  you got to wonder like maybe it's just like the party of the people that really bust their ass and
*  They they want that they want that that hard-working
*  Farmer ethic is like there's no room for bullshit in that life
*  If you got to get up at 6 o'clock in the morning and feed the chickens milk the cows and then do shit all day
*  Long and you're barely paying your bills. You don't want to hear any
*  Bullshit, you don't want to hear any bullshit. And so I think a lot of them are
*  Republicans because Republicans stands for like this no bullshit perspective on life
*  They think the Democrats want to hand out their money and take too much of the taxes, but it's because of their reality
*  It's because the reality this particularly grueling occupation these people have taken on, you know
*  It's it's almost like a mistake of perspective
*  You know
*  They don't they don't have an opportunity to see things openly like see the whole world and see where their their position is like
*  They have a uniquely difficult position. They might think the whole world is like that, but it's not necessarily
*  Like you just chose something that's a preposterous endeavor. I mean, I mean that in an admirable way
*  I'm like admiring farmers work ethic if you took a regular person's you or me
*  It's never worked like that ever and say hey Owen
*  You enjoy gonna get up at five o'clock in the morning. You're gonna feed the chickens and milk
*  Man and you're barely gonna make any money and you're gonna have crazy loans and you're gonna need to be subsidized
*  By the goddamn government me up no man, you know so much depression and suicide and when their farms collapse, man
*  It's fucking devastating and there's some people who could do it too
*  Some people do it and they become very successful and some people do it and love it and swear by it
*  I mean, there's a whole spectrum but that that has got to test you and if you think about how crazy that is
*  That that's not more lucrative
*  But what is more valuable to us than our food?
*  Why do we treat them that way exactly? Well, it's like what else is more valuable our teachers?
*  What why do you think that way is consistent people who get paid so little who are so valuable
*  Yes, what a fucked up society backwards. What what is more value? There's number one is stay alive. Yes number one
*  How do you do that? You need food? Okay, the people like food. Yeah, we should take take so good
*  1% they should be priests. Yes, they should be taking care of fruit
*  They literally bring you fruit and you give them paper and you get their fruit and it sustained you but they struggling
*  And then number two is teachers. Yeah, because once you hear you got to learn something
*  What do you but what do we do with our teachers? We take them we pay them dog shit
*  We stick them in front of 50 kids barely paying attention and you just hope to make an impact on like
*  I'm sure you have a few teachers like that said a thing. Yeah at one point time you're like, okay
*  Like this teachers do make a difference. Yeah, mr. Friedenberg
*  You'll never you'll never be able to draw a woman until you've had a woman
*  Shit that's a Bill Withers line that sounds like a song. Yeah, mr. Friedenberg god damn
*  Yeah, I had one guy who was a Vietnam vet who was a heavy guy
*  He was heavy and he was in middle school when I was in I was in the Mary Curly Middle School in Jamaica
*  Jamaica Plains, which is a at the time
*  It was a real sketchy neighborhood outside of Boston suburb not a suburb of Boston, but you know inner city
*  We moved there from Florida and that was the only place we could afford when I was a kid and
*  Like 17 year old kids in my seventh grade class
*  It was so ridiculous I'm not exaggerating man
*  Yeah, it was maybe eighth grade. I'll forget but there was this one teacher
*  Anyway, he was a science teacher and he would grow his own radishes and he kept saying like all I need is radishes and salt
*  And that's my lunch and I grew my lunch and I'm thinking like wow
*  This guy's out there growing his lunch even out here in the city, but this is the big thing
*  He said to me he goes you ever want to hurt your head
*  he goes just go outside and look up at space and
*  Realize how big it is try to imagine
*  Something that has no end if you really want to hurt your brain. Just try to imagine that space has no end
*  That fucked me up dude, I was like 13. Yeah, I was like, oh my god
*  He's right
*  What there's no end and I swear to God that became a big part of the shift in how I started viewing the world
*  There's like two things that started happening when I was a kid
*  One is that I moved around a lot so I never had friends and because I never had friends
*  I had to form my own opinions on things. I couldn't just adopt the opinions of the neighborhood
*  I had to form my own opinion
*  So I was always traveling to all these different places and then two was that teacher saying to me
*  That there's no end and I remember thinking that when I was a kid like holy shit and
*  Then the two conclusions that I won there are no grown-ups. It's not real
*  I come I was realizing like I'm gonna one day be one of them. What this is nonsense
*  They don't know what because you see enough like faulty behavior. Yeah adults you see enough
*  Alcoholism like us. I saw a lot of
*  Alcoholism and drug abuse when I was doing construction
*  My stepdad was an architect, okay, he got me gigs on
*  Jobs and construction sites if that's what I would do for summer
*  That's how to make money and you get to be friends with some of these guys and some of them had like real
*  Potential like there's this one dude. He was a he was a
*  drummer and a music I think mostly just a drummer I think he played guitar too in a band and he was a
*  Really funny guy. His name is Robbie funny interesting guy
*  But he just struggled with the fucking booze in the bottle and I became friends with him when I was like
*  1617 and he was in his 30s man, and he couldn't get his shit together
*  He would like do good for a little stretch and then he would fall apart
*  But I remember I liked him so much. I was like, he's so funny and when he's got his shit together
*  He's just a fucking cool guy
*  And then I would see him drunk and I remember thinking that when I was 17 like I was poor guy
*  He's tripping on his own dick
*  He's just fucking his way through the but it was like for me
*  It was important to realize that you could be a guy who was like a funny nice guy that I really like
*  But also do the dumbest things possible and derail your life
*  So I was thinking like what is missing in this guy that he's doing this like why do people keep doing that?
*  particularly with things that are just undeniably devastating like hard drugs and
*  Things along those lines where you literally could die every night and you're still shooting up
*  Like what keeps you doing that and it's like a lack of structure for a lot of them. It's a little wow
*  I was thinking that when I was like a lot of them are adrift
*  And some of them it's a chemical thing some of them for sure addiction is they're more inclined chemically
*  But it seemed like some of them was just like a lack of structure and discipline and if they just had rules
*  Like here's rule number one. You don't shoot heroin into your dick because you're a Smith
*  Yeah, and this is Smith's don't shoot heroin into their dicks. Okay. All right gather it up
*  But some people they grew up with parents that didn't lay down any rules man, and they never developed
*  They never developed like a line. They can't be that farmer
*  Yeah, those fucking farmers that get up at 6 a.m. That those no bullshit motherfuckers that work hard every day
*  Every day and then there's people that just like they barely show up. I'm sick today. I can't make it in
*  Think of it that way but that's so true. They don't have anything hanging over their head
*  You know, especially when you're young Billy Gardell used to say
*  When you're single you're a Democrat
*  No, no, no, no. Yeah, we see your day. He's get a house you're Republican
*  Yeah, so I want you own some shit. You're gonna want to keep it and then that's what that's what yeah, that's sort of true
*  But that's not always I mean, I'm not a Republican. Um, I
*  Can't I consider myself left on almost every issue
*  Yeah, except for maybe the Second Amendment and this is one where I saw people falter
*  I saw a lot of my liberal friends fall apart
*  Wanted to come to Jojo. How do I get a gun? Oh when this shit went down?
*  It wasn't that we disagreed even it said like they never one friend his wife would never let him have a gun and the moment
*  Went down she goes you have to get a gun. She said to him you have to get a she turned 180 degrees
*  And this is I've always saying like I've like people can go dark on you men. The world can get evil
*  The when when scarcity becomes a thing
*  I mean, there's a reason why there's so many apocalyptic movies and it never works out great, you know, all these Mad Max movies
*  It's not like that would be way better
*  Fish we speared yeah, it would be it's a great idea in theory
*  But you what if you break your leg you want to dive an infection on the beach?
*  So how many people hit you up asking a lot a lot like almost probably a dozen close to did you help me?
*  I would say
*  Genuinely at least seven or eight it was to know I said listen
*  You're gonna go down a road man. Like I'm not gonna help you get a gun. You got to go to a gun store
*  There's a giant line. Yeah, wait in line bitch go read read online how to get a gun like this is I'm not supporting your panic
*  buying of firearms
*  You got to learn how to use it too, that's the other part. Yeah, you don't have to learn how to use a gun
*  Like I've taken several lessons many lessons now
*  You you have to learn how to use a gun correctly. You have to learn how to load it. Yeah, I've had
*  Rifle lessons. I've had pistol lessons
*  It's a very dangerous thing to just have around if you don't have any experience with it
*  It's tricky but but the inclination to get one
*  Is what I've been telling people about all along like you think the world is safer than it is
*  mmm
*  The world's not that safe. It's just safe right now. We hit a real good spot man. You and I were born in an amazing time
*  I know could you imagine we're born in the time where people are getting it together, right?
*  We're not together all the way, but we're still but we're getting it together
*  Yeah, we're getting it together
*  So in a sense like one of the things you were saying earlier about wanting a woman of color to be vice president
*  Here's what that would indicate. This is what I think
*  Well, one of the best things about the Obama presidency
*  But this is what I said the best thing about the Obama presidency and let everybody know
*  Okay
*  Well, this racism is all bullshit because here's a guy who made it to the fucking White House
*  And this is a guy who's articulate and he's brilliant and he's a perfect statesman
*  Whether or not you like his policies or not, like that's a great representative of who we can be so drop it
*  There's no inferior race
*  It's just people who have an opportunity people who don't and cultures and where they're where they develop in advance and what kind of environment
*  They grow up in we're all one thing. We're all one thing true, but but
*  But here's the but
*  when one group decides to
*  Change the rules and keep moving the goalpost and keep doing so they can keep whatever they have that's everybody in power
*  That's what I'm saying every culture has but in this country every job everything everything but in but in this country
*  It you know
*  Racism, it's not it's not bullshit like this shit still. Oh, no, no, no, no, no
*  I don't mean it's bullshit. Like it's not a real thing
*  I mean, it's bullshit like it's a dumb thing to still hold on to okay. Let's be clear. No, no
*  Thank you for being so calm and correcting me if I really thought that stupid no, I'm not saying that racism is bullshit
*  I'm saying no, you can't defend it anymore. There's nothing there. There's nothing there
*  Yeah, if you just decide that an individual is in a category because of how much melanin or where they're from
*  That's crazy. Now that's a something to Joe. No one has a stronger work ethic than a racist
*  No one's stronger work ethic than Jamaican
*  Jamaican legendary making racist mind
*  Listen to me about no
*  You know how hard these cats work to change the rules and if they just did half of that the other way everything would be
*  Beautiful. Yeah, you understand what I'm trying to say like, you know, what's my favorite one? What lazy Mexican?
*  Do you know how god? That's crazy
*  You see the Mexicans out there picking strawberries for like 13 cents an hour, you know, I mean how much are they making
*  What do they pay them? There's so many undocumented workers. How many people walk here from Mexico? How many people?
*  Mexicans working on farms and bust their ass doing the hardest jobs possible waiting outside Home Depot to do anything you want them to do
*  That's crazy
*  That's hilarious. That's a hilarious
*  Racist
*  Before that the same thing happened to black folks too. Sure the slavery and after slavery called us lazy in this like word
*  Well, that's the the darkest aspects have never been addressed from slavery is what where you where you start from
*  So if you if there's a community and this there's a community that has definitely been
*  suppressed by racism like
*  There was a guy
*  What is this woods? What's his name? The the the Baltimore police detective that we had on Michael Woods, that's right
*  Who was a he was a detective in Baltimore or a police officer in Baltimore, I don't know was he a detective
*  I don't know. Who's a police officer?
*  Anyway, he found an old piece of paper that was a detail of like the the crime report
*  And it was all the exact same crimes from 1970 something as he was experiencing the exact same place
*  The exact same crimes and it was like oh shit and for him
*  It was just a
*  Relevation like oh this is and then he found out about redlining. We all weren't allowed came up with that
*  like seriously like
*  but and then think of
*  The work ethic it took to even what the but who came up with well people that were trying to suppress people that were freed
*  from slavery
*  Right. So even imagine right even if you weren't a slave owner if you condone slavery
*  If you were around in 1864, I know like I think it's a good thing and then all of a sudden they let them out
*  You're like, oh shit
*  And then they tried to suppress them so they try to keep in it
*  But we're still experiencing that today now when people talk about like reparations being a good idea or a bad idea
*  The most important thing would be to fix all the spots that we absolutely know were affected by slavery
*  There's not a small number of them
*  There's a large number of them and these communities continue to be in a suppressed state
*  Even though they are free they can go out some of them do escape and they get great careers
*  Some people do get out of bad neighborhoods, but you're asking people
*  To do a way more difficult thing than if you growing up in Brentwood and most people talk about
*  You know slavery and now but nobody talks about like the the moment after slavery where they started doing the black codes
*  right, so
*  So like so you're technically free, right? But then they would make it illegal for you to hunt and fish for your own food
*  Or and then you couldn't look for a job outside of your town
*  Like it was like all these things that was basically in it and then they made loitering illegal
*  You know what I mean? Yeah, it's like if we can get you to jail then we can treat you like a slave again
*  it was like this could you imagine like
*  So you only had to work for one person still and still get paid shitty wages
*  Yeah, as opposed to going I want to work wherever I want to work. It's illegal
*  Then I won't work. I'll just draw my own food. You can't do that like and the federal government didn't
*  You know make the states
*  Deal with it. I'm gonna do a movie about that shit, but I don't know if anybody's a hundred movies to be done
*  you know, I got balls deep in a Native American history a couple months back and
*  It freaked me out man. It's crazy, man
*  I read I started off with this book that my friend Steve Rinello wrote on American Buffalo
*  And I read that and a lot of it had to do with like Native Americans hunting the buffalo
*  And then I did read this book Empire the Summer Moon
*  It was on the Comanche's and holy shit, and I just started getting I read like at least five of them over
*  Most of them I listened to what fascinated you an audio to story stands out to you the most the Comanche's
*  Yeah, bro, they ran shit they ran shit all through Texas and Oklahoma. They killed everybody they this is how devious people were at the time
*  They would give people giant chunks of land. They say you could have a giant chunk
*  Oh, yeah in Comanche country, so they would give them this land. They would go there and get slaughtered
*  But they would like slowly they were trying to like use them as like human cannon fodder to slowly move
*  The the you know the line of what America owned and push into Comanche country
*  But they it took
*  hundreds of years
*  The Comanche's from like the 1600s to the 18 just with dominant they were they were so terrifying
*  They all they ate was buffalo their wild motherfuckers who didn't hardly create any art
*  They they figured out horseback riding and they figured out horseback riding better than any of the other
*  Native Americans and they figured out how to shoot arrows off their horses and they figured out how to raise horses
*  So their whole thing was about giant packs of horses and they can conduct all of their fighting off these horses and
*  The the white dudes only had muskets back
*  They had one shot right and then you had to fill that bitch forever and the Comanche's figured out
*  There's a dude named Lars Anderson who actually like sort of recreated what they were able to do back then
*  He's an archery guy and the Comanche's would take arrows in between all their fingers
*  And so as they were riding a horse chasing dudes down all the white guys would get off the horses
*  That's how they fired the rifles the Comanche's would shoot from their horses with all their arrows stuck in their fingers
*  They'd go one two three four
*  They could shoot like an arrow a half a second
*  Crazy, they would hang off the side of the horse and use the horse as a shield under its neck
*  As though and they were ruthless man
*  Ruthless what they did what they did to other Indians what they did to white settlers and it's all depicted in just
*  dark
*  Gory detail where you're like, oh my god
*  They I mean, but you got to realize what was
*  Imagine trying to survive back in Oklahoma in
*  1700 when you're just riding around your horse with you got sticks that have
*  Sharp rocks that you chipped at the end of them to go kill deer and buffalo and shit
*  And that's what you need to make your baby stay alive
*  And then you get raided by other Indians who want to fuck your woman and take all your shit
*  Dude I got so crazy about it. I got so crazy about it that I had a I had to take a break for a while
*  When I got that painting the painting you saw in the
*  That's this guy Greg Overton. He's this master
*  Native American stuff. I think that's a crow
*  I actually didn't ask him but somebody else told me look at that. This is how these fuckers do it
*  This guy hanging that guy looks like a Mongol, but he's
*  Is he Native American?
*  He well he might be a native
*  Well, it might be Danny below speech also the way like all their stuff their hats and their clothing and stuff looks more like Mongolian
*  But the Mongols were famous for being able to do that and that was even before you know
*  Anything was recorded about the Native Americans. They were strong
*  Or had to be to be able to do that. Well, they're bows their bows would take
*  160 pounds to pull what yeah. Yeah
*  So you saying it was like pulling 160 pounds 160 pounds
*  Yeah to give you an example my bow. Yeah that I shoot with is 82 pounds
*  It's really hard to pull back. Oh shoot. Yeah, it's like doing lap pulldowns. Exactly. It's really hard to pull
*  But that is twice as powerful and mine's a compound bow. So it's on like these cans, right?
*  So as you pull it it gets easier at the end. Oh my god easier to hold there. That's hilarious, man
*  I just had like what if you made a sound every time you pulled it because it's hard
*  You did that
*  Gym noises, did you ever see that? What does that one is it Planet Fitness? They don't let you make noises
*  We got discrimination of all time there's meathead discrimination they discriminate against us meatheads
*  Yes
*  Yes
*  You want people that are gonna quit that's what they want
*  They want people that are gonna buy a membership go there for a month and not so
*  Dedicated right
*  Dedicated people grunt they grunt they drop weight. Yeah, they feel it. They also put pizza out on Fridays
*  I've heard oh do they what place at Planet Fitness? Yeah, they put pizza out. Yeah pizza
*  I'll go is it like
*  Like what kind of pizza like pizza like pepperoni and cheese pizza. Are you serious? So ridiculous at a gym
*  What is that a plant-based crust that's actually
*  Actually make pizza crust from scratch it's fun man
*  This hilarious misunderstanding that you thought I was saying that racism is bullshit like it doesn't know I just wanted to
*  If I said that like that god that's gonna be taken out of context. I didn't think you yeah, that's what I'm saying
*  That's why that's why I went back. I didn't I didn't think that at all. Oh, that's hilarious
*  I just think it's it's a there's it's it's bad for everybody
*  But it's also like it's a part of a pattern of human behavior. That's bad and that pattern is
*  Lumping people into a category and not
*  Accepting the uniqueness of the individual like as soon as you put someone in a category
*  Like any kind of category you put people in and you don't accept the uniqueness of the individual you create the potential
*  For some sort of tribal difference between each other that wouldn't ordinarily exist
*  Like we start thinking of someone as oh this guy's from yeah
*  This guy's from this place this guy's from that place. I think of them in this way or they do a this
*  So I think of them that way like what I don't have a problem with any of that
*  I have a problem when you go because I think of you that way
*  You you you don't get to do this. That's yeah, that's where it gets weird. It's like for sure thinking me what you want
*  Here but when you just go I don't want anything, you know
*  I was gonna say is it like we still have sir, but there's certain like aspects of certain cultures
*  You can't deny if it like
*  attack like Italians
*  Like I'm mostly Italian and they are the most stereotypical fucking people alive
*  Like it's East Coast Italians are exactly like the Sopranos. There's just varying levels
*  Right now the promo was killing it fam he could be president
*  He could be ready to see that's a guy who could be president
*  that's a guy who exhibits all the leadership skill and and
*  understands that this is a terrible thing and sacrifices have to be made and there's mistakes that have been made and we're gonna have to
*  Correct those mistakes and do the right thing going forward and we're gonna have to figure out how to get through this and
*  That's the imagine being a guy who's a president or a mayor or a governor
*  Who's dealing with this right now like we as much as we shit on all of them
*  We have to we have to respect that they're trying to help us and they're you know
*  I think they're trying to help us this my perspective when I see whether or not I agree that we should be shut down for
*  X amount of months. I don't know when we should reopen. I'm not an expert. I don't know jack shit, but I do
*  I appreciate when someone like our governor
*  Like seems like a leader and is on television and he's making the choice and he's making a choice based on
*  Wanting more people to be able to stay alive. Yeah, I'm all fit. I'm all for that too
*  That's all those things are great for all of us. Yeah
*  But I just I hate the fact that there's Democrats and that there's Republicans
*  I hate it. I hate the fact that there's these groups because it just leaves open this like I had a friend
*  He's a really nice guy and when we were on
*  This we worked together on the set and he was so into Apple
*  So into Apple products. Yeah, he was talking about when the new Apple laptops comes out
*  You know, we're gonna shove it in Microsoft's face and it was like all this team shit
*  I was like bro, you got team shit for the operating system of your computer
*  That's so that's how we are man
*  It doesn't have to be of something that's important because politics are important, right?
*  The way we treat each other is important policy is important the way the standards of how
*  We accept the leader of this great nation the way communicates all that stuff is important, right? That is real but
*  It's also
*  To break it down into two sides is so dumb it opens up the possibility for tribalism
*  Oh the same thing is like fucking iPhone versus Android people already stab each other
*  Yeah, it's at my son's school. They won't they won't let you wear superhero stuff because it can create clicks
*  Because if you're like I'm spider-man people Batman people and then you can create that DC versus Marvel when I was a comic book
*  Head it was all about Marvel Comics versus D. I was a Marvel guy my friends with DC guys and they were fucking losers
*  But that's just a natural part of human beings we have to
*  Yeah, we have to recognize all that will still be like you wear glasses. I don't wear glasses
*  It's also I'm from Jersey. I'm from Boston, you know all that shit. It's like come on
*  It's it might be cute but to hang on to it
*  If you if you get some benefit out of it, if you're proud to be from Brooklyn, that's great
*  But you're just a person and this this is the only way to look at each other
*  the only way to look at each other is based on the individual and
*  It's just hard to do it's natural to separate people by political biases by what part of the country they're from it's natural
*  It's fucking it's a part, but we don't have to do it anymore. We don't have to it's a trap
*  There's a trap that robs you of your perspective and it lumps you in with a bunch of other assholes
*  You know like there's some women that like all girl powered out, you know, like listen
*  There's a lot of girls that are amazing, but there's a lot of girls that will you don't want them on your team
*  You know, it's a bad shit. You know what Casey Anthony on your team. Let's just stop this all girl all boy shit
*  Let's stop all left all right. It's all
*  Fucking nonsense and we we haven't figured it out yet for some reason. We're still
*  Dependent upon two parties. We're still dependent about among two philosophies conservative or liberal
*  Different parts of the country. Oh, these are red states like oh Christ. Oh
*  It's a trap when did that start
*  Blue states when I was a kid, it's a fucking trap. It's all a trap. It's a trap. What's the alternative though?
*  That's the thing like whenever I hear
*  So what's the what's the alternative I think multiple parties I believe Holland
*  Doesn't Holland have like seven political parties or some shit?
*  Why is that working out?
*  Well, they have legal weed or they tolerated weed long before us used to be able to buy mushrooms at cafes
*  Oh shit, why'd they stop? I think people start tripping too hard. I did mushrooms one time
*  shit on this dude's couch
*  I think I'm so excited. Oh white couch. This is crazy
*  Say his name, I know give them that platform. That's a rough moment
*  That's crazy if he sees this every pistol
*  But so that's another example of like
*  What do you do like people are so people are so
*  That's my only question like when atheists say you shouldn't believe in God. I
*  Don't believe in that either. I don't think they're right. What's the alternative and like you can't
*  Yeah, no, you're right. You you can't tell people what to believe in
*  the the thing about atheism versus religion is like
*  What is the overall?
*  Benefit, but do you if you get an overall benefit out of believing in a higher power and it forces you to act in a more
*  Harmonious way. So you sure that's not good
*  Because there's a lot of religious people that because of those religious principles, they live very ethical and moral lives
*  So is it an overall net benefit for them to be involved in a religion?
*  It seems like there's an argument that it could be but then is there also an argument for being objective about some of those stories?
*  That seemed crazy like guys coming back from the dead and walking on water
*  And yeah when I went to Notre Dame we had it we all had to take theology class. We had a nun
*  Who told us that everything in the Bible is a symbol. It was a symbol. So someone is old. They're just saying that
*  No one lived to be 800 that just means what they have to say is important. Oh
*  Like 72 virgins. Do you know that idea of when you blow yourself up?
*  Yeah, it's not doesn't really mean simple. Yes. It means like a million versions. It's like I'm saying I get a hundred million billion
*  It's like yeah, it's a lot. It's saying that that's an important. Yeah. Yeah, I'm for one belief for tenant and
*  That resonate I understood that and um
*  So that's how I perceive it as far as like it's not a literal thing which kind of makes it kind of cool
*  You know, they were like, yeah
*  Just as an artistic choice cuz like oh cuz like in notebooks
*  Some people were upset that I did some I will go to black and white and then go to color
*  But the reason for doing that is whenever we talked about the past we would go to black and white
*  Oh, and then whenever we talk about the present that's like a dream, right? Yeah, it was like a dream state
*  Yeah, and I thought it was like a cool choice
*  Yeah
*  Exactly, so I just made that choice and because initially I wanted it to all be in black and white
*  But we just we just did it as a run-and-gun thing
*  So we weren't thinking about the lighting and making sure it was and so when we looked at the color footage
*  Like some of it was all over the place too. It was like let's do the black and white for the past and then so it was
*  Good. Yeah. Yeah, cuz color correction is also like expensive. So it was like
*  Let's try to keep the cost down as well. So that's why that was the choice
*  So if you go back, you know smoke one then watch it again, you'll see whenever we talk about anything in the past
*  It's all black and white and back in the color when it's present
*  Do what's it gonna be like going on stage and you haven't gone on stage in a month?
*  Oh my god, I was thinking how weird is that gonna be everybody gonna seem like open micers
*  What's the longest stretch you've ever gone without doing? I can't even I that's a damn
*  Oh, I know I can tell you eight months, but it was one of the really early I bombed so hard
*  But it called me back and I went back up
*  This is a good stretch. I was 19. I was 19 and the next time I went on stage
*  I was 20 and I was funny again and it was back in me
*  Oh good, and that was my that was my one again off again for eight months
*  But as but as a professional the longest I've ever gone I couldn't I would say I
*  Would be lying if I tried to think of I don't know those shows are gonna be lit
*  Do you know crazy the comic store is gonna be when this motherfucker opens up again?
*  Do you know how crazy it's gonna be?
*  Last time I was on here. I broke my phone basically from the text own.com joy
*  Oh, I told you I was gonna try that out man. It was good shit, though
*  And so I still exist. I talked to those people all the time and it's been great beautiful cast is like
*  It's pretty powerful one guy told me the other day he uses my clips
*  To help the morale of his troops and they're like floored me like oh whoa
*  Yeah, man, I've been sending them like I sent them notebooks first and so they got to see it
*  They got to see the trailer first and I was getting feedback and stuff. It was cool people think it's a robot. It's really me
*  I'll be doing that shit man. I'll be talking to you
*  That's nice. But yeah, it was dope man. You know it worked out. Thank you, man
*  Beautiful, but I was gonna set up some dates and then I know yeah, well we talked about I want to go with you
*  People ask me are you coming here with Joe you come here? Yeah, we're gonna do some hopefully when we're allowed to I have a
*  Couple dates booked at the end of the year. I don't even know if they're gonna be able to do them
*  I'm supposed to be at the forum
*  November 1st. Yeah, I don't know. I want to do that one. I don't even know if it's real
*  It's down the street, but I think that the governor has said 20 21 for concerts and shit
*  That makes sense. I don't know and they say it might be like six. It might be people separated
*  I'm gonna be so mad if all you need is vitamin C. I know right
*  I'll be so mad
*  Doctor comes out like ten years from now. It's like all the if everybody just like what he took just four thousand milligrams of vitamin C
*  Yeah, that's all you need. There's no viruses. Hey, you're good four thousand grams of vitamin C and don't be a dick
*  I don't know what stops it like what what can strengthen your immune system and what can't you know, do you know?
*  Yeah, is that real? Well as an expert I would say I would say I don't know about you
*  System cuz that's kind of like your pelvis like you can't strengthen that shit. It's just I think that's true though
*  Your immune system. Oh your music. Yeah
*  It's by oh, yes, I think you're strengthening by you can't strengthen your pelvis like the bones themselves
*  I don't know man. See those dudes do that fuck exercise
*  Strengthen your pelvis listen if she's
*  150 yeah, but if she's like
*  380 so you know, yeah, that's too bad. I can't do it. She's got to give up sugar and carbs, right?
*  I think you shouldn't the immune system by what you put in your body
*  Especially over 40. I think um, like when I was doing raw food, I didn't get sick at all at all
*  Why'd you stop got socially socially is tough. No forgot being sick
*  My boys were teasing me like yo, it take you 48 hours to make a pancake son. I had a dehydrator
*  I had a dehydrator I still have it I dehydrate fruit and stuff for my kids
*  But did you have to when you were doing that? Did you have to in any way?
*  Like supplement your protein were you eating like pino because that's a myth. That's the whole thing
*  It's all in what you choose to believe about protein, but they were like you can get protein from greens
*  so yes, I was certainly can so
*  That was that you can get protein from you just don't get the same amount. No
*  Absorbable but then there's a question of like how much protein do you really need? That's the big debate. Yeah, it's kind of like a big debate
*  Yeah, it's kind of like
*  like with bacon you remember when bacon was like dying and then they somebody came up with make
*  Make it like you have to have it on burgers and they did these campaigns
*  That's what they did then bacon like came like you well
*  They were people weren't really messing with it. Then they well people thought bacon was bad for you for a long time
*  They're like they thought that those fats were bad for you
*  And so like the idea of having bacon is it's delicious, but it's gonna kill you
*  Like everybody gonna have a heart attack choking on that piece of bacon everybody thought that um there was a
*  That dr. Sean Baker that carnivore MD guy he
*  He wrote something about a study. There's something about a study that was released on
*  people who don't eat meat and the correlation between
*  mental disorders and
*  Anger issues and sadness there's some I don't know if I might have made part of that up
*  Something about it like people who just who don't eat meat that have
*  Some mental issues
*  Come on man. That's what it said well people who don't possible they always say
*  You take on can you find that Jamie the stress of the animal? I'm just talking about science
*  Science here. I don't know
*  What people eat and what people believe are very personal things right? Oh, yeah
*  Religion right and politics you want to clear a room yeah, right ain't that crazy, but they didn't used to be
*  The eat part is recent is recent right?
*  Everybody ate everything vegan up until like 30 years ago everybody ate everything yeah
*  Well, but that's because I believe we didn't have to we had a smaller population
*  So to stretch it you don't know like the milk my mom drank is not the same milk that we're drinking
*  So because you got to feed more people more people are drinking milk
*  So that's part of it for sure another part of it is they want to make more money
*  You know they want to be able to make more milk be able to pump it out quicker pump it out quicker
*  I'm gonna tell you man plus when I used to drive all over the country. I never saw two cows fucking ever
*  Always see cows don't see him fucking and everybody eating. I was like that can't all be cow man
*  Take that making enough these motherfuckers. Just be standing around
*  The most ridiculous science like I drove by I never saw anybody fucking it's not real not real earth is flat
*  That's not me to me. Yes meat and mental health a systemic review of
*  absentee depression anxiety and related phobias
*  Yeah, okay the majority studies especially of higher quality studies show that those who avoided meat consumption had significantly higher rates or risk of
*  Depression anxiety and or self-harm behaviors there was mixed evidence for temporal relations
*  But study designs and a lack of rigor but precluded inferences of casual
*  Relations yeah one study does not support meat avoidance as a strategy to benefit psychological health well
*  Yeah, because our study room you beat yourself up
*  You have you do feel guilty if you ever live a whole life of eating meat
*  Then you try not to eat meat and then you go damn, so then you go crazy
*  No, I don't know I don't stand a whole crazy part, but I get you feeling guilty and it's tough
*  That's it's tough to change your diet. Yeah, it's it's not eating that way is not supported. It's starting to get more
*  Supported but eating raw you mean
*  That's not nobody really says that but like eating vegan you mean yeah vegan the whole vegan industry the Beyond Meat world
*  And it's not soy they have pee it's made of pea protein like all of that stuff is like
*  Like this stock went through the roof
*  Yeah, the the thing
*  The thing that freaks me out the most about the animal kingdom is not just that we are able to
*  Justify stuffing as many as we can into a warehouse and yeah and making them shit on top of each other and then eating them and
*  That that's just one crazy thing about it the the other crazy thing about it is what they do to each other
*  Yeah, man. I'm I'm obsessed with
*  Wildlife videos like wildlife videos where animals are eating every day every day I watch a
*  Cheetah take out some kind of a gazelle or a crocodile ate someone's dog
*  I watched the other day in Australia the dog pulled up on this for these people screaming at the top of their lungs and the
*  Crocodile gets their dog snap and just drags them into the water and they are fucking screaming and crying. I am
*  fascinated by the
*  Well, it's we're doing is fucked up for sure yeah, but what they're doing to each other's fucked up, too
*  It's just a different kind of fucked up. They're fucked up as instantaneous right if they need an animal
*  They find it they bite it with their face. They drag it into the water
*  And that's they're fucked up and we just kind of accept that as a part of nature right our fucked up is
*  Weird our fucked up as we figured out metal and boxes and we figured out cages
*  We stuffed that chicken in this fucking little box and make them shit on the other chicken
*  And we figured it out we figured out how to do whatever the fuck we want if you want eggs for a dollar a dozen
*  That's what it's gonna take in order for this company to make any fucking money
*  So they just they figured out how to do it
*  You know when I saw this video it started really making sense to me
*  I saw this video of baboons that were raising puppies
*  Yeah, bro, it's crazy
*  These these baboons that steal these dogs and then keep these puppies
*  They keep them nearby the camp because the puppies will bark whenever things are coming close
*  So they feed them they keep them nearby and they basically have pets
*  So these baboons they need this crazy video these baboons just grab this puppy bites like they're rough with them
*  You know they don't have any idea of compassion right so they don't give a fuck
*  They're banging his puppy off rocks and shit dragging them behind them
*  And then just set them the puppies like trying to get away
*  And it's like sit the fuck down and he gives them some food and the baboons just hanging out with this puppy
*  And then raises it and then uses these dogs that they stole
*  To guard the perimeter
*  Yes, yeah, so animals do weird like why didn't you just eat the puppy right no because you wanted a pet
*  Animals do weird shit, too
*  like the
*  What they're just a bunch of systems that are trying to compete against other systems like the system the deer system versus the mountain
*  Line system the deer system is we just got to keep fucking and keep moving
*  Big things if they fuck too much, and there's too many of them and not enough we're done
*  We got to just keep fucking and keep moving and the mountain lion system is every day
*  I got to kill a deer with my face right every day. I got a fine one
*  I got a sneak up and get close enough
*  This fast-ass thing with swords growing out of his head to grab him by the neck and drag him down into the woods
*  These systems they're all horrific outcomes right predator and prey systems
*  They're all of them are horrific all of them are horrific is just a new kind of horrific
*  We also like outlive all of those other things right oh we outlive the fuck out of them
*  So we know real guilt yeah you kill someone when you're four
*  Do you really even understand what you just did right in your life expectancy is seven right?
*  You really understand four-year-old lion has probably killed a million things
*  Did you watch Tiger King did you watch any of that my wife and I tried to watch it's not
*  We
*  Another time not during the quarantine I need shit to be okay for me to like
*  Enjoy it, but it seemed hilarious cuz they were I opened up
*  But with the with the call saying that that lady's you gonna want to prosecute that lady. Yeah, all right
*  I'm in and just it's just wore me out man. It's way to wear you out. Yeah, it wore me out
*  So I think in when happier times I'd totally be all into that. I'm serious like I literally it's in my queue
*  I'm going back. It's just it's a good show for the apocalypse. Yeah
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, because it represents the folly of human beings what we could be at our most preposterous
*  You know I mean a gay guy who raises tigers marry straight guys
*  They all do math and shoot guns one guy accidentally shoots himself in the head the other guy decides he's not gay
*  What what what this is madness that is a wild-ass show of real people and you you really couldn't make something like that
*  Fake you maybe like the Coen brothers could do it
*  You know the old brother where art thou type deal they could kind of they could kind of create somebody like Joe
*  But it's almost like better because it's real it's real it's better
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, and the other guy runs a sex cult and and then Carol and her husband her husband's dressed up with a rope around his neck
*  He went missing. I hate this guy went missing
*  No big deal, I mean she definitely didn't do it's not like she feeds meat to cats every fucking day
*  He was worth millions whatever whatever
*  I don't know where he is Carol fucking baskin. Yeah, god damn. What a show
*  Do you think you can marry somebody whose first husband went missing? Oh my god
*  Do you think we sign up for that well the kind of guy that would be into that there's some guys that would be into that
*  They're similar to like girls who like get into serial killers. Oh
*  Right, there's girls that are really they like email serial killers and they're in love with them. They want to marry them
*  Oh after the court. Oh, yeah
*  Yes, I'm out like right like no they prime out there I think there's a weird
*  Obsession with it's a small percentage of the people I've
*  I've got high and thought about this. Yes, I think it has to do thinking about it for the first time now
*  What I with back in the day if you were a murderer if you were like and if you could befriend a
*  Murderer like you would you would be more protected. Oh, that's interesting
*  Yeah, is you know someone who is done it before they won't walk out of something we need to
*  Well, that's what women are I think a lot of women are really terrified of is if
*  Confronted with real adversity. How will their man hold up?
*  I give you're a woman are you weigh 90 pounds and you have a husband that's
*  Twice your size like literally a hundred and eighty pound human
*  That happens all the time but if he's a bitch and he folds and
*  You're like left there like oh my god
*  Like no one's gonna stop anything from happening to me or stop anything from saying rude things to me and fuck
*  You're not protected and this mean people out there, right?
*  If you're a woman he's stumbling to some mean people that are saying rude
*  Lured shit to you and no one's there to protect you and you gotta walk back to your car and you're wondering holy fuck
*  You know that sounds like a fun game show did you marry a bitch
*  Husband we'd be causing a lot of divorces
*  We don't just dudes out there that don't even know that they're bitches
*  Because they haven't really been tested. They don't know that's true. And I think
*  Most people believe they're gonna do way better than they will
*  In real times of struggle
*  I think most people believe they're gonna do way better than they actually will because when you actually
*  That boxing ring in the club everybody thought they could
*  But that's a different thing right? That's like a guy with technique
*  Yeah, if you got a guy with technique in front of you and you don't know how to box you're fucked
*  You got like a few seconds to get lucky as you charge
*  Maybe you might clinch and throw a punch that connects and hurt him. It's possible. Maybe maybe but it's not very likely
*  It's more likely you're gonna get boxed up yeah
*  Yeah, and jujitsu is even worse and jujitsu. It's a hundred percent because you there's no lucky shots. You have a break a bone
*  Practicing yeah, I broke my foot my rib my hand
*  My nose is destroyed. Yeah, I broke my nose so many times
*  That my nose was useless
*  It was useless. It didn't work. I only had like one quarter of one nostril that was open and I had a nasally tone to me
*  I didn't realize I was listening to an watching an old fear factor once other than my horrifying choice of wardrobe and
*  Inescapable accent that I still had I
*  Was how nasally my voice was because I couldn't breathe out of my nose. It was useless
*  Broke, so rib had two ACL surgeries
*  Two ACLs. Yeah, I blew out both knees
*  That's that's it though. That's not too bad
*  when you
*  Would you do like jujitsu and
*  Particularly like most people just accept the fact that there's a possibility of injury
*  It's like it could happen. You could go a year without getting injured or right. It's not like
*  Going and taking a yoga class where you're probably pretty safe
*  It's too much random wild shits happening where people are trying to kill each other
*  But I was gonna sign up for jujitsu you'd be great at it what I you're so big how tall are you six five long-ass arms
*  Do you choke the fuck out of people all the leverage? Yeah. Yeah the leverage from your arms and your legs. It'd be so spectacular
*  How would it transform me as a human? Oh, you would lose a lot of weight and you would shit ton of confidence
*  Yeah, you would just have to go about it very
*  Technically the thing that I when I started I was I was younger and dumber and I went at it like
*  Aggressively like I went at other martial arts when I was younger
*  I just wanted to do them as hard as I could as fast I could what you just do really it's about technique
*  And the more strength you have one of the problems is you could substitute
*  Technique for that strength like the best jujitsu players the guys to learn from the best are the guys who are small humans
*  They're smaller people like Eddie Bravo is a smaller guy
*  It's one of the reasons why such a great instructor Hoyler Gracie is another famous super technical jujitsu guy
*  Who's a smaller guy?
*  There's like a series of guys like that all all over the country and Jeff Glover is another one these smaller guys
*  Because they're smaller they have to rely on this spectacular technique. So you learn from them
*  So you never really want to rely on your strength? It's it's it it'll stop you from getting better in fact
*  It'll stop you from achieving like the perfect the right technical level
*  So you just keep getting better and better at it
*  And then when you get to a certain point
*  Like if you're gonna fight with a guy like a wild fight and the guy if a guy just knows how to throw a punch
*  And he's fast and he's a strong guy. He might punch you and he might fuck you up. It might happen
*  It can't happen whenever you're throwing knuckles with people especially in a chaotic environment. It's it's possible. Here's what's not possible
*  I don't care who you you don't know how to grapple at all and someone like hoist Gracie clenches you and drags you to the ground
*  You're a fucksville. You're fucksville
*  100% of the times 100 1 0 0 your fucksville your fucksville
*  He's gonna choke you a hundred percent of the time and he'll do that to people that know jujitsu
*  So when you get to a point like a guy like Hicks and Gracie or my instructor John Jock Machado
*  He can do that to people that are experts in jujitsu. So there's like so many levels
*  It's a crazy thing to learn and you're built for it man being so tall and long
*  Yeah, also you're a smart dude who like you say you like economics. He's like figure. Well if this happens and that yeah
*  Yeah, that's the same jujitsu is just like that. Yeah, Hells and Gracie was another famous jujitsu practitioner
*  He was asked to describe jujitsu and he's like I'm gonna paraphrase this I might fuck it up
*  He said he said it was basically like I move and then you move and then I move and then you move
*  forever forever
*  That was a description of jujitsu
*  So if you realize how good Hellsend is that it becomes a terrifying
*  Expression because it's like eventually I'm gonna get you bitch. Yes, you're gonna fuck up. You're gonna get tired
*  You're gonna be using too much strength and you're gonna get exhausted
*  Just like those boxers that were throwing punches and they get tired and the other guy would piece them up
*  But it's gonna be even more horrific because you're never gonna be able to accomplish anything
*  You're just gonna slowly wear out
*  The guy's just gonna keep attacking you and you keep pushing them off you and he's gonna keep attacking you and you keep
*  Exploding and he's gonna keep attacking you and eventually you're gonna get tired and then he's just gonna dominate you
*  He's just gonna control you
*  You'd be great at it, dude. Yeah, be good for you. Yeah, it'd be really good for you
*  Would I have to be in there with kids when I first start like
*  Getting all tacked up they're gonna put you out. Here's how strong jujitsu is there was a woman named she still exists
*  Her name is Felicia. Oh, she's a friend of mine. She's a black belt from John John Machado's
*  she's super technical and she weighs Felicia is very strong, but she weighs about maybe 135 pounds and
*  There was a guy named Seymour Butts and Seymour Butts was a porn star who had a TV show on Showtime
*  And he had this idea pretty bold of him
*  Really? He's brave to do this. He just decided I'm gonna do like a
*  Jiu-jitsu match well, I've never taken you just before but I'm gonna spar with a woman and see what happens and this girl just
*  But she it was she's a leap man. She's really good. She's really good. Yeah, she teaches people
*  She also works for the California State Athletic Commission. So I get to see her at UFC events oftentimes when they're in California
*  She's awesome, but she's super technical. So this guy has he was doomed. He just didn't know he was a guy
*  He's in really good shape. He's young and fit and pretty good body. She's bitch
*  Just choking on its leg lock in home and I don't know what she did
*  Do I remember how many times she tapped him and what she did it with but it was like arm bars and triangles
*  But again that would happen to any man who didn't know anything and went with her. So even though she's a woman
*  Just the technical expertise it overcomes strength it's
*  So for a guy like you who's a very cerebral person who likes these sort of puzzles and figures things out
*  It's one of the reasons why your comedy is so good
*  You're an excellent at like economy of words and setting things up in a mysterious way and then drop him punch lines
*  That's jujitsu. It's they're similar. I like that. I think there's a lot of things like that in this life. They're similar
*  There's little things that you you learn like little
*  Ways to move around things that advance through these these games and systems and you can apply that to all these other different things
*  Yes, and you can apply it even to comedy. Yeah, that's what I was I was just thinking like we were talking about
*  another approach
*  But that's that's that's what I got from notebooks to just how everybody approaches
*  We have the same goal to make somebody laugh, but we approach it differently
*  Yeah, something that's so enticing to me like how everyone approaches the craft in their own way
*  I was super awkward when I first started out because I didn't have any background really in anything performing arts related or even music
*  Yeah, you know
*  So I was super awkward and how to how to present myself and how to dress and yeah how to act and yeah
*  Yeah, cuz people who have knowledge of that they do have a different
*  Level of execution yeah, and and and like I know people who can sing they say things in like a more memorable way
*  Like you were just remember it, but they're not technically trying to sing. Yeah, you know
*  Like you remember their phrases or their hooks or whatever it is, you know, because this is like a musicality to their performance. Mm-hmm
*  You just you know, that's a thing you figure out too. Yeah, is that it's not just and this is something with podcasts
*  I think as well, it's not just the words
*  There's something to how you say the words and some people are not good at that
*  And you don't think of it as being an important part of the you kind of ignore it because you're concentrating on writing or you're concentrating on
*  Whatever your look but there's a there's a thing in how you say the words that gets into people's brains better
*  Yes, then if you're clunky, you know, and you I've been clunky
*  We've all been clunky when you listen to old recordings, you know, there's moments we like
*  What's it's a lot of times because you're trying to figure out the best way to do it on the spot in real life
*  And that shit takes especially with a complicated bit. It should take a long time to work out the details
*  Yeah, especially yeah the more personal you are too. Yeah, but when you get it is nothing
*  Do that get it I don't want to say this bit either I'm telling your bit but your bit about your son
*  Adopted a white kid is a fucking it's one of those bits where you just go
*  Goddamn, like when someone builds a beautiful house, you just go. Oh
*  Shit, look at that Wow
*  We got to do something with it man
*  When when when everything gets rolling again, I think we all need to realize like hey you can't wait for shit
*  No, cuz this can happen now that we know that this could happen. He doesn't even feel real. Here we are
*  We know it's real. Right? Right. We know it's real. We know you just got an antibody test
*  We know we can't really go anywhere. We can't go to restaurants. Everything's closed. No comedy
*  We know it's real, but it still doesn't feel real
*  That's how weird life is. Yeah
*  In the moment, baby, you don't know what's next. You don't know what's next in the moment in the moment
*  Welcome to in the moment with Owen and Joe welcome
*  Exist through funding. So please contact our website
*  Funding the moment into the moment. There's a that's a style of
*  Radio that you would get I was when I was delivering newspapers. I would listen to all things. I think was all things
*  Yeah, I think was something on NPR and national public radio and they were so calm. Yeah the way they would talk
*  Yeah, so calm. I don't know if it was all things consider if I listen to that later
*  I feel like that was way later, but it was a whatever it's considered. Yeah, whatever those old school
*  type of
*  Talk radio
*  That's when I knew I was ready to get married when I like listening to talk radio
*  When I want to hear people talk I'm ready for a wife bro
*  Nobody gets more riled up than white dudes who listen to conservative talk radio
*  Oh
*  Michael Savage fans those kind of guys rush limbaugh. There's something about
*  How did that happen? Let's think about how that happened. Like how did that?
*  How did that one?
*  Yeah, that
*  hardcore
*  right-wing
*  Like we did that come real angry. It's like a radio. It's like all
*  Like alt radio, yeah
*  It's like a genre of music like, you know how there's like hardcore rap. Yeah, there's metal
*  Yeah, you know, there's like just right wing talk. Yeah, it's like
*  Right it kind of is and left wing talk to like NPR here welcome welcome to our show
*  Yeah, we're gonna tell you about a new scientific experiment that shows that there are no such thing as genders
*  And
*  Their right wing gender is a construct
*  Yeah, there's a way that they talk there's a calmness to the way they explain things and lay things out to make you seem
*  Like there's no ambiguity. There's no question whether or not they're right. Yeah, and here's why
*  And then they always ask for money yes coronavirus did not come from a lab
*  It's a dangerous conspiracy and here's why we talked to and they always have an expert. Are you sure?
*  I like it man
*  I'm into it. I'm into it cuz I grew up listening to my favorite is like hip-hop stations cuz they're always very excited
*  Right put your hands up like all right, and I love that energy, too
*  But then you get to age like I just wanted some people just talking just talk normal voice. Yeah, just talk normal quiet
*  I want to fuck you voice. That's what that really is. I want to fuck your voice, but I'm I'm low-key about it
*  Hello. Yes. Hello. Yes. I love wine
*  Want to show it I would do if I had to show an PR would you do it what I do I'd be gassed
*  Yeah, we're talking to Joe Rogan and I would purposely do like an onion version of NPR. I love it man because
*  I'm a sucker. I'm all it all animals are equal. Yeah. Oh, we've talked to some animals
*  We feel like they're all equal. I do want to do a
*  Parody of an NPR show cuz they cuz they cuz now they play like dramatic music and shit
*  When they tell stories like and you'll be listening to it and then I'm like and then no no I'm confusing with the daily
*  Lab and NPR show is radio lab put together by NPR
*  Daily his show man. They play that dramatic music. Oh, yeah, and then Trump
*  Just told me about the daily she said she's posted something's great here are three things you need to know what's up WNYC
*  Alright
*  WNYC was the radio station of news radio
*  When I was on that news radio sitcom New York Public Radio, so it's not national public radio. Mmm
*  So it's not NPR, but it's something like that. It's some kind of public radio cousins. Yeah, that's that's a great show
*  You ever listen to radio lab. No, holy shit
*  I said I get angry at Brian count because you would tell me something as if he had like gotten it from a book
*  I listen to that same radio lab
*  Try to hit me with some scientific facts about what happened in World War two I go I listen to radio lab to bitch stop
*  Damn it. Yeah, I go Brian. Why are you pretending you read right pretend to be smart?
*  Yeah, I say read and I really mean listen right on the books. Yeah, I was wondering I was gonna ask you that
*  Can you say that technically I do a lie. It's a lie. It's a dirty lies in there
*  I read this book. I never cracked a fucking page
*  This is the book on Charles Manson the CIA this guy Tom O'Neill. Yeah. Yeah, I had him on the podcast last week, bro
*  This guy spent 20 years researching this book 20 years 20. It's
*  It's the craziest story just of how the book got created, but the story itself is bonkers
*  They think that Charles Manson was a CIA asset and that they had let him
*  Get away with being released from parole being he was on parole and he got arrested
*  They just let him out of jail like multiple times and they had
*  This the same LSD studies that they were running and hate Ashbury in San Francisco
*  He went to that same clinic the people that did mind control
*  That were a part of MK ultra that were feeding people LSD and trying to control their mind and manipulate their psychology
*  They were all connected to him and they kept letting him go they want they were studying him
*  They wanted to see they wanted to diminish the hippie movement and they want to study what it's like when you get some fucking
*  Mad man who spent half of his life in penitentiary and you give him a ton of LSD and then fuck all the hippies
*  He wants holy shit, dude
*  It's a nutty book man
*  It is nutty and he details it all like stuff
*  He's there's more than 50 pages of references at the end of this book citations and references. It's all like heavily documented
*  It's crazy
*  That one fuck you up Jamie that one fuck thing to the book. I'm on chapter
*  11 12 I think just got through all the MPL to stuff Jesus Christ. It's crazy
*  Did you get through the one where he was discussing about the guy who they think they fed?
*  LSD to and programmed him to go kill that kid. Oh, did you get that when he talked about it on the podcast?
*  I might have been I might be right there. Yeah
*  Some of those that stuff now dude, that's crazy they did all kinds of experiments on people in the 60s and 70s
*  They just tried shit on people man
*  Well, we were showing a video of
*  These British soldiers from 1964
*  Yeah
*  They they gave acid to and they were just let them run around the field with fucking guns and they're laughing and falling down and giggling
*  And you can watch the video. There's a video. It's online
*  I
*  Fuck with acid I have yeah, I mean, but I'm not taking it with a gun
*  No with a bunch of other troops. No, not only that like you're relying on those guys to keep it together on acid
*  How good is this Mike Tyson weed it's amazing this is the stone Owen Smith look at you I know man
*  I'm stoned on the internet, baby
*  It's legal it's legal. We're in we're in California. Oh my god, it's crazy. I just thought of my mom watching this. Oh
*  No, tell you not breaking the law. It's the same as having whiskey. Isn't it funny? It's like the whiskey part. No problem, right?
*  Soon as you bust out the weed like what are they doing really good? It's really good
*  So what's your estimation of when we're gonna get out of this if you had to guess next year next year
*  Because I think it's gonna be out and then the resurgence. Mm-hmm. Be a second wave. Yeah. Yeah next year. I feel like
*  This time next year that dude who said we have all been vaccinated. Yeah, what's that mean?
*  I wish I knew was he talking about I wish I knew he was joking around or not. I mean he might have been
*  I'm pretty adamant that he wasn't but I'm an idiot
*  He might have been joking around it didn't sound like he was
*  Around just like he had a command of it and it didn't sound like he was joking around
*  But I don't know that dude's personality right that might be that thing that he does
*  You know me like Callum does a lot of that
*  Say jokes that sound like statements. He does that all the time
*  You know, there's a funny. Oh
*  I don't know
*  I mean
*  Like you said though too because like what's next, you know, is there gonna be a gap between what this is and what's next? Yeah
*  Provided that there is nothing next. I feel like next year just because we'd even know how they're talking about how
*  You can go to concerts, but you're still up to six six feet apart
*  right and
*  That's not gonna stop about the end of this year
*  Something
*  Or some sort of a really really efficient treatment right like some sort of yeah, yeah and and but I do think it I
*  Mean they're hinting at saying it helps if you're healthier if you do work out and all the things that we as a collective
*  Society should have been doing right now may start to take precedence. So
*  but I feel like
*  as far as what our
*  Livelihood is concerned about
*  Performing in front of people again. I feel like next year because it's two-sided
*  It's us wanting to be on stage and then the audience from the safe being Jesus
*  Next year, I think how many people gonna fall apart
*  How are comments gonna make a living like guys who are doing the road like middle acts? It's a great question. I know
*  Like we don't know yet right now. Everybody's sort of floating right? Yeah, it's a bit a month and everybody's like whoa
*  Yeah, everyone's just sort of floating like what what happens those people that were they had a system they were doing good
*  Then all sudden the rug gets pulled out from under them
*  Jesus thought if I got you high you'd have all the answers. I do have I have some answers
*  But what they need to do brother Joe
*  Yeah, I think they
*  Sector checking it you can I
*  Don't know man people have you ever been contacted about doing anything online being funny online those things are preposterous I
*  Said I want to donate I want to donate I'll give you money. I know they're trying to raise money. I'll just give you money
*  Yeah
*  Just clusterfuck. I'd love to do a show once we were back. I'll do shows for free
*  I'd be happy to do that. Yeah, be happy to do a bunch of shows
*  I want to be able as well as I like donate. I heard yeah
*  I'd love to be able to if someone had a problem. I'd love to be able to
*  Sell out the Comedy Store and yeah, give them that money. Yes. It's a nice feeling too. Cuz it's like there's shows that you do
*  Where you it benefits people? There's an extra nice feeling so you get the nice feeling of the show
*  Yeah, doing your bits the bits make everybody laugh
*  Yeah, all that nice feeling and then you get the nice feeling of that all went to a good thing
*  Feels great man
*  Charity shows are like my favorite shows because of this the way they make you feel. Yeah, like this is cool
*  We all got together made some money for this charity and had fun and then it helps the money goes to a good cause
*  Yeah, we should do a lot of those men. I'm down. I'm down to do them all the time
*  Yeah, we should do them. I should probably figure out one to do a week once we get cracking again
*  Yeah, and just do one a week. That's just a benefit for for something. We'll figure something out
*  The day I can sell out something off my name
*  That's not gonna be far as soon as people see you're in a weird position man
*  We have this incredible act, but people don't know
*  It's it's a sneaky thing because once you pop the hardest part is being funny like you've got that
*  Yeah, it's like you just spent so much time writing, you know
*  Yeah, well you spent so much time where you're in the machine and not just fully dedicated
*  Out there as a comic what if somebody wants to?
*  What if a network wants to pick up notebooks should I do it or should I stay on YouTube?
*  If they want to give you money do it
*  As long as there's enough money, but you could definitely
*  Do whatever you want if it's on YouTube and it should probably make some money
*  Once people become more aware of it and people start downloading a lot of them. They're funny man
*  It's like it's also everybody's got something
*  From when they started and everyone can and it's good for people to see that
*  You know people that you see with like our full Netflix special now at one point time were terrible
*  Garbage it's garbage, but that's how you get better at it. You've got to keep doing it and there's no other way around it
*  That's one of the things that I like about it is in a lot of ways comedies are real
*  Meritocracy yes, I give people laugh if they enjoy your stuff
*  Then it works and then it continues and you keep people keep coming to your shows and you keep having fun
*  Yeah, there's a reward to that kind of a thing
*  Especially when you don't have any collaborators just putting it together yourself. Yeah
*  But now we'll appreciate it more. Yeah, that's very true
*  I just hope that clubs will be here when everything's said and done, you know, that's the real scary thing
*  It's how many of these businesses are gonna go under?
*  Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's plan on doing a lot of free shows
*  All right, let's wrap it up man always brother always come Oh Owen Smith TV
*  Subscribe shows called the notebooks notebooks. No ladies. It's not like that
*  You can't even take that name
*  Yeah, what is your all your Instagram text Owen calm to text me literally and then Owen Smith for real
