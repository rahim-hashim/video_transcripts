*  And by the way don't you find some of their stuff to just be plain weird?
*  Yes!
*  Well Donald.
*  I do hope you'll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage.
*  Because as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face.
*  They knew it was coming.
*  It's coming.
*  She nailed it.
*  Yeah, she nailed that.
*  She nailed that.
*  That alone can get you the president.
*  This is where we're at, idiocracy.
*  That alone, like she, that is very-
*  Get a couple bigger soundbites, right?
*  You can't say that's not outstanding.
*  Totally.
*  She just crushed it.
*  She crushed it.
*  She had the big moment-
*  Oh, I'm tuning in.
*  This is pay-per-view now.
*  She had the big moment and she crushed it.
*  And she did it without any ums or stammers, no fucking missed words.
*  She had a smile.
*  The laugh made sense.
*  Made sense there.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  For the first time.
*  It was in context.
*  She laughed so I got a nerve, it seems like.
*  Just tried to get everybody to feel lighter about the situation.
*  But that wasn't that one.
*  That was like a genuine, just genuine smile and a laugh.
*  Crushed it.
*  That's a problem.
*  That's a problem.
*  And I don't think they thought she was going to be able to do that.
*  That's the thing.
*  You can fucking coach somebody, bro.
*  It ain't hard.
*  I mean, maybe she just practiced.
*  Who are these coaches?
*  There's public speakers and stuff?
*  Oh yeah, public speaking coaches.
*  Yeah, there's political speech analysts.
*  There's people that-
*  Imagine if there's comedians.
*  Imagine if David Lucas gets hired to give her some one-liners.
*  Listen.
*  I mean, there's a crazy world where there's shit like that, where somebody goes, you need
*  a couple zingers in your back pocket.
*  I don't know.
*  100%.
*  Because if that's not your world and your brain doesn't operate like that, Trump's does.
*  Trump is looking at like, you know, to make a little put down or he's just quick in that
*  way.
*  Listen, he is quick in that way.
*  Also, it would behoove him to hire a few great comics to just tour with them and just write
*  one-liners about all these different fucking people.
*  If he could remember them, I mean, I know he likes to go off his own head, but if he
*  could remember a few Hinchcliffe bangers, if he hires Hinchcliffe to take him on the
*  road.
*  Do you know how fucking insane that would be?
*  Yeah, dude.
*  Hinchcliffe writing bangers for Trump to shit on people with.
*  Comedy cures and it also is like sometimes what kind of just pushes things over the top.
*  The thing you're getting from him is you know no one is coaching him, right?
*  You know he's going off the cuff.
*  You know he's, nobody gets to tell him what to do.
*  He goes out there and he tells him everything.
*  It's like he's just off the cuff, off the cuff and that's why it gets sideways sometimes.
*  You know it gets a little fumbly sometimes.
*  But what I'm saying is that what she did was like a pro.
*  She did that like a pro.
*  That's where it gets dangerous.
*  You don't think that was calculated?
*  You think that was off the cuff, like just responding to what was?
*  Hers?
*  No, that was a 100% planned out thing.
*  100% and well executed.
*  Like she fucking nailed it.
*  The problem is that's what we're looking for.
*  It's not even necessarily who has the best policies for the country.
*  It's not necessarily who's going to make real reform, who's really going to change things
*  and make it better for everybody versus who looks like the kind of person who should be
*  president.
*  Who's talking like a leader.
*  Who's got the whole audit.
*  Say it to my face.
*  And the whole is like, bro.
*  What if that becomes her catchphrase?
*  That's on Mike Drop.
*  That's on Mike Drop.
*  You're going around to every country.
*  I mean, that's your there's going to be those t-shirts.
*  That's your I, Caramba, if you're Bart Simpson.
*  Well, that's a bit of a problem is that she does repeat the same speeches over and over
*  and over again in these speeches.
*  So they have all these compilations of her saying things in the exact same order.
*  You got to mix it up.
*  But this is the thing that they like about Trump is that he does not do that.
*  When Trump goes up there, he is more than capable of talking for an hour and a half
*  straight, be entertaining.
*  He cracks on things.
*  Says funny things like he was joking around about Biden wandering around, not knowing
*  where he is.
*  It was hilarious.
*  It was like he was a comic.
*  He was killing.
*  And I guarantee you, he probably had an idea in his head that he's going to shit on Biden.
*  Probably had an idea how he's going to do it.
*  But that's like just being a free baller.
*  Yeah.
*  You're up there free ball.
*  He's the only one that can do that.
*  People do respond to that, too.
*  Everybody does, like you said, want to look at somebody and go, oh, they represent us.
*  Well, the same way like if you have a agent or manager, right, you want them if they're
*  out in public, you go, oh, do they are they an extension of me in a certain way?
*  So we you want to see the best at it?
*  Yeah. Clinton.
*  Clinton, when he was running for president the first time, bro, put on a clinic, tell
*  you something, dude, he's the fucking Michael Jordan of those motherfuckers.
*  I can't argue with that.
*  Old school titty grabber from the people I called tits bazoombas.
*  You know, he was an animal and play the sax on our studio.
*  Guy smooth talked.
*  Better than and he was like, that's the president.
*  Yeah, you hear him talk.
*  You're like, that's our guy.
*  Exactly right.
*  Listen to this motherfucker talk.
*  Oh, let me just get a speech when he was this is when he's the president.
*  We've never seen that.
*  He's the president.
*  He's playing saxophone.
*  Give me a little bit of that.
*  Let me hear it.
*  Sling and dick before the Internet.
*  I mean, up until this point, we'd seen footage of like Nixon playing go fish.
*  There was no cool president doing.
*  No, he was the coolest ever.
*  You know, people who lost their jobs, lost their homes.
*  Well, I've been governor of a small state for 12 years.
*  I'll tell you how it's affected me.
*  Every year, Congress and the president sign laws that makes us make us do more things
*  and gives us less money to do it with.
*  I see people in my state, middle class people, their taxes have gone up in Washington and
*  their services have gone down while the wealthy have gotten tax cuts.
*  I have seen what's happened in this last four years when in my state, when people lose their
*  jobs, there's a good chance I'll know them by their names.
*  When a factory closes, I know the people who ran it.
*  When the businesses go bankrupt, I know them.
*  And I've been out here for 13 months meeting in meetings just like this ever since October
*  with people like you all over America, people that have lost their jobs, lost their livelihood,
*  lost their health insurance.
*  What I want you to understand is the national debt is not the only cause of that.
*  It is because America has not invested in its people.
*  It is because we have not grown.
*  It is because we've had 12 years of trickle-down economics.
*  We've gone from first to 12th in the world in wages.
*  We've had four years where we produced no private sector jobs.
*  Most people are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago.
*  It is because we are in the grip of a failed economic theory.
*  And this decision you're about to make better be about what kind of economic theory you
*  want, not just people saying, I'm going to go fix it, but what are we going to do?
*  I think we have to do is invest in American jobs, American education, control American
*  health care costs and bring the American people together again.
*  Okay, stop.
*  If that guy runs right now, he wins.
*  That guy runs right now, he fucking blows everybody out of the water.
*  Easy listening voice.
*  The Democrats come home with like every fucking state.
*  That guy wins.
*  Can you do that?
*  I don't know.
*  He can't jump back in, right?
*  No, no, he can't.
*  Once you did two.
*  He's not the same guy anymore.
*  He's not the same guy anymore.
*  He doesn't have the energy anymore.
*  But you're saying this type of guy.
*  He's had a bunch of scandals.
*  That guy, if you could go back in a time machine and grab that Bill Clinton and run him today,
*  he wins.
*  And it makes sense.
*  What if there was a younger son, Clinton, that was a spitting image of Bill and Monica
*  Lewinsky was the running mate?
*  Is there ever a world or is that too in the simulation?
*  It's too in the simulation.
*  That would be too strange.
*  Be too strange.
*  Yeah.
*  But what if she came out and her policies were great and she had a say to my face, but
*  she goes and she made jokes about like, and you know, we're going to swallow the competition
*  or I don't know.
*  Well, the problem was she didn't swallow.
*  Right.
*  That's all I got on the dress.
*  Oh, that's right.
*  Yeah.
*  We'll clean up all the mess.
*  Well, maybe just we'll clean up every dress and mess.
*  I don't know.
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe she just wanted to keep it.
*  Yeah.
*  This is just a soft pitch.
*  I didn't say this was a great idea.
*  No, it's I see where you're going with it, though.
*  It's nuts that that's what we used to get for choices.
*  Yeah.
*  Like they made sense.
*  When you saw Arnold in the mix, because I feel like at least for me, that was because
*  I was, you know, around obviously for the Reagan stuff.
*  But like to the Arnold was my first taste of like, oh, anybody can do, you know what
*  I'm saying?
*  Well, that was Ronald Reagan when he became president.
*  Right.
*  I mean, it doesn't make sense to us.
*  But if you were someone who grew up during that time and he was a movie star, it's like,
*  you know, Dennis Quaid being the president.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's playing Reagan.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Same gal that did his makeup does my Phil stuff.
*  Oh, that's why she's a go.
*  Jen Aspino.
*  It's just like, you know, the world has gotten real weird, man.
*  It's real weird when we know what the trick is.
*  Everybody's talking about the trick.
*  I mean, there's all these videos of Kamala off script.
*  She doesn't talk nearly as clearly.
*  It's not.
*  Well, but if you could just keep her on that script and focus everything else.
*  Now you just you're still running the show.
*  Yeah.
*  You're still running the show just like you were for the last four years.
*  Because like, no one even talks about Biden anymore.
*  Yeah.
*  You don't you don't even care that he's still the president.
*  Don't even know what he's doing.
*  Quite a few months.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's August kids, September, October, November, December.
*  No president.
*  No president.
*  And also, how bad does he deteriorate between now and then?
*  Because clearly that man is at the end of a long road.
*  The presidency took its toll on him, I think.
*  It takes its toll on everybody because he is quicker than him.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, everybody.
*  Trump just kind of.
*  He seemed fine.
*  He seemed fine.
*  Four years didn't age him at all.
*  Yeah. Wild.
*  Wild.
*  The dude's just water off the duck's back.
*  Well, you look at LeBron, he's fucking playing 20 plus years.
*  Some people just got a little extra juice.
*  Yeah, but LeBron spends millions of dollars on his body.
*  He's never been out of shape.
*  You know, he's constantly.
*  Trump and LeBron don't spend the same amount of money on their bodies?
*  A little different.
*  You really can't compare the two.
*  Also, it's not like the NBA ages you like that.
*  No, it's the stress of knowing you could start a fucking nuclear war.
*  The economy rides on you.
*  Why would you want that stress?
*  Running for president seems like the craziest thing to.
*  Even just the campaigning, you see when people drop out after four, five, six, seven, eight months.
*  I'm like, God, what do you do now?
*  Like, is that withdrawal or even that come down?
*  It's like a shroom come down where you're like, fuck, now you're questioning everything
*  because you're like you put everything into it.
*  But then is there a weird like, fuck, I didn't have enough to even get close?
*  Or do you just go, all right, I gave it a shot and it wasn't my time?
*  Fucking, I mean, depends entirely on the individual.
*  Yeah, I think it's just people just getting fed up that want to throw theirself into that crazy race.
*  But that thing is nuts.
*  You never had any of that, right?
*  Like through any part of your once you even like, you know, that's wild.
*  That's a different type of there's a being wanting to be on stage and make people laugh
*  because my buddy might say this to me just about, you know, as we were talking about,
*  you know, actors, whoever running for president.
*  And he was like, oh, it'd be great if there was a comedian that ran.
*  And I'm like, yeah, but we don't that's not our Al Franken probably could have run.
*  Yeah, we could have run. Yeah.
*  And he probably could have won. Yeah.
*  He's he's a really interesting guy.
*  He just got fucked. Yeah.
*  Was it that picture? Yeah. Yeah.
*  There was a picture he was trying to be funny and it wasn't funny.
*  And it's just unfortunately, wrong place, wrong time, wrong hands, wrong groups.
*  To be a comedian, trying to be funny. You know.
*  Oh, wait, real quick. I just had a thought.
*  When Dice came out and did his because I wanted that.
*  That first of all, talking to him about being back in the garden,
*  you're just you're just saying just being funny or whatever.
*  And I watching him do his hickory dickory joke at the garden again was wild, dude.
*  Yeah. And hearing him talk about being back there was so that that's a
*  there's so many small things in between the entire garden experience that I was like,
*  I want to not ever forget this because seeing him even just be there,
*  I was like, that's crazy.
*  Well, Dice was kind of on the outs with the comedy community.
*  It was to me, it was the dumbest thing I'd ever seen.
*  It was real weird because he did MTV
*  and he got banned for life from MTV for telling jokes.
*  I forget what the jokes are in the poly area or no.
*  Yeah, I was kind of around that time, maybe a little after Polly was off of MTV.
*  But he had these jokes.
*  I forget even what he was joking about, like their bonds and something.
*  No, you know, I don't even know what the fuck he was joking around about.
*  It was perfect.
*  But it was Andrew Dice Clay.
*  You asked the dirtiest comedian of all time to do a set.
*  Yeah. And then you got mad when he does the kind of jokes that Andrew Dice Clay does.
*  Right. Do you even fucking watch his shit?
*  No, I probably watch Dice Rules.
*  They heard he was popular and they just were like, get the guy.
*  I don't know what the fuck they thought.
*  If they thought he was going to do something different because he was on MTV.
*  I don't know what they thought. But anyway, they banned him for life.
*  And there was a lot of comedians that came out against him.
*  A lot of comedians said that they thought his act was sexist and racist.
*  And yeah, it was like, but it was a character.
*  He was like, there's a man, his name is Andrew Silverstein.
*  And then there's this character, Andrew Dice Clay.
*  And the whole idea was like that some stupid people like him.
*  Stupid people like a lot of things, but smart people like him, too.
*  Totally. Because it's jokes.
*  He's being hilarious, saying the most ridiculous shit.
*  And for whatever fucking reason, he was on the outs.
*  He wasn't respected by a lot of comedians.
*  It was real weird. It was disrespected.
*  And it's like, I get it if you don't like that kind of comedy.
*  But it's like, who are you to decide what's good?
*  I don't think that way, but I think it's funny when people say things that way.
*  Yeah, like I'm not really mad at Billy Joel.
*  I think he's awesome. Yeah.
*  But when Holtzman was shitting on Billy Joel, I loved it.
*  Couldn't get enough. It was amazing.
*  It was funny. Nobody shits on Billy Joel.
*  So it was like, yeah, that's also why it's funny.
*  Like every you got to hit him and hug him, dude.
*  Everybody has to be fucked with. I'm sorry.
*  You know, and there's loving degrees, obviously, like, you know, somebody's.
*  I don't know. Again, like jokes.
*  There's there's I mean, some of the jokes I've had with friends
*  who have been really bad hospital bedridden and like that's changed
*  their entire outlook on stuff like, you know, like you got to be able to joke
*  around. Yeah, dude. It's a real superpower.
*  It's it's really I mean, even some from some of this first stuff,
*  which is so silly, dude, some of these messages like messages I get are wild
*  about people. This kid I met in Jersey, she's in the stress factory.
*  You ever do this all the time?
*  Vinny Brand. Yeah, sure.
*  So I'm doing these shows and this kid comes up and he's like,
*  my mom has cancer. I was four months to live.
*  We've been watching your Phil stuff is all that she wants to watch
*  and it makes her smile.
*  So that's our thing now.
*  And he starts bawling and I got all choked up.
*  And it was like just more and more of that happened the last few years.
*  And not just that stuff, just to comedy is medicine.
*  It's wild, Joe. It's medicine.
*  It really is. Yeah, it's medicine for people because I think we get so.
*  And I know I'm guilty of this like like a lot of us.
*  When you're getting going, you're so you're thinking, you know,
*  yeah, about the show and making people laugh and I'm present and I'm
*  and afterwards chatting with people and taking it in.
*  But those now that we have this opportunity to receive messages like that
*  or hear it live in the face like that is it's wild.
*  I know it's amazing. Yeah, it really is.
*  And it makes me so even more lucky to like be a part of it.
*  And you look at some like Kill Tony, it's like having to be global.
*  There's people in probably Beirut that are having a shit day that like
*  saw fucking Hans Kim in there like, dude, I always want to see Hans Kim
*  in the garden or whatever their dream was, you know?
*  But yeah, it's it's it really is like kind of medicine.
*  It is for me, for sure.
*  If someone makes me laugh, I feel way better.
*  When did you start getting like love like what I wanted to say, though?
*  Oh, yeah. So I forgot because I was going.
*  So Dice Dice is embraced now by this class.
*  Yeah. Oh, yeah.
*  To this group of comedians that are coming out, Dice was one of my heroes.
*  When I was 19 years old, I mean, I was laughing so hard at his kid.
*  I was in my car in front of my house with this girl.
*  I was dating. I was 19.
*  We were listening to Dice on a cassette.
*  We're just sitting in the front seat of my car, just laughing.
*  Ah, it was so funny.
*  I couldn't believe how funny it was.
*  And it was just listening to it on a cassette.
*  Yeah. You know, and then as I became,
*  you know, a comedian, a headliner and traveled to go on TV also
*  and became friends with Dice and then I realized some comedians don't like Dice.
*  I was like, this is this doesn't even make sense to me.
*  Like, what are you guys talking about?
*  Like the guy does legitimate performance art on the street.
*  He does for no money.
*  He he plans it out.
*  He strategizes and he makes these videos of him
*  stumbling into people and telling them you want you wanted the picture.
*  You wanted the picture with me.
*  They have no idea who the fuck he is.
*  And it's genius.
*  It's genius performance art.
*  The guy does not get the credit that he deserves.
*  And it's he's really he's a great guy.
*  Just for whatever reason, there's this weird time period where comedians hated him.
*  And I don't understand that.
*  Does doesn't make any sense to me.
*  And I think he got too big, too,
*  because he was the first guy to ever sell out arenas. Right.
*  He was the first guy that was doing those like he did Madison Square Garden
*  multiple nights sold out.
*  You know, he does every he did Nassau Coliseum.
*  So it was a classic got so big people just want to kick him off the mountain.
*  There's a little bit of that for sure,
*  because there's no comedians before him that was doing arenas. Right.
*  And he was doing a different thing because he was doing this thing
*  where everybody knew the jokes and they wanted to say it with him.
*  What's in the bowl, bitch?
*  Oh, yeah, man.
*  And the fucking thousands of people.
*  Yeah, come on. It's like a rock band.
*  You're seeing a band play your favorite song.
*  Yep. So he had the rhymes, man, the rhymes.
*  You could not go wrong with those rhymes.
*  And, you know, he's dressed in a fucking giant glittery biker outfit.
*  It's fucking crazy.
*  I do not like a little bit of that. It's fun.
*  It's like there's all kinds of comedy.
*  You can love that and still love Patton Oswalt.
*  I think he's funny, too.
*  It's like all kinds of stuff is funny, man.
*  Duncan Trussell's hilarious. Everybody's different. It's OK.
*  So much. Yeah. But it's just this this class of comedians gets that.
*  This group is all comedians gets. Yeah. Gets. Just be funny.
*  It's all bullshit unless you're funny.
*  And another fun thing about Keltonia is that it's like, you know,
*  the the audience that has cultivated it's putting, you know, having dice
*  on like that is like people who may or may not have
*  fully been educated on Andrew will now be like, oh, fuck.
*  And then go back and do a deep dive.
*  And then these kids have no idea even existed.
*  Yeah, because they're 20. Yeah.
*  You know, they're 20 years old. Yeah.
*  They don't say they were born in 2004, son.
*  That is crazy.
*  You already had navigation in your car and those kids were born.
*  Yeah. And so they don't know what the fuck is going on.
*  Who's that guy? Why is everybody clapping? Yeah.
*  And you got to become a comedy historian and you got to go, oh, dice rules.
*  And then listen to the day the laughter died.
*  You want to be a real dice fan?
*  You listen to the day the laughter died.
*  It's two hours long. Oh, my God. OK.
*  Rick Rubin produced it. Oh, my God.
*  It's two hours long of him just popping into danger fields
*  with no material and bombing.
*  And oh, yeah, on purpose, on purpose, in the height of his stardom.
*  OK, this guy's selling out arenas
*  and he decides to do a two disc special
*  of him bombing on purpose, on purpose.
*  I love that. I mean, no material, dude.
*  No material. No, no.
*  Bombed on purpose or bombed on purpose.
*  Look, if he wanted to, he could have done his act and he would have crushed.
*  They would be, oh, my God, it's dice.
*  He decides to bomb on purpose.
*  Dude, it's the craziest thing.
*  Yeah, because the kind of ego you have to have to be able to bomb on purpose.
*  On a CD and then put it out.
*  No internet, by the way.
*  This is all in his crazy head. Right.
*  This is not a thing you do because, you know, you want to impress people on Reddit.
*  This is a wild thing he did as an artist.
*  It really is a wild artist move.
*  And this is where I think he doesn't get enough credit because everybody thinks,
*  oh, he's just the dirty guy.
*  He's the guy who tells racist jokes.
*  It's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
*  Innovative. Pay attention to what this fucking crazy person is doing.
*  And the thing he does now, he's not trying to get
*  people to like know who he is.
*  He's just making this the most uncomfortable video.
*  And the people who are fans of his like he's a fucking maniac.
*  He's walking up to this crazy Chinese lady.
*  Oh, yeah. And he wanted the picture like, I don't know what the fuck to do.
*  And he's big and he's a pose.
*  Yeah. Crazy sunglasses.
*  He looks like he might be an insane person.
*  You're worried about your safety. Yeah. Yeah.
*  It's hilarious.
*  He's a fucking he's a genius.
*  It's inspiring to see somebody like that that has that doesn't lose their zest for
*  right. The funny like even in the green room at the garden,
*  he was doing videos with everybody and he came up and he goes, Phil,
*  do a video for me where I come up and you go, I am talking to my fans.
*  And I go, I go, what? He goes, no, no, but in character right now, you're Adam
*  Doofus. So then he comes up and he goes, hey, Doc.
*  And I go, Andrew, I'm talking to my friends.
*  We fuck off. And he goes, Jesus fucking Christ, this guy.
*  And they put their back and he goes, I thought I liked this guy.
*  And then he's like, and he goes over to Sal and does a little video.
*  And yeah, he just was like, he was fucking around.
*  And it was like and that's what the that's what the backstage vibe should be.
*  You know, dude, he used to do these little sketches at the store
*  and he would do it with a VHS handheld camera.
*  He do sketches at the store. And I asked him one night, I go,
*  what are you doing these for? It was full.
*  It's like, it's like, what am I doing?
*  If I like it was great answer, I'll put it together someday.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. He was just having fun.
*  Yeah. Just having fun.
*  Oh, the first time he brought me up in the OR at the store,
*  Jeff Scott was over there on the keys and he goes, Jeff, who we got next?
*  And I met him maybe three times, but didn't expect whatever.
*  But he goes and Jeff goes, Adam Ray.
*  And he goes, oh, I love this guy.
*  And, you know, we didn't know each other.
*  And he goes, this guy, you've seen him here.
*  You've seen him there. Keep it going for my friend, Alan Gray.
*  And then I get up and then I get up and he goes, sorry, I had to write it
*  like to me. And I just laughed and I was like that. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  He's I would love when he would go on stage in the OR
*  and there'd be like 10 people in the crowd. Yeah.
*  And he would just fuck with them. What a treat to get this fucking guy.
*  Look at this fucking guy with his pants.
*  It looks like he got attacked by a fucking mountain lion.
*  How much did you pay for those pants? You fucking moron.
*  And he's like, this is how we call it mean dice.
*  That was my favorite dice to watch in the OR when he do mean. Yes.
*  Because people love it, too.
*  They're like, Dice is roasting me. Get the fuck out of here.
*  They were dying. They were dying. It was funny.
*  Yeah. It was like it sounds mean when I'm saying it, but mean dice was hilarious.
*  Has he? He's been to the mothership. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  He loves it. Yes. I'm just happy.
*  I was always just would freak me out to become his friend because I.
*  Does that one for you that's just crazy that as far as like in the business,
*  you're like, I was young, man.
*  I was friends with him in my 20s. Wow.
*  And I was standing in the back of the car.
*  He's the reason why I started going on the road
*  because I was standing in the back of the comedy stories like you should do the road.
*  And I said, why? I was like, I'm here at the store.
*  He goes, yeah, I know. But you know what?
*  You don't want to be attached to Hollywood.
*  These fucking jerk offs.
*  He's like, you can make all the money that you need on the road.
*  Wow. You get us get an audience.
*  He goes, you're a funny guy.
*  She did the road.
*  And I was like, I should do the road.
*  So I started doing the road before three years.
*  Yeah. Opened you up to the idea.
*  100 percent. For years, I was mostly just doing the store.
*  And I would do the Laugh Factory and I do the improv.
*  I was just doing Hollywood sets.
*  And occasionally I would do something else where it was a long set.
*  But it was a little awkward because I was mostly doing 15 minute sets, you know.
*  And so then I started headlining again.
*  I was like, oh, yeah, you have to do this.
*  You have to do hours. Yeah.
*  You have to do like four hours on a weekend, like two, two on Friday, two on Saturday.
*  But it's like the problem was I always had like one foot in and one foot out,
*  because one foot in was like I was always working on television.
*  So that was like most of my day.
*  Most of my day on news radio was working on the TV show.
*  Like it it dampens your enthusiasm for doing the thing that got you to the dance.
*  But I want a set of news radio once.
*  And the producers said to me, why do you still do a stand up?
*  You're an actor now.
*  I was like, oh, no. Oh, shit.
*  I was just like, like this whole cycle of needing people to pick you for something.
*  I was like, yeah, get me out of this.
*  Why are you deciding what I should, you know, be to people?
*  And it was at the same time where Dice told me you do the road.
*  Wow. Same time.
*  So it was like a fortuitous universe.
*  Yeah. Convergence of this guy that I couldn't believe I was friends with.
*  It was just weird to me.
*  Would those news radio days be so long that sometimes you wouldn't want to go up
*  and do a spot or was it? Yeah, I still did it.
*  I always did it. I never canceled. Yeah, I always did it.
*  Even though it was exhausting.
*  It was your reward, too, right?
*  You were looking forward to it, like I can get through the day
*  so I can get on stage almost.
*  It was a little bit of that, but it was also those are my people.
*  You know, the comedians were my people.
*  I had to be around the freaks.
*  I had to be around the weirdos, the Holtzmans.
*  You know, I became friends with Holtzman in 94. Wow.
*  Yeah. So I had to be around those guys.
*  Yeah. Those are my compatriots.
*  It is wild how quickly you find that out, that you are in the right spot.
*  I remember when I first started going around the store in 2000,
*  I started saying 2007, so it was right around there
*  and just going open mics and waiting for four hours
*  and Tommy telling me I'm going up and then not going up
*  and then be like, well, maybe come back tomorrow.
*  And then just being around, even if I didn't go up,
*  I was around for four hours and I didn't just sit and wait.
*  I like milled around.
*  And that's where I met Tony and all these guys that that you're like,
*  oh, cool, you're doing this, too.
*  And that was the connecting over that is an immediate bond.
*  That's just like once you kind of lock eyes with someone like,
*  oh, you're trying to do this to unspoken respect.
*  And then and then also like, oh, cool.
*  Somebody that like, oh, we both didn't go up or you got up.
*  Oh, cool. Yeah. Well, dude, next time maybe do this.
*  And then, oh, where are you going now?
*  You know, it's late.
*  Like I'm fucking I'm jazzed from watching four hours of comedy and not going up.
*  And I feel like it's sad if I just go to bed.
*  So, oh, well, let's go fucking play video games and smoke weed and and talk.
*  I just talk about our experience of that night.
*  And they're wild times that you don't appreciate
*  at the moment because you're worried.
*  You don't know if the future is ever going to be real.
*  You don't know if you're ever going to be a real comedian, you know,
*  because you don't you want to do it.
*  You're obsessed with it.
*  But it's hard to even get on stage.
*  It's hard to even take the first steps towards the dream.
*  So it's like even though it's an amazing time
*  and you're going to look back on it so fondly forever.
*  At this time, it's crazy.
*  At the time, you just don't know.
*  And that that not knowing and not being able to control your destiny
*  as a young person is one of the most terrifying and paralyzing feelings
*  because you don't know if it's going to happen.
*  In whatever you're trying to do, you're just you're a fog of,
*  you know, hope and dreams.
*  And I don't know. I don't know.
*  I can't see the future.
*  I don't know if it's ever going to work out.
*  The uncertainty that is a constant cloud over your head.
*  But but also the appropriate amount of delusion and enthusiasm
*  for wanting to make it right or make it.
*  I mean, just wanting to be able to work in in in this world.
*  Well, I was very fortunate that I'm a very determined person.
*  I was terrible when I started.
*  Santa. Yeah.
*  I mean, occasionally I had some good jokes, but I was bad at putting it together.
*  But I didn't know how to write.
*  I didn't know.
*  I just knew like what I liked.
*  And I knew that I could make people laugh in inappropriate ways.
*  I just couldn't figure out how to get that.
*  Were you comfy on stage? No.
*  Yeah, it took a while.
*  Took a while for me to be comfortable on stage, which is so crazy.
*  I was so nervous about it.
*  But I had fought like a hundred times.
*  It's just so weird that like getting kicked in the head
*  didn't make me as nervous as talking to people.
*  That's so wild to me.
*  It's so crazy.
*  There was a lot of fear that came with the fighting that didn't come with stand up,
*  like all throughout the day.
*  Like you have massive anxiety all throughout the day when sparring days.
*  You have massive anxiety when you're going to a tournament.
*  And that's when I became funny because I would make everybody laugh
*  when we were all freaking out because we were like on a bus
*  driving to New York together to go get kicked in the face.
*  And I would just make jokes because it's very likely
*  that one of us might get knocked unconscious.
*  You know, I'd seen a few of my friends get knocked unconscious.
*  And it's a terrifying feeling.
*  I saw a friend of mine get axe kicked in the face.
*  And he was really never the same guy again after that.
*  He was a really good fighter.
*  And we went up to Canada and he fought this guy named Jersey Long.
*  And Jersey Long was this national champion from Canada who was nasty.
*  He was nasty.
*  And he caught my friend in the head with an axe kick and KO'd him.
*  And I didn't think my friend should have been fighting him.
*  I didn't think my friend was good enough at that point and experienced enough.
*  He was good. He was very talented.
*  But he didn't have enough experience on a national level.
*  And this guy was at the peak of his form and he fucking caught him so hard.
*  And it was so horrible watching him crumple and go unconscious.
*  I was like, God damn.
*  It was one of the worst KOs I'd ever seen live from a friend getting KO'd.
*  I was like, God damn.
*  That make you really just reevaluate everything at that point.
*  Oh, it made me a bunch of times.
*  Made me reevaluate.
*  KOing people made me reevaluate it.
*  Watching people snoring on the ground and knowing that could have easily been you.
*  Easily could have been you.
*  Easily, you know, easily.
*  There was definitely guys that could have knocked me into the shadow realm.
*  They just didn't. I just got lucky.
*  I got lucky and I never really got knocked out until my last kickboxing fight.
*  I get TKO'd. I was still conscious.
*  It was I was OK. I got rocked.
*  I got hit with a left hook and dropped.
*  My legs just disappeared.
*  My legs just went, weep, go away.
*  What's that like? It's weird.
*  It never happened before.
*  I've been rocked before in the gym, but I'd never been dropped
*  where I was really exhausted.
*  It was my third fight of the night, too.
*  Because even that's a crapshoot, right?
*  Like when you're getting kicked in the head, you go down or whatever it is
*  that knocks you out. It's still right.
*  There's always the oh, a couple of centimeters to the left.
*  And that would have actually this guy caught me perfect on the jaw.
*  And I think I had my mouth open because I think I was tired
*  because it was like I said, it was the third fight of the day.
*  And I remember being exhausted because I would get sick a lot of times
*  before fights because I would get nervous.
*  So I get real nervous.
*  And your immune system drops because you're freaking out all the time.
*  Fuck. Yeah.
*  And also you're cutting weight.
*  I'd be cutting my calories down because I was trying to compete
*  in a different weight class.
*  Those nerves don't enter in the comedy like before your live special,
*  which I told you a couple of days ago, but it was awesome.
*  Thanks. Thank you.
*  And also, I'm just I love doing a different man.
*  When Harlan Williams did a fucking special outdoors in front of animals,
*  I was like, fuck, yeah, you know, doing something different.
*  But the live thing is so not guaranteed, man.
*  You're prepped. You're ready.
*  You've done live, but like still you're you're still
*  it's still a new challenge. Right.
*  I mean, I said no to it at first.
*  Right. I was like, I don't want to do that.
*  Fuck that.
*  We'll put you over the top.
*  And what and what was it like that were?
*  Well, what put me over the top was I was like, why are you scared, Bussy?
*  This is like, what do you like to do?
*  You like to do things that scare you.
*  Do this thing, you fucking bitch.
*  Yeah. That's exactly what I thought to myself, because I said no.
*  I was on the phone with my manager and she was said Netflix wants to do
*  a live specials like fuck that.
*  I go, I don't want to do that. No, no, no.
*  Tell him, no. Maybe I'll do a special.
*  But at that time, I wasn't even thinking about doing a special.
*  I was just working on comedy.
*  I was just having fun and just doing comedy.
*  And then being at my own club, it was fucking wonderful.
*  And then I was like, why are you being such a bitch?
*  As I said, no.
*  And then when I got home, I think, or maybe the next morning, I called her up
*  and I said, don't tell him, no, yet.
*  Let me think about it.
*  And then the next day I said, I'm going to do it.
*  Conversations with other people about it or you just kind of had a.
*  I didn't tell anybody. A car pep talk or what?
*  No, no, just my own head.
*  It was like, this is what you're supposed to do, stupid.
*  Yeah, just do something.
*  Do something that scares the shit out of you,
*  because that scares the shit out of you.
*  But I just realized, like.
*  I'm having great shows.
*  I know that I'm the materials tight. It's funny.
*  I'm like, what am I worried about?
*  I'm not going to be able to do it every night.
*  Just do it like a regular night.
*  And I do everything live.
*  I do the UFC live.
*  I do. Yes. Do YouTube videos.
*  We used to do live. Yeah.
*  You just stream the podcast live.
*  I've done so many shows live.
*  Like, what am I worried about?
*  And I'm like, are you worried about fucking up?
*  OK, well, don't think about fucking up.
*  Think about doing it the best way you can do it.
*  And the best way I could do it was like to over prepare.
*  So I prepared like crazy. Yeah.
*  I was in the one point in time I was doing six hours a week.
*  So I was doing three nights, two shows a night headlining.
*  God damn. You're ready at that point.
*  After like an hour and 15 minutes of other guys killing an hour and 15,
*  an hour and a half sometimes.
*  One time it was an hour and 45 minutes because the Protect Our Parks guys
*  were all with me. Oh shit.
*  So we all went out. We were blazed.
*  We're all so drunk.
*  We were so drunk.
*  When we got there, we hopped out of the limo and ran upstairs.
*  And it was ridiculous.
*  At one point, Norman got so drunk during the podcast
*  that he went backstage, threw up and then went to sleep.
*  So, you know, that backstage area like right behind the stage.
*  Yeah, he was sleeping up there.
*  Yeah. Out cold.
*  So he goes up and then, you know, R is hammered.
*  He goes up and Brian.
*  Brian Simpson was there. Tony was there.
*  Like it was a giant crazy show.
*  So but all those shows when you're going up that late,
*  it's like running with weights on.
*  You got to keep that momentum.
*  You got to keep things tight.
*  So all I did was just over prepare.
*  I just really listened to a lot of recordings.
*  I watched the video from Friday night because we recorded Friday night, too.
*  Oh, great. So I watched that video.
*  I was writing bits out that I knew, but I was writing them out
*  word for word on a notebook over and over again.
*  And when you're over prepared, I'm assuming.
*  I don't know if you rift anything in the moment,
*  but I feel like when you are that in the pocket, you're like, all right.
*  Now I feel comfy to shoot from the hip.
*  Yeah, you could just do a show.
*  Like a regular show, like how you would do it.
*  That's how I thought I'll just go.
*  I go, I want to over prepare, but I just want to do it like a regular show.
*  Yeah. But it's also a regular show in a theater, which was odd
*  because I had only done my club for a year and a half.
*  I hadn't done any other venue for a whole year and a half before Friday night.
*  I had not done any other big places.
*  Wow. Yeah, for a long time.
*  I think the last time I did a big place was probably one of the arenas that I did.
*  And then I went to the club and then I stayed in the club for like a year and a half.
*  So next special, you have to be like, what, blackout drunk?
*  Or what? Just to mix it up?
*  No, I think I'll do a live one again.
*  Yeah, it was fun.
*  It was fucking terrifying, but fun.
*  Like in the moment, it wasn't terrifying at all.
*  I was just in the moment and I always doing was just concentrating
*  on staying in the moment and enjoying myself and having a good time
*  and doing it the best I can do it and being, you know, real.
*  I was so prepared because I knew like what my transitions were going to be.
*  I'd done that set in that order for like three weeks.
*  Yeah, I was like, I was ready.
*  Yeah, we're going to live stream these Phil theater shows, I think.
*  Just taking a, you know, a page out of the KilToni book.
*  It's like, why not?
*  If people, you know, because there's only a handful of theaters we're doing,
*  but it's like there's people, you know, you can reach way a bigger audience doing that.
*  And I mean, it's all the shows, all unscripted.
*  So it's like there's a little more room for, you know, something, whatever.
*  But I don't know.
*  Well, there's a lot, a lot of room for it.
*  But the most important thing is, you're like, actually, don't do it.
*  The most important thing is that's what people like.
*  Yes. They like that you're going without a net.
*  Right. They like it.
*  Yeah. That's why they like the live KilToni.
*  That's why they like all this stuff.
*  Yeah. Anything could happen.
*  Yeah. Look, KilToni at its base.
*  The whole thing is there's no net.
*  You know, it's like you're going to go up.
*  Some guy went up in Mass Square Garden the first time he ever went on stage ever, ever.
*  That's fucking so crazy.
*  Ever. That's so crazy.
*  I mean, what a mind fuck that must be to walk out in front.
*  And by the way, those people were harsh.
*  Those people were fucking mean.
*  I was going to ask you, how do you feel with like a joke in?
*  They're like, so my mom is a my mom.
*  My mom's my mom's weird.
*  Like, fuck you.
*  They're boo. Yeah.
*  I mean, the boo's coming so quick sometimes.
*  Also, they're drunk. OK.
*  There's there's people out there.
*  They've been ready for the show all day.
*  They've been day drinking.
*  They probably went to a pub.
*  Got fucked up. Oh, in New York. Yeah.
*  Yeah. They're walking.
*  And then they walked into this most iconic arena, their favorite show.
*  It's live. There's 16000 people.
*  They're fucked up. Yeah.
*  Let's go. Yeah.
*  And then some guys on stage and it's not that good.
*  You're like, boo.
*  It's normal. I paid for this.
*  Especially in New York. Yeah.
*  Especially in New York. I know.
*  They're not polite.
*  If you're if it's going south, they're going to let you know.
*  But that's part of the fun.
*  Because when it goes great, they let you know, too.
*  Yeah. They're great laughers.
*  God damn. When they were laughing, they were laughing hard.
*  It was a fun show.
*  It was really fun.
*  But it's that weirdness of like it could go sideways.
*  It could be awesome. Yeah.
*  But it's always going to be funny. Yeah.
*  And so and then you got the regulars like William Montgomery is a goddamn
*  national treasure. I can't get enough of him.
*  I love him to death. Me too, man.
*  He's so funny, dude.
*  He's so fucking funny.
*  And he gives it. He's so I love to when people are just so
*  he's such a kind guy, but he's so like he just commits fully, dude.
*  Yeah. And he's just always in the pocket.
*  And he's always that's a tough thing, too, is going on.
*  Like I've only been on his long panel or a five, ten minute bit.
*  And it's like to go on for a minute and then however long the interview part is,
*  he's just always he always delivers, I guess, which is he's a he's a character.
*  Yeah. Right. He's just a maniacal character.
*  And you can get away with so much as that maniacal character.
*  I met his he's got two brothers by what met one and he goes, Hi, my name's Vance.
*  And it was from William's brother.
*  And I was like, of course you are.
*  He just had all the William like really just a very intense like
*  William hugs you.
*  Oh, yeah. He hugs you like he might be stabbing.
*  He hugs you like a Trump handshake, like he pulls you in.
*  And then it's really weird.
*  Like he's stabbing you. Actually, that's very tense.
*  Yeah. You might want to stab. What is that?
*  That's just I don't know what it is.
*  I'm trying to relax him on it.
*  For several years now. Yeah.
*  He just hugs you and you're like, am I in trouble?
*  Am I in danger here? Yeah.
*  It's just we jump out of a plane.
*  Why are you holding on to me?
*  So what a writing exercise that show is to have to come up with a whole new minute
*  every week. Yeah, that's bananas. Yeah.
*  It's a bananas experience.
*  I mean, it's such it's such a crazy job.
*  And to do it live in front of a crowd and then have it on YouTube.
*  And if you bomb, it's on YouTube forever.
*  It's like that's the ballsiest shit you can do.
*  Let me ask you this. Would you ever go on like now that there have been, you know,
*  I've gone as a few characters, Shane going on doing doing Trump.
*  If there was ever a pitch to you from Tony or whoever,
*  because you're a good actor, man.
*  And if would there ever be a world of somebody was like, dude, Joe,
*  let's get you up and some to come on and do like a bucket.
*  Pull that was like a wild person, not even like a long panel thing, but like a.
*  Yeah, I would do that.
*  Like a fake.
*  You know, it would have to be a person that I could actually do an impression of.
*  OK, because I'm not that good.
*  I only have a few like I can do dice and I can do Joey.
*  But it's only a few.
*  But what about an original?
*  This is a guy named Earl Strickland.
*  This is my best impression.
*  My best impression is a professional pool player.
*  Let's go for real.
*  His voice is the way he knows a video of me doing impression to him.
*  I sound exactly like him. Awesome.
*  And I say the crazy he's he's a genius, genius.
*  One of the greatest pool players of all time.
*  But like all people that are incredible at what they do, they're nuts.
*  Yeah. Almost all people that are really, really good at things
*  are out of their fucking mind. Oh, yeah.
*  And he's out of his fucking mind.
*  And he's famous for things like he puts like ankle weights on his wrists
*  when he plays and tapes up his fingertips and puts like shooting goggles on.
*  Meanwhile, I was like one of the greatest pool players that's ever lived. Wow.
*  So he has all these like gadgets and shit he does.
*  But I do this impression to him.
*  Play it for me, because you got to hear him talk for you.
*  Mr. Earl Strickland, ladies and gentlemen. That's my buddy, Justin.
*  How are you doing tonight?
*  Pool is a beautiful game played by ugly people.
*  OK, first of all, how are you going to play pool if you're not properly equipped?
*  Where's your beekeepers?
*  You don't have no ass weights.
*  I don't see you in waiters.
*  What are you doing? You have goggles on?
*  No. Then get the fuck off the table.
*  So this is wow.
*  You got to listen to the sound like you listen to the get.
*  That's like if that guy was famous.
*  Yeah, I could do like a whole tour as him.
*  Oh, my God. That's your next chapter.
*  I could do a tour of pool halls.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Meet and greets with that.
*  But that's the only one I could do that good.
*  Well, here's the thing.
*  Even that voice, I'm like, dude, that's a kill Tony guy.
*  You see that guy come on. Right.
*  This is him. It's every week.
*  You know, it was just the best players in the world playing.
*  Bro, you nailed it.
*  I know how to do his voice.
*  That was the biggest thing.
*  Oh, Joe's a beautiful game.
*  Played by a bunch of ugly people.
*  The stash, bro.
*  Yeah, he's a wizard.
*  Now, is he is he so famous that like a biopic is in the works?
*  If something happened, they could do a biopic.
*  All right. And I could play Earl Strickland.
*  I can't play as good as Earl Strickland and not not not built like Earl Strickland.
*  But I could definitely do it in the old street.
*  Oh, my God. He'd be so mad at me.
*  Have you wait. So you haven't you met him yet?
*  Yeah, I met him. He was happy when I met him.
*  I ran into him and he was like, why are you picking on me?
*  I do. I'm a giant fan.
*  It's the only way I could do an impression.
*  Yeah, good. Yeah, I'm a huge fan.
*  And we became friends like friendly.
*  But then I tried to get him on the podcast and he doesn't want to come on.
*  He's mad at me for something.
*  Doing his voice like did it.
*  Keep saying he's a podcast saying that he like turned me down.
*  They didn't want to do my podcast.
*  Oh, God. I'm only a fan.
*  Yeah, I'm only telling I don't know.
*  I only joke it around because I think you're awesome.
*  Is pull your man.
*  How do I ask this question?
*  Not vice number one, hop number one, like if you had the ideal day,
*  like a joint, a show, you know, maybe post show for however long and you're hanging.
*  Obviously, I know you like your dinners and whatnot.
*  But like is pull your true like you're in your happy place.
*  Well, it's just to me, it's like a game that's also a mind cleanser.
*  So there's certain and the social aspect of it.
*  Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Social.
*  Well, if you're hanging around a pool hall, for sure. Yeah.
*  Also, it's like pool players are also obsessed with it the way you're obsessed with it.
*  So you could talk about stuff that you can't talk about with other people like
*  tip millimeter sizes and carbon fiber shafts and stuff.
*  Nobody wants to talk about that.
*  But the pool players can't wait to talk about it.
*  So you're talking about these weird aspects of the very particular aspects of this game.
*  But while you're doing it, when you're just trying to concentrate on running out
*  and just trying to concentrate on putting that cue ball perfect for the next ball,
*  perfect for the next, you think of three balls ahead, you're plotting your lines
*  and you're going there's no room for anything else.
*  There's no room for, oh, I forgot to call that guy back.
*  Oh, I got to do this. Oh, I got to do that.
*  Oh, I didn't do this today.
*  There's no room while you're shooting.
*  It's a mind cleanser.
*  So all the things should I do this, should I do that?
*  All that goes away. Yeah.
*  And he just cleans your mind out because it requires all of you to make a hard
*  especially on tight pockets.
*  A long shot on tight pipe requires all of you to stay in line.
*  Have your stroking arm follow through smooth.
*  Have the proper grip on the cue where you're not gripping it too tight.
*  You got it like you're cradling it like a little baby bird,
*  like a little baby bird in your hand.
*  And you're just letting that cue weight and the the acceleration from your arm
*  push through that ball.
*  And you want to watch that spin as it collides with the ball
*  and moves perfectly to the next ball that requires all of you.
*  So while you're doing that, it cleans your head out.
*  Dude, Strickland, you're just making me realize is like Bob Ross for pool.
*  The way that you described all that, I was like, dude, that all made sense.
*  You just basically broke down pool in the most beautiful way.
*  And it really is there's so much finesse, there's so much like strategy.
*  There's so much there's athleticism involved.
*  There's a little bit of body control.
*  I wouldn't call it athleticism, but you have to have execution.
*  You have to be able to execute the shots.
*  And that requires like a finesse that's learned over thousands
*  and thousands and thousands of shots.
*  I thought I was going to be a pro pool player at one point.
*  My mom, my mom was a
*  single mom, four jobs, ran an assisted living homes,
*  you know, activities.
*  That was one of the jobs like the bring in, you know, our school choirs
*  and then just coming up with games form.
*  And so I'd go there for a lot of times after school.
*  And there was a guy that was like, I don't know, the fucking janitor.
*  Who knows if this guy even like worked there?
*  But also, I'd always be upstairs with him playing pool and my sister.
*  And and he just like was so good and would like show us trick shots.
*  And I got so into it.
*  It was one of those things you got so into for like three, four years.
*  And then, I don't know, girls, you got someone who's good
*  that showed you how to do it right.
*  Yes. You I always think back every now and not always, but think back to like,
*  oh, man, what if I like had really made that a thing?
*  Because I mean, who knows where I was?
*  But all I know is I was playing like anything as a kid, right?
*  I was playing all the time to where I was like, oh, man, what if that was like
*  that would be crazy if I knew you from the pool world, the comedy world?
*  That would be crazy. I know, right? Yeah.
*  Then you probably would have had this thing in your head like,
*  I think I could do comedy. Oh, yeah.
*  I think I could do it.
*  You know, that thing that you had in your head before you ever started
*  doing it, like that little voice, it's like maybe you should do comedy.
*  That was me on the bus impersonating doing Ace Ventura scenes.
*  We were so as a fat kid.
*  And then I was getting teased all the time.
*  Look at you, you handsome bastard.
*  Fat kid to a glow up.
*  That's right. Right.
*  I'm trying to take care of myself.
*  The guy in it, too.
*  Remember the fat kid in it, too, comes back, buff and handsome in it, too.
*  You don't remember?
*  I watched it the other day in it one, the chubby kid.
*  It gets cut up by the bully.
*  Yeah. Remember that? Yeah.
*  And then in it, too.
*  Now he's a stud.
*  He's got like a six pack. Beautiful man. Like something happened.
*  Oh, yeah. We're still working on that.
*  But yeah, you got a glow up.
*  I appreciate it.
*  Yeah. Well, it was I was getting teased all the time.
*  So it was fat kid.
*  And then I started making friends laugh and they were like, oh, you're the funny kid.
*  So I was like, oh, this is making them laugh, which feels good.
*  And then it's also changing the way they're looking at me,
*  which I felt like a crazy superpower.
*  I mean, this is sixth grade.
*  And I was just, you know, I just was like, oh, I got to chase this then.
*  So then it was, you know, but I was doing it naturally.
*  I wasn't going out of my way to do it.
*  It just came like I was.
*  I'd watched AIDS Ventura.
*  Then I was like, oh, I want to, you know, do that to a couple of friends on the bus.
*  And now I'm like telling stories.
*  And then I would prank call Seattle sports radio stations and record it on like my
*  my first Sony and play it for friends on the bus.
*  And they'd be like, just seeing them laugh was fun or prank call.
*  One of the first things I did was there was a girl in our class
*  that everybody had a crush on and me too.
*  But she was like, yeah, bigger tits than me.
*  Why would I like you?
*  And so I called my buddy who she ended up dating and pretend to be her,
*  as I called him with other friends, kind of diabolical.
*  Jesus, you could do an impression of her.
*  Is that good in fourth grade? Yeah.
*  I have a voice. I didn't sound like this fourth grade.
*  Yeah, that's insane.
*  Yeah. And so even back then you were doing that.
*  Yeah. Impersonating teachers and whatnot.
*  And then, yeah, that's hilarious.
*  But then but the but the the chasing of it was,
*  which is why I was telling somebody this day or day, Jim Carrey,
*  when he came through, when he was scouting for him,
*  dine up here at the Comedy Store.
*  And I had never met him.
*  And he's walking through and Adam, he gets walking him through.
*  And, you know, that movie was so influential on me, Jim Carrey in general.
*  But like how much I was like, you know, involving it in making people laugh.
*  He walks. Was it a movie or was it a television show?
*  Ace Ventura? No, no, the the Comedy Store thing.
*  Oh, a television show on Showtime. Right. Yeah. OK.
*  So he's coming through the back bar.
*  I think he was going to do Roast Battle.
*  And I'm seeing the back bar or the main bar of the store.
*  And and he walks through and Adam's like, hey, Adam, it's Jim Carrey.
*  And I go.
*  And Jim goes, OK, man, and keeps walking.
*  I was like, and Rob the Boxer was like, dude, you fucking what was that?
*  And I was like, I couldn't communicate.
*  And then I put it all together and I was like, oh, dude, like,
*  I'm sure subconsciously in that moment, I was like, oh, dude, this guy,
*  you know, whether it was all about it or not, like,
*  me just telling you all the stuff about the movie and influencing me
*  and and giving me the confidence to like want to try to make people laugh.
*  He was your Jesus.
*  Yeah. I mean, in a weird way. Jesus.
*  I mean, I think so.
*  Man, so it was put me on the track to try to.
*  And now that's my life. I don't know. Right.
*  Maybe I'm getting too heady about it.
*  No, you're not getting too heady.
*  No, I appreciate what you're saying. Yeah.
*  That's exactly what it is.
*  Like he is the guy that started the spark. Right.
*  He's the guy that inspired.
*  I think so impressions of him getting laughs is what got you down the road.
*  Yeah. Yeah. So you meeting him was a freak out. Yeah.
*  He should be used to freak outs by now.
*  Like you're fucking Jim Carrey, dude. Yeah.
*  But I bet he gets bugged out by people that don't act normal around him. Sure.
*  You know, I mean, he's probably so tired of it.
*  Yeah. Maybe you appreciate that.
*  And then Adam later was like, dude, you fucking froze in front of Jim Carrey.
*  It's a great.
*  Oh, he was right there. I don't know.
*  It's my kind of back. You saw Santino.
*  So I don't know.
*  He's he'll be better in 30 years.
*  Nice. Definitely not coming back.
*  Because you fucking stared at him weird.
*  I love Adam. Shut up.
*  Shut it out of me.
*  That's a perfect Adam Higgett.
*  But, you know, those guys, I think that being that famous for that long
*  is like radiation poisoning. I think so.
*  You know, I think you have to have a very unique constitution to live near Chernobyl.
*  Oh, yeah. And I think that a guy that's that famous for that long
*  probably goes a little wild. Yeah.
*  And they also like became insane.
*  I think when he was doing Andy Kaufman, he became.
*  Whoa. Andy Kaufman for like a year.
*  I know I need to be taken a pay.
*  Like, what if that happens to me with this Phil thing?
*  No. Yeah, I know.
*  I can separate you separate.
*  You're talking to me before you went on stage.
*  Yeah, Phil, you're just you.
*  You're just imagine fuck if I was just like, Joe, you excited for tonight's show?
*  I would understand. I'd go, yes.
*  Yeah, Phil, what's up?
*  Tell Jay I said hi.
*  You should have done it.
*  Dude, you that coat you were wearing that night.
*  Like you were I mean, it was incredible, dude.
*  And you look like with your shades and that jacket.
*  Where I just wanted to be ridiculous because we're at Madison Square Garden.
*  I love it, dude. Yeah.
*  You were adding to the show.
*  Yeah, it was just to me.
*  It felt like this is so big.
*  I should dress preposterous.
*  I feel preposterous.
*  Can I ask where you get a jacket like that?
*  Nordstrom's. Let's go.
*  Shout out to Nordstrom's. Yeah, I got a it's it's not.
*  No animals died in the making of that jacket.
*  Only a few seals probably choked to death on the oil that spilled out.
*  Yeah, I mean, is that even eco friendly when people have like fake fur?
*  I guess they think that it causes less death.
*  But I wonder if overall it does.
*  I wonder if like what is the amount of life
*  loss through the petrochemical production of nylon versus.
*  Beaver trapping.
*  You know, like what how many things live lives get lost
*  because of the actual production of fake leathers and plastics and chemicals?
*  How many how many things go into the ocean?
*  How many how many things die because they get poisoned by the runoff?
*  Yeah. How many where are these things made?
*  Let's ask Siri.
*  Where is this stuff made?
*  Is this stuff made in some third world country
*  that doesn't have any environmental regulations
*  and they're just dumping this waste into the river, which we know has happened?
*  Is it like, but you feel better because you're wearing a fake fur?
*  Like, I'm not sure. I know. I'm not sure.
*  I think we might be better off just using real fur. Maybe.
*  I bet we are. Yeah, but it's just cruel.
*  The idea of killing an animal just for its skin is just cruel. Pretty wild.
*  It's wild. But I mean, we kill them for food.
*  It is weird to be like there's places that are fur free zones now.
*  OK, right. Like states like places you can't sell furs.
*  I bet you could still wear them.
*  It is America. Yeah. But here's the thing.
*  You can't sell fur.
*  I think you can't sell fur in parts of Los Angeles.
*  See if that's true. Sounds about right.
*  I think they put a ban on selling fur, but you can still sell leather.
*  Do you know how fucking insane you are when you have animal skin on almost
*  everything? You have animal skin on the inside of your car.
*  You have animal skin on your shoes.
*  You have animal skin on your belt.
*  You have animal skin on your wallet. You have animal skin everywhere.
*  If it's better, it's leather upholstered.
*  Look, look at this beautiful leather upholstery.
*  It's better if it has leather.
*  So you have animal skin everywhere as long as there's no fuzz on it.
*  Fur sales are illegal in California.
*  2019, state of California, the first state to ban fur.
*  States Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law AB 44, which bans the sales
*  and manufacturing of new clothing and accessories made from fur.
*  I get it. I get people wanting to be kind and not kill an animal for its fur.
*  I totally understand where you're coming from.
*  But it is a little weird that we're OK with leather.
*  Yeah, it's a little weird.
*  And don't ban leather, you motherfuckers.
*  That's not my point.
*  My point is, shut the fuck up and let people do whatever they want to do.
*  Like, I don't I don't think you should ban furs.
*  I don't want one.
*  I'd rather have a fake one.
*  You know, what do you think about the test?
*  I feel bad. Yeah.
*  But I mean, but I get it.
*  If I was living in a place where they couldn't like, where did it all come from?
*  Right. It came from that was the only way to stay alive.
*  People wore big ass fur coats because it protects you.
*  They don't wear fur coat.
*  The Inuits don't wear fur coats because it looks cool.
*  They want to stay alive. Yeah, it's warmth.
*  Yeah, that's all it is.
*  It's the best way to stay alive, especially when you're getting it
*  from these animals that you're killing.
*  Yeah. Like that's literally how you get your clothes and your food.
*  It's from these animals. That's the origin of it all.
*  Now it's like a weird thing
*  because you're wearing it to show everyone you're a baller.
*  You come in in a full length mink coat.
*  What's up, player? Yeah.
*  Like my ostrich hat.
*  Yeah. You just you have feathers on your cap from some exotic bird
*  that had lost its fucking life.
*  So you can look like a pimp.
*  And you just just to go to the Clippers gaming style wearing gold all over your
*  alligator pussy rings, diamonds carved out of the ground by child labor.
*  You know, and you just glitter and shine.
*  You have to you have to walk in like that, by the way.
*  Yeah. If you got a fur coat, you have to walk in like this.
*  Even though the coats doing the talking for you.
*  But my friend Bill had one. I put one on once.
*  I was like, oh, my God, this thing's amazing.
*  We were in Aspen and he had a mink coat.
*  I go, what is that? What is that coat? Let me try that on.
*  I put it on. I was like, oh, my God. Wow.
*  This is amazing. Yeah.
*  It insulates you so perfectly.
*  He's like pimps.
*  Pimps made mink coats popular. Is that I don't know who made mink coats popular,
*  but they're popular with rich ladies, rich ladies. Yeah.
*  It's rich ladies.
*  And then it's like, I think pimps caught on because it wasn't a lot of Joe Namath
*  didn't Joe Namath, like famously where you have coat. Yes.
*  Yeah. Baller shit. Baller shit.
*  It looks. Yeah. But back then people didn't think twice
*  because everybody's just trying to stay alive.
*  They were just trying to not starve to death. Right.
*  They didn't give a fuck about those animals.
*  And once things get soft and sweet and people who started doing way better,
*  you know, in society, you know, it's like, you don't have to worry about starving
*  to death. Everyone's like, hey, why are we killing these little animals for their fur?
*  Let them live. Yeah.
*  What do you think about the taxidermy stuff,
*  like the full on people that have like rooms with just creature on creature?
*  I don't do that with animals I hunt because I like what's called a European mount.
*  And a European mount is the skull with the antlers on it.
*  Just the actual skull. Yeah.
*  I know what it looked like.
*  I don't want a fake representation of it on my wall.
*  It's basically a doll.
*  First of all, the people that do it are amazing.
*  And the art of it is pretty incredible because it is an art form.
*  What you're doing is you're you're using this mold. Right.
*  So you have a mold that's roughly the size of the torso of the animal you killed.
*  They have a photograph of the animal that you killed.
*  And then they take the skin from the animal you killed and molded around this foam
*  and do it so perfectly that it looks just like the animal.
*  They put fake eyes and they they do it all up.
*  And it's got the antlers from the actual animal. Right.
*  And they've made a fake version of this animal that you killed.
*  I get it. Yeah, I get it. But it's not for me. Right.
*  Also, I don't know.
*  I feel like I would get pretty baked in my own house and have some
*  some late night freak outs at some of these. Yeah.
*  Things that looked super.
*  Well, a buddy of mine has a full house of him. He's
*  his name's Doug. He lives in Jersey.
*  And but he's into it for the yeah, the artistic like he says.
*  It's beautiful. It's got this big.
*  It's Jimmy. You don't have that thing I was going to show Joe.
*  Do you? The little trailer.
*  So I made this doc called Doug about my friend who in
*  was a lifeguard when he was 21 in the 70s, jumped into a pool in Jersey
*  to save a kid who was faking drowning.
*  And he ended up being a paralyzed from the neck down.
*  And his brother, Brian, was an accountant, quit doing that
*  to save his brother mentally, physically, who's in the hospital, wanted to die.
*  Was like, leave me in the pool. I don't want to live like this.
*  He was a college football star, you know, going to be a lawyer.
*  Brian not only gets him physically fit and mentally stable,
*  you know, to a place to where he wants to live, gets him so strong
*  that he enters the Paralympics, ends up becoming the world champ,
*  setting all the world records, gets on the cover of a Wheaties box,
*  travels the world with Michael Jordan, Joe Montana, Bo Jackson,
*  speaking to people all over the world, becomes a criminal lawyer,
*  helps get the Disability Act going.
*  And so I meet Brian, who's now who's now a physical therapist
*  to the stars in New York.
*  And and he goes, he's telling me about his brothers.
*  Do you got me my brother, Doug?
*  This guy's a fucking he's incredible.
*  Come to New Jersey, meet my brother.
*  You can hear him.
*  It's it's it's it's it's good as your Strickland impression.
*  And so I go to Jersey and I see his place.
*  He shows me all his pictures and videos of him with the pope
*  and Christopher Reeve and Regis and Kathy Lee.
*  And I'm like, holy shit, is this talk out already?
*  Yeah, it's on YouTube.
*  And I just it's a one minute trailer.
*  Let's see the trailer. Yeah, let's see the trailer.
*  Thanks, brother.
*  So I directed it the first time.
*  The Doug Air story from the Wheaties cereal box to the Olympics.
*  It was 1978 when Doug Air as a lifeguard dove into a pool to save a drowning boy.
*  When I dove in, the stand kicked back
*  and my head hit the bottom of the pool.
*  He's no pain.
*  I don't feel my legs.
*  I don't feel anything.
*  I'm screaming to the guys.
*  Come on, come on.
*  My life ended and began right at that moment.
*  My brother, he goes, you're not going to get this corny arms.
*  And he he would duct tape one pound wrist weights to my hand.
*  They told me about wheelchair sports.
*  He goes out in the field, breaks the first world record, breaks
*  the second world record, breaks the third.
*  Jaffa shop of discus.
*  Doug Air.
*  We never thought we'd see that. Never.
*  I got a phone call.
*  Soon his picture will be pasted on three million boxes of the stuff.
*  You see my brother on the face of the wheelbarrow.
*  So cool.
*  Where's it go from there, you know?
*  Fall down, get dirty in life and get back up again.
*  And that's the journey.
*  And you can't beat the parking.
*  Just remember that.
*  Dude, that's bad ass.
*  Crazy story.
*  That's a crazy story.
*  So I went out there and I was like, I at least got to film the interviews
*  and their mom just passed with Brian Doug.
*  And because the story of the brother,
*  you know, just being there for Doug is wild and inspiring.
*  And I don't know, you know, having that amount of pictures
*  and video to accompany any doc, I feel like it's pretty imperative.
*  And it was overwhelming.
*  So I was like, I'm going to come out and at least interview you guys.
*  And then took a couple of years to put it all together.
*  But some of my YouTube channel, YouTube dot com slash Adam Ray comedy.
*  I tried to pitch it a few places, didn't really have enough juice.
*  And then I was like, I'm just going to put it up because I want them to.
*  It should be out there.
*  A movie on that story. I mean, it's wild, Joe.
*  I mean, I'll text you a link. It's only 50 minutes.
*  So that you've never done did a documentary or anything like this before.
*  First one directed. Yeah, that's crazy.
*  You just got inspired because this guy's story to put this out.
*  And I was like, I can't believe that that your story is not more.
*  I go, I'm like, how the fuck have I not heard about this?
*  And, you know, I've talked to a few people since we've been like,
*  oh, I remember seeing some on the news about this.
*  Yeah. Fucking a quick news.
*  A 10 second, whatever. But like
*  and Brian's such a character, the brother, that's who I was doing the voice of.
*  That's a great impression.
*  His voice is that is right.
*  It might be better than my own strictly.
*  But but Brian now is that's his life now.
*  So that's also crazy.
*  He dedicated his life to helping his brother.
*  And now he is to the stars in New York and whoever else.
*  I mean, he'll be on a I flew him to Vegas once when I had a major back thing
*  and three days of aggressive stretching and fucking fix me.
*  And on the plane is like, there's a woman next to me.
*  Is her shoulder was fucking fucked up.
*  I fixed his shoulder.
*  She was able to do that for fucking 40 years.
*  Now she can. And he kept telling me about Doug.
*  And I was like, what did he do to her shoulder that letter?
*  I don't know. Just fucking licked it.
*  I know he just he did a little I don't know.
*  Release some gap. He's he's you know, he's there's a name for the type of physical
*  therapist he is, but he says that it's in case people don't understand.
*  But he's a wizard man.
*  And he yeah, so I just got I was like, I need to do this.
*  Is he like do raw thing? Is that kind of stuff?
*  What's that?
*  That's that really painful kind of soft tissue manipulation you ever had done.
*  No, it's brutal, man. Oh, really?
*  I mean, it does. It's it's a that's why I say aggressive stretching.
*  It's really.
*  But but he just a lot of unlocking things, a lot of.
*  But there's days when I've seen him.
*  I stuck around New York an extra day to get worked on.
*  And, you know, I get just from flying and carrying a lot of shit here.
*  My quads get real tight all the time.
*  And so, you know, I'm just not stretching enough, which I know I got to.
*  But, you know, he's like, I could use two more days with you to like really get you,
*  you know, loosen you up. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Yeah, I am. I've been doing a lot of stretching lately because I
*  I've done a lot of like
*  especially getting ready for the special.
*  I was working out a lot also to calm my mind. Yeah.
*  And I might have overdid it a little bit.
*  And so I just was sore, man.
*  My back was sore.
*  You feel on stage as you were moving around?
*  And then I decided on Saturday.
*  No, not on stage.
*  Just mostly like when I wake up in the morning.
*  Yeah, I'm going a little too hard here. Right.
*  But I was what it really was, I wasn't stretching enough.
*  And everything was just tight because I was doing a lot of like
*  kettlebell shit and it was just tight.
*  And I spent like two and a half hours on Saturday,
*  just stretching in my hotel room, just stretching.
*  That's all I did. I just watched some YouTube videos and stretched.
*  And I felt 100 percent better. Yeah, of course.
*  And I was like, oh, you fucking idiot.
*  You should be doing this all the time. I know.
*  You don't put it.
*  I need to do like long stretch sessions like that all the time.
*  That's patience, man. Two and a half hours.
*  Yeah. You just watch YouTube.
*  Just put your phone down and watch some.
*  You have no excuse to not. I know.
*  I tell my sister that now, too, when she's like,
*  I need to find more time to, you know, exercise in this.
*  And I'm like, dude, you watch shows like already after work,
*  just like for even 20 minutes, like walk around and just, you know, space out.
*  But well, it's also if you want to exercise, like get on a some kind
*  of a cardio machine and watch a movie on an iPad.
*  Yeah, it's a cheat code. Yeah.
*  It's how I watch anything is is on the bike.
*  But it's the best way to distract yourself from the fact that you're exhausted.
*  Totally. If you watch a good movie with headphones on an iPad
*  on like a stationary bike. Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah. You can enjoy the movie.
*  Yeah. You actually can enjoy the movie and actually put in some serious cardio.
*  Yeah. And you'll be distracted.
*  So you won't be thinking about the fact you're exhausted on the bike.
*  You'll be thinking about, oh, my God, don't go in the basement. Yeah.
*  Take a look in the basement. I can't fucking believe this.
*  The movie is insane. This fucking movie is insane.
*  Yeah. Yeah. You know, what's especially a good thriller, you know?
*  Oh, yeah. That keeps you engaged. Yeah.
*  What's your go?
*  Well, what's your go to workout movie?
*  Or can you not watch? Are you rewatching?
*  Yes. John Wick.
*  John Wick's the greatest ever workout movie. Whoa. Ever. Yeah. Yeah.
*  I have a confession. Haven't seen it. Oh, my God.
*  It's like, let's watch it.
*  Saying she hasn't seen put it up, Jamie.
*  It's like a girl saying she hasn't seen Barbie, really. Right. Oh, wow.
*  Yeah. It's the most insanely violent movie of all time.
*  It's so on a rain. Yeah. So Keanu, it's so ridiculous.
*  And they've made 15.
*  They need four of them. Yeah. I think four. Right. Yeah.
*  I remember hearing this last one.
*  It was the talk of the town. People were like, it's a fun movie.
*  Yeah. But it's a really good movie to work out to because it's just so crazy.
*  Cool. Because like so many people are getting killed.
*  You just like, oh, yeah. Yeah.
*  You get in those extra reps to watching people engaged.
*  You get fired on combat. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.
*  It's a crazy movie.
*  Mortal Kombat. Remember when that became a game?
*  Remember when that was that I understood why my mom was like,
*  you can't play video games because I remember sitting downstairs.
*  I had my bar mitzvah.
*  She goes, I'm not buying you a video game system,
*  but you can use some of your Jew money to buy.
*  She didn't say that. She goes, she can buy some here.
*  She could buy what she did.
*  She goes, you can use some of your money from gifts to buy.
*  And so I bought a Super Nintendo and then more.
*  And then I got, I think, a Sega and then Mortal or my buddy had a Sega.
*  And we played Mortal Kombat.
*  And I remember just being like, what is happening right now?
*  We went from Street Fighter, which is, you know, throwing,
*  you know, herukets and whatnot, and then just ripping a guy's cock off. Yeah.
*  Yeah. You could kill people. Yeah.
*  Pull their fucking skull out with their spine attached to it. Pretty cool.
*  And then just go have a fucking crustable right after.
*  And it's very addictive. All those games are very. Do you ever a gamer? Yeah.
*  Yeah. What was your quake?
*  But it's just because they're fun. Yeah.
*  It's like they're not addictive because they suck. They're awesome. Yeah, dude.
*  They're just too awesome. Yeah. Like playing quake is too awesome.
*  It's crazy fast paced. You're shooting rockets of people.
*  They're electrocuting you to death. Yeah. It's nuts. Yeah. You know,
*  and it's it's such an adrenaline rush that you just don't want to stop.
*  You just want to go to the next game. Oh, yeah. The next game. Keep playing.
*  Keep playing. Next thing you know, you're exhausted. You're dehydrated.
*  You haven't had any food. Oh, yeah. Eight hours. Oh, yeah.
*  What's wrong with you? And then you have to go to bed.
*  You're lying about, what the fuck is wrong with me? Why am I still awake?
*  This is crazy. I've only played
*  Halo a handful of times.
*  My younger brother is pretty obsessed, but he's really good.
*  And I played it online and I was real high.
*  So I started to kind of get emotionally invested to where like
*  I see guys getting shot and I was like, fuck, I can't.
*  You know, my heart was beating so fast. It was too much.
*  I probably if I was sober, I would have been less.
*  You lost a comrade. Yeah.
*  Real connected to it.
*  I did. I was fucked up.
*  They have virtual reality ones now.
*  My friend, Matt Sarah, he plays these virtual reality.
*  With the goggles.
*  What's the one that Matt plays?
*  What is that? The game he plays that is population one population one.
*  So it's a VR shooter.
*  So he's running around with VR goggles on.
*  So he really feels like he's in the game.
*  And he's like, get down to shooting at each other and shit.
*  It's nuts. Oh, my God.
*  He's got the goggles on.
*  He's like in his fucking house, moving around.
*  Give me that security.
*  So you feel like you're in a war.
*  Like you're you're so immersed in it.
*  This this video game is now a whole next level experience.
*  Yeah. It's just in front of the computer is pretty involving.
*  Yeah. You get the headphones on, especially with these computer games.
*  Now have 3D sounds. You hear sound coming from there.
*  You know, yeah, over there.
*  You know, you run towards them, smack your wife. Yeah.
*  Yeah. I mean, yeah, it's that's that's another thing about these goddamn games.
*  You could beat the shit out of people.
*  Like there's a lot like what is it? Red Dead Red Dead Redemption, right?
*  Yeah. Where you like take someone and fucking tie a noose to their neck
*  and drag them behind your horse.
*  Do wild shit. You could drown a prostitute in the river.
*  Yeah. You could do wild shit.
*  And people like, hey, maybe you shouldn't be able to do this.
*  I fucking game.
*  This is a little crazy.
*  Seven year olds shouldn't be able to see that that's possible.
*  Yeah. It shouldn't be able to beat a prostitute with a shovel.
*  Yeah. Like, what are you doing?
*  Maybe a super soaker. Just hit her in the face or something.
*  Yeah. Something lighter.
*  Well, it's just the whole game is chaos.
*  I know. You know, it's like you.
*  But you could do chaos to anybody.
*  Just like Grand Theft Auto.
*  You could do chaos to anybody.
*  You know, first time playing that, though, and driving down
*  Sunset and seeing like the Comedy Store was pretty cool.
*  I think Grand Theft Auto, I think I've read this.
*  They were comparing the amount of money
*  that Grand Theft Auto has generated versus like almost any other
*  like movie game, like I believe it, Paris into how it does
*  to like big Hollywood blockbusters.
*  Like how much money has Grand Theft Auto generated?
*  I mean, that has got to be one of the most popular games of all time.
*  That may be it's about stealing cars and run point five billion dollars.
*  Yo, good call, dude.
*  Yo, we'll be right back.
*  That's a fucking holy shit, dude.
*  That's so much money. That's so much money.
*  Joe, that's wild. Thanks for pulling that.
*  Now, do you think you deserve that amount of money?
*  What have you done other than show teenagers
*  it's possible to beat, steal and rob from a hooker?
*  Hold that thought. We'll be right back.
*  Do you remember the guy who used to run bump fights?
*  And he came on Dr. Phil as Dr. Phil?
*  He shaved his head, the top of his head.
*  Joe, that's what we could do.
*  You want to come on the Dr. Phil live show with me?
*  That guy. All we got to do is throw a stash on you.
*  That guy, he fucking.
*  Phil goes, what are you doing?
*  And he goes, what? What? He goes, what are you doing?
*  What are you doing?
*  And he's like, I'm doing I'm doing what you're doing.
*  I'm exploiting people.
*  He's like, I don't like it.
*  Get out of here. Yeah.
*  Get out of here. There's Robin.
*  Dude, just kicked him off his set.
*  But it was weird, right?
*  Like you knew that's what he did, of course.
*  And you invited him on the show. Yeah.
*  He probably just didn't like that that path of the argument.
*  I guess that path is a legitimate path.
*  Do you think he knew?
*  Maybe he didn't know he was going to get in a full makeup,
*  because I'm sure Phil is not visiting the guests. Right.
*  Listen, this is not a surprise.
*  If you think if you think if you think I exploit people,
*  every time you bring a guest on this show, you exploit them
*  and spread whatever problems they have to the whole world.
*  You think that's helping them?
*  Keep telling yourself that you can go.
*  You know what?
*  Who do you think you are?
*  Bye. Come on.
*  Huh? No, I'm not finished talking to you.
*  Yeah, you are. No, I'm not.
*  Yeah, you are. Yeah, you're done.
*  Yeah, you are.
*  Don't even grab a complimentary Dr.
*  Phil hat. Just go.
*  I hate me right now.
*  I mean, this guy. Yeah.
*  Thing about that guy, though, is that guy,
*  that bum fights thing was crazy. It was why I paid people to pull their teeth out.
*  Yeah, it was. There's some awful, awful shit.
*  Yeah. You want to talk about using YouTube for the wrong reason?
*  Well, it wasn't YouTube. It wasn't.
*  No, these were cassettes.
*  This is like VHS is maybe my first taste of bomb.
*  When did when did what was bomb fights originally released on?
*  I don't believe it was YouTube.
*  I think it was pre YouTube.
*  Yeah, it was sold for twenty two bucks a piece.
*  So bum. So people were either.
*  DVDs, I guess.
*  Was bomb fights for people that couldn't get Girls Gone Wild?
*  What? Like, because those were both probably popping off.
*  Basically, what bomb fights was was a lot of shit that you see already on the Internet.
*  You see how many bomb fights have you actually seen on the Internet?
*  I've seen so many guys that are like on heroin
*  fistfight in the streets of Los Angeles.
*  Like this is a shitload of videos of bombs duking it out.
*  Their pants fall down.
*  Guy gets kicked in the head, knocked unconscious.
*  There's a lot of that that you can find.
*  I get sent it all the time by Tom Segura.
*  Really? Yeah, he sends me a cell phone.
*  But it's no Instagram.
*  Oh, yeah. Like terrible things that you can see people just doing to each other all over.
*  So the thing is like this guy made a living off of it, though.
*  And he was like selling these DVDs.
*  And I think we didn't want to admit that people want to see that.
*  Just like we don't want to admit people want to drown hookers and read that.
*  But they do. They do.
*  They do want to see that.
*  Yeah. If you let people slap each other in the face on television, people will tune in.
*  Oh, yeah. If you let people dress up like fucking medieval knights and sword fight,
*  people will watch. Yeah, that is 100 percent a fact. Yeah.
*  And back then we didn't want to believe that.
*  And there was no Internet.
*  So we didn't we didn't really understand our nature until the Internet came along.
*  Think about two girls, one cup.
*  Think about porn.
*  OK, think about the amount of porn that gets digested by the average
*  American male versus that of 1950.
*  Oh, God. There's a huge difference.
*  There's the guys were jerking off to underwear ads.
*  OK, guys were starving for things.
*  Now that's weird.
*  Yeah, they were jerking off to memory.
*  They didn't even they had no idea.
*  We had a lot of solid imaginations, probably.
*  That's all you need.
*  Back then, it was a good, good idea in your head.
*  That's why I tell you had it's all you had.
*  And then now everyone has a phone and anyone's phone can connect
*  to a plethora of porn sites.
*  Had a guy on my flight about three months ago.
*  No joke. Porn on the phone. No headphones.
*  Jesus. Yeah. Heard like heard.
*  Oh, fuck my butt. Fuck my.
*  And then was just kind of like like and then saw saw this.
*  You know, people kind of like turning people.
*  No one wanted to citizens arrest this guy.
*  So everyone was kind of like he probably was doing it to make people uncomfortable.
*  For sure. Yeah.
*  Because what is the law? It was wild.
*  I mean, I was two rows behind. Are you allowed to do that?
*  Like, what's the law?
*  I think it's probably illegal.
*  But right. I'm saying, yeah, like you shouldn't be looking at his.
*  But if you can hear it. Yeah.
*  Like, what is the law? Right.
*  Because it's like what if you're playing a podcast that's offensive?
*  What if you're playing a podcast on your phone that makes me upset?
*  And but you're playing it. I have to let's do it.
*  I'm getting upset. What is the law on that? Right.
*  I feel like you're allowed to do that. Right.
*  So if you're allowed to say like, fuck that guy and fuck this.
*  But you can't say fuck my butt.
*  It gets a little weird. Right.
*  It gets a little weird.
*  It's like it's his phone.
*  Why? Why are you even looking at what's on his phone?
*  You shouldn't be a fucking two rows back.
*  Put your headphones on.
*  How about stop paying attention to his phone?
*  But also, why does he have porn on his phone?
*  And it's loud. Right.
*  Like, I don't think is it a public is almost like urinating in a public decency thing?
*  Like you can't.
*  It's just like that, according to the law that I'm looking up.
*  You can't pee in public or watch someone talk about peeing. Right.
*  But can you listen? That's what I'm saying.
*  Like, what is the law in like?
*  Because are you a peeping Tom if you're listening?
*  Yeah. Defending convicted of watching porn in a parking lot
*  fails in constitutional challenge to public obscenity law.
*  Watching pornography in public in public serves no legitimate purposes
*  unless you want to fucking jizz like a racehorse.
*  You're trying to get first class to turn things up a notch.
*  Doing so with one's window down and at a restaurant's busy parking lot
*  and full view of families recklessly exposed pornography to young children.
*  Oh, well, this is a little different.
*  This is like a business.
*  And he got in there with his window rolled down and he's beaten off.
*  He might be a little bit of a freak.
*  But it depends on like, was he in the corner of the parking lot, away from everybody?
*  Yeah. I think was he by himself?
*  He's like, I just got to rub this out.
*  I got to make a decision right now.
*  I'm real confused.
*  You know, it could have been like a mental health totally thing.
*  Yeah. Like, look, I'm losing my mind here.
*  This thing says the public libraries can't block porn and it's not illegal to watch.
*  Wow. No way.
*  Is what this says. That's crazy.
*  Look at libraries staying cool and hip.
*  If that's true, how many people are jerking off in San Francisco in a library right now?
*  Oh, I don't know.
*  A thousand percent of the people attending the library.
*  Hundreds. Hundreds.
*  Yeah, I would certainly recommend against doing this.
*  One lawyer says.
*  But he said Missouri was scroll back up.
*  Yeah, it said under Missouri statutes,
*  depending on the exact circumstances, the prosecutor could file at least two different charges.
*  But this is Missouri.
*  Every state's different with that, too.
*  Right. But didn't wasn't the article about San Francisco or any public library?
*  Yeah, this is just public. Oh, it's any public.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Anywhere.
*  I almost got arrested for taking photos, mooting a camera when we were like 21 or something like.
*  That's how crazy San Francisco is.
*  I didn't say San Francisco.
*  I assumed.
*  Wow. I just assumed.
*  Right. We didn't even bring in my hand.
*  I'm like, that has to be San Francisco.
*  That's so crazy.
*  That's how crazy San Francisco has gotten, where a story comes up and it's almost like the Bernstein Bears.
*  What's that called? Yeah.
*  That thing when you the Mandela effect.
*  Yeah, the Bernstein Bear effect.
*  Yeah. Well, it's the Mandela.
*  These people thought the Mandela died in jail, but he didn't.
*  Right. And so there's this thing like people have like a whole narrative in their head.
*  It's like a glitch in the matrix type thing.
*  I think that might apply to this because it's like instantly I was like, oh, it happened in San Francisco.
*  I would have told the story.
*  I would have in my head I would have I would have gone on.
*  Did you hear what happened in San Francisco?
*  That's crazy that you can watch pornography in the fucking light.
*  Meanwhile, it's every library.
*  Wow. Every library.
*  That's that's is that one person making that kind of parking lot was in New Jersey.
*  Of course he is. You see you saw that.
*  Yeah. If you had a guess what state's going to produce the most parking lot jokers.
*  Did you do it on the top of the list?
*  Hear that story about the guy.
*  It was maybe a few years ago.
*  They might actually been during covid when everyone was doing big work zooms and the guy thought you were doing work zooms.
*  I'm sorry. Yeah.
*  And he stayed on.
*  He didn't turn his computer sound off.
*  It was one of those things where you log on for the zoom.
*  You know, the boss like, all right, guys, everyone's here, blah, blah.
*  And then you can just turn your screen off.
*  But he didn't turn his off.
*  Dude, one guy, there's fucking hundreds of guys.
*  I have a bit about it.
*  Hundreds of guys got caught doing that.
*  There was there was a Jeffrey Tubin guy, the CNN guy.
*  Yeah, that's I guess a famous.
*  Yeah. But it was like that's a wrap.
*  Right. You're fired.
*  He's back. Wow.
*  The Tubin guy's back.
*  But let's say it was like a Jamba Juice conference and you're on zoom and you get likely it's a wrap.
*  It's a wrap. But if you're a rapper, no big deal at all.
*  No. Whoops. I didn't know the camera was on.
*  Sorry. Sorry. Yeah.
*  Sorry. You're welcome.
*  Forgetting to see some beautiful.
*  Yeah, I don't think no one tells you're welcome if you're getting caught doing that.
*  But it's one of those things where it's just like an article from the UK where it says it's debatable
*  whether porn use is even illegal.
*  It should be. The best hope for prosecution currently looks to be an offense against public decency.
*  But what an archaic notion that sounds now.
*  Isn't that weird? When was this written?
*  If the government wants to retrieve any credibility from this debacle, it could order a legal review.
*  Can old laws be repurposed or is new legislation required?
*  That's interesting, because like when all these laws are put in place, they probably never anticipated porn on the Internet.
*  No. Especially the way it is now.
*  Great point. You know, we're talking about businesses that never got bailed out.
*  That's this is what imagine if I told you there was a business and this business
*  is going to eat up about 30 plus percent of all the Internet traffic.
*  And this business is used by some ungodly percentage of men, way more than it takes to elect a president.
*  Right. Was it take to elect a president?
*  You know, 51 percent. Yeah.
*  Way more than 51 percent of guys have used pornography.
*  But yet, when that business stopped making money because DVD sales went away, nobody talked about a bailout of porn.
*  Just shut the fuck up.
*  Bail out banks or bail out this business, not business.
*  And, you know, too big to fail, but not the porn business.
*  Everybody's like, I don't even know what you're talking about.
*  I don't know. Is it still real?
*  I don't even know they were making porn anymore.
*  I mean, I don't even watch it.
*  Did you see the Ashley Madison duck?
*  What is that? Ashley Madison was.
*  Oh, is that the dating site?
*  Yeah, the site for where people could have affairs.
*  Oh, that's right.
*  So it is a wild.
*  It's oh, they got doxed, right?
*  Didn't something happen? Yeah, they got hacked.
*  Yeah. Yeah. And and so they basically it was.
*  Yeah, people signed up to have a fair.
*  It was a wild folk.
*  Just a whole web show full of wild.
*  Oh, man. And a bunch of risk takers.
*  Just a bunch of people.
*  Just a lot of people doubling down and running away from their husband.
*  They're on 20s. Yeah.
*  Two o'clock in the afternoon.
*  Yeah. Fuck.
*  Meet me at the subway. Yeah.
*  Next to the KFC. Let's get wild.
*  Where's that my pants mask?
*  It was maybe that guy was in the parking lot getting ready for one of them.
*  It was wild, dude. Warming up.
*  Yeah. And then they interviewed a couple of couples that were all about
*  that were doing it together.
*  They were just like that were just swingers.
*  Yeah. Swingers are weird.
*  They're like they have a missing fuse.
*  It's like there's something in them. It's like it's different.
*  I met a few swingers through Brad Williams,
*  of course, because swingers and little people know each other.
*  Oh, really? There's a direct. Yeah, there's a.
*  Interesting. Yeah, they have the same agents. Yeah.
*  Just so I met my first through Brad,
*  porn stars, swingers and other little people through Brad and comedians.
*  But these these swingers were wild, dude.
*  I never I mean, I'm coming from small town North Seattle and like
*  I just I just even know
*  it's not something I just is in my zyka.
*  I never met. And so just talking to them so normally was just wild.
*  You know, I'm saying it was I did these gigs and I can't remember
*  what state it was somewhere in the south.
*  Might have been Nashville.
*  So I did this gig with Ari and we had this guy drive us from the club.
*  He picks us up at the hotel or at the airport, takes us to the hotel.
*  And then he's driving us to the gig.
*  And he's and everything's normal.
*  And then he eventually at the end of the weekend, he's driving us to the airport.
*  And when the guy drives the airport, he opens up about his swinger life
*  like out of nowhere.
*  He's like, you guys ever swing?
*  We have a swinging swinging club in town and we're like, swing.
*  Like, what do you mean?
*  He's like, you know, like we wife swap and and the like.
*  He goes, I've been doing it for a while.
*  I do. You like swinging?
*  He goes, oh, yeah, I love it.
*  Yeah, we swing.
*  You know, my wife, fuck.
*  So I get I get to decide, though, you know, like if he's too good looking
*  or he's too buff, I get to decide that I don't like that guy.
*  He she can't fuck that guy.
*  And they make like decisions like that.
*  Oh, my God.
*  And this guy just opened up to us out of nowhere.
*  What preceded that conversation?
*  Nothing like fucking zero today, huh?
*  Speaking of swinging, you guys like swinging like what?
*  Out of nowhere, this dude just chatted up about the guys.
*  He lets his wife fuck.
*  It was crazy. That's wild.
*  But he was one of them dudes that like had a ponytail, but it was also bald.
*  Like the whole thing was a mess. Of course.
*  It was chaos.
*  He was a human just example.
*  If you bring up swinging unprovoked, you have a ponytail.
*  He was a bizarre character, but it was just
*  I've only met a few groups of people that are like really into that.
*  And one of them was in I was doing the improv in Tampa.
*  And this is that once fun gig.
*  Yeah, fun gig.
*  And then this this for some of people were like, we're swingers.
*  You should come. We have a swinger convention like get the fuck out of here.
*  They look like people that would be swingers.
*  Just like just a mess.
*  Just a mess.
*  Tampa is the swinger capital of the U.S.
*  That's it.
*  No joke, I had a guy come up to me and proposition.
*  That's crazy. Me in Kansas City to
*  someone I was featuring for Harland, the Kansas City improv.
*  And he goes, you know, it's funny.
*  He's like, you know, being my wife, you guys doing it.
*  You won't fuck my wife.
*  And I was like, well, I had never been proposed like that.
*  Then she comes over. What are you guys talking about?
*  I go, oh, he's trying to say wants us to do something and he whatever.
*  She goes, what the fuck?
*  Had no clue that that was even I was like, oh, he said.
*  And then it was just super weird.
*  She's like, Darrell, what the fuck?
*  Why would you like I'm crazy?
*  But what the fuck? I would never do that.
*  And I'm like, oh, this guy must just be going around doing that.
*  That's his thrill. Yeah.
*  He wants someone to fuck his.
*  Or maybe he wanted me to say, yeah.
*  And then like beat you up. Yeah.
*  Could be could be a trap.
*  It was fucking wild because I could be sent a trap. Yeah.
*  Who knows? Who knows?
*  But it's just that's a weird culture.
*  But, you know, whatever. Not hurting anybody. Exactly.
*  Go fuck each other.
*  Yeah. Enjoy. They have clubs where they go and they're like, there's like a.
*  Oh, the eyes wide shut.
*  So people, yeah.
*  Fucking each other.
*  Some one of my friends, maybe it was Callan
*  told me he got a little bang bang party.
*  It's like in the 90s or something like that.
*  Of course it was.
*  Told me that he went to one of those and walked in.
*  People are fucking all over the place.
*  Those are things where you like drop your keys in the bowl or you put your phone
*  like writer.
*  No, that's like a party that they would like
*  throw their keys in the bowl.
*  And then the guy would reach in and pull out one of the women's keys.
*  The woman would reach in, pull out one of the guys keys.
*  And you figured out who you're going home with. Wow. Yeah.
*  And they just swap, swap wives. Dude.
*  I mean, then that became a show. Yeah.
*  Is that a wife swap? Yeah.
*  Of course it was. I wonder if it's real, though.
*  You know, those shows, they fuck around a lot with those shows.
*  They manipulate reality.
*  I remembered and found this recently.
*  It's a commercial from Ohio where I'm from.
*  Sunbubble Hot Tub, a hot tub place.
*  Oh, bro. We have a private room.
*  I love you for pulling this up.
*  We had one in Seattle called Tubbs.
*  Look, you just bring your kids.
*  Well, yeah, I mean, kids are swimming in fucking big jizz.
*  That's drop soup in there.
*  Twenty bucks an hour or something wild.
*  Oh, that's crazy.
*  But that's like couples.
*  That's very different.
*  Bro, we had a place like this.
*  We had Tubbs in near a comedy club near Giggles.
*  You play Giggles in Seattle.
*  That was the first one I first did in open mic.
*  Giggles in Seattle.
*  I did Giggles in Saugus, Massachusetts.
*  OK, cool.
*  It was the one comedy club, I guess, in the 90s that was thriving
*  near the University of Washington, and they had a place called Tubbs there.
*  But we also have a place called Tubbs Subs, a sandwich place.
*  So that's all I know about.
*  I'm a little fat kid thinking about sandwiches.
*  And my friend's dad would leave in soccer practice.
*  I'd score to my own team.
*  That was he called me a fucking idiot.
*  That was a rap for me in soccer.
*  And so we're driving by and he's like, and I see Tubbs.
*  I'm like, oh, Tubbs.
*  I'm like, we should stop and get some food.
*  You know, we just lost a score to my own team.
*  Some sandwiches sounds good.
*  And he's like, oh, that's not they don't do sandwiches there.
*  It was just the same name.
*  And I was like, oh, what happens there is like people rent rent hot tubs
*  and they go in there and just kind of hang out.
*  I was like, I had no clue.
*  What do you mean hang out?
*  So they go in there. You meet somebody, you bring them in, you have some fun.
*  No clue. And then like, you know, ten years later, I'm like, oh,
*  people were just going there just to fuck like you said, just in a hot tub.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  It's probably better than a hotel room for sure.
*  And it's a hot tub. Who doesn't love a hot tub?
*  Yeah. People just want to go and bang it out.
*  Or maybe on a date and you get a wild hair.
*  Want to go to a hot tub room?
*  How do you feel?
*  Dude, let's go.
*  How do you feel about hotel hot tubs when you're on the road?
*  Yeah. Thank you.
*  What are the odds that's clean?
*  That's dangerous. I know, dude.
*  That's literally you know, a guy got Legion Neers disease from a hot tub in L.A.
*  What is that disease?
*  Oh, it's like a disease that's like archaic.
*  It's like one of those old world diseases that's not supposed to be around anymore.
*  And this guy got it from a fucking hot tub.
*  Oh, God. See if you can find that article.
*  I'm pretty sure it was California that it happened.
*  Yeah, they never clean my memories a little foggy on where it was.
*  I feel like it's but maybe I'm thinking everything crazy is in California today.
*  You know, I assume that other story was from San Francisco.
*  Yeah. But this guy, he got in a stanky ass hot tub
*  and he got Legion Neers disease and fucking died.
*  You can die for he died. Yeah, he died.
*  Do you have it? Because if you not, I saved the article. Yeah.
*  Man, I definitely saved it on my phone because I was like, this is the craziest.
*  Just going to relax.
*  So is in twenty twenty three.
*  California spas believe to be the source of an outbreak of Legion Neers disease.
*  Oh, God. They cause the illness of multiple people and the deaths of two.
*  Contra Costa Health announced Monday it has been investigating
*  Zen Day Spa and Contra Costa, California since August.
*  How about you step in and fuck?
*  How about don't investigate?
*  Just fucking test the water. That's so crazy.
*  One dead, eleven sick in the Legion Neers disease outbreak in Napa.
*  Oh, my God. It's a hot tub disease.
*  Yeah, that's that's got to be a man who died of Legion Neers disease
*  from Bay Area Spa was celebrating his birthday.
*  Oh, God, dude, a hot tub birthday gone wrong.
*  It's your birthday.
*  I want to take you to the hot. You got a group on.
*  Oh, my God. So do all the other people that jizzed in that pond.
*  That's what's so disgusting.
*  It's probably just a combination of jizz meets shit.
*  This has become this monster virus that kills people
*  that are trying to celebrate their birthday.
*  What the fuck? Yeah. Bring your kids.
*  Bring your kids to the spa.
*  Legion Neers disease.
*  What is that? What is have a health permit?
*  Oh, why should they? It's only a spa where you're naked.
*  It's wild. That type of water.
*  Why would they have a health permit?
*  Why would they even check? Yeah. Hot tub is a wild invention.
*  I mean, even a public hot tub is just such a wild idea.
*  Yeah. Like, what are you doing?
*  Water that gets hot like that is so perfect for bacteria.
*  Yeah, it's so wonderful.
*  If you don't have the right amount of poison in there,
*  which is what it is, we pour chlorine in there.
*  You just kill everything that's alive.
*  Severe pneumonia. Oh, wow.
*  It's a severe form of pneumonia lung inflammation, usually caused by infection.
*  It's caused by a bacterium known as Legion.
*  Why did they name it Legion Neers disease?
*  Let's Google that because it sounds like some shit that happened in the old world.
*  It does.
*  There's a bunch of diseases that are starting to emerge
*  in the homeless community in Los Angeles that are ancient diseases.
*  No shit from what? They got typhus just from being disgusting.
*  The American Legion State Convention in Philadelphia.
*  What? OK, it's it's commonly known as Legion Legion
*  Nellosus, which is a generic term for respiratory
*  infection caused by the Legionary Legionella bacteria.
*  This disease is named after a deadly outbreak of pneumonia in 1976
*  that occurred during people attending the American Legion's State Convention
*  in Philadelphia. Legionella sounds like Coachella for people
*  that have swallowed a lot of hot tub come. So.
*  So that's why they named it Legion Neers disease,
*  because it happened during that.
*  That was the outbreak. Oh, man. Wow.
*  Wow. Yeah, no, thanks.
*  What is the American Legion?
*  What's that?
*  Was the convention of the American Legion?
*  Do you know what that is?
*  Led to the name of the Legionnaires disease. No clue.
*  But what is the American Legion?
*  How many veterans association wartime veterans?
*  Oh, my God.
*  And it advocating wartime veterans and they die
*  from a fucking disease that and then they name it after the Legion.
*  Wow. Which is like really bad for business.
*  Really bad for business. Yeah.
*  I should have done that to them.
*  Don't call it Legion Neers disease.
*  Don't name it after us, you fucking assholes.
*  Call it some fucking weird Latin name
*  and come up with some spooky monkey pox type definition.
*  Don't call it.
*  Don't name it after us.
*  Imagine somebody caught pneumonia and they called it mothershipitis.
*  And they got mother people dying from mothershipitis.
*  I can't you fuck it.
*  You be pissed. Don't do that.
*  It just happened to be there.
*  It's not the Legionnaires.
*  It's not the Legion Center that was the problem.
*  They didn't do anything wrong. No.
*  But they probably had some dudes
*  that were coming back from Thailand.
*  You know what I'm saying? One thousand percent.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Where does Herpes get his name?
*  Old dudes that come back from Thailand.
*  Oh, yeah. With everything.
*  They go over there for like four months of the year.
*  Come back looking like, who knows?
*  Who knows? Who knows?
*  You look it around real quick.
*  Yeah. There was a meme that I saw today of this older man
*  like he's in his 60s and he's holding hands
*  with two hot Asian girls.
*  And it was saying something about like when I cash my V.A.
*  check and I disappear, don't worry about me.
*  Cool. Because I'll be in some strange country.
*  Oh, yeah. Where there's rampant sex trafficking.
*  Oh, my God. I know, right?
*  I thought you were going to bring up the 91 year old
*  who just died and who was married to a 42 year old.
*  What are you talking about?
*  Ninety one year old billionaire I just saw today that died.
*  Well, it's true love. That's what's important.
*  That's what's beautiful. She's probably hot as fuck.
*  She's probably super, super hot as fuck.
*  She was way into him.
*  Let's see what he and she looked like.
*  He had a great personality.
*  That gives me hope for the future.
*  If everything goes sideways, you know, like you should be.
*  Men should be happy because that's even possible.
*  They can trick. There you go.
*  Look at that. Totally looks like they would love each other.
*  And it's like Mr.
*  Bean's dad. Yeah.
*  She looks like she should be married to a farmer.
*  Some big old buff farmer.
*  How does she even meet this?
*  Well, I mean, I guess, yeah, probably some billionaire dating.
*  Yeah. He gained fame through high profile dates
*  just weeks after marrying his sixth wife.
*  She yeah, she got a pillow over that, dude.
*  You think? Yeah, yeah.
*  But if you're a woman and, you know, you're 40
*  and this guy's nice and he's worth fucking
*  30 billion dollars, you want to marry you.
*  Let's go. Let's go. Let's fucking go.
*  I know I can I can deal with you.
*  Maybe she likes him.
*  Maybe she even likes him.
*  Maybe she also likes being super fucking rich.
*  Totally. Why not?
*  She might like that a little bit more.
*  Yeah, like people were always about member Anna Nicole Smith.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Jay Howard Marshall. Yeah.
*  And people like they knew what it was.
*  But guess what? He knew what it was, too.
*  Totally. He was having a good time.
*  It was caused by a tough bike workout.
*  Oh, wow. He's rushed the hospital crippling back pain.
*  And the ruptured heart valve.
*  Wow. Blew his heart out.
*  Probably thinking about talking there.
*  1000 percent. Yeah, he's still like, oh, yeah, I'm going to give it to her tonight.
*  Forty nine year age difference.
*  So let it go.
*  Oh, look at that one right there. Is that her?
*  Oh, the previous one. Damn.
*  Let me see that one.
*  That was even more preposterous.
*  No, scroll up so I can see.
*  Oh, this guy's doing it forever.
*  That's the most preposterous. Yeah, that's perfect.
*  That's what I like to see.
*  It does give me hope that. Yeah.
*  Yeah, because you can be disgusting.
*  Also, it gives me hope that it like, I don't know how old it was.
*  80, 90. But like, bam.
*  That's what that's what I'm talking about.
*  Well, how about that?
*  Even like Betty White before she passed was saying how like she was like,
*  I think at 99, maybe that like there was some article I read and she was just
*  like talking about like still banging it out. Wow.
*  Yeah, dude. Wild.
*  Old ladies don't give a fuck. Oh, no.
*  They're not worried about your approval anymore.
*  Dude, that's she'll tell you who she fuck.
*  She'll tell you.
*  Was that guy who owns the Raiders?
*  He's got like a really hot 24 year old girlfriend. Oh, yeah.
*  He's got that crazy mo haircut.
*  Yeah, dude, that guy's what a guy's character.
*  He looks like he truly looks like a Nickelodeon cartoon character.
*  Did he? Is he having a baby? Is that what's going on?
*  Well, or is it and Bill Belichick's got a young girl?
*  I mean, Pacino's got I mean, fuck, dude, Pacino's a dad at 92 or whatever.
*  Is that normal? That's totally normal.
*  Seems like it's going to work out.
*  What the fuck?
*  It's so it's so I think Pacino wanted to take a paternity test, too,
*  to make sure it was his like, what?
*  I'm shooting live rounds. Yeah.
*  At fucking 90 years old.
*  How is that possible? Yeah, it can't be.
*  But it is. Yep.
*  That's the crazy thing about men.
*  Men can keep having babies when they're geriatrics.
*  But women, like nature says, that's rap.
*  They get to a certain age.
*  They go through menopause and that's a rap.
*  But the dudes can just keep impregnating gals.
*  Yeah. Bam, son. What's up?
*  He looks like he.
*  Oh, I mean, this. Yeah.
*  Bam. Yeah. Wow.
*  Mystery woman. Oh, she's a mystery woman.
*  She's a mystery. She's hot.
*  That's not a mystery.
*  Congratulations for him. Yeah, you did it.
*  This is a fun thing about that.
*  But when you see it the other way, you get creeped out.
*  Yeah. Like if you saw Betty White with like Thor, you'd be like, what the fuck?
*  What's going on there? Yeah. Kind of gross.
*  Yeah. Why are you doing that to that old lady?
*  Yeah. You'd be worried about Betty White. Yeah.
*  Yeah. You would take it.
*  You heard the way you would have sex with a young lady,
*  because that's disturbing. Yeah, that's tough.
*  What are you doing to her?
*  Can she even take that kind of abuse?
*  Maybe she could. Jesus.
*  Maybe she wanted it.
*  Maybe she's just one of them old school ladies, immigrant ladies with strong bones.
*  Oh, God. Stiff spine.
*  Harlan used to do a joke.
*  When I'd open for Harlan, he would do a joke where he'd go,
*  he'd take somebody's tortilla chip out of the front front row.
*  And you go, here's my impression of a 75 year old woman having sex.
*  And then he would just crinkle the chip into the mic.
*  And it was like it sounded exactly like everything breaking.
*  And yeah, yeah, it sounds wrong.
*  Right. But like an old guy,
*  like having sex with a hot young lady, like go Pops.
*  Kind of a cool way to go out, too.
*  Yeah, sure. I guess. Yeah.
*  Actually, yeah, maybe not.
*  Then I guess everyone's looking at you like, oh, you couldn't
*  you couldn't keep it together enough.
*  There is. Oh, this is the one.
*  She's not. They're not. This is like a weird. Oh, it's wildly untrue.
*  Yeah. Well, of course it is.
*  People love saying silly shit. That's not true.
*  Hopkins is pictured sitting next to Davis in December 2022,
*  fueling rumors that to romantically involved, but they're not.
*  But we're hoping we're hoping that he can get a girl like that.
*  That's what it is. Right.
*  You're hoping. Oh, you're not going.
*  Oh, my God, because he's so old that he's passed the creepy into the novelty.
*  Yep. Right. So there's a creepy firm.
*  The creepy version is like, you know, a guy who's in his 60s
*  is dating a girl who's 20. Right. That seems creepy.
*  But if a guy is in his 70s, yeah, he's dating a girl.
*  20 is like, OK, yeah, it's so ridiculous.
*  Why is yeah, a little more acceptable.
*  It is what it is. I know, you know, it is what it is.
*  You know what it is. I know what it is.
*  Everyone knows that.
*  Like, you don't know what it is.
*  He probably knows it is. He was exactly what it is.
*  He lies to himself.
*  That's fine. That's all know what it is. That's his deal.
*  So when it's 60 and 20 or 50 and 20, we feel like that person
*  is probably taking advantage of that 20 year old. Potentially. Potentially.
*  Yeah, maybe not.
*  Maybe she's a real mature 20. Sure. That could be.
*  Possibly. OK, I can deal with that.
*  But there's a weirdness.
*  If it's like a 60 year old guy and a 20, that makes me creeped out.
*  Oh, my God. That's too. That's too old. Oh, yeah.
*  But if it's a 70 year old guy and a 20 year old, you're like, it's OK.
*  My buddy went to school and there was a 45 year old dating a 20 year old
*  in there in college. That felt very weird.
*  But it wouldn't be weird if it was a 20 year old guy.
*  This is my problem with it all.
*  Like a 20 year old, let's assume that men and women are equal.
*  Right. A 20 year old man and a 45 year old lady is great.
*  Like, no problem. Like, look at her.
*  She got a hot young guy.
*  No one cares at all. Yeah. At all.
*  It would be weird, but not weird where you would think, oh, that lady's a creep.
*  No. Right. No.
*  But like a 49 year old guy, a 20 year old girl, you're like, hmm.
*  I mean, maybe. Same thing with the teachers.
*  I'm not one to tell people what to do.
*  But if it was the other way around, like Cher, like Cher is what?
*  How old is Cher now?
*  Don't ask the lady your age.
*  How old is she? She's 77. Wow.
*  I was going to say, wow.
*  OK. But listen, that doesn't bother me at all.
*  Right. That is what it is, too. Yeah. Right.
*  It is what it is. You know what it is. Yeah.
*  You know what it is. You know what it is.
*  I know what it is. She knows what it is.
*  Everyone knows what it is. We all know what it is.
*  We all know that. And we're fine. We're fine with it.
*  But it's just you can still go about your day and eat pizza.
*  Let them live their life.
*  So like a 49 year old lady and a 91 year old guy like fine.
*  Let me ask you this. When you heard about Mary Kay Laterno,
*  that happened in Seattle where I'm from.
*  And that was the first teacher that like was fucking around the kid.
*  That was that age gap was like, I think, 35 and 12.
*  But also she listen, she's the first teacher to get caught.
*  There it is. Yeah.
*  They were there as freaks all over this fucking planet.
*  Wow. Freaks. Also women that are just as crazy.
*  He was charming. Some men are crazy and some women are crazy.
*  And some women are crazy and they have great features.
*  Yeah. And they're just nuts.
*  And they want to blow the whole football team.
*  And they don't go fuck who tells who, what, who cares.
*  They get into teaching for that reason.
*  Well, who knows why they got into teaching, but they're crazy people.
*  And then some people just have no impulse control and they want to get
*  teenagers drunk and maybe they want to relive their high school
*  and freak these young boys out and suck their cocks. Wow.
*  Suck their cocks in front of their friends.
*  Oh, I can't believe it's happening.
*  You imagine the math teachers got her tits out and she's blowing you.
*  You're like, what am I seeing? How is this even real?
*  I don't know what I would do.
*  Bro, and they're always in Florida.
*  How many of them like if I hear a story like that, like I think of another story.
*  It's San Francisco.
*  Probably if it's a teacher fucking her students, I go probably Florida.
*  So hot blonde with big tits.
*  Tampa teacher took the pickleball team. Oh, Jacksonville.
*  No, Tampa. Yeah. The swinger state swinger state.
*  It's just something in the water out there.
*  It is probably alligator farts. They're fearing.
*  Everybody confused.
*  The methane in the air from alligators fart and it's got everybody high.
*  They are fearless down there. Yeah.
*  Hurricane warnings, they don't give a fuck.
*  Well, they do give a fuck, but there's not much you can do.
*  Well, do those people choose to live down there?
*  Like that is the fucking gamble you play.
*  But don't you ever see those stories when like they're like a thousand mile an hour
*  winds coming through and then some guys just like, I ain't going anywhere.
*  I built this house. He's ready to die.
*  Some people just ready to check out.
*  That's what it is.
*  And if God's going to take them out by flattening their house,
*  sucking you out of your house, they're like, I'm not leaving.
*  I don't want to go anywhere. I kind of respect that.
*  Yeah. Maybe the cars don't have any gas.
*  They don't have any money for gas.
*  You know, if you're going to drive away from a hurricane,
*  you are going to have bumper to bumper traffic for a day.
*  You ever been that? You ever seen it? Oh, yeah.
*  Did you ever get stuck in one of those? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
*  Like just a big pile up for hours and no, like a hurricane.
*  Oh, okay. Oh, shit.
*  Now it's a unique pile up because the whole state's trying to leave.
*  Like the highways are not set up where everybody can leave.
*  The highways are set up for normal stuff.
*  So you're better.
*  Normal stuff is you're going there, but I'm going there.
*  We're not all going there.
*  So if everyone's going there, I did.
*  We might as well just park that back up.
*  Yeah. Think about that.
*  Yeah. Normal traffic is we're all going all over the place.
*  Yeah. I got to go to the east.
*  You got to go to the west. That's fine.
*  We could have multiple cars going there.
*  Rarely is everybody going all going that way.
*  Yeah. That's fucked.
*  That is so fucked.
*  Look at this, dude.
*  This is what it's like.
*  Fifty six hours on the road to escape from Hurricane Irma.
*  Fifty six hours. That's what that looks like.
*  That's why you don't live there.
*  You don't live there unless you have a fucking private jet.
*  Or a helicopter.
*  Yeah. To get the fuck out of there.
*  Because if you get stuck in that shit and arguably less safe. Right.
*  Or it depends on when you leave.
*  Yeah. OK.
*  Because the thing about the modern storm,
*  the way they're the meteorologists, the way they're able to predict
*  the paths of these things, they're pretty good.
*  They're pretty fucking accurate.
*  And they see them coming pretty far away.
*  So you get a couple of days.
*  But that's 56 hours.
*  56 fucking hours.
*  Look, that's what it looks like.
*  So nothing is set up for that, dude.
*  Nothing is set up where see they have both lanes on both sides going this way.
*  No one's going the other way.
*  You notice that?
*  So they change the lanes.
*  So instead of on the right lane, people going forward in this one.
*  They're going back. Nope.
*  Everyone's going the same fucking way.
*  That's wild. Yeah.
*  And no amount of podcasts can get you through that drive or roadhead.
*  Like you're just like you might not have the money for the gas.
*  Right. OK.
*  Like you're going to run out of gas.
*  This is what's going to pull over and get gas.
*  You better hope they have gas because a lot of times they run out of gas.
*  Yeah. In a lot of places, they run out of gas and there's hurricanes.
*  So you have to have a full tank.
*  You have to make sure your car is not a gas guzzler.
*  Yeah. You're going to have to shut it off, maybe,
*  because you're stuck in the middle of this fucking road.
*  It's not going anywhere because there's 10 million people on the same road.
*  That's a mindset that people don't take into consideration
*  when they think about living in places like that.
*  You have to take into consideration the fact that everyone has to go in one direction.
*  Not good. And Florida is shaped like a dick. Right.
*  So it's a narrow ass bullshit state and everybody's going towards the north.
*  That's what's scary about L.A. too, even with these like last few earthquakes happening.
*  I'm like, oh, man, dude, like it's it.
*  We're just not set up in a
*  a leave town. Oh, no, no.
*  L.A.'s not set up like that at all.
*  For example, Texas, one for six, which travels through Liberty County,
*  dumps 600000 people into a county with only 70000 residents.
*  Oh, that makes sense.
*  Do you know how insane that is?
*  600000 people in a place that only has 70000 residents.
*  That's crazy.
*  Thousands of people ran out of gas.
*  Their cars overheated from all the inching along, causing many to stop
*  and sleep along the highway.
*  Thief reports of price gouging by convenience store owners inundated with customers.
*  Crazy. The death of 24 Bel Air nursing home residents
*  who died when their chartered bus caught fire and exploded at about six forty five a.m.
*  Oh, my God. Clogging on traffic clogging.
*  So the car overheat and caught fire.
*  So that's happening just with the influx of people. Right.
*  There's just cars popping off.
*  And dude, when you're when you got to get the fuck away from a hurricane, that is.
*  Have you been in one or any sort of tornado? Not like that.
*  No, nothing like that. Any desire.
*  Hurricanes that had made it all the way like Gloria made it all the way to Boston.
*  When I was a kid, that was a that was a but it wasn't.
*  Do you want a shelter and all that?
*  No, it wasn't that scary.
*  It wasn't by the time it got all the way up to Boston.
*  It wasn't it was nothing like the tropical ones.
*  The ones where you're catching them hot off the ocean.
*  Yeah. And you're you're getting those fucking Florida Keys, those fucking Miami ones.
*  Oh, yeah. Bro, those are bananas. Take you down.
*  I was in a rainstorm once in Miami where the whole highway had to stop.
*  Whole highway stop because you couldn't see anything.
*  You couldn't see a goddamn thing.
*  The whole highway stopped.
*  It's wild how long people drive still to with you when you just can't see.
*  No, no one was driving. OK, this.
*  It was so bad. No one was driving.
*  I was doing a gig in Miami.
*  Eddie Bravo was doing a Jiu Jitsu seminar in Miami.
*  I was doing a gig in West Palm.
*  That's what it was. And I had to go down and travel to Miami with him.
*  We had to stop on the highway. Stop dead.
*  The whole highway. Oh, my God.
*  It was white. You couldn't see anything.
*  It's like apocalypse.
*  It was. It's how long that wasn't that long because they just dumps.
*  And then it goes away in a few minutes and becomes passable where it's just raining.
*  Now, it's not so insane that no one can see. Right.
*  But you've never seen that before.
*  You've never been in like a tropical place. Yeah.
*  That was a normal rainstorm.
*  That wasn't like a hurricane warning. Right.
*  They just get so bananas.
*  You can't fucking see a car in front of you.
*  You can't see anything. So fucking nuts. Yeah, dude.
*  I had to go into shelter once.
*  Tornado, my grandparents and mom from Oklahoma.
*  And when they were living there, we went into the shelter.
*  Tornado people like we were down there with people that were just like,
*  we might have to live down here.
*  This could be the new.
*  You know, this like it was my grandparents,
*  a few of their friends and people that were just like went to the shelter.
*  And I'm fucking 10 surrounded by true doomsday guys.
*  They were just like, this is where we live now.
*  Like you might need to.
*  And you look like you're the fattest kid here, young Adam.
*  So we might need to be chomping on those beef jerky titties.
*  It was wild. But just even just the idea that like, oh, we're
*  running away from this was was wild because Seattle.
*  We didn't have any of that growing up.
*  We just had, you know, torrential rain or whatnot.
*  One time when we were at the Nashville airport,
*  we had to go into the tornado shelter.
*  There was tornadoes in Nashville, but nothing happened.
*  Right. We got lucky.
*  That that's the craziest one.
*  The craziest one is tornadoes because you can't even predict those.
*  Those just show up.
*  You see twister? No, I didn't.
*  I didn't see the new. I saw the old one.
*  I didn't see the new one. I heard the new one's good.
*  It's wild. Is it good? It's awesome.
*  Yeah. The effects are wild, dude.
*  I mean, they can do now is like compared to the old twister.
*  Oh, my God. Dude. Yeah.
*  Helen, you believed Helen Hunt was in danger. Right.
*  We were very concerned for Helen Hunt.
*  And now you're I mean, it's I thought about going to one of those theaters.
*  I want to know how you feel about this.
*  The ones that like shake the seats and that.
*  Yeah. No, thanks. Fuck that.
*  Well, as people freaking out around me,
*  that's going to see a fucking heart.
*  But I mean, she she the seat is shaking. Oh, yeah.
*  People start screaming. No, thanks.
*  Yeah. Too real. Too much of a mind fuck.
*  Yeah. Maybe in some movies would be cool.
*  You know, when I worked at Universal Studios, they had a Shrek 4D.
*  And so like when Shrek or when Donkey would sneeze, you get,
*  you know, blown with snot and stuff. Right. Right.
*  People like that. But that's a theme park.
*  You know, I hosted the Fear Factor live show at Universal.
*  No way. Yeah, that's hilarious.
*  And it was not anything close to your show.
*  But it was like, you know, but you have to make people think like,
*  you know, the first stunt was like, these guys are going to be hanging on
*  to these, you know, bike handlebars 30 feet in the air.
*  And there's a platform below them.
*  And when the platform drops out, you hear the sound effect.
*  They got to hang on.
*  And but they're attached to a bungee bungee cord.
*  So there's no real danger of all of it.
*  And then it was the only real thing that was kind of close to the show
*  was the eating of stuff.
*  It was like we have this picture of like sour milk and, you know,
*  beaver clits and just all this.
*  It was just crazy shit.
*  And one guy projectile vomited on me.
*  And I said, what the fuck into the mic in front of 1500 kids?
*  And I got suspended for a week because I cursed in front of kids.
*  But I was threw up in your mouth. Yeah, dude.
*  What do you want? Perfection.
*  You got a Fear Factor show. Dude. Yeah, it was wild.
*  Hilarious that you hosted that. It was nuts, dude.
*  I mean, it was very I mean, dude, the show was so I love the criss.
*  Yeah, dude, it's a small club.
*  Mary Fuck Hill.
*  That is that.
*  Did you ever go to Universal when you were there with the kids?
*  Are you sure? Yeah, I probably saw you.
*  I was Wolverine there for three years.
*  I did. You know what?
*  I used to love it. Universal, the the zombie place.
*  Oh, my God. It was awesome.
*  Fucking what am I thinking?
*  Walking Dead. The walking dead maze.
*  Yeah, that's fun. It's incredible.
*  That's fun. Yeah, that's pretty scary.
*  We had during Halloween Horror Nights before they put a clamp down on it.
*  But I dressed up as Scarface zombie.
*  So I was Pacino zombie.
*  So I'm just chasing people around, scare them.
*  And oh, shit.
*  Is that you as Wolverine?
*  That's me, dude, for about four years.
*  That's hilarious. Yeah.
*  The that whole.
*  The shit out of people.
*  Universal has a great Waterworld thing, too.
*  Like Waterworld, the movie.
*  It was not that good.
*  But Waterworld, the like show.
*  The show's the best part.
*  It's fucking great. Oh, yeah, it is better than the actual Waterworld.
*  Right. Isn't it crazy?
*  Costars like they banked on a movie that turned out to be a tremendous flop.
*  That's insane.
*  And they put together a theme show for a movie that was a tremendous flop.
*  Yeah. But the theme show is so good that people still come to see it.
*  Oh, yeah. About a movie that no one cares about.
*  Bro, it's wild.
*  They spent so much money on Waterworld.
*  Millions of dollars. Maybe billions.
*  One of those things where it sounded like it just didn't work out.
*  Didn't work. The pitch must have been like, so just it's like
*  last of the Mohicans on water and the guy from Field of Dreams and Tin Cup.
*  I like it. Jet skis. Yeah.
*  Dude, there were days when you'd see people do some of my universal days
*  where I'd see a guy dressed as SpongeBob.
*  I mean, I was a 1940s cop was the best job I had there because I wasn't from anything.
*  I'd improvise as Wolverine and make and do bits.
*  And my boss was like, Wolverine's not funny.
*  Stop doing fucking stand up because I'm doing open mics at this time.
*  So my 1940s cop walking around can make fun of people, do whatever.
*  And at one point, I picked up a squirt gun that was on a kiosk.
*  It was like 120 out.
*  And I'm just shooting people with it and do all these bits.
*  And Japanese tourists walk by and I'd shoot this one guy in the back.
*  And then all these people were watching me and I'd be like, I didn't know what was happening.
*  And my boss pulls me over and she goes, what are you doing?
*  This is 1940s New York, this part of the park.
*  There's a New York people out of the window. There's a cabbie.
*  You're supposed to be making people think this is 1940s New York.
*  And I go, Jenna, with all due respect,
*  a trolley just drove by with Fievel, Curious George and SpongeBob Squarepants
*  blasting the song, Ooh, ooh, ah, ah, Ching Chang, Walla Walla, Bing Bang.
*  And I was like, I'm not a history buff, but I'm pretty sure that song
*  wasn't also a part of the 40s.
*  And she's like, it's your job to make people think that this is 1940s New York.
*  And I was like, fuck, I got to get out of here.
*  Jesus, it's your job to make people retarded.
*  What does that mean?
*  And I was like, people are walking out thinking that
*  I didn't make them think that this is then they shouldn't be in the park
*  in the first place. That's ridiculous.
*  Wild. That's funny.
*  That's like people that go to those fairs, those Renaissance fairs.
*  And then some people like break character and the other people
*  like try to talk to them in character.
*  Oh, yeah. You ever see that happen? Oh, yeah.
*  That's hilarious. Oh, yeah.
*  I broke character all the time.
*  Dude, John, Dave Matthews came in one time with his family.
*  I'm in full 1940s cop.
*  And he's like, you know, I can get a beer.
*  And I was like, yeah, come with me.
*  There's one Irish pub down here. I'll take you to it.
*  And I just seen him the night before.
*  I go, dude, you guys fucking crushed it last night.
*  And he goes, oh, shit. He goes, can you break character?
*  I go, dude, I don't want to be here.
*  Fuck. Yeah.
*  And then I went and he offered to get me a shot of this bar.
*  And I was like, dude, you ruined the experience for him.
*  You ruined it for Dave Matthews.
*  He was like, he's breaking character.
*  This is bullshit. I wanted to get the cop thing.
*  I paid for the cop. I paid for the cop thing.
*  This is bullshit. Yeah, dude.
*  Dave Matthews. That's funny. Cool as fuck.
*  That whole universal rides thing is the best thing is the Harry Potter thing.
*  A thousand percent.
*  That fucking roller coaster with the dragons. Oh, yeah.
*  Oh, my God. It's incredible.
*  Yeah. You don't get sick from those.
*  No. Yeah. No, I'm lucky.
*  I don't have the motion sickness.
*  Yeah. The motion sickness thing is a weird one.
*  You can't read in a car. You can't, you know, it's what?
*  Yeah. Just try to dream. I mean, is your fucking cocaine?
*  You can throw up from reading in a car. Oh, yeah. Real weird.
*  Your brain gets so confused.
*  Like, why am I looking at something that's stationary when I know my body's in motion?
*  I know. Doesn't make sense.
*  Your body does not like it. Yeah. At all.
*  And your body's like, you must be sick.
*  You have to tell it. I'm not sick, bitch.
*  I'm looking at my phone. I know.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  I tried to read a book once in a car and I was fighting off the nausea.
*  I was like, don't be a pussy.
*  And then I was like, oh, my God, you can't fight it anymore.
*  It was like, just happened. Yeah.
*  No, I held it in. Oh, you did.
*  But I was like, you know, where it like comes up in your throat
*  and you have to swallow it back down and it burns your throat.
*  You know those feelings?
*  I was right there. I had a kid have to do that in science class.
*  He had to eighth grade.
*  And the teacher found a Mr.
*  Moore cut Joe and told such RIP.
*  And he had a big thing of chew in his mouth.
*  And Mr. Moore goes, Mr.
*  Anton, such as a little he looked like David the gnome.
*  Huge beard. You couldn't see his eyes barely.
*  His beard came up to here.
*  Big fucking, you know, fro.
*  And he goes, Mr. Anton, such I see that chew in your mouth.
*  And he was like, I don't know what you're talking about.
*  He goes, swallow made him swallow it, dude.
*  Puked right after. That's crazy.
*  Wish that story was better.
*  I'd be mad at that teacher.
*  You can't make my kids swallow chew. You fucking fucking 1995.
*  Bad for you.
*  Really bad. Mr.
*  Moore gave a fuck.
*  Poison, Mr. Morgan, you piece of shit.
*  How about you shave your stupid fucking face to cocksucker?
*  You could tell this guy.
*  I mean, he was a tiny little like science guy that you could tell.
*  Like, I don't know. He didn't give a fuck.
*  He was going to.
*  Well, they don't like kids fucking around.
*  Yeah, I get it.
*  But kids are going to fuck around.
*  And you got to be a little bit more even keeled.
*  Yeah. Can't make kids swallow tobacco.
*  You fucking idiot.
*  It's pretty wild. Now that I'm saying it out loud.
*  It's crazy.
*  Well, when I was in school, they used to paddle you when I lived in Florida.
*  The fuck out of you. Yeah.
*  Yeah. You get in a fight. They paddle you.
*  They whack you in the ass with a piece of wood in front of people.
*  No, it was just the principal.
*  The principal would paddle you.
*  Jesus, that was like a weird fetish.
*  It was just like this.
*  No, it's a punishment.
*  You did something wrong.
*  You got whacked.
*  I got whacked. Did you get whacked?
*  No, I'm not really as a kid.
*  Yeah, not much.
*  Yeah, nothing like where I got hurt.
*  Yeah. You know, just like this.
*  Yeah, of course.
*  Nothing serious.
*  A little spoon to the back.
*  Nothing. A little slap.
*  My sister threw a high heel shoe at my back once during a fight.
*  Oh, my God. Yeah.
*  That fucking hit me right in the back.
*  I went down. It's a piece of wood.
*  It's goddamn deadly weapon.
*  Yeah. Then she locked me in the garage.
*  Then I got out.
*  Locked her in the garage. Jesus.
*  And then she made fun of me for being a fat kid and having bigger tits than her mom.
*  Oh, my God. And she was adopted.
*  So I go, you mean my mom and fucking dude.
*  Mic drop, but also.
*  Yeah, that one.
*  That one.
*  Yeah, that was fucking.
*  I said, Natalie, I'm so sorry.
*  Even to this day. Yeah, that was wild.
*  That's to the bone.
*  She's crushing it.
*  Is that deep as a fucking 10 years old?
*  Yeah, well, even like kids are fucking mean because they don't understand
*  what it's going to do to someone.
*  That's why bullies in school are so dangerous because you could ruin someone's life
*  for no fucking reason other than you can. Yeah.
*  You see kids ganging up on kids as fun for no reason other than you can.
*  You're going to ruin that kids experience for the rest of their life.
*  Oh, yeah. Some kids, they get bullied in high school and they never recover.
*  One thousand. They become like recluses.
*  They hide. They always associate people with pain.
*  Yeah. It becomes a real problem.
*  Oh, yeah. Because a real fucking problem.
*  Yeah. The kids that would tease me for weight stuff like I try, you know,
*  as I get a little older, I try to give benefit the doubt.
*  Be like, oh, they didn't know any better.
*  They're just fucking kids.
*  But like and thank God I found a way to maybe, you know, get around it.
*  But like kids can be so mean.
*  They can be mean. They don't even know.
*  They don't even know, man.
*  They're just doing it because they're they're experienced.
*  Louis CK had a whole bit about it.
*  I forget how it went.
*  But it was essentially about his.
*  Well, he's dead on right.
*  It's like they know that they can do this thing.
*  Yeah. So they do it.
*  And it's just like it's like throwing a rock in a window.
*  Right. They can. So they do it.
*  And young kids don't think about consequences.
*  No, they're little animals.
*  They're not fully developed. Yeah, I know.
*  And so they're mean.
*  But the problem is when they're mean to like if you're mean to a 14 year old
*  is just coming in in ninth grade, you might fuck them up forever.
*  Yeah, dude. Forever. Yeah.
*  Especially if you're like 16 or 17, you're a big older bully
*  and you're picking on some 14 year old kid like, whoa. Yeah.
*  I know so many people that just got destroyed from their experience
*  in high school and just destroyed their confidence and didn't recover.
*  Well, it alters the course of your life. Oh, wow. Yeah.
*  You're always thinking you're a loser.
*  So it kills your confidence to try anything.
*  Yeah. Kills your confidence to meet people. Yeah.
*  You know, you're afraid of interactions.
*  You're always harkening back to that. Yeah.
*  Yeah. I mean, that's why parents, you know, old school parents will tell you
*  and some boy bullies you.
*  You go back to school, you punch that kid right in the fucking face.
*  Like, imagine sending your kid to school and telling them that.
*  Like, go punch that bully in the face. Like, what the fuck?
*  I know my mom used to tell me, she like, tell me or go tell the teacher
*  or call me and I'll call the parents.
*  I'm like, that's the fucking last thing I want to do.
*  At least I'm like savvy enough to like not.
*  You're not going to be there all the time. Yeah.
*  So I'm going to have to go to school and I'm going to have to deal with this guy.
*  This is don't you don't if you intervene, you're not going to intervene every day.
*  Yeah. So what's going to happen is to remember that you intervene.
*  Yeah. Next time he sees me, you know, he's going to put me in a locker.
*  You know, it's going to be a real problem.
*  I ran for vice president in the fifth grade and my mom helped me write my speech.
*  She was reminding me of this.
*  And I go big kid again.
*  And I was running him down the platform of
*  if you vote for me, I'll have we'll have ice cream every day.
*  My mom helped me write this.
*  And I was like, I think I'm OK.
*  And then she was like, put this and she goes, say,
*  if you vote for me, you have ice cream.
*  I promise we'll have ice cream at LP every day. Not.
*  Joe, I did that in front of the whole school. Oh, no.
*  Crickets. One teacher in the back.
*  Oh, shit. Your mom told you, oh, mom.
*  Terrible idea.
*  I was going to roll the dice.
*  I was going, yo, don't listen to your mom.
*  Also, come on.
*  Kind of applaud the confidence to fucking try.
*  I mean, you know, open mic night in front of the school.
*  Yeah, basically.
*  It's also when not was still kind of in.
*  So you think that was like the first joke you ever cracked publicly?
*  It might have been.
*  Probably has to probably has to be right.
*  I mean, when did you ever address a group of people?
*  Oh, never, never, never.
*  Right. So first time ever for the whole school.
*  Bad joke.
*  Crickets right out of the bat.
*  Maybe a couple of kids were like, dude, this guy's fucking on to something.
*  Well, some kids just like it when there's a little bit of chaos like, yeah.
*  Yeah. Say something stupid.
*  Yeah. Give me something to think about other than my miserable existence.
*  Dude, yeah. Yeah.
*  Which is a lot of people.
*  That's a lot of online activity.
*  Like people just looking for someone to fail so they go like, yeah.
*  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
*  I love it.
*  I don't read the the comments right now.
*  I'm trying not to right now.
*  Yeah. Just start doing that.
*  Maybe a couple of years ago.
*  Good for you. I was reading both.
*  And then it was just like, I I'd love to live in like the present.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I know how I think it felt good in the moment.
*  Why would I want to take away anything from that?
*  I don't know.
*  It's an unnatural way of human beings interacting with each other.
*  It's not good for you.
*  Sometimes I look at stuff just to go like, oh, did they like when she and I did
*  the Trump Biden thing, I was like, I want to see if people are digging it.
*  You read a few nice things.
*  And then it's like you just have to have self-discipline to go.
*  But, you know, but listen, you know, it's good.
*  You know, that's good. It killed you guys when it was you guys doing Biden
*  and Trump and going back and forth with each other.
*  It was magic. It was hilarious.
*  Just got it like, you know what it is.
*  What a wild thing to to have as far as like SNL does these political things.
*  They're like, what, eight to 12 minutes, like two hours of it.
*  Like, that's a wild even come close.
*  They can't even come close.
*  First of all, it's not possible for them to come close.
*  They can't come close in the subject matter.
*  And they don't have Shane.
*  Shane is the greatest Trump that's ever existed.
*  I will put my name on that.
*  Shane should be writing for Trump.
*  Like if Trump was smart, he would hire Shane and Tony Hinchcliffe
*  to write for him.
*  Because Shane could show him how to do it.
*  This is how this is how you say the joke.
*  He would do it. He came out and was doing the dance and the low clapping.
*  I don't know if you saw this, too, the way he was drinking his Bud Light.
*  Fully in character. Fully in character.
*  Yeah. If I mean, for real, he could show Trump how to deliver the lines.
*  Dude, when we were the first time we did it, because Shane and I
*  only maybe see each other and chatted about 10 times at clubs prior to that first time.
*  So this is really the other thing I love about comedy.
*  It's like we got to really kick it like this past weekend a lot and chum it up
*  and like just get to know each other more because we are thrust into this thing
*  kind of together, you know.
*  And during the first time of the mothership, I lean over in character and I go,
*  I go, hey, Shane, you realize this is the most most we've ever talked to each other.
*  And in character goes, Joe, shut the fuck up.
*  And I started fucking biting my lip. So funny, dude.
*  Yeah, it's a it's a fun time for comedy and a fun time for politics.
*  If you're a comedian for the rest of the world, it's like, yeah.
*  I said that when Joe Biden was was operating the country, it felt to me
*  like how I feel when my Tesla is on autopilot.
*  Like, yikes, does this really work? Oh, yeah.
*  You know, it's like, Jesus. Oh, yeah. What's happening there?
*  And now it's seeing you as Joe Biden.
*  You're way more coherent than the actual Joe Biden, which is so nice.
*  Zingers. Yeah. You have some zingers.
*  What's the balance you have to find?
*  Like, I can't just be people were like, dude, just mumble and stumble and you'll be fine.
*  I'm like, I'm still there to be funny.
*  Yeah. Like I have to, you know.
*  But you figured out how to do it in character, too, which is fun,
*  because you have that thing where you can do the bumbling.
*  And it's actually funny.
*  Like you are on purpose bumbling, you know,
*  like because sometimes he just bails.
*  Yeah, he just bails on what he's saying.
*  Totally. And just, you know, we got to.
*  We beat Medicaid.
*  Yeah, that's what I said the first I go, we beat Medicaid, Megatron.
*  We took down the Transformers. Yeah.
*  And even when I got there with the tell, I go, we got David Tell, Dave Chappelle.
*  We got Adele up here. Come on.
*  How long did you do the character before you did it on Kill Tony?
*  Did you fuck around with it or?
*  No, just I'd done a couple like voices in my act
*  talking about the debate, maybe, you know, some.
*  Oh, that's the first time doing it.
*  I've done Phil Jeremiah Walkins.
*  And I did a bunch of during Covid like Lost Phil episodes.
*  And that's kind of how I started to find whatever my version of it was that.
*  But this was just the first. Have you met him? Who? Dr. Phil?
*  No, that's hilarious.
*  But I think he's going to come on my show at the store and.
*  How are you going to feel when you meet him?
*  I'm pretty sure.
*  You're going to handle it better than you handle Jim Carrey.
*  Oh, fuck. I think so.
*  I hope so. Yeah, I hope so.
*  For your sake. So it'll be awesome.
*  What if it doesn't get tense?
*  Yeah. What if he's what if he just is that honestly, when they were playing,
*  I need to be in charge of what you're allowed to say,
*  because you might be saying things, you know, he might get to.
*  I thought he was going to come out at Madison Square Garden
*  when they played that video montage, when they put me in the Kill
*  Tony Hall of Fame, I thought he was going to come out behind me.
*  And I don't know, fucking like stab me in the back and go,
*  we won't be right back.
*  That would have been funny. Just take me down.
*  Yeah, he's I think I think he'll be I want him to come out on my show
*  at the comedy store.
*  And when they announced Dr. Phil, he comes out instead.
*  And then everybody goes nuts.
*  And then I come out, we shake hands and chat for about 20, 30.
*  Well, kill Tony's so big now, I could see him coming out,
*  especially now because he's got that network work.
*  Yeah, he's got some stuff to sell.
*  Do I plug his book on every episode of the show?
*  People buy books now, Joe, and bring them to my club dates
*  and have me sign and do a thing.
*  Tiffany Hattish was on one of the shows.
*  And I go, Tiff, this guy's got a question for you.
*  And he's like, Tiffany, I'm I can't stop.
*  I stopped drinking. I can't stop jerking off.
*  And she goes, you got to stop jerking off.
*  She goes, you can go blind.
*  You jerk off too much. You can go blind.
*  I go actually talk about that in my book.
*  We've got issues. I go chapter 25.
*  If you come too much, you're going to lose your ability to see the world.
*  So I'm like finding ways to like plug the book.
*  And now I'm sure it's happy.
*  That'll definitely sell.
*  I think that's kind of not a bad move, right?
*  No, it's a very good, solid move.
*  Good move on your part.
*  And it's a fun bit.
*  And it's like people now like, I don't know.
*  No, it's definitely fun.
*  But what would happen if you said stop doing it?
*  Stop doing it. And it was fun.
*  It was a fun run.
*  I would keep throwing it.
*  OK, you heard it here first.
*  I think I might have to go to court for this one.
*  I don't know, bro. Let it go.
*  It's I mean, there's no I mean, it's parody and it's all this.
*  So I don't think there's a real it would have to.
*  I mean, there's it'd be a cease and desist of some sort.
*  Right. Well, parody is an interesting thing, right?
*  Because people are really worried about parody now with A.I.
*  because there's a lot of parody now with. Oh, yeah.
*  And people think like there was this one Kamala Harris thing
*  that was going around where wasn't she never said any of these things.
*  This is the original speech that she gives.
*  And there's this like ridiculous version of like the worst thing
*  that a person like the dumbest. Oh, God.
*  Yeah. And it's A.I.
*  And it's and it's like, yeah, that's one of them weird ones.
*  That's a weird one.
*  Because if you could do that, then you could have people saying all kinds of things.
*  Like if that's OK to take like a famous person
*  who's like the vice president of the United States
*  and have her say a bunch of shit that she didn't really say
*  because it's parody, like you can kind of get a little slippery with that.
*  Like you can get like subtle parody. Yeah.
*  Or it's like you barely know that she's not saying those things.
*  Oh, yeah. And then it becomes like people believe it's real.
*  It's pretty obvious, though, right? The videos of the.
*  Not always, man. They're getting good.
*  They're getting really good. They're getting really good.
*  They're getting close enough that they could trick a lot of people.
*  And I think the best version of it now is pretty fucking tight, man.
*  The vocal stuff is pretty wild. It's all wild.
*  Yeah. They can take your voice and have you say almost anything.
*  And if they do a good job with it and manipulate it and tweak it,
*  like the intonation is the God they get it's like so god damn close.
*  Scary. There's still a little part of you that listens to it
*  and goes, this seems a little fake. Yeah.
*  But I always wonder if like if I didn't know that it definitely wasn't real.
*  I wonder if it would feel fake to me. Yeah.
*  You know, yeah, I don't know.
*  I feel like, yeah, I don't know.
*  They said we're going to have flying cars about now and it's not happening.
*  So maybe I won't be as scary as they do have flying cars.
*  Yeah, but like a part of society and. Yeah, they're not common,
*  but they would help in the hurricane place.
*  Yeah. As long as you don't catch them winds.
*  I remember when Dallas had Uber helicopters for about two months.
*  Could you imagine if Florida had flying cars and hurricanes
*  in the middle of the hurricanes, you know, there'd be a bunch of those
*  same kind of dudes that shoot out their window at people and road rage.
*  They would be flying in winds that they shouldn't be flying in
*  and crashing into the whole highway in a burst of flames and killing everybody.
*  And it would be on YouTube reels the next day.
*  Florida is the guinea pig of states for all the stuff that's.
*  Well, it's a state that was essentially founded.
*  OK, there's two findings, right?
*  This original, the Spaniards landed in Florida first.
*  The first city was in Florida in this country. Right.
*  So you have like the colonizers, the first original colonizers land in Florida.
*  Then, you know, all the fucking prisoners that Castro releases.
*  He gets them out and puts them on fucking boats and sends them to Miami.
*  And then you have the crazy cocaine days in the 1980s.
*  And then you have an economy that has there was more,
*  at least at one point in time, find out if this is true still.
*  There's more banks per capita in Miami.
*  Yeah. Like for a city than anywhere else in the country,
*  because it was all money laundering.
*  People were just like they were moving money around with cocaine
*  and people were making millions of dollars and putting in trash bags
*  and digging holes in their backyard.
*  You see cocaine cowboys? No fucking incredible,
*  fucking incredible documentary.
*  And it's all this about everything you're talking about.
*  And two, yes, it's all about cocaine in Miami.
*  At one point in time, one graduating class, the Miami Police Academy,
*  every single one of them either went to jail for corruption or was murdered.
*  Oh, my God. The entire class.
*  It was just cocaine.
*  Everyone was out of their fucking minds.
*  They're all on it and they're all committing crimes on it.
*  And they're all making millions of dollars and they're all going to nightclubs.
*  It's Scarface. It's Scarface was based on that.
*  My God. Brian DePalma Scarface written by
*  was Oliver Stone, right?
*  Didn't Oliver Stone write it? Sounds right.
*  It is right.
*  I believe so. How long was this time?
*  A couple of years or what?
*  Like a decade.
*  More, maybe more than a decade.
*  Maybe 20 years.
*  I had a buddy who was an ophthalmologist
*  who did his residency at a university in Miami during the cocaine days.
*  Oh, he said, dude, it was nuts.
*  It was nuts. Gunshot wounds, stab wounds, people with things up their asses.
*  Like they so many people got brought into the emergency room with things.
*  They stuffed up their ass while they were coked up.
*  I didn't know that was a side effect.
*  Army soldiers. I thought it was like stories with no end.
*  No, no, no. Like light bulbs, the ones that are shaped like pinecones,
*  stuffed light bulbs up their asses.
*  Like people were doing all kinds of wild shit and being brought into the emergency room.
*  I thought coke was just supposed to be like you take the party up a notch and you know,
*  there's more fun and depends on where you're starting.
*  You're like, hey, man, in some places, something to blow up the ass was.
*  Yeah, like those fucking swingers in Tampa are already on the 29th floor.
*  It's not much of an elevator to get them to the roof.
*  Yeah, these fucking people are out of their minds.
*  Yeah. And the whole town was like founded by cocaine.
*  Wow. And it still has that feel, this party feel to that city still.
*  Yeah, it does. I'm sure cocaine is still an issue there, but I mean,
*  it's not the whole thing now, but it's like that's a frivolous area.
*  I always say if you want to starve to death, open a bookstore in Miami.
*  No one's got no patience.
*  Yeah, reading the fuck up.
*  We're out here stunting pot doesn't pot hasn't had a similar type.
*  I don't know. Affect on the town. Yeah, not really.
*  Maybe pot and LSD was San Francisco in the 70s and 60s.
*  But like, not really.
*  You know, people were putting stuff up their butts and what?
*  No. Well, that's what reefer madness stuff.
*  That's the opposite of what you would do if you're a high.
*  You would not take you take that toy soldier and you go, if I put this in my house,
*  we get stuck. Yeah. You start freaking out.
*  What do I have to go to the hospital? It's stuck in my ass. I'm not doing it.
*  Whenever you're on coke, you're like, get up there, soldier.
*  Do your fucking.
*  There's a will. There's a way.
*  What did you sign up for to protect your piece of shit?
*  Here comes up out of your mind.
*  I didn't want to join Diaz's Death Stars the last time at his pod when he was in L.A.
*  Yeah, he would do that, too.
*  That might be the highest I've ever been in uncomfortable,
*  very dangerous, bad for people, psyche.
*  I was good for about 20 minutes and then don't remember what happened after that.
*  Yeah, he takes people and he throws them into the darkest pits of their soul.
*  Thank God he just talked like I was so I got quiet.
*  I remember I looked over at Lee at one point and I was just like,
*  I don't know if I can say anything else.
*  Lee's probably asleep. Yeah, he was.
*  Lee was probably asleep standing up.
*  Joe would finish the story and go and then and we got here and then
*  let me tell you something, man, this one time we were in book and I was like,
*  when he got real low like that, I was like, OK, I think I think this
*  I got another 10 minutes to be quiet because another story.
*  And then it was your brain totally.
*  Catched. Wow, dude. What a great way to put it.
*  Yeah. Catch it. Where is it?
*  Where's my fucking brain? And over here.
*  You know how to think. Yeah.
*  But he was I'd never been so paranoid.
*  Breathe, breathe.
*  The amount of times I told myself to breathe was terrifying.
*  The old days of the church of what's happening now is all just Joey doing edibles.
*  Yeah. Insane amounts of edibles. Yeah.
*  And just being obliterated.
*  At least I like it.
*  So much episodes where his eyes are closed and he's just rocking back and forth.
*  He's hallucinating. He's watching like neon cartoons.
*  Fuck behind his eyelids.
*  I remember he gave him another Death Star when he was like, he was like,
*  eat another one, easily.
*  And I'll go. He woke up to eat it.
*  And then he I mean, it was yeah, it was wild.
*  But it was like, you know, I wanted to be I wanted to participate.
*  Oh, yeah. How do you not? You have to. Yeah.
*  If you're doing Joey show, you have to be on the same wavelength.
*  Otherwise, it'd be rude. But I was totally.
*  Imagine being a sober person.
*  Listen to that conversation. Like, what are you saying?
*  Look at Lee. Look at Lee.
*  Yeah.
*  Lee's in another dimension right now.
*  He's literally in another dimension.
*  He's gone. He's gone.
*  Eyes in the back of your head.
*  Always smiling. So he was on some sort of a journey.
*  Well, listen, he's on the church of what's happening now with Joey Diaz having a great time.
*  I know. Which is when you want to be like that fucked up on edibles.
*  You're around nice people having a wonderful time.
*  By the way, another stamp in the comedy zeitgeist or the history books of like,
*  I'm I feel very fortunate to have been in a time where I got to be around that.
*  And then beyond, you know, I'm saying like, be I mean, obviously, you guys been
*  homies forever, but like, yeah, that's like, you know, that was a staple in time.
*  Well, also, it doesn't exist anymore.
*  Like people forgot I keep trying to tell him to bring back to church.
*  And I'm trying to get him and Lee together again to do.
*  I think they're talking about it.
*  And Lee was out here when he was out here.
*  God damn, those two together were so fun.
*  Yeah, it's just Joey Diaz like that was so funny.
*  Yes. So it's just so Joey Diaz.
*  And if you know him, you love him like the one on the July 4th one
*  when he was like screaming, you're a fucking American.
*  It's like the background is dead.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Is did the Joey Diaz state of the union?
*  It's incredible.
*  Those are also some of the wildest nights at the store that I will never forget.
*  In the hour of seeing a lineup that's just, you know, Tom, Bill, you, Joey,
*  like you bring up Joey, Joe bringing up you is a half hour
*  that I don't think I'll ever forget, dude.
*  That's so wild.
*  And I know you get that now at the mothership of what you guys are doing here
*  and what you've created.
*  But man, like seeing it for the first time of it, of me seeing it
*  is what I'm, I guess, getting. Yeah.
*  Of being and getting to a point to where it was like open mics at the store.
*  Then I did phones for a few years and then being a regular.
*  Then just being around and being around enough to be comfortable,
*  to stick around and sit in a bucket seat and watch that transition happen was wild, dude.
*  The the fucking the pops and the roars.
*  And then you sitting down and watching him was so fucking cool.
*  You know, I don't know.
*  That's that's other stuff that that is not.
*  You have to just be around to see that.
*  Like that was a different time.
*  Yeah, it was like you could do that then and you could hang out in the back.
*  You didn't get bothered.
*  And you could, you know, the store was that was an interesting time of the store.
*  Because it was like it was so heavy.
*  There were so many killers.
*  There was so many people there.
*  It was just it was such a magnet for crazy people, too.
*  So there's this energy in that place that was so different. Yeah.
*  You know, that's also because it's like Ciro's nightclub.
*  Right. People were killed there.
*  You know, oh, really? Bugsy Seagull.
*  You don't know the whole story.
*  Oh, my God. Bugsy Seagull owned it.
*  I just know it was a nightclub.
*  That's about as far as a mob run nightclub.
*  Holy shit. Yeah, of course it was.
*  I'm sure you've talked to people that have seen Ghost there, right? Oh, yeah. Yeah.
*  Well, how many other places where people have seen ghosts?
*  That's like the most ghostiest of ghost places in L.A.
*  When you talk to like those fucking ghost freaks.
*  Oh, really? They really are.
*  Yeah, man.
*  It's like there's a bunch of stories about the comedy store being haunted.
*  Yeah. I know multiple people that have seen Ghost there.
*  Carla Boe used to have a crazy story about sleeping on the stage
*  and like something grabbed his leg and dragged him to the end of the stage.
*  And he heard a bunch of chairs clink and the door slammed.
*  And there was no one in the room.
*  He was asleep on the stage, got kicked out of his apartment.
*  He's had a fight with his girlfriend.
*  Fuck you. I'm going to make it.
*  You know, that kind of shit. He's young.
*  And he was working as a doorman for the store.
*  So he had a key.
*  He goes and he said, I'm going to sleep on the stage because I'm going to fucking make it in comedy.
*  And then he's on stage and he hears a noise like chairs clinking.
*  He's like, hello? Hey, it's me, Carl.
*  I'm here. I got kicked out of my place, so I'm just sleeping on the stage.
*  Hey, who's there?
*  And he hears like a sound again.
*  He doesn't see anything.
*  Then all of a sudden, a hand grabs his leg and drags him like six feet and then let's go.
*  Oh, my God. That's fucking terrifying.
*  Yeah. I mean, maybe he lied.
*  But it's an amazing story.
*  The way he would tell. I want to believe. I want to believe.
*  I want to believe too.
*  I've never heard anybody get touched by a ghost, though.
*  It might have been one of his friends.
*  He might have been blackout drunk.
*  One of his friends, like, Carl sleeping on the stage.
*  Let's fuck with him.
*  And they probably never told him.
*  They probably forgot they did it because they did it acid and fucking a pile of coke.
*  That sounds more believable.
*  Yeah, because he was a part of Kinnison's crew.
*  Right. Right.
*  And so like Mark Maron said that when he he partied with Kinnison so hard
*  that he had voices in his head for a year.
*  A year after he got back, he left, went to Boston after he was hanging out in Los Angeles.
*  And he had voices in his head for like a year.
*  Saying what? I don't know.
*  Not good things, I'm sure.
*  They're never good voices.
*  Start a podcast in your garage.
*  That took years to get to happen.
*  This is like the 90s.
*  Yes, this is like not even this is the 80s.
*  That's right.
*  So this is like when I met him, it was 88.
*  So this is like so these are leftover residual voices from they did so many drugs.
*  They did so much coke that he like had voices in his head.
*  Where's that? I guess I just the coke.
*  It's like probably a breakdown of the natural neurochemistry.
*  You're fucking with your brain.
*  So yeah, 100 percent.
*  Yeah.
*  You're robbing your brain of its ability to produce dopamine.
*  Like you destroy all your serotonin levels.
*  You fuck with everything.
*  When you go that hard with coke and then you have to get off, like those guys get wrecked.
*  Wow.
*  I've met people that are getting off coke and they are wrecked.
*  Like just it's just empty and they're so drained.
*  Oh fuck.
*  It's just like it just fucks you up and makes you want to do more coke.
*  Get back on the horse.
*  Here the dog.
*  And we're back.
*  And we're back.
*  Yeah, I'd see it.
*  Oh, my God.
*  That's a demon.
*  That's a demon in powdered form.
*  It's not around as much anymore.
*  At clubs. Oh, really?
*  Yeah, it's around all over the place.
*  The problem is now it's got fentanyl in it.
*  And now I can kill you.
*  Fuck that.
*  People are still doing it.
*  That's how nutty coke is.
*  They're going to roll the dice.
*  Isn't that crazy?
*  I know.
*  It's not from the cartel.
*  It's fucking wild.
*  I don't even take people bringing me weed now all the time, which I appreciate.
*  But I mean.
*  Well, they found weed with fentanyl.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  And it's also like one kid had a bag.
*  It was at the Comedy Castle in Royal Oak.
*  And I walk in the bathroom, he pulls out this little bag and he goes,
*  bro, I brought you something.
*  And it's just a bag of shake.
*  I go, oh, man.
*  Thanks, bro.
*  I'm just trying to be polite.
*  I go, thanks, man.
*  He goes, there's more where that came from.
*  I go, can I be honest?
*  This looks like it just fell out of your pocket.
*  He's like, yeah, I mean, but I brought you the bag.
*  I was like, the gesture sweep.
*  But like, I just feel like this is not the move.
*  Like maybe if it was a nice joint, maybe in a tube and stuff.
*  He's like, OK, you're a Hollywood guy.
*  I'm like, that has nothing to do with it.
*  It's just a bag that was stuffed in your cargo pants.
*  Of shake.
*  Yeah, of shake.
*  Yeah.
*  Or joints that are.
*  Yeah.
*  You can't roll the dice on that.
*  Yeah, you can't today.
*  You know, there's places that are trying to outlaw fentanyl tests,
*  which is insane.
*  Who's doing that?
*  Where is that happening?
*  Is that a Texas thing?
*  Where is that happening where they're outlawing the fentanyl tests?
*  And I think the concern is that it would encourage people to do drugs
*  or sell drugs and that maybe the thing that's going to discourage them
*  is the fact that people are dying from it, which is an insane way to think.
*  Let's just prevent people from dying.
*  Yeah.
*  First, I guess the fear is that it would make people feel like it's safe
*  to do coke again.
*  Center for Disease Control and Prevention and most public health agencies
*  endorse distributing fentanyl test strips to people who use drugs.
*  The practice is illegal in 42 states and the District of Columbia.
*  Wow.
*  Oh, my God, that feels like way too many places.
*  Insane.
*  I thought it was like a state.
*  I thought it was like a Florida thing.
*  Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, North Dakota, and Texas.
*  They are now allowed in every state except Idaho, Indiana, Iowa,
*  North Dakota, and Texas.
*  That's nuts, Texas.
*  And it's an easy way to save lives.
*  Jesus Christ, that's insane.
*  Bummer.
*  Why does Texas have it illegal?
*  Why are fentanyl strips illegal in Texas?
*  Texas, one of the few states where fentanyl strips are still illegal
*  and considered drug parnofenylia.
*  One argument that has been made against the test strips
*  and other harm reduction practices is that they may encourage people
*  to do drugs or continue doing drugs.
*  So let's just kill them.
*  Let's just kill them.
*  Let's let your kids die because they made a mistake,
*  because they're 16 and someone gave them some coke
*  and they wanted to be a cool kid.
*  That's insane.
*  That's insane.
*  Yeah, we don't want to encourage kids to do drugs.
*  Correct.
*  And you know the way to do that is to have positive role models
*  who aren't doing coke.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the best way to do it.
*  Yeah.
*  It's the best way is your favorite country music singer doesn't do coke.
*  You know, like maybe that.
*  Maybe your favorite athlete doesn't do coke.
*  And he tells you, listen, I don't do coke.
*  You shouldn't do coke.
*  It's fucking scary.
*  What the fuck, dude?
*  Yeah.
*  What the fuck?
*  That is wild.
*  It's crazy that you would have a test strip and make it illegal.
*  You could save lives.
*  That's the only way you should look at that.
*  You're going to save lives.
*  They're already doing something illegal.
*  You know, you're not encouraging or discouraging.
*  If it was not killing people, probably the same exact amount of people
*  would be doing coke.
*  I can't believe that we got rid of, what was it, Jamie?
*  Sunbubble?
*  What was the place that you pulled up?
*  The hot tub, the cum tub place.
*  We got rid of those, but we can't get fentanyl strips approved?
*  Crazy.
*  Well, also, the real elephant in the room is why is it a prob?
*  Why are these drugs tainted?
*  And it's because they're illegal.
*  That's the problem.
*  And the problem is we don't want to make them legal
*  because we don't want to encourage drug use.
*  I get that too.
*  But the thing is, the only way you're going to make it safer for human beings
*  to do these stupid things and live is if you make it legal.
*  It shouldn't be legal in terms of like, I mean, it should be legal.
*  But it shouldn't be something that someone can profit off of.
*  It shouldn't be something that someone can sell to people.
*  Maybe the best way to do it would be to make drugs free and legal.
*  Sure.
*  I catch you selling coke, death penalty.
*  But if you want to give away coke, if you want to make coke and give it away,
*  it's totally legal.
*  If you want to make your own cocaine or a pharmaceutical drug company makes
*  cocaine, they can sell that cocaine for exactly what it costs
*  to make it and nothing more.
*  So no one's going to make it.
*  But then you will have a supply problem.
*  And then you'll have, eh, my idea sucks.
*  I bailed on it.
*  It was adorable to watch you go through it.
*  Because I was like, no, because then people just they'll make it.
*  And they'll say, let me get the fentanyl bottle all back over again.
*  You got to allow pharmaceutical drug companies to profit, otherwise they
*  have no incentive to make it.
*  Then they're going to tell you they're going to have fucking ads like CNN
*  brought to you by cocaine.
*  That's going to be the Anderson Cooper show brought to you by crack.
*  The cocaine news network.
*  That's what it will be.
*  It'll be like pharmaceutical drug companies sponsor those shows now.
*  All right. It'll be cocaine sponsors.
*  I would watch a full news network that was just everyone's fucked up.
*  Responsible use of cocaine.
*  Just a little before you talk about the weather.
*  I'm going to talk about the weather.
*  If you're going to have any segment of the news.
*  Fucking rain.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Well, you better got two coats on today, baby.
*  You better get that fucking car gassed up because you're going to be in 56
*  hours of traffic. Let's go.
*  It's going to be hot. Let's go.
*  I'm not even going anywhere.
*  I'm going to ride this motherfucker out in the basement.
*  Meanwhile, your basement gets flooded.
*  You know, some of those places get flooded.
*  I was watching the last hurricane.
*  This whole community is underwater.
*  Did you see any of that, Jamie?
*  There's a community in Florida and it was it was not even in the flood zone.
*  And they're all underwater.
*  Their houses are underwater.
*  Everything's underwater.
*  No, thanks. Yeah, not good, dude.
*  Not good at all.
*  You're living in a place where the sky becomes an angry monster and could snuff out life.
*  Have you scuba dived? No.
*  Fuck all. No, thanks.
*  I know there's sharks out there.
*  My wife is like, we don't know.
*  I think 73 percent of the ocean.
*  She's just like, I think it's 90.
*  Yeah, it's got to be. I think it's 90.
*  Every day, there's a new fish or dolphin or whale.
*  And you're like, I just saw this video of I think it was a swordfish coming out
*  and like flying across the whatever.
*  Did he pop down to the water?
*  I was like, I didn't know they could fucking jump like that.
*  Yeah. No, thanks, dude.
*  This kid was on my podcast recently.
*  Bob Gimlin is his YouTube channel.
*  He had a very interesting point.
*  He said he thinks that and this is coming from someone else who observed this.
*  He thinks that sharks are attacking people, not even to eat them.
*  They're attacking people because they don't want them there
*  because they're getting in the way of the seals and all the things they eat.
*  That's why they're killing people.
*  They don't want you in their water.
*  And I was like, oh, my God, that makes sense.
*  A thousand percent. I mean, we thought about what are we doing there?
*  I want to think of them as like these fucking thoughtless killing machines.
*  There's biting everything.
*  Imagine just walking into a stranger's house, opening the door,
*  just opening the fridge, you guys might make some tater tots.
*  That's what we're doing in the ocean.
*  There's a video of a kid in Hawaii who's on a small like paddleboard,
*  likes fishing off a paddleboard and a fucking tiger shark bites the paddleboard.
*  Have you ever seen that video?
*  Oh, it's terrifying.
*  But it is. I mean, if you wanted to think about it.
*  Look, the kids out there fishing.
*  Yeah. So he's stealing fish from the sharks. Sorry.
*  Yeah. Like the shark knows that that's not a fish.
*  Oh, God, is this it? You watch this. This is crazy.
*  So he's on your fish. Look at this.
*  Bro, shark.
*  Tiger shark ran me.
*  No, no, bit you, bro.
*  Rammed me. Yeah, they think bit him.
*  Watch this. Oh, look at that.
*  It bit the boat, man.
*  It bit the boat.
*  You're taking food out of its mouth and it's family's mouth.
*  Again, you walk into a stranger's house, you take the meatloaf sandwich
*  out of your kid's mouth.
*  Your dad's going to punch you in the face.
*  He knows for sure that's not a fish.
*  Shark attack seems like that may be the worst way to, I mean, die for sure.
*  But like it's a horrible way to die.
*  Oh, first of all, you can't get away and they move real fast and you can't move at all.
*  It's not even like a bear on the ground.
*  You feel like you maybe can run.
*  Maybe run up a tree.
*  I saw this video with an alligator attack, where it's like if it bites your leg,
*  you're supposed to roll with it and then play dead.
*  And then you like the playing dead thing always to me.
*  I'm like, you're not that good of an actor.
*  Good luck keeping it together while the thing is clamped on.
*  Dude, I don't even think Pacino could fake dead in front of a gator.
*  I think they're going to be like, dude, it's going to keep you underwater
*  until it knows for sure.
*  So you have to not move.
*  Yeah, you're not like, are you that zen to reduce your panic around a gator attack?
*  Nobody is. Nobody is. Nobody is.
*  But yeah, but a shark, dude, that just feels and then they say punch them.
*  They say punch them.
*  Who's got enough wherewithal or just, you know, in the moment who survived?
*  It's punched a shark was wrapped around their torso.
*  Who survived?
*  Maybe Tom.
*  We're going to rip you in half.
*  Yeah, you're done.
*  Bite force is insane.
*  Yes, got filled with knives.
*  Go to your happy place.
*  You know, as in the last moment of your life,
*  you're looking down at your entrails and no legs.
*  And that's it. That's the end.
*  Wow. This is the end.
*  How long do you think you get to look at that before?
*  Seconds. You get a few seconds.
*  What is that thing biting a camera?
*  I just thought it was a cool. Oh, my God.
*  It's mouth. Oh, my God.
*  It's just a killing machine.
*  But it does make sense what he's and now that I see that video
*  as a great perspective of the shark biting the boat, that totally makes sense.
*  Taking his snacks. Yeah, because I used to think that it was all just
*  they'll bite anything. No, they're mad that you're there.
*  Get out of here, bitch.
*  Because they're pretty smart, right?
*  Or no. OK. OK.
*  Well, they're ancient.
*  Most most of these really ancient things that haven't changed at all
*  since the dawn of time.
*  They're not that smart because they're just about killing.
*  Like if you think about how old sharks are, I think sharks are older than trees.
*  Yeah, I think sharks predate trees on Earth.
*  See if that's true. Ninety nine percent sure it's true.
*  I talk about that in my book.
*  We've got issues. Sharks are older than trees.
*  Four hundred and fifty million years old.
*  Wow. Tree is three hundred and fifty million years old.
*  So there was sharks for a hundred million years before there were ever trees.
*  That's fucking wild, dude. Why?
*  And they're out there in the water.
*  You want to scuba dive, Adam Ray? No.
*  Fuck is wrong with you, bro.
*  I'll go to Sunbubble with Jamie.
*  They're going to see you down there with your stupid gear.
*  And I know you fucking cocksucker.
*  You're ruining my fishing. Yeah. Yeah.
*  No. Thank you, sir.
*  Not interested. Yeah. OK.
*  Not if I'm glad we're on the same page.
*  What's that?
*  Implicit of that shark.
*  Oh, my God. What kind of shark is that?
*  A little bansaw in its mouth.
*  Is that the early sharks? Heliocoprion.
*  That's what its mouth looks like.
*  A two hundred and forty million year old fish.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  You ever see the movie The Meg? Oh, yeah.
*  One of the dumbest movies has ever been made.
*  Yeah. It's so dumb.
*  Like, why are you watching?
*  What have you done to me?
*  And even Statham was just like, we're going to see what's down there.
*  No, you don't, Jason.
*  Go back to fucking the Italian job to or things.
*  Biting the window. Yeah.
*  Crashes through the window.
*  Giant 50 foot shark.
*  Oh, yeah. The fuck it was.
*  What about open water?
*  Was that the name of that one where it was just all shot?
*  Found footage. Yeah. That was a good one, though.
*  Because it was realistic.
*  Yeah. The Meg is the Meg two is even dumber.
*  It's even dumber than the Meg one. Yeah.
*  But they're fun. It's fun.
*  Dumb. You know, those are good popcorn movies from time to time.
*  Enjoyable. Yeah.
*  No, that's not really happening.
*  Imagine it's like a Megalodon down there.
*  But there could be. That's what everybody thinks.
*  Maybe that's what took the the rich guys in the submarine that went down there.
*  Do you think something big got them?
*  No. Yeah. Incompetence. Yeah.
*  Human folly.
*  I think that gets more people than sharks.
*  You know, that's a big one.
*  I do like the idea that the further down, like all the way down there,
*  there's something like where the Titanic really were at the fucking very bottom
*  is something that's living down there that's just you can't even comprehend.
*  That's never even trying to come up.
*  But if you go all the way down there like they did or you make it down for whatever.
*  I saw Will Smith in some video where he went down, right, with some people
*  for some Discovery show, like really down there to where it was like
*  they shouldn't be down there.
*  Yeah. Get the fuck out of there.
*  Even these astronauts are going to space that are stuck.
*  They're stuck. February. They're stuck.
*  Joe, why?
*  If they can get them in.
*  Why are we still going?
*  Like, what are we with? Is down here not good enough?
*  Yeah, but it's also if they can get them in February.
*  Are you fucking serious? Yeah.
*  What if that doesn't work?
*  What if what if something goes wrong with that?
*  Something went wrong, which is why they can't get them.
*  Guess what? Things go wrong.
*  And you might not have rockets available that can do it.
*  You might not have a shuttle available to get them.
*  You might not be able to fucking.
*  You might have like some sort of problems in your software.
*  Who fucking knows, man?
*  Dude, that's so scary.
*  And they have to like either be saved by another, I guess, SpaceX
*  make friends with the Russians of the Russians bring them home.
*  They go. I bet they can get them.
*  Wouldn't that be funny? That's a nice slap in the face.
*  Yeah, dude.
*  The Putin says, I'll do you a favor.
*  Nice Putin. Go get your friends.
*  OK. Yeah. Just for the nice.
*  And you'll be nice with me.
*  I'd be nice with you. Wow.
*  Your friends. We gave you Britney
*  Garner. We bring back your estimates.
*  Yeah. Or give us back.
*  There was a sound that was recorded once by underwater microphones.
*  That was a biological sound that was louder than anything
*  that any animal had ever made before.
*  And they don't know what it is.
*  Do you see if you can find that?
*  I mean, it might not be this, but remember the other day, the hump.
*  So whatever make a fucking. Oh, yeah.
*  They make crazy sounds.
*  But I don't think they they think they took that into account.
*  And this is different.
*  This they don't know what it is, and they never found it again.
*  But whatever this thing is, it sounded biological.
*  Oh, God. Like it was a biological sound.
*  It wasn't a geological sound.
*  It wasn't like a sound that Earth makes or, you know, a little underwater earthquake.
*  There's something about the sound that they determined it to be biological,
*  which is like, what are we talking about?
*  Is there fucking Godzilla down there now finding out about this?
*  Something called the Bloop. Yeah, that's it. That's it.
*  Doesn't sound very scary. What is it?
*  Nineteen what? Nineteen ninety seven.
*  Well, put up the details of it so I could read it.
*  Is you have an article on it?
*  Just making sure it was. Yeah.
*  So whatever the sound was, they don't know what the fuck it was.
*  And 1997 National Oceanic Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
*  recorded a mysterious underwater sound that lasted for one minute
*  and was detected by hydrophones 5000 miles apart.
*  The sound was named the Bloop and came from a location off the coast of Chile.
*  The Bloop captured people's imagination, led to theories about what it could be,
*  such as the call of a dinosaur, an undiscovered sea creature or a giant squid.
*  In 2005, an OAA scientist discovered that sound was actually caused
*  by an iceberg breaking away from the Atlantic glacier. Oh, shit.
*  What the fuck, dude? I don't even know.
*  So they solved it.
*  I was hoping it was a fucking monster.
*  That was the only one. There wasn't one.
*  So that's what it was.
*  So it was probably one of those things where they had talked about it for so long
*  that it is stuck in my head that it was a biological thing.
*  I still have hope.
*  I just found an article in 2017 talking about it where they said
*  they don't know what it was. Oh, OK.
*  So this is someone trying to cover up for Godzilla.
*  That's that is that's some state sponsored CNN type bullshit.
*  We're trying to cover up for the fact there's a goddamn loop.
*  You're reading the AI overview, so maybe I've made up the answer.
*  Oh, AI, you piece of shit. You fucking lied.
*  That's probably what it is. You know, AI lies. What?
*  You have a thing called hallucinations.
*  If AI does not have an answer to something, it will come up with an answer.
*  And then that could be searched from the Web. Right.
*  So it could be some blog somewhere where some guy made up
*  something about it was an iceberg that caused that sound.
*  And AI will spit that back out. Yeah.
*  It's a thing that AI does when it doesn't know the answer to something.
*  Apparently, they call it hallucinations.
*  This is coming from AI.
*  Scientists told me this.
*  I don't want AI to have hallucinations.
*  They don't even know how it works.
*  They don't even know exactly why it's doing what it's doing.
*  You know, they don't know how it's being creative.
*  What?
*  What's it once you see those things, too, about like some of these robots?
*  Like, what was the thing it was like?
*  We're I don't know.
*  It had having them have feelings or any sort of they're not going to have feelings.
*  That's even scarier.
*  They're going to be able to think really clearly without any emotions.
*  No remorse, no morals, no ethics, no worrying if people like them.
*  No reading the comments.
*  They don't give a fuck.
*  Just hit the new button.
*  They're fucking robots, man.
*  That's my fear about aliens.
*  My fear is that that's what aliens are.
*  They've they've already bypassed the human body and all of our primate systems.
*  Oh, yeah. They bypassed all that.
*  They're all they're all gone.
*  That's all gone. Do you think they listen to our podcast?
*  Yes, 100 percent. They're in.
*  They're listening right now. They love it.
*  What up, guys?
*  It's fun for them because they don't get to think stupid anymore.
*  Yeah. You know, because everything's clear.
*  Right. It's like, you know, it's like you want a little bit of chaos
*  and they don't have any chaos left.
*  I think that's why they visit us.
*  That's why, like in my special, I said that I think aliens look at us
*  the same way we look at Waffle House fights.
*  Oh, that's right.
*  This is like, what the fuck is going on over here?
*  What if the aliens like love Danny DeVito?
*  Like, what if their favorite actor is like they love Despicable Me?
*  They're like Gru. Yeah, they love him.
*  We love Gru. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Maybe that's it.
*  I mean, who fucking knows?
*  But if these lying AI cocksuckers, do we find out about that 2017 thing?
*  I found another thing in 2024.
*  I said the same thing about the iceberg.
*  OK, so it might be real.
*  Might have just been an article.
*  They were putting it in the headlines.
*  People would watch their video.
*  Oh, right. Probably.
*  And what year was it?
*  What? What? They recorded that sound?
*  It was recorded 97.
*  Yeah. See, anything back in those days, that's, you know, like
*  you didn't have barely had the Internet in 97.
*  Yeah. I don't know. Facts together.
*  How do you know what you're talking about?
*  Anything pre Internet.
*  Yeah. I would.
*  Could be a biological sound.
*  Could be a dude just into dinosaurs. Sure.
*  You know, but there's probably some shit down there
*  we haven't discovered. I think so.
*  They always find new fish.
*  Like there was a bunch that washed ashore during a tsunami.
*  They were like, what the fuck is this?
*  Was that in Thailand where there was like a gang of them
*  that washed ashore in a tsunami?
*  These undiscovered deep sea creatures. Cool.
*  Crazy, like blind things that live in the place where there's absolutely no light.
*  They can pop up and show up here.
*  I don't think we need to go down and try to find them.
*  Yeah. Wait for a storm.
*  Yeah. Wait for the storm to come through.
*  Don't go down there. They'll wash up.
*  Oregon. Yeah, dude.
*  That was in Oregon. Look at that fucking thing.
*  Oh, yeah. I'm going out of my way to find that.
*  Fuck off. That's some kind of an angler fish.
*  Oh, my God. Which is one of the craziest inventions in nature.
*  The nature invented a fish that has a fishing rod off of its nose.
*  Yeah. Like, how does that even happen?
*  Look at that fucking thing. Is that real?
*  Come on. That can't be real. Oh, my God. Is that real?
*  Well, I know this one above it is not, but I don't know what the fuck that is.
*  See, the thing is with AI, man, they you could think something's real
*  and they just fuck with you.
*  And this is in the New York Post. They might have got the 2017.
*  Jesus. We'll go pre AI.
*  But wait a minute. They probably did a sample of that thing. What is it?
*  Let's find out what it is. I bet they figured it out. Look at it.
*  Hmm. Think to be a fang tooth snake eel or garden or conjure eel.
*  All three species occur off Texas and have large fang like teeth.
*  Look at that thing. Imagine if like we lived in the ocean.
*  Show me the picture of that again.
*  Imagine we live in the ocean. You got to deal with that.
*  There's more. I'm surprised Pixar.
*  They did finding Nemo, but like let's like they should do something
*  that's like highlighting all these lost creatures.
*  Like there's got to be an underwater lost city where you can see the.
*  Yeah. Mermaids versus monsters. Yeah, they should.
*  Why don't they do that?
*  Fang tooth snake. Jesus. Look at that fucking thing.
*  Yeah. Mermaids aren't real, right?
*  I hope so. I hope they're real.
*  I know. Me too. It's like.
*  Throw those things around. I'm like, I don't fuck like.
*  Who the fuck knows, dude?
*  But isn't it like the. Probably not.
*  A beautiful girl and she has no vagina.
*  Yeah, she is just fish.
*  She's a fish. Yeah. Like fish don't have sex.
*  What are you supposed to do there?
*  The part where you have sex with doesn't exist.
*  It's all just. Yeah.
*  Fish. So how you lure any guy into the ocean?
*  You ever see how fish breed?
*  The fish, the female lays their eggs and the guys just jizz all over it.
*  Yeah. Like we used to catch rainbow trout when I lived in Boston
*  and we'd go to this lake and catch rainbows and they would be jizzing
*  when you pull them out of the lake,
*  because it would be the time where they're spawning and they're making babies.
*  And you're allowed to fish for them, at least back then you were.
*  And you're pulling them out as they're jizzing, like they're as you're holding
*  there, like nothing all over the place.
*  Trying to get their last loads out before you fillet them.
*  Wouldn't you?
*  If a bear is about to eat you, wouldn't you just try to fucking empty the tank?
*  I guess no one's probably ever touched him before.
*  It's probably really exciting. There you go.
*  It's the first time to go around. Oh, my God.
*  Like imagine you just like blueballed all day long.
*  You're so blueballed that you just jizz in the ocean.
*  Yeah. On the floor. Yeah.
*  I bet all they have to do is run a finger by you.
*  You know, you're seeing where your dog is humping a leg.
*  Oh, yeah. And the dog is just like they start humping the air.
*  Yeah, dude. Committed a fish.
*  Yeah. Grab them right when they're in that that perfect spot.
*  Peak rut. Just just squirt all over the place.
*  Have you ever seen a fish do that? No.
*  Yeah. With rainbow trout, they would do it all the time.
*  We'd catch them. They'd be jizzing. Good for them.
*  What a life. It's a bad death, though.
*  You know, come and then die. You failed.
*  Yeah, you failed. Yeah.
*  You just over the inside of a boat.
*  The opposite of what you're supposed to do.
*  Oh, good. Good. Not good.
*  But yeah. So if that is a mermaid, like, what the hell?
*  What are you saying?
*  What's why the little mermaid?
*  I mean, she only Eric was only into her because she came out of the
*  the water and had some human features. Exactly.
*  And lost her voice. Like, what the fuck?
*  I mean, that's why he was into her.
*  He was like, dude, I've been dating all these you son of a bitch.
*  These girls that just talk too much.
*  And he's like, wow, I met a girl that just doesn't even want to super hot.
*  Can't talk. But if she does talk, you can't have sex with her.
*  She doesn't have a vagina anymore. Yeah. Take your pick.
*  Honey, you need to learn sign language.
*  Well, all right, Adam Ray, let's wrap this up.
*  John, I appreciate you. My pleasure.
*  I appreciate you, too.
