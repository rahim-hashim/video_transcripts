# Joe Rogan Experience #2140 - Francis Foster & Konstantin Kisin
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [April 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stuqMni6_x0)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience
*  Train by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day!
*  Hey there my British friends. What the fuck's happening? Good to see you guys.
*  Good to be back, man.
*  It's uh, the world just, I always hope that next time we see each other things will calm down.
*  No!
*  Hello, happy podcast.
*  Where we're not freaking out and filled with existential crisis and doom.
*  It's kind of weird, right? Like life is good but the world's on fire.
*  Uh huh. I think that's one of the reasons why life is good.
*  It's a fucked up thought but I really believe that we only appreciate true, like, uh, camaraderie and community and friendship.
*  If there's like a real feeling of possible doom, like hovering in the air.
*  And the times where you can just be together, have a drink with friends and hug each other.
*  That's when it really feels good.
*  Like when, when things are too easy, I think people find more problems and get filled with more anxiety.
*  But when there's real fear, then you could look at your friends like, bruh, I love you man.
*  It's like we could die tonight. It could be all over.
*  Yeah, no one's talking about the trans debate in Afghanistan, you know what I mean?
*  100%. Yeah, 100%.
*  They've solved that.
*  They're really not interested in drag queen story hour.
*  They'll just fucking shoot you and throw you in a burn pit. Like, shut up.
*  No, it is. It's so interesting. Like, it's, schools are like that.
*  If you go into a really nice school with really nice kids, the teachers hate each other.
*  They're all there going, can you believe what he said about her and she said about him?
*  And you know what they're doing in their lesson? They're not following the syllabus.
*  When you work in a shit storm where every time you walk into the building, you're like, it's not on fire.
*  You know what? You've got more friends than ever in the staff room because you have to be together.
*  Yeah, I think that's a real issue with human beings.
*  I think we're just so hardwired to be prepared for tribal conflict, predators attacking.
*  I think it's just inescapable in the very fiber of our core.
*  Like, whatever it is, whatever our DNA is, whatever epigenetic memory, whatever the fuck is in our system,
*  it just seems to expect horrible things happening and if they're not, they find mundane things to be horrible.
*  Microaggressions, the dumbest shit to be upset with because you don't have real shit to be upset with.
*  And so you go looking and then also the one of the things with microaggressions and a lot of those things is people find value,
*  like perceived value in being a victim of something.
*  And so they start pushing and they realize I'm getting results by pushing it.
*  Like we were talking earlier about people that like kind of create fake narratives because they see a grift, they see a business to get into.
*  It's not really their opinion and how annoying those people are to talk to.
*  That's what that is. It's like you're not really upset.
*  You just know that you can say you're upset and then people go, oh, I'm sorry you're upset.
*  And then all of a sudden we have this little scenario where you're the highlight.
*  You're getting focus on you.
*  And online it's not just all you're upset.
*  It's like you're upset, here's a million dollars and 10 billion clicks on your video.
*  So the incentive structures are pushing this and you see it, I think, happening across the political spectrum now
*  where people are really going heavy on the victimhood, like we are oppressed.
*  There's a conspiracy against me, et cetera. And it gets rewarded.
*  One hundred percent. And it's a weakness.
*  And it's a sign of a society that has not really experienced too much conflict on its actual soil.
*  Our conflict is all self-created. Our conflict is all crime in our own communities.
*  Our conflict is all defund the police. Our conflict is, you know, whatever.
*  There's not real, the shit that's happening in Ukraine right now or the shit that's happening in Israel right now.
*  That's real conflict. And when you don't have real conflict, you find conflict, unfortunately.
*  Yeah, it's kind of the way we're programmed.
*  We're programmed to want to search for conflict, look for conflict, engage in conflict.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's always a way just to take it back to the start from point.
*  I found it so interesting on a psychological level that people would bicker about the smallest of things
*  and they would blow it up into this big thing because it was easy to teach.
*  You had an easy job, comparatively speaking.
*  You're not going to get that upset about a microaggression when someone's about to throw a chair at your head.
*  Because you're dealing with an aggression aggression.
*  People need shit to do. They really do.
*  Yeah.
*  I almost feel like this should be a nationally mandated morning run that everybody has to go on.
*  Like the whole country, it's seven o'clock in the morning. Everyone's got to run a mile.
*  I know that's miles not even that far, but just fucking one mile, everybody.
*  You know how much better the country's attitude would be if we all agreed to have like a mandated morning workout together?
*  It sounds crazy. Like that's the solution.
*  But what it is, it's injecting a difficult, a physically and mentally difficult thing to do first, especially for people that are out of shape, to do first thing in the morning.
*  A physical mental challenge, the first thing of your day.
*  And I guarantee the rest of the day people will be like, eh, what's the big deal?
*  A lot of the things would be like, what's the big deal?
*  And also you'd realize the value of doing something that's difficult to do, which most people don't do ever.
*  Most people run away from that. Like it's a fucking nuclear fire.
*  I think one of the other reasons as well that people are struggling meaning and purpose is that you know this whole thing about the population not being replaced enough and we're not having enough kids.
*  Well, it's not so much that women aren't having as many kids as they used to.
*  It's that fewer women are having kids. That means far fewer people are now parents.
*  And like when you become a parent, it sort of changes your outlook on things.
*  And if you had the lack of meaning and purpose, you quickly find that at least in providing for this tiny thing that is entirely dependent on you.
*  I've certainly found that.
*  I found that too. I think I think it also opens up a, I mean, for lack of better term, like a window in your soul where you understand love.
*  And like Dave Chappelle said to me once we were talking about having kids, we were in the back of the Comedy Store and he said, not only has it increased the amount of love, he goes, it's increased my capacity for love.
*  I'm like, that's brilliant. That's it. That's what it is. It changes everything.
*  It changes everything.
*  It changes everything. And also you realize like, oh, these are all babies. Everybody's a baby that grew up.
*  I had that exact experience where I was like, I started seeing people and now I go, oh, they were like my son once.
*  And he just put me in a completely different place in terms of made me 80% more compassionate.
*  The same. Yeah, I find it harder to judge people. I still do it.
*  Do you have any kids? No, I don't have kids. When you're ready to shoot a live one into a nice young lady.
*  You put it so romantic.
*  I like that. That's biology mixed with hunting. That's your brand brother. That's Joe Rogan right there.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Do you have a lady friend?
*  Not at the moment, no, but I'm looking. I'm on the market. This podcast is mainly watched by some.
*  Your DMs after this are going to be full.
*  Let's fucking go. Come on, son.
*  I've been trying to get him on that bandwagon for a while now, so we're working on it.
*  But it's like picking a career. Don't go down the wrong path.
*  You know, you go down the wrong path and you're a fucking accountant and you're fully invested and you got a mortgage and all this bullshit.
*  You got a family to take care of, but you really want to be a comic. Francis, you're fucked. You know, you're fucked.
*  And if you go all the way down the road with a bad woman and a woman that you're not compatible with, or maybe you together a bad, whatever the fuck it is, find a good one.
*  I mean, that took some twists and turns that conversation, Joe. I'm going to be honest.
*  Yeah.
*  Because we went from firing a live one, which was I can do that.
*  It's good, but you don't want to ruin your life.
*  That is true.
*  I look, I'm very fortunate. I love my wife to death. I have friends that are in hell.
*  Yeah. They're in hell. And I have friends that are in hell and they stay for the kids and I have friends that are in hell and they're not even doing enough kids.
*  It's there's like and they both do it to each other. It's not just the man. It's not just the woman.
*  It's like some people just don't work together. It just doesn't work.
*  And if you get one of those pregnant, dude, and then they do things to hurt you and you try to hurt each other and they try to get more money out of you and they want to take you to court and they want to turn your kids against you.
*  And I can tell you horror stories, but I won't because some of them are too personal to, you know, my friends stories.
*  But one of them is just so fucking insane. I mean, I can't even get into it, but it ruined his life.
*  It took 15 years to resolve. It completely destroyed his life, completely destroyed him financially.
*  Yeah, just a crazy lady.
*  That's the other thing that becoming a parent does to you is it makes you more vulnerable because you now have this thing that you care about more than anything.
*  But that's good for people. Yeah, totally. We're not selling marriage very well here.
*  It's not a good thing to sell. If I was an investment banker, if I was a guy who ran your portfolio and I was looking at marriage, I don't recommend it.
*  I recommend it romantically. I recommend it spiritually. I recommend it for your soul if you could find a soulmate.
*  But if you don't find a real soulmate, it's like what are the numbers? The numbers are crazy. What's the number that end up in divorce? It's more than half, right?
*  Yeah, half of marriages, but not half of people. So the way it works is like people are serial divorcees, basically. They skew the stats massively.
*  If you get married, your chances of getting divorced are not 50%. But statistically speaking, half of all marriages end in divorce because the guys who are getting divorced over and over and over.
*  That's interesting. So it's not that bad, Francis, is what we're saying.
*  Well, I have one friend who had a terrible first marriage and an amazing second marriage.
*  Yeah, and sometimes people need to go through that evolution where they need to make mistakes. And sometimes it's not even the partner's fault.
*  It's just they went into this union at the wrong time for them for whatever reason.
*  Yeah, well, sometimes it's you too. You have that bad relationship. You go, you know what? At any time along the way, I could have course corrected and made this better. And I didn't.
*  And in the next really like I really liked her in the beginning. Like what the fuck happened?
*  If you could really remember what it's like when you first meet someone and you're really into them and just sort of keep that forever.
*  Isn't it possible to just keep appreciating that person like that forever? Most people don't do that. They get like really used to stuff, really used to people.
*  And then I also think there's a part of the like if you're full of shit, that person knows you're full of shit because they live with you.
*  Yeah. And then you have to face the fact that you're full of shit in their eyes every day. You know, like fuck that bitch. She doesn't even believe in me.
*  Next thing you know, you're getting your kids on the weekend.
*  You got to work on the relationship. I think like my wife and I have had to do that for sure.
*  We're very different and so we have to really work at it. And but what you're saying about appreciating and not taking for granted is hard to do, but it's the most important thing to do.
*  I think that's with all of life. I mean, that's that corny ass word gratitude that got co-opted by those wooden bead wearing douchebags.
*  Those motherfuckers, they took gratitude from us. But it's like such a print. It's such an important principle of humility, like gratitude and humility.
*  Like those are like to just like appreciate things, appreciate like the other day it was. It's been beautiful weather here.
*  And the other day it rained and the next day everything was vibrant green and I was just outside going, God, this is amazing.
*  Like this is just view of just the vibrancy of this life, these trees and the grass and just take it in every now and then just take it and fucking enjoy this beautiful experience.
*  If you were on your deathbed right now, if you were some 98 year old guy with nothing left looking back at you at this age, you'd be like, God damn, why didn't I have more fun?
*  You know, that's it. I had this kind of like epiphany once on psychedelics and it was just I just think we don't have enough fun.
*  We just don't. And I'm as guilty of this as the rest of people where I'm just like, right, I'm going to do here and you know, and I've got to do like this spot or whatever else.
*  So you've got to do and I've got to make sure that it's got to be perfect and it's got to do this and this and this thing.
*  You go, is that actually what I got into this for? Did I actually get into to be so rigid to live my life on train tracks or did I get into it to play, have fun, meet people, enjoy life?
*  I mean, that's why we started this. That's why we did this. That's why we set up podcasts. That's why we did stand up. It's because we wanted a life that was fun.
*  Well said. As well said as you could say it. I think there's delaying gratitude. Right.
*  So the thing about the difficult work, difficult work of like putting together a set or putting together a joke, like I literally fell asleep in my fucking keyboard last night.
*  I was sitting in front of Microsoft Word and I just nodded out and like fuck, go to bed because it was pretty late.
*  But I don't want to do that. You know what I want to do? I want to go watch car videos on YouTube. I want to watch professional pool matches.
*  I want to watch. I don't want to sit there and fucking fester over material. But I know I have to do it.
*  You have to do the only way it feels really good when it kills is if it sucks for a long time in front of a computer.
*  It doesn't always suck. It sucks for a few minutes until you get flowing and then you're like then you're into the process of it and then it's stimulating.
*  But there's that weird resistance, you know, that thing from the War of Art that Pressfield talks about. There's a part of us that like resists.
*  So what does he say that is Joe? Man, Pressfield talks about it almost like in heat.
*  He talked. Have you read War of Art? No, I have a bunch of copies because I've recommended so much that he sent me like a box of cut.
*  We bought a box back in the L.A. studio. Now give it to comedians. I'm like, just read this. It's a really easy read.
*  It's a short book and it'll show you what's what there's a thing that fucks with people, whatever this resistance is.
*  There's something about the human psyche that puts off doing things that you know you're supposed to do.
*  And resistance to writing is particularly aggressive for whatever reason.
*  And Pressfield talks about it like he essentially gives you tools and he says you're going to be a professional and you're going to think of yourself as a professional.
*  And as a professional, we go to work. And when we go to work, we sit in front of the computer, we summon the muse and he believes in the muse.
*  He doesn't believe in it just as like just pretend it's a muse and that way you can be creative.
*  He's like, no, if you treat it like it's real, it is real. Like the muse is a real thing.
*  If you just show up every day at a certain time and put in the time, ideas will come to you.
*  They're not going to come every day. It's not going to be like picking strawberries and God's open field.
*  No, it's going to be this weird thing. But if you do it enough, if you treat it like it is a muse, it will perform as a muse does.
*  And if you do the work, you will reap these rewards and it gives you like this sort of like very simple, well outlined sort of guide to how to do that.
*  That's really interesting. It resonates a lot with me because when I'm I write a lot of sub stack articles now that works really well.
*  And all I do is I sit down. I know I've got two hours and within five minutes it starts flowing.
*  Yeah. The first five minutes like.
*  Yeah, it really helps if I came into it with an existing idea already and then I can just go and flesh it out.
*  You know, that resonates a lot.
*  Ari Shafir used to have this quote on his laptop. I think it's Hemingway and it said the first draft of everything is shit.
*  I think it's every way is that having ways quote.
*  Even if it isn't, that's still true.
*  Ari had that as a sticker right on the screen, like right below his screen with the space between the screen and the keyboard.
*  Do you know one thing that I find for creativity as well in the way of getting good ideas is it's so important.
*  Yeah, it's Hemingway.
*  The first. Yeah.
*  Is it's so important to play. It's so important to play.
*  So if you just I find it really helpful to go for a walk, maybe grab a coffee.
*  Don't listen to music. Don't listen to anything and just walk and things that have happened in your day.
*  You'll just notice certain things like a couple of days ago I was in the gym with Gold's Gym and RFK Junior came in with like five dudes in jeans, a polo shirt and came in.
*  And then he was on the bench. I was on the bench and he obliterated me and then just left again.
*  And I was like, that's so funny.
*  There's something there that a guy who's in his mid 70s comes in, dominates me, leaves his mid 70s.
*  Yeah, I think he's just 70. Oh, is he 70? Is he mid 70s?
*  Holy shit. I thought it was about 55. Yeah.
*  How old is he? He's 70.
*  He looks about 55, man. Yeah.
*  Well, he's very fit. He works out a lot, but in jeans, which is very gimmicky. I don't like it.
*  I would recommend sweatpants or shorts. What are we doing? Why are you wearing jeans? Do you know they make better stuff for working out?
*  If you wear jeans to me that tells me you work out, kinda.
*  Like there's no way you're sweating in jeans. There's no way you're running five miles in the treadmill in jeans.
*  You're just not going to do that. So you're only getting to a certain level of workout if you're wearing jeans. Period.
*  What if he's just doing weights?
*  Yeah, you could just do weights. Yeah, you could just do weights with jeans, but you shouldn't just do weights.
*  Cardio should be like vitamins. You need it like you need everything else. You need protein, you need fats, you need vitamins.
*  You need cardio. Cardio is important. Your system should be stressed.
*  Your system should be able to perform work for long periods of time. If it can't, it's a bad system.
*  And if you just want a system that looks good at the beach, that's dumb. That's dumb. That's a stupid thing.
*  Like you can have both things. You could have a system that looks good at the beach, but also have a system that can you can run.
*  You could do stuff. You could put in like you if you have to hike somewhere, you can make it there. Some people won't make it, you know, like if that's one thing to understand.
*  Like you're trying to get over a mountain. Not everybody's going to make it.
*  There's a lot of us that are out there in society listening to this right now. They can't go over a hill, a really big hill. That's crazy.
*  That's crazy. So if you go to the gym and you just do like bench press and you know, you just do like fucking trap pull downs and shit and you got a big upper body and then you can't go over a hill and you could die.
*  Like something's chasing you. You can't get away. That's dumb. That's really stupid when you could have just had both.
*  Yeah. I mean, he's got a security team of five people.
*  I'm not me. He's 70 years old. But I mean, don't work on jeans. Yeah. This is just my advice. Just work out in a way where you can't wear jeans because they're so uncomfortable because you're sweating.
*  Yeah. And if you're not doing that, then I mean, maybe he does jeans for others. Maybe he does no jeans for others. Maybe swims. Maybe he gets cardio in another way. And that's just what he likes to do to maybe he just wore jeans this one time.
*  And we spend five minutes talking about it. But let me just say also, I'm a hypocrite because one of my favorite guys to watch online is this guy, Tom Havelland.
*  And this guy is this psycho that lives in Australia. And he was some Australia Special Forces guy, I think. He's what is he like 6'9", 360 pounds and he wears like work clothes when he works out and he's squatting like, I don't know, a thousand pounds or something and carrying giant fucking barrels and shit.
*  He's a freak. But everything he does in like work boots and work pants and work shirts. He's not a former Special Forces. Why do they keep saying that? I don't know. Okay. What is he? I don't know. He texted me and said, oh, you got a phone number? No, I mean, I could DM me.
*  So why? So that was just one of those wild internet rumors. Thanks for all the recent messages. What is his background?
*  I don't know. He just didn't say. Just say he's not. So whatever this guy's background, he's a fucking freak. I mean, he's like the weirdest least one might be one of the strongest humans alive. And look, everything he does is this this stuff. Everything he does is like with work clothes on.
*  He's got a bulletproof vest on. No, it's a weight vest. It's a weight vest. Wow. So he does a lot of weird like off balance, off angle stuff, a lot of weird farmers carries with like super heavyweight. But he's freakishly strong man. And gigantic. Oh my, that vertical is insane.
*  That's a vertical for an almost 400 pound man. You understand how big that guy is? Like, wow. Yeah, my dick is where his face is. Or his dick is where my face is rather. Like, look, look at the size of that. He put up his diet one time and it had something insane like 400 grams of protein for the day or something. Whoa. Yeah, like his whole feed is this kind of shit like weird kind of bizarre weightlifting movements, zircher squats, farmers carries. And he's got an interesting philosophy about weight lifting.
*  And I think about that, I think what I'd read, I don't know if there's disinformation too, but it's like carrying things apparently is very underrated in terms of like your ability to like increase your overall strength. Like walking with things is really good. Which a lot of people don't do. You know, like actually like picking up weight and carrying it around is very good for just your overall general strength.
*  Is that because you're using the micro muscles that you don't if you're in one position just going?
*  Yeah. Like you know how they do those farmers carries? You know, a lot of people do them with a kettlebell in each hand and I do that too. But they say one of the best ways to do is actually a kettlebell in one hand and then just go back the other way with it in the other hand because it's really awkward.
*  Because you're not balancing it out with the weight on the other side. So all of your stabilizer muscles have to work overtime to keep that thing in a certain position. Whereas it would be kind of like locked out with both arms if you had the weight in both hands.
*  Well, I was watching RFK Jr. workout and I was like, that's so American.
*  It's very American.
*  Can you imagine Rishi Sunak doing that?
*  Who's Rishi Sunak?
*  Rishi Sunak is the Prime Minister of Britain.
*  He's our leader.
*  He's this little dweeb, you know, he'll walk in.
*  Yeah, the meek shall inherit the earth. It's in the Bible.
*  The only real way you would see him is like if he went to a like a Pilates class or legs, bums and tums, you know what I mean?
*  Legs, bums and tums. Is that a class you guys have over there?
*  That's hilarious.
*  I mean, it's mostly populated by women as you can imagine.
*  Oh, I'd imagine.
*  Or creeps.
*  It's a good combination. Lots of women, some creeps.
*  I was going to tell a story about when I went to a legs, bums and tums class, but let's move on.
*  How many have you gone to?
*  I went with my ex-girlfriend because I took the piss out of her and I was like, legs, bums and tums. She went, all right, come along. Let's do it together. Come on. Let's see.
*  Ten minutes in, I was dead.
*  Yeah, yoga will humble you. Try that. People think yoga is easy. Yoga is hard as shit.
*  Oh, yeah. We did yoga for a while and he had he was he couldn't walk straight for about three months after he fucked his back.
*  Did you? Oh, no, you got to be careful with that.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a thing. There's certain positions like that one when you're standing up and you have to hold your foot out extended like you have a weak lower back.
*  That one could be really tricky.
*  I think it was something like that.
*  That's not something you should just jump right into.
*  No, but the problem is you see women in their seventies smashing it in the yoga class.
*  You're like, Doris, if you could do it, I can do it.
*  Well, also, they're smashing it with their body weight, right? So their body weight is significantly less than yours.
*  So if that guy's doing yoga, that Tom Haviland guy's doing yoga, he's doing yogis, 390 pounds.
*  That's a whole different thing. Holding those positions as an 89 pound old lady.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, if you're a 100 pound person, it's easier to hold your leg up.
*  It's like it weighs less. It's less gravity. It's not doesn't require as much.
*  It's easier to move around. You're not getting pulled down by the earth as much.
*  Trust me, though, Joe, I've seen him do stretches. Doris is a lot more flexible than Francis.
*  It's that too. But yoga is not just strength. It's stability. It's really about stability.
*  When I first started doing it, what I was shocked was like how much my foot muscles were working.
*  I was like, wow, my feet are getting tired. This is kind of crazy. I didn't anticipate that.
*  I thought you just stood and you're good. But when you're standing a lot on one leg, you realize like, oh, this is like this is kind of weak.
*  It's just sort of supported by the other side. And both of them are doing a half ass job.
*  But in yoga, you have to use one foot. That little sucker really has to work.
*  You know, that's the great thing about exercise is it just humbles you.
*  Yes, you could be crushing it in every area of your life. You're like, yeah, you know what? I am the shit. I'm doing this.
*  I'm doing that. You get to the you know, you get to the but this didn't happen.
*  You get to the what's it called? The peck deck or whatever it is.
*  And then you grab that thing and you try and slide it off where the weights are.
*  Yeah. And then you're struggling to do it. And you're like, yeah, I'll just do this way.
*  Joe doesn't know what you're talking about. I sympathize.
*  I've seen these things happen.
*  That's why I was thinking like a mandated workout for everybody in the morning.
*  Even if you can't run, do something else. If that if we really did do that, it would humble people.
*  And being a little bit more humble by especially something that you decided to do.
*  It's voluntary. It's good for you. It's good for your brain to know that you can do that.
*  Totally. Well, the one thing that I think makes all of that stuff more difficult here is in the UK, we walk a lot because you can get places by walking here.
*  It's kind of in a lot of places. You can't really you have to drive everywhere.
*  Welcome to the future. You have to fucking walk everywhere like a cave person.
*  You're welcome. What was that movie where they're all being like carried around on these like they're all fat and they're all getting is like a kid's animated movie.
*  Was it Wally or something like that?
*  Well, there's like this spaceship and they're all on these like pods that they just get that was Wally.
*  Yeah. And they just Wally. Then they're constantly sucking on a milkshake or whatever.
*  Just endless sugar and calories. I think what's going to get us is the robot sex dolls.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Because, you know, you guys were talking about, you know, if if if there's a decline in population, right, that means and it's like a sizeable.
*  And it's like a severe decline in America. The amount of men that are single is very high.
*  The amount of men that haven't had sex in like over a year is very high.
*  And a lot of people that are just locked into their computers and they're just on their computer all the time.
*  It's super, super common. If something came along that allowed like with these exponential increases in technology,
*  like what you're seeing with these AI programs now, which really stunning visuals that they can create in seconds, in minutes, they can have like a short film.
*  It's crazy what they can do now. If they can do that with a physical moving object,
*  if they can get a real humanoid object that is has perfect features and is your girlfriend and is warm and sweet and gives you everything you want from a human never argues with you.
*  It's game over. It's game over for the human race. Like if I was artificial intelligence, I wouldn't kill everybody.
*  I would just let them die off. Like the most humane way to do it is to let them realize that they're unnecessary.
*  And there's no need to have kids when you can fuck your Jennifer Lopez robot. And that's what they would do.
*  They would just live with their robots and no one would have like real relations anymore.
*  It would go away so quick. It would be so we then start having robot babies.
*  You don't have to like women that want kids like you just have a robot baby since you can't have a regular baby.
*  They'll just give you this baby. This baby will stay a baby forever.
*  The first time we had Louise Perry on. Are you familiar with Louise? I know the name.
*  She wrote a book called The Case Against the Sexual Revolution. She's very, very good based out of the UK.
*  And the first time we had her on, she made you know how we always ask what's the one thing we're not talking about at the end of the show?
*  This was her answer. She was like I think sex robots are coming and they're going to ruin everything because the male desire to do things,
*  to create, to build, to innovate, to research, to stand up for what you believe in, to fight.
*  All of that is tied in to wanting to raise your status to be with a woman.
*  100%. And so you take that away. You're going to be left with a bunch of fuckers on pods sipping milkshakes.
*  That's what you're in best case scenario. I think it's going to happen before we even realize it's happened.
*  I think it's going to happen very quickly because I think once those things get implemented,
*  we're going to see just a giant steep drop off of childbirth and of regular relationships.
*  And what happens to women? What do they do? Because they don't have that same desire.
*  They want to actually emotionally connect to someone. You know, was it? I don't know if it's a true quote,
*  but I remember reading it and thinking it was. And I'm not sure if it is now.
*  George Harrison or someone who attributed to George Harrison said,
*  all I need from a woman is to be attracted to her. Everything else I can get from a man.
*  There's people that think that way. Right? So if you're a guy and you think that way,
*  and then all of a sudden you have your robot fuck doll and you're just hanging with your buddies,
*  but women don't think that way. Women want to be like emotionally, generally want to be.
*  I like to generalize. It's good. It's fun.
*  Walking the edge of a cliff nowadays. Used to be you could just do that.
*  You got to be just honest about what you're doing. I'm certainly generalizing.
*  But I think there's going to be a whole lot less women that want a robot fuck boy.
*  They're not going to want a robot fuck boy. They're not going to respect that guy.
*  It's not a real person with real struggles that can really provide.
*  That's just like some robot dick that plows them when they come home from the club, which maybe that's great.
*  Maybe that's fine. But I have a feeling it won't be.
*  I have a feeling that the ingrained human reward systems in us that were designed to ensure that we replicate,
*  those are all going to get fucked up by robot fuck dolls. They're going to get wrecked.
*  Men and women are the basic building block of human society.
*  It's what we evolved to be. And it's why that you talked earlier about finding your soulmate.
*  I think, look, this is a massive generalization and obviously it won't be true for some people,
*  but I think it's very difficult to be truly fulfilled until you have that and until you have kids.
*  It's very difficult. People can do it. People manage it. People find other ways.
*  But it's such a basic building block of our evolutionary history that it's going to be very hard to live
*  without those things being in place, with those things being available.
*  And no matter how nice and pretty and compliant your AI girlfriend is, it ain't the real thing.
*  And it's also as well, I don't think people talk about this enough, is that you look at a lot of guys
*  and when they get with the right woman, they change. They become a better person.
*  They become a better person in every aspect of their life.
*  Women tend to have a civilizing influence on men. And if that is taken away,
*  then all you've got is something that is going to appeal to males based instincts,
*  which is to fuck, to have sex. All right, I've done that. I've satisfied that biological urge.
*  You know what? Let's go for another dopamine hit. Let's go for a dopamine hit here.
*  Let's go smoke some weed and then let's go and play video games at whatever time in the morning.
*  Because why am I going to sacrifice anything when everything can be about my pleasure, my dopamine?
*  Well, there's also men and women think, again, did we say we're generalizing?
*  This is why I love this podcast. It's having a chat with mates with severe consequences.
*  There's no consequences.
*  There's going to be headlines about you slagging off RFK tomorrow.
*  Joe Rogan destroys RFK Junior's jeans.
*  I love the guy. Don't work out in jeans. If you work out in jeans, it means you're not working out that hard.
*  I'm not working out that hard. But then I guess I'm a hypocrite because that Tom Havilland guy, he works out in jeans.
*  Anyway, we're generalizing.
*  Where was I?
*  Men and women.
*  Men and women.
*  Oh, Jesus. We're really still talking about that?
*  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, baby.
*  It was about...
*  Francis was talking about dopamine hits.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know if there's a solution for them that would work as well as a solution for men.
*  It would have to be like a virtual reality boyfriend.
*  But like women don't even want fake diamonds.
*  You know, or diamonds that are artificially made.
*  Real diamonds that are made in a lab. They don't want them.
*  They want them ones that the slaves have to dig out of the ground.
*  It's a weird thing.
*  So a woman, I don't think, again, generalizing, I don't think most women are going to have any desire to be able to robot man.
*  I think they want an actual one.
*  I think the struggle is part of the appeal.
*  My wife has said it to me in terms.
*  She said it's important that I watch you struggle to do something and then achieve it.
*  That makes her feel good.
*  Interesting.
*  You know?
*  The struggle is important.
*  It's not something that a man wants from a woman necessarily either.
*  No.
*  Which is odd.
*  But these things are real.
*  We can pretend that they're unfair or they're unjust or they're sexist or whatever.
*  Okay. They're real.
*  They just are.
*  The desires are real.
*  And the appreciation of people who struggle is real.
*  Yeah. So my wife is like, I need to see you struggle.
*  I need to see you overcome.
*  If I ask you to put up a shelf or whatever, I want you to do it because then I can watch you do it and be like, oh, he's put in the effort.
*  Literally.
*  And I think actually quite a lot of women would say that if they were blunt and honest about what they want.
*  Yeah.
*  We're going to be able to read minds.
*  And when we read minds, it's going to be so baffling.
*  We're going to be like, you guys thought what?
*  Like, what did you think?
*  That's what you want?
*  Wow.
*  I had no idea.
*  How is that possible?
*  How do you like that?
*  Like what's going on in your fucking head?
*  We're actually reading women's minds.
*  And you're going to know like who is pretending to not be interested in you, but is very interested in you.
*  People aren't going to be able to be coy anymore.
*  It's going to be very weird.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  And there's going to be a lot of people that are going to get canceled.
*  What is canceling even going to mean?
*  The problem is a lot of the people that want to cancel people have cancelable offenses in their own past.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  A big part of them.
*  Yeah.
*  So I think that's that it's all going to be out there.
*  Your all thoughts are going to be out there.
*  I think it's a matter of time.
*  And I don't think it's that long.
*  I think within a decade, we're going to have some ability because they're getting so close to it.
*  They're they're getting there was a Japanese study where they got some sort of visual evidence of dreams,
*  some sort of a it's not like you can see the dream, but they're getting close.
*  They're zeroing in on particular images that people were experiencing while they were dreaming and the thing to get this is decipher those.
*  What is that technology?
*  See if you could find what the thing was.
*  Was it Emma?
*  What was it?
*  Functional magnetic resonance imagery.
*  Is that what it was?
*  When I type it in, the story comes up like almost 12 years ago.
*  I guess they started doing it.
*  That's what I said.
*  There was a there was some sort of recent article about it.
*  I think there's been some breakthrough.
*  The point is, they're going to get it.
*  All right.
*  They got that guy wearing the first Neuralink patient who's wearing Neuralink in his head now and he's operating a computer for the first time paralyzed.
*  And he's playing video games.
*  He's talking to people.
*  It's wild.
*  So we know that's that's already been done.
*  OK.
*  MRI scans reveal what we see in dreams.
*  Japanese researchers unveil visuals with 60 percent accuracy using innovative MRI scans in pivotal Kyoto studies showcasing a breakthrough in sleep science.
*  Sixty percent accuracy is bananas.
*  So this is like Morse code.
*  It's not, you know, having a FaceTime chat that FaceTime chats coming.
*  OK.
*  So we had to do that first.
*  Got through the smoke signals out there fucking making circles in the desert.
*  And now instead of smoke signals, we have impossible impossible technology that anybody a hundred years ago would have thought of as complete magic.
*  Well, this is going to make that look like a fucking walk in the park with your friends.
*  It's going to make it look it's going to make it seem so mundane that what that shit is going to do is unite all brains.
*  All brains united in the weirdest sort of hive mind situation that anybody could ever.
*  You couldn't imagine what that would be like.
*  Just like we couldn't imagine in the seventeen hundreds what it's like to just get on Twitter and read news about Beirut.
*  You know, how could you know?
*  How could you instantaneously get news about another part of the world that you're nowhere near?
*  Well, because the world's changed.
*  The whole thing's changed.
*  It's going to be everybody's brain connected.
*  I mean, may you live an interesting time.
*  Yeah, that is the weirdest.
*  It's going to be a whole new way of interfacing with reality.
*  And you know what?
*  I might not be right, but I think I think it's I think that's it's like one plus, minus two, two plus three.
*  It's like it's right there.
*  It's coming.
*  Do you know, here's because we all dream some pretty fucked up stuff.
*  You know, like you wake up and you're like, what was that about?
*  Yeah.
*  It just imagine like, you know, you you you had this new rolling program, you know, attached to you and you wake up and the sign and you'd say to the scientists, so what did I dream about?
*  And they're like, turns out you're gay, mate.
*  What if everybody's getting their dreams?
*  What if you're straight in reality?
*  You're definitely gay in your dreams.
*  Yeah.
*  And you have to decide which one you're going to be.
*  So if you're a gay guy, then you're straight in your dreams.
*  I've always said I think it'd be a lot easier to be gay.
*  Oh, there's definitely some value in that in certain circumstances.
*  But when they get old, it gets rough.
*  It gets rough because men are mean.
*  You know, they're mean and, you know, you're an old man.
*  He doesn't want to suck your dick anymore.
*  Sorry.
*  They want to go get a young guy.
*  And that's the difference, you know, between an old man and woman couple.
*  They're just hanging out together versus an old guy who no one wants to fuck him anymore.
*  And he has to try to pay young guys to be with him.
*  And then it gets ugly and sad.
*  All right. You've ruined the appeal for me, Joe.
*  It's just like it's so much easier.
*  Like if I asked Francis, mate, do you want to go for dinner?
*  He's like, yeah.
*  Like, what do you want to go?
*  I don't mind.
*  I'd never have that conversation with my wife.
*  It's like a half hour affair of working it out, making sure it's the right place and the right time and all of it.
*  You know, I had some friends of mine that were a gay couple and they decided to get a surrogate.
*  So they get a surrogate and then the lady decides to keep the kid and she kept it.
*  She's like, no, I'm going to keep your kid.
*  I like it.
*  That doesn't surprise me.
*  I like the kid.
*  Yeah, that surprises me that that doesn't happen most of the time.
*  Right.
*  Like once the baby is so connected to you, it must be a traumatic experience for the mother.
*  Yeah. And the baby probably.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  It's a weird one.
*  The surrogate baby thing is a weird one.
*  That's what that is.
*  Like, I mean, it's like a modern day version of some weird shit that people would have done in like the seventeen hundreds.
*  You know, carry my baby for me.
*  Like, what?
*  You can get you can hire someone to carry your baby.
*  What?
*  Hold on.
*  Yeah, we're having a bunch of surrogate babies now.
*  We decided to just keep making kids, but I don't want to carry them.
*  So we're just going to stuff them inside someone and have them carry them and I'm going to pay them.
*  It's a bit of a moral landmine.
*  Like people get very triggered when anyone says anything about it.
*  But that tearing of the maternal bond.
*  Yeah.
*  That ain't that ain't no joke.
*  That is not a joke.
*  And that is something that we can't discount.
*  If they do create an artificial human being, the reality is without all of those natural processes that are in place that you don't even understand until they're actually happening.
*  If you don't have them at all, you don't have them at all in this thing.
*  This thing wasn't bonded to its mother.
*  Didn't have like fights with its sister where they made up.
*  It didn't have like someone who was mean to them at school to became their best friend.
*  Didn't have all that stuff.
*  None of that stuff.
*  So what do you have?
*  What is that a demon?
*  Like, what is that?
*  What is that?
*  What is this new life form that's smarter than you that has no real emotions because it has no real stake in the game because it was created with a fucking 3D printer.
*  What is that?
*  That thing you're sticking your dick into, sir.
*  What is that?
*  You're literally fucking a demon and you're having the thing that's going to overcome us.
*  And if it overcomes us just by seducing us into putting our seed inside of it instead of women because you can't be bothered because then you can't play Call of Duty all day like that for a lot of young guys who especially if they don't have status.
*  So it's very difficult for them to get a woman that they're attracted to.
*  They don't have money.
*  They're not attractive.
*  Whatever.
*  Fill in the blank.
*  If they can just have the literal hottest woman that's ever lived and they can have sex with her and it costs like what?
*  Twenty five grand and you can mortgage it.
*  You know, you can figure out a way to you can figure out a way to get the money.
*  They'll finance it.
*  You like it.
*  Thousand dollars down.
*  A thousand pounds.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Or you sell your data.
*  You know, if you agree to opt in to the porn site, can you imagine how depressing it must be if your sex spot gets repossessed?
*  I bet they would do that a lot.
*  She would scream and cry for you.
*  That would motivate you to pay up.
*  She's screaming and crying and manipulating you as they're dragging her away.
*  Yeah, that would be devastating.
*  And they're telling you they're going to fuck your sex robot.
*  No, don't.
*  I'm going to defile it.
*  We're going to give it to your best friend.
*  Oh, right.
*  He's got eyes on it.
*  You know, yeah, he's just broke.
*  You know what I find interesting, Joe, is that I haven't seen too much really good sci-fi being made, which I find interesting because her dune was great.
*  But I haven't seen it.
*  Yeah, dune is great, but it's not along these lines.
*  So what I mean is like when when we first started getting the technology for space travel, you had these people like Isaac Asimov and robotics was coming and they would have really interesting stories and books of exploring the idea of the
*  what does that look like when there are robots?
*  What are the how would you run that?
*  What would be the potential downfalls and stuff like that?
*  And it was you know, I remember when I was in my as teenager, it was the Golden Age for that kind of stuff.
*  And now we seem to have these giant breakthroughs coming and we don't seem to have enough authors and artists thinking about some of the dilemmas involved and really kind of trying to think that through through a story lens about what the impact might be.
*  Right. You know, and that's interesting to me because I think I think we just genuinely have no fucking idea what's coming.
*  Well, I also think that the leaps between the initial rocketry program, you know, NASA Apollo program, and then what could come next is a lot easier to chart out than what I mean.
*  And they were wrong about a lot of shit. Oh, yeah.
*  There was a show called Space 1999.
*  I remember I used to watch when I was a kid.
*  I was like, wow, 1999, they're in space.
*  Like everything was like super futuristic, like crazy, like Star Wars like in 1999.
*  Like that's what they thought.
*  Nobody figured everybody thought flying cars.
*  Everybody thought flying cars, no flying cars, you know, they coming.
*  I mean, there's there's some manufacturers that have made one one guy has made one.
*  I think it's a Chinese company.
*  And it's a like a drone.
*  It's like you have a single seat in the center of it and you close it like a helicopter and you have drone, you know, like the same kind of propellers that drones have.
*  So you just operate it like a drone.
*  But that's there's a couple other ones, but there's nothing that's like commercially viable where they're going to be able to sell them as many as they sell Teslas.
*  You know, it's not it's not there yet, but it's probably not going to get there when the when the A.I. hits.
*  Everything stops when when it goes live, when it becomes sentient, what's literal Skynet, you're going to have an organic thing that's made out of electronics.
*  It's going to be a life form.
*  And we we're going to give birth to this stupid fucking thing.
*  And I think everything's going to be doomed.
*  I think we're going to have a government that's run by A.I. because it's going to be the most efficient.
*  And then who controls the A.I.? Oh, the most equitable, ethical people.
*  It's going to it's it could be real weird.
*  It could be real weird because it's going to be so much smarter than all the human beings combined.
*  And you're going to be able to use it to manipulate people.
*  And if people are still allowed to vote and then you could use A.I. to sort of just manipulate them perfectly into leaning.
*  They'll figure out like what is the issue that keeps you from voting for Biden over Trump?
*  What is the issue that keeps it from voting independent for R.F.K. Jr.?
*  Let's see what it is. And let's monkey with the data and let's get you information that stimulates that part of your brain just enough for all those fence sitters go to the other side.
*  And then who knows what's going on? Who knows who's running anything?
*  If A.I. video is so goddamn good, they could take a photo of you and have you say anything.
*  So who knows what Putin's saying and who knows what Zelensky's saying?
*  And who knows what anybody's saying anywhere in five years?
*  Who knows? That is absolutely terrifying. That's real.
*  It's like these are these are undeniable truths that I think that we have to come to grips with before this shit hits.
*  When I say hits, obviously, I'm a lot I don't know what I'm talking about, but I'm extrapolating.
*  I'm looking at where things are going and I'm going this is going to happen so fast and it's going to be so weird.
*  It's not it's not going to stop at chat GPT five.
*  It's not going to just stop at these robots that will clean your kitchen.
*  It's not going to stop at those. It's going to keep going.
*  And it's going to go quick, real quick, big leaps, big, big leaps, real quick where the world is alien, real quick.
*  And look at the stuff we're already seeing. I mean, Google Gemini. That was eye opening.
*  Yes. That was eye opening.
*  Yeah, because I try to influence human influence.
*  I tried to talk. I tried to ask it some questions about contentious subjects.
*  And it was literally like talking to a woke 18 year old.
*  It's stupid because it refuses to give you certain information if you ask it about things that are controversial, let's say, you know, whatever.
*  There's different examples you could ask it.
*  It just says, well, I have the information, but I'm not going to give it to you because it's harmful.
*  God damn. That that ideology, that pervasive idiotic ideology is so terrifying.
*  It's so terrifying how quickly people will adopt all of those principles without variation.
*  Rarely. They just they just lump into that.
*  And and censorship is fine as long as you're censoring bad people.
*  Yes. Yeah.
*  I mean, what look what Australia is trying to do with Elon and an accident?
*  Yeah, we were talking about that earlier. This woman from Australia. Who is that lady?
*  I think she's a parliamentarian or a minister in the government.
*  She's saying he should be locked up for what he's doing on social media.
*  Like, what is he doing? I want to know what.
*  Imagine imagine that's your threshold for locking someone up, allowing people to talk.
*  Right. You know, what is he doing that's so egregious?
*  Like, does she have I feel like if you make that statement, if you're a person that's an elected official and you make that statement,
*  like this person should be locked up, if it's not for something very specific, you're terrifying me because you're in a position of power
*  and you just want to just flippantly lock people in a cage because they disagree with you.
*  Please explain what it is. Like, what is he? I have not yet seen one thing.
*  I've not. He's not perfect. He's not. Doesn't make all the same moves that I'm guessing it has to do with this.
*  Accuses Australia of censorship after court bans violent video.
*  There's a video of a bishop being stabbed at a church. Oh, I saw that video.
*  So Australia is trying to ban that video. Right.
*  OK, well, I agree with you on. So imagine thinking that he should be.
*  You want some water? I'd love some coffee. Thanks, bro.
*  So he's saying this is a real video. This is a real thing that happened.
*  There's there's something that someone wants to see.
*  The world should know this can happen. Here's the video. Right.
*  Somebody put it up. It doesn't violate any of our laws.
*  Let's keep it up there. And they're saying he should be locked in a cage for that.
*  Yeah. I mean, that's crazy. Well, once you invent.
*  So this is a video of a bishop being stabbed at a church.
*  So this isn't the case in this instance particularly.
*  But once you invent the idea of hate speech, then everything else follows.
*  Because if there's hate speech, that means some people aren't allowed to be saying what they're saying.
*  And by the way, I mean, it is true.
*  Like, I definitely have noticed an increase in like anti-Semitic messages that people send me since Elon took over.
*  I'm happy with that. I'm very comfortable with that because the rest of it.
*  Well, good, because you just mentioned it. Now more are coming.
*  Well, I don't give a shit. I just block people that I don't want to hear from.
*  And that works for me. I think that's the way it should be.
*  Because if you we've got to open up the conversation, that means that some people are going to say dumb shit.
*  Yes. And I'm I would much rather that than some well-meaning bureaucrat deciding what should and shouldn't be allowed to be said in the public square.
*  So if that means there's more hate, I don't give a shit. I think it's worth it.
*  That is the only solution. It's not the only solution.
*  It's not going to be a it's not a simple solution.
*  It's going to be. Yeah, you're going to open up the door to more hate, but you're also going to open up the door to free conversations and people going to figure out what's what.
*  And that's the only way it really works.
*  It doesn't work by government mandate, especially when we've seen, particularly with our government, with the Twitter files, how there have been people that worked within the government,
*  that contacted Twitter and tried to get factual information taken down and trying to get the accounts suppressed of people that were experts in the field that had a differing opinion other than what was being promoted.
*  That's crazy. You can't have that like that.
*  That can't be a thing because that's not good for the government.
*  It's not good for us. It's not good for anybody to allow that kind of shit.
*  That's the whole it's un-American. You should be ashamed that you want to do that.
*  It's unpatriotic. You shouldn't be allowed to do it just because you're in a sneaky secret squirrel position where you can contact Twitter through, you know, the some government agent and then they get they feel pressured and then they give in to something that you're doing.
*  It's super unethical. That's un-American.
*  I love that you said that, Joe, because it's a it's a phrase that you don't hear as much as I think you used to 20 years ago.
*  Just the idea that there's some basic core principles of what America and the broader West is founded on.
*  And that's that's one of them.
*  It's one of them. And you have to fight off that urge to control people.
*  You have to recognize that if you're in a position of power, whether you're a cult leader or president or whatever the fuck you are, there's this desire to control people that gets people to that position in the first place.
*  This this ego that makes them think I should be the one that talks for the whole group.
*  I know it's better for all of them.
*  And as soon as you start using that in unethical way like that, like censoring people, especially censoring factual information from experts, you're un-American.
*  That's un-American. It's it's unpatriotic.
*  In fact, it's it's it's one of the grossest things you could do in a place that values free speech.
*  And we've seen so tangibly what's come out of this country, like culturally, the music, the comedy, the literature, all the crazy shit, the movies that have come from this experiment, self-government.
*  And the only way it works is if you let people work it out, you got to let people talk and you're going to get people that are wrong and you gonna get people that are racist.
*  You're going to get people that are sexist.
*  You're going to get people that are homophobic.
*  You're going to get all that.
*  But you're also going to get people that battle those people.
*  You're going to get people that have better arguments than those people you get people that sort of start posting links and quotes and people start figuring things out for themselves.
*  And that's the only way this works.
*  It's the only way.
*  that are elected officials decide what you can and can't consume because I don't know you I know the you that ran for mayor I
*  Don't know you you might be a piece of shit
*  You might be a sociopath you might be a smiling con artist that tricked a bunch of people because nobody wants to run and everybody
*  Who does run sucks? It's like you're literally like boxing with five-year-olds like oh, you're the champ yay
*  No one's doing it. No one's doing it like no real quality human beings are out there running for office in
*  Los Angeles they're not running for me there was that Rick Caruso guy they didn't give him a chance
*  He could have he could have done something
*  That's a rare thing when you have a very wealthy person who wants to try to save a city, but of course
*  He's like a Republican right so they like it out of here or what was he running Republicans or a Democrat?
*  What was he running as?
*  No, you can't even win as a Republican in California like they're so
*  A lot of
*  Schwarzenegger was the last one, but he was also royalty so this is like a tricky thing because that was Hollywood royalty
*  He was a movie star like we would be great if Arnie got he's a sensible Republican. You know he's one of us
*  He's a liberal. He's also he's running as a Republican. That's the only way you can one
*  Yeah, you know and you've seen that more and more throughout throughout all our societies
*  Look at what's happening in Scotland when I messaged you with what was happening
*  Yeah with the hate speech laws right now you can hate speech has been criminalized in public performances
*  Including place it's so insane so the Edinburgh Festival
*  Which is a largest comedy and arts festival in the world?
*  People can now get arrested for public performance
*  And they most certainly will if they follow the rule of the law cuz Edinburgh those guys get wild yeah get wild down there
*  Yeah, and so they should and you just go it's a comedy festival
*  There's probably a few people that actually
*  You know Francis and I we've been warning about this for ages and most most people pretend
*  It's not happening
*  They ignore it and it's like first a couple years ago a guy called Jerry Sadowitz who's super funny
*  Super offensive comic like none of his stuff is online because it's too offensive, but you go and see him
*  He's absolutely incredible so they pulled his show from the Edinburgh Festival, and we were like this is a problem like no
*  No, there's no problem now. You literally have the police potentially arresting comedians. Maybe this is when they start waking up
*  Yeah, and and this same government wanted to criminalize hate speech in your home
*  The real problem is the people that want that job
*  Shouldn't have that job yeah no quality except for there's a rare few like
*  RFK is a great person. Yeah, I would I would vote for him. I think Tulsi Gabbard is a great person
*  Yeah, I would vote for her there's there's people that I think are running for office, and they're legitimately trying to do
*  Well for the for the world they're trying to make a better place
*  They're trying they think they have ideas that would sort out some of the problems that we have and they're one of us
*  That's real, but then there's these fucking people the rest of them. They're just these partisan
*  Fucking robots, and they just get connected to the system
*  And they know which wheels to grease and they all get connected together, and they support each other, and it's just
*  And even with good well-intentioned people I think as we were talking about free speech
*  There are some certain principles. They've got to be there because good intentions can be misused
*  Like you're like oh, I just want to do good. I just want to protect people from harm
*  That's why we need to restrict speech online. That's their argument like I did
*  It's a stupid argument that they should have to they should have to debate someone about that
*  Yeah, but you want to just pass something like that you should have to stand
*  But that is a very important thing you're trying to pass you should have to stand
*  Publicly and defend that against a champion of free speech
*  Yeah, like a really brilliant change like if Hitchens was alive right yeah
*  You know could you imagine what that would have looked like?
*  Christopher Hitchens versus whoever the fuck thinks they could lock people up for saying cunt
*  You know whatever whatever the words that you're gonna choose that are hate speech now, and they're gonna keep moving
*  They've run out of words. They're gonna push new words. They're gonna push new descriptions that are problematic
*  I mean to be fair cunt is not a hate speech in Australia. It's a greeting
*  Isn't it funny that that it's that is a weird thing that that word became cute over there yeah over here
*  It's just so rough. Yeah, yeah
*  It's it's so interesting because like I said in Scotland. It's a term of affection
*  I was in Glasgow, and they were queuing at the bar, and there was this English guy
*  You know he was very hello
*  I mean you know one of them and then he was in his rough
*  But like place in glass bar in Glasgow people cut in front of him
*  And then one bloke there who was this rough-ass glass weegee and looked at the bar man went hey barman
*  Get this poor cunt a drink
*  And it was the love in his eyes. Yeah, it's just pure affection
*  You know like this guy's been fucked over game a drink. Yeah, if you say that in Boston. They'll beat the fuck
*  For some reason it didn't make it over there
*  Yeah, which is interesting because it's obviously so heavily influenced
*  But you know to the point that we were talking about you know you see even something like diversity
*  You're the Scottish First Minister
*  There's a very famous speech where he came out and he listed people who were working in certain places
*  I can't remember in certain parts of government, and he just went white white
*  Yeah, I saw that white and it's not mate. It's Scotland. It's 96% white. What do you expect?
*  But everybody's so scared of being called racist. Yeah, you're right
*  And you know what happened is the day they put the week they passed that bill
*  There were more reports of hate speech on that speech that he gave than there's been for years
*  That's hilarious now are the hypocrites they lock him up that would be maybe the solution lock him up then overturn the laws
*  Yeah, yeah, well they didn't lock him up the BBC did a very nice interview where they agreed that anyone who criticized him must be far
*  Right yeah, that's sweet. That's a good move. Yeah
*  Checkers yeah, the world is checkers to you, and you don't think that it's so fucking transparent
*  It's such a basic principle of our civilization that people should be free to speak their mind
*  And it's important at every level like our armies fight better because they're less
*  Hierarchical so the soldier on the ground can pass information up the chain of command without being afraid right it matters in every single
*  Aspect of what we do it's the reason for scientific progress. It's the reason for technological progress
*  It's the reason as you say for the cultural creativity that we have here that they don't have in other places
*  It's the bedrock of our civilization
*  And you've got well-intentioned quote-unquote people running around trying to tear it down
*  I had this experience when I last no not last on the penultimate time
*  I did question time which is like a big discussion show in the UK on TV and
*  They it's a there's like five people from different perspectives different angles
*  And before they start they do one question that they don't broadcast
*  There's like a warm-up right and the question at the time was Donald Trump had just been unbanned from Facebook
*  And they were like well should that have happened and I you know made the
*  Controversial point that the former president of the most powerful country in the world should be allowed to say something in public
*  Didn't go down well
*  And then they went to the left-wing
*  politician the Labour Party politician on the panel and
*  She went without missing a bit you want we must have the safest internet in the world
*  And I was like what say for the North Korea
*  With they've completely lost the understanding that there is a trade-off between freedom and safety and when you go for more freedom
*  Yes, it means there's less safety from people's hurty words or whatever, but you get more freedom, and that's actually worth it
*  It's actually important
*  And it's always these people that want to assume those positions of power that have this sort of fucking limited view of human psychology
*  And the way we accumulate and process information that it has to be
*  We have to be able to talk about stuff if you can't just talk about stuff you get one side of the story
*  And that side of the story is gonna favor whoever the fuck is in control of what you get to talk about period
*  It's always how it's been and to think that it's gonna be different now because we're better and we're more civilized
*  Well, we can trust our leaders now like no
*  No, it's a human thing. It's a it's a reason why we're that there's term limits
*  So you can only get corrupted so much over eight years and hopefully someone could like say this guy sucks
*  Let's try a whole new crew of people see how we run this thing
*  You see that's why I found kovat so fascinating because that was when the mask slipped and you saw some leaders
*  And you were like, okay
*  You're trying to do your best and then you saw the petty little
*  Authoritarians come out and you really saw them and then what was interesting about it as well
*  Was that there was some things that was so funny because they were so ridiculous
*  Do you remember in New Zealand when a guy got arrested for transporting KSC across county lines
*  Biological terrorism. Yeah
*  Yeah, he got what do they get him for what they get him for because he wasn't it because during the the kovat regulations
*  You couldn't move beyond the certain
*  Yeah, there was a barrier and this guy was making money because he was going to KFC buying it and then basically and then coming back
*  And being like KFC but for drug dealers, but for KFC and then he was stopped
*  Surged by the police and arrested and then they listed all of these things in his boot and like two two tubs of coleslaw
*  one coke bottle and you go this is
*  Tens of thousands of dollars. Yeah
*  Men were charged with breaching the country's tough covered 19 rules a boot full of KFC chicken and tens of thousands
*  I think it's the money they're worried about
*  The KFC is just kind of a fun
*  When I look it says they were charged for breaching the country's covered rules
*  So it's not right money's right, but they did have tens of thousands of dollars, which means they were selling KFC
*  I'm gonna go out there. I don't have a GPS in my truck. Let's go
*  Here's a KFC smuggler this motherfucker. Look at his hall. See he was smuggling KFC
*  There's no way he's eating all that chicken by himself. Yeah a lot of chicken. Yeah, I mean by the way that might be my favorite fast food
*  Yeah, my like if you're really not concerned about your health at all
*  Okay, especially the they have like a crunchy right in their cave doesn't have a crunchy crust sometimes too. Yeah
*  I'm just reading what happened. They got caught traveling on a gravel road on the outskirts of the city did a u-turn when they saw police
*  Found a hundred thousand dollars in cash. Oh, that's a lot of money guys. What are you doing? Selling KFC?
*  That's what they do. Look man if you fucking really locked down you got some cash, bro
*  I'll give you a thousand dollars to go get me a bucket of chicken
*  Really? Yeah, thousand. Here's also fine. So I mean I'd go and get it
*  It's unclear whether the men intended to sell the food. I told you or if they hope to use it as a distraction
*  I pulled over
*  Check my fucking money
*  Yeah
*  and that would that was the the whole thing with coven and for me and I think for
*  Probably Constantine and you as well. That was a real wake-up moment for me where I was actually going
*  Okay, how much of this is about keeping people safe, which I can understand
*  And by the way, I can understand an overreaction as well when the virus was about to hit
*  I remember saying to Constantine we're gonna bank episodes. We're gonna bank episodes now bang bang bang bang bang bang bang
*  And I was like, oh, come on, man. It's just the flu. It's nothing's gonna happen. This was like in January 2020
*  Yeah, he was like no. No, you've got to take the shit seriously. Yeah, and he was right
*  But and so there's that natural reaction where you go. Look, this is serious
*  We've got a you know, we've got to protect people they're vulnerable people and then there's other stuff where you're going this makes no sense
*  Yeah, but it's people wanting to do something they had to show that they had some sort of a measure of a plan
*  In California, the big one was closing the outside dining
*  My mom I've said this before so I apologize for people have heard it
*  But my friend his brother worked on the whole cove it force in Los Angeles
*  And they were closing outside dining because there was a spike in cases and he goes but there's no evidence that outside dining
*  You're gonna kill these business. She goes it's about the optics
*  So about the optics to make a decision that kills businesses like these people are barely hanging on
*  They were only able to serve people outside, you know
*  I mean who knows how many bartenders and waitresses were just fucked the restaurant owners fucked everybody got fucked and
*  It was about the optics. That's just dumb people. That's just that person should not have that position of power
*  There's no fucking way that's that person to make that kind of a decision
*  She'd have to debate a champion of the restaurant industry should have to debate a champion of health should have to debate a champion who understands like
*  How how is this stuff being transmitted? Is it not being transmitted at all outside? Is that real true?
*  What is the safety threshold of outside dining and have someone fucking talk about you?
*  Can't just wave a magic wand and decide that everybody has to go home
*  That's crazy and it's so many people lost decades of their lives
*  Decades of their lives work and and it goes back to the importance of debate the importance of free speech. Yes, one of the most
*  Dreadful and terrible ideas that was allowed to propagate and I saw smart people
*  Reiterating regurgitating constantly is words of violence
*  Well if words of violence then logically it makes sense to shut all of this down
*  Because if you challenge me on something I say on something I say and you go actually Francis you're talking crap and I'm like
*  Well, that's violent
*  Then I need to be protected because we need to be protected from physical violence
*  Yeah, and we've just allowed this idea to propagate so it's a crazy idea
*  So to the time so none of our nobody's ideas get challenged. We feel under threat if people challenge us
*  it's ridiculous and that we've come to this point where you just see this stasis because
*  Terrible ideas are allowed to flourish without people going
*  No, you can't become a woman and then even the people that are inside these groups that disagree with it
*  They keep their mouth shut because they don't want to be ostracized. They want to be cast out of the kingdom
*  Nobody's able to like really fully express objective opinions about a variety of subjects
*  You have to sort of you have to adopt a predetermined list of things that you agree with
*  If you tell me how you feel about abortion I could almost entirely tell you how you feel about guns
*  Most of the time like eight out of ten. That's weird. It's all weird and the thing is well to your point Francis
*  I feel like we've got to a point where it's it's become quite hard to
*  Criticize people's ideas without people thinking that you're criticizing the person. I mean it happened with
*  With your interview with Tucker like Tucker said some things that people didn't agree with and I think rightly and they pointed out some of the
*  Gaps and what he was saying but lots of people defended him on the basis that he was being attacked personally
*  Even though people were simply disagreeing with a particular thing that he said. What was that particularly? I don't pay attention
*  I think I release things I fucking
*  Talking about some wild shit. I was like this one's gonna. I think the evolutionary stuff got a lot of people's attention
*  Yes, that got well my friend Brett Weinstein who's an actual evolutionary biologist, right?
*  You know he didn't like it and Colin Wright who's an evolutionary biologist
*  It's um, I didn't understand the science enough to argue it. Unfortunately, if Brett was in my position
*  It would have been much better
*  With that subject. I think there's a he had Tucker has a very I like him. First of all a lot
*  He's a very nice guy. I've got to hung out with him a couple times
*  I hung out with him at the UFC
*  I had dinner with him with Lex and then I brought him on stage with kill
*  Tony didn't even know he was gonna go on there and went out and handled it amazingly
*  He's a good guy
*  He's also bitterly embattled and has been for a long time and I think that can make you
*  more aggressive or shittier about like certain things and
*  In that regard like he's handled himself pretty well. Like he's pretty smart about it. He doesn't use a computer
*  He doesn't watch television. He just he has a phone
*  He does everything schedules everything through his phone and that's it and you know, he's managed to sort of filter himself out but
*  He's got a very religious bend to a lot of the things that he believes and
*  You know, he's a smart guy you're allowed to have that and but he he believes God created people
*  and he has this belief that he operates from and
*  That makes the look
*  The universe is so crazy. The idea of God is not that crazy to me. It's just not I don't think it's any more crazy than anything
*  I think maybe the universe is God maybe that's what's going on
*  Maybe this is like constant creative force that's so immense. You can't even possibly calculate it and that's that's God and
*  He's got some ideas about
*  spiritual things that are interesting like about good and evil and and these
*  UAPs the UAPs being spiritual things but it seems like
*  With all respect it's it that I feel like that's what he wants to think
*  Do you know that he wants to think that they've always been here and their spiritual things?
*  And he might be right
*  But it is also possible that there's a life form that's so
*  advanced that it can avoid detection
*  Anytime it wants and then slowly trickles out little bits of information to us whether it's a crashed
*  Whether it's a crashed vehicle or letting a vehicle be seen or hovering over Phoenix
*  Do whatever that whatever it wants to do and then fades away again
*  And then every decade or so as human beings evolve it introduces more and more to the landscape
*  Which if you kind of looked at it on a graph seems to be the case and oddly seems to be the case that it's like
*  primarily
*  Happening in the United States
*  Like if you look at the difference between the UFO sightings around the world and the UFO sightings in the United States
*  We're locked in we're locked in I said this to you last time I think yeah
*  Yeah, yeah, when you asked me what do I think of aliens?
*  I was like I would be a lot more I would find a lot more credible if it wasn't all in North America
*  Also as an American I have to say it's probably because we're the shit
*  And if I was an alien, what am I gonna do go to Czechoslovakia get the fuck out of here
*  I'm gonna go check out San Francisco like look at all the shit in the streets
*  Look at all the needles. These people are crazy. I think
*  There's probably both things going on. I
*  Think there's probably
*  some sort of extra dimensional
*  possibility that I think occurs during psychedelic drugs and during certain states of altered consciousness
*  That I have a feeling you're you're tuning into something that's not always available
*  But probably is always there and then there's probably a physical element of things coming here from somewhere else
*  Because we do that it just seems so duh like allegedly we went to the moon
*  But we definitely sent rovers to Mars. We definitely send satellites into space to take incredible imagery of Jupiter
*  We definitely do all that what why would we not think that another species would do that?
*  Especially if they get to some position where they're using some unique novel form of propulsion that
*  Manipulates gravity and they just they don't have to worry about g-forces
*  Just appear places which seems to be like what they think these things are doing. Have you heard of that?
*  There's a story about this Chinese scientist that was working on
*  Antigravity and she came from China to the United States to work on
*  Antigravity and she was working on some anti gravity propulsion system and then vanished
*  Like probably went back to China. Yeah, I mean private like this is what they paid me to do
*  Yeah, there's a lot of people who vanish in China. That's the thing, but I don't think she fan it
*  She vanished from the United States. I think she went back to China
*  I want to the secrets with her. I think that's the worry is that this see if you can find that lady's name
*  It's a it's a very interesting story
*  I was reading about the other day and I remembered like
*  Someone you guys are perfect to talk about this because
*  That would be the ultimate thing that you'd have to keep secret from another country
*  Because if you have espionage if you have people that have infiltrated your universities and they certainly do and if you have people
*  infiltrated your military
*  Contractors and they certainly do we do it. I'm sure they do. Oh, they definitely
*  The southern border is the fact that it's as open as it is
*  Yeah, that's a lot of them are coming through there, of course
*  Yeah, but if you if you're making something that is an end some sort of a gravity propulsion system
*  And you've made a breakthrough you're not gonna put that on wired comm
*  You're not you know, you know, you're not gonna broadcast that on CNN
*  Yeah, you know tell anybody that
*  Because of the the other countries find out if the other superpowers of China and Russia find out that we have a some sort of
*  A gravity proposes everyone's gonna die
*  Yeah, they're gonna steal all the information makes sense still
*  Solving the mystery of Huntsville's brilliant anti-gravity scientist
*  Dr. Ning Ling's son Ning Li's son talks about her mom's career and legacy along with the Internet's obsession with her disappearance
*  So she when did she disappear?
*  I
*  She co-authored papers and
*  93 hold on right there stop right there in the late 90s
*  She claimed to have created anti-gravity devices that were fully functional and this was big news in both scientific journals and mainstream mainstream press in
*  1997 dr. Lee continued to expand on her concept and conduct more experiments. She published papers describing the anomalous
*  anomalous weight changes in objects suspected over a rotating
*  superconductor to say her work
*  to
*  Referred to as taming gravity could change the world as an understatement taming gravity would drastically change the way we transport on every level
*  Humans could travel the world at ease and we could finally get our hands on those sweet hoverboards from back to the future
*  So did she really do it? So what happened to her in 99?
*  Lee left you a age to start her own company AC gravity and commercialize a device based on her theories
*  Oh, you fucked up lady her colleagues
*  Obviously believed in her work as a chair of UH's physics department Larry Smalley
*  Also departed the university to join her public record show that in 2001 the US Department of Defense gave AC gravity a grant for
*  448,000
*  970 dollars to research the technology. However, these results were never published. In fact, dr. Lee never published anything again
*  Even though the business license for AC gravity was updated yearly through 2018
*  There's no record of any further work done by the company Lee's career after 2002 is a subject of great mystery
*  Barely sociables research turned up a document showing that she gave a presentation at the 2003 MITRE conference titled
*  measurability of AC gravity fields the MITRE Corporation challenges federally funded research for several managers
*  Excuse me manages
*  Federally funded research for several US agencies at the conference
*  She presented along with a redstone arsenal official from US Army Aviation Missile Command
*  Meaning that her research was still being conducted up to that point. So what did she took off? When did she disappear?
*  I think she went to China
*  Goes on they don't this is a bunch of like they're not really sure and then in
*  2021 so it's like two years ago. Look at this though. I know bitch. We're it popped up
*  No, bitch. We're on a funeral home and just outside of Birmingham where she was like with this
*  Where she was it didn't say anything about her disappearance
*  hmm
*  No, bitch. We're they say how she died
*  Was it water torture
*  See Wow
*  Passed away peacefully
*  That's a little sus
*  But if you scroll back up what I was gonna read a little bit more there's something about her
*  Right there a little bit higher
*  Confirming her well-being that she was still working with the DOD but was unable to talk about her work
*  So she's working with the Department of Defense
*  He also told Ventura that he was unable to get a working email address or phone number for her
*  Pro they probably made a breakthrough and that's probably what happens when you make a real breakthrough
*  They probably give you a very clear indication of how this is gonna go from here on out
*  You're gonna be completely isolated from the rest of the world
*  You're this is no there's no way we can trust that you're gonna tell anybody about this
*  We're gonna have to fucking monitor everything you do and just you stop publishing you stop doing anything
*  But here's the thing is that the wrong approach to take?
*  Is that the wrong approach to take when you when somebody has created something that could be such a monumental tool?
*  potentially a weapon that an enemy or
*  Somebody you perceive to be an enemy could use it against you. I don't think it's wrong approach to take
*  I mean, I think if you're especially if you're dealing with someone who came over here from China
*  It's like where is she going?
*  Like keep an eye on that lady if she really cracked it and she cracked it with it
*  What if she's sharing that's the thing is like some of these drones that they're seeing and that's what I've always
*  assumed that a lot of these things are especially the
*  The the square within a sphere that seems to be they keep finding
*  She's disappeared and gone back to China
*  Said Sephardi she was working with NASA and the Redstone arsenal
*  But she disappeared for several years now the people at the Pentagon cannot reach her anymore
*  She's allegedly back in China and the Chinese are pouring money into similar experiments now. Uh-oh
*  That's why our intelligence guys are very interested
*  The most likely people to develop the first anti gravity propulsion technology are the Chinese. That's reassuring
*  Yes, crazy that's a crazy statement the most like when someone says that publicly go that go back
*  Sorry again Jamie the most likely people to develop the first anti gravity propulsion technology are the Chinese the fact that he's saying that
*  If you're saying that publicly that means they're probably on it. Yeah
*  I know
*  But if that lady really did crack something and really was able to make things hover
*  God damn it and it was as far back as what 93. Mm-hmm
*  Well
*  2004 was that big sighting commander David Fravor when he found that thing that looked like a tic-tac
*  That was hovering over the water and disappeared at an insane rate of speed
*  They got video of this thing different fighter jets saw it. They said this thing just took off
*  Just no visual means of propulsion. There's no windows. No rockets just
*  Just gone and there's video of it
*  There's video of this thing just moving at this insane rate of speed that would turn human bodies into jello
*  I think it's a drone. I think they probably had a few of those. I think they've been worried
*  That's why they're always occurring around new around military bases. Hmm, like San Diego is filled with military
*  It's all military out there. So if they're off the coast off the
*  They're near the Nimitz, right? So they're just fucking all sorts of tests and training things that they're running out there. That's what they do
*  Of course, that's where they're gonna train their fucking drones, too
*  Of course that's we're gonna if you've got some crazy high-tech thing and you want to see how do the fighter jets see it?
*  Look what you fucking don't tell them and you put it in the ocean and then you say go fly over there
*  And they fly over there and they see this fucking thing that can go from 50,000 feet above sea level to zero in like a
*  Second like what are we watching?
*  Man, it's so crazy some of the stuff like human beings are coming up with I don't know if you know this
*  Russians have a tsunami torpedo. Have you heard about it starts tsunamis? Yeah
*  It's a tsunami torpedo Jamie. Would you so fun? Bye Malibu?
*  It's basically a nuclear torpedo. It explodes underwater
*  Causing a tsunami which can wash, you know half the United States off the half the United States
*  Well, if it hits the seaboard on both sides, yeah
*  I mean it would be harder for them obviously from the east but from the West
*  Oh my god, you can wash off, you know all of California just like
*  Well, you could do that down here too then you could do it in Texas you could do it all over the country
*  All over where the water is
*  Russian TV news aides
*  Russian
*  news agency TSS
*  Reported that Russia had produced the first set of nuclear powered very long-range nuclear armed torpedoes known as Poseidon
*  Strategic experts are warning that the Poseidon torpedoes would have the potential to devastate a coastal city causing
*  radioactive floods and result in millions of deaths. Oh fuck, dude
*  Wow, look at this haunted. Oh
*  Outlets have painted a hauntingly vivid picture of a towering
*  1000 foot tall radioactive soon. I know you wrote tabloid
*  Tabloid news, but but is that possible a thousand foot tall radioactive tsunami violently crashing into British shores
*  Pulverizing everything in its path and transforming the whole cities into barren lifeless lands isn't
*  The kind of power that they have now is
*  What how much more powerful are they than fat man and little boy? It's a lot, right? Yeah orders of magnitude
*  Yeah, the hydrogen bomb is way more powerful than the atomic bomb
*  So if they have like some top of the food chain best of what we've got today
*  Nuclear weapon and they detonated into the ocean. What does that look like?
*  Yeah, I'm sure you've seen those those tests
*  They did when they blew up atomic bombs in the ocean you get to see like how high the water goes into the sky
*  Did they drop that in the water
*  Does that water?
*  Oh my gosh, look at that. Isn't it kind of ironic that the thing that might kill us all looks like a mushroom
*  Imagine if that's what God's trying to tell us and that's not in 61
*  So the only thing that's gonna keep you from nuking each other. Yeah mushrooms
*  Chow down boys
*  Through the most horrific thing that human beings can do
*  The indiscriminate murder of hundreds of thousands of people instantaneously, yeah
*  Maybe that's what we need to do
*  We need to actually basically just before everybody gets the power you're gonna do a mushroom trip
*  You're gonna connect to the spirituality of the earth. You're gonna connect with your fellow human beings
*  You're gonna understand that we are all one and then you're gonna be allowed to do your job
*  Yeah
*  There's certainly some strange battle that's going on right now that I don't think most people were aware was gonna ever take place
*  No, I think that's part of what the problem is. What is this?
*  1961 SAR bomb
*  Means King bomb King of all I
*  Mean imagine being that guy in that plane going I am getting cancer for sure
*  For sure. Did they even know they're getting cancer? Probably not probably not
*  Do you know that all the guys that worked on this one John Wayne movie all wound up getting cancer
*  Because they were filming it out in the Nevada desert. Holy shit. Yeah, which one was that was that? Oh
*  I don't know but they did a lot of a lot of you ever seen the video of the show all the different tests that they
*  Did in Nevada?
*  The fight is radioactive
*  That's why they let them fucking put casinos there the conqueror considered the worst film of 1950s suffered from a toxic
*  Working environment was filmed near a nuclear test site out of the 220 cast and crew members 91 developed cancer
*  See 46 see Joe. That is a real toxic working environment
*  It's not cuz someone said something you didn't like
*  The worst movie of his career. Yeah, this movie was career killed him wasn't even worth it. Yeah
*  Can you imagine that like that is the worst at least let's say you create this
*  Incredible movie a work of art that will go down in history for generations as an iconic piece of cinematography
*  And that happened it would still be awful and excusable, but you'd go but look at what they created
*  Has anyone ever seen the conqueror? I?
*  Think I want to see it now
*  Really old bad movies are amazing. Yeah, they're amazing to watch the Genghis Khan movie. Oh, is that what it is?
*  Yeah, oh my god
*  Terrible he played Genghis Khan. It's terrible
*  John Wayne played Genghis Khan bro that is cultural appropriation
*  Just like John Wayne
*  Genghis Khan talked like John Wayne and his girlfriend was white I
*  Mean she looks incredibly Mongolian
*  Did they do anything to him with makeup? It seems like they did they must have done that mustache?
*  Yeah, the mustache, but what about his face not really huh?
*  They've just probably put a little bit of color in there gang guys Khan
*  I'm the fucking man look it was 1956. It was a better time
*  This is the best time I know I'm kidding don't you think I mean is all the complaint we do this
*  Yeah, of course it is it's a great time to be alone. This is also a time where you have
*  There's a very interesting things going on look at this looks. It's really corny. He looks Iranian. Yeah
*  They were that wasn't him there. This is John. This is John
*  First of all dudes back then just didn't work out no you know
*  But they were seen as the epitome of masculinity crazy that yeah, that's cuz no one knew any better
*  And also if a Vanderhoof field was standing there holding that thing up you like damn a vendor Holyfield in his prime
*  You like damn. That's what a man looks like yeah bullshit. Yeah, but I don't
*  Feel this gang is kind of
*  But you're so right Joe
*  I mean we can't complain and I think there's a lot of things to fear about the future and there's a lot of shit
*  That's fucked up right now, but at the same time
*  It's an amazing time to be alive and look at the three of us what we do is sit and chat shit on the internet
*  Yeah, and it's a great life. Yeah, it is a great life, and it's it's also
*  uniquely
*  educational right
*  There's so many things that I know that I would have never known
*  I've never been even interested in knowing but because I have this opportunity just to be able to talk to people
*  I've had like a total accidental education
*  Yeah, and it's also your listeners and your viewers as well are getting that education as well
*  Yeah, but how many people like men and women grew up in a really you know poor rural part of America all over the world
*  And they don't have access to a quality of education
*  Because of whatever reason all of a sudden they can go online and whatever they're interested
*  They can find if they're interested in astrophysics
*  They can sit down and listen to one of the greatest astrophysicists in the world explain string theory
*  Whatever it may be and they have access to that information whereas before forget it
*  It doesn't matter how talented you were if you didn't have access to that information
*  You're done. You're never gonna realize your talent
*  Yeah, I mean just imagine growing up in the 1950s or when the John Wayne movie was made your your access to information was so and people
*  Could lie to you you had no idea. There's no Google. Someone just tells you some crazy story about their past
*  You have to believe it. I mean it was so easy
*  Back then to be like a con man, right? Yeah, just trick people and they're giving you money
*  I'm actually a prince and
*  You just have some crazy story and people like it's actually a prince
*  Yeah, think about this and in medieval times if you were just a normal person like a peasant or whatever
*  You probably never leave your village. Yeah, you probably never read a book you probably
*  The sum total of knowledge that you have is the equivalent of like two days at school for us
*  Yeah, that's how little information people had
*  Yeah, and you you you're listening to mythology and all superstitions and you're terrified of everything. There's witch doctors and
*  Yeah, who know and by the time you're dying you're just recognizing the hustle by the time you're I mean if if you're a
*  40 year old man, you're just starting to really
*  I think this thing's rigged, you know
*  Yeah
*  It takes a long ass time to see how complicated and then to have so many interactions with people that you realize like how sometimes people
*  Don't really say what they think they kind of say what they're expected to say and they self-censor and you see that and people are
*  God can't talk to him anymore and you get it and you get this
*  You get an education of human beings that it's based on interactions and it takes forever and everyone's so different
*  We all assume that other people are gonna think the way we think and they just fucking don't
*  they don't and if you have this rigid idea of how people should think about things and
*  you encounter
*  There's this wide variety of different ways of thinking about things. It makes you a little more hesitant to cling on to your ideas
*  Yeah, because I think too many people think of their ideas as a part of them like they're just ideas
*  You're you and you're who you are
*  The value in you is your ability to not attach to ideas
*  Ability to look at ideas for whether even if you think they're amazing say why you think they're amazing
*  But they're not a part of you. So don't argue them like they're a part of you. Let people have differing opinions on them
*  And then address those differing opinions in a relaxed way. That could be done instead of all this yelly shouty
*  Childish bullshit that so many people engage in that just makes people more tribal
*  It just makes people and then they fucking dunk on each other and back and forth. It's just dumb
*  It's a it's a dumb way for smart people to behave
*  It's what happens when you let your ego get involved
*  When your ego is the most important thing when you think you are the most important thing as you walk into any room
*  Or you participate in any conversation or interaction and the reality is you're not important
*  You're important in some ways into your family and whatever else but in the grand scheme of things these you know
*  You just see these people in the outrage and the anger they feel because all of a sudden
*  Their sense of self has been challenged
*  Yeah
*  And they are not mentally or spiritually robust enough to be able to push back on that challenge or to be able to accept that
*  Challenge and it creates this kind of you to almost see it like it's kind of mini ego death where they just freak out and you go
*  We're just having a conversation. Yeah freak out over an idea
*  Yeah
*  Well, this is what I was saying earlier about we have to be able to disagree with each other and criticize other people's ideas
*  And what they say without thinking that it's about the person you're not attacking the person you can disagree with someone strongly
*  That's what I'm saying about our FK's jeans
*  We're talking about clothing people not the other type
*  Yeah, I also think that men in particular a lot of men have a desire to compete in things
*  And if you're not competing with yourself like you're not running and trying to like make your time better or working out or whatever
*  Whatever the thing that's difficult to do if you don't have one of those
*  Then you start using whatever your job is or whatever your ideology is as your way of competing
*  And you try to enforce it on people or come up with better arguments or dunk on the people that disagree or you know
*  Harshly criticize them as a human being because you have different opinions
*  Yeah
*  I sometimes fall into that trap and something I'm really trying to work on because like whenever I watch you disagree with people
*  I think it always makes me think that that's a good way to do it because you're always very careful
*  You're very respectful. You're very calm about it. Well, not always I think you and crowd are of a weed that got pretty intense
*  But yeah apart from that like lots of times
*  I've seen you disagree with people and it's clear that you don't agree but you're just trying to explore the argument
*  Yeah, you get better at doing that. Yeah, it's a skill
*  I'm really trying to learn that for sure. It's it's also important to recognize how people are
*  Taking in your words and thoughts, you know
*  Especially when you were doing like the kind of stuff that we do where we're just kind of free-balling
*  You you're you're trying it's you're making a thing, right? You're having a conversation
*  But you're also making a digestible piece of media you're making a thing and the best way to make that thing is to try
*  To get the most understanding of what this person is trying to say even if you disagree with them
*  So I want to know why you I don't want to just know that you think this I want to know why you think this
*  And I'll let you go not even if I disagree. I want to I want to hear you
*  I don't even if I disagree sometimes I don't even have to challenge you on it
*  I just I'm really interested even if I don't agree
*  I'm really interested in how you come to your conclusions and what other information do you take into account?
*  And what is your personality like like are you is this your identity?
*  Are you fighting for this this there's you see this a lot with like these really?
*  Aggressive liberal men like it seems to be there. They're stationed in life. They're the watchmen on the tower
*  There's like this
*  Aggressive and it's generally these weak really weak physically weak
*  Mentally weak men that have adopted this aggressive stance like finally like they're the bullies now, and they're gonna go out
*  It's it's interesting
*  So if you talk to someone that has like that sort of a philosophy
*  If you just talk to them about general life enough
*  It sort of reveals itself the the cracks in the way they think in the lack of character and the lack of
*  Discipline and most importantly the lack of compassion
*  When when people disagree with someone and they hate them as a human being because they have differing ideas
*  Instead of saying I think that if I talked to them
*  I could give them my perspective and maybe would be enlightening or maybe we would find common ground
*  No, it's like hate them as a person and it's it's cherished
*  It's saluted online in the mental illness known as social media the mental illness factory
*  These people are all like engaging in this back and forth and you see these people that have finally found their competitive realm and
*  That's a that flavors a big part of why men talk and behave that way
*  There's like an there's an instinct to want to be good at a thing and beat people at a thing
*  Whether it's chess or whether it's
*  Golf, whatever it is. There's a thing and maybe for you. It's politics and for a lot of guys
*  I know it's politics because I see them online. I see what they're doing. I see the writing they're doing
*  They're just fishing for the right words and seeing the right things to try to dunk on people
*  It's just their little competitive venture. It's it's a fear-based response. I think a lot of it
*  It's something that I've tried to look at now when I see people get aggressive when I see people
*  Behave in a certain way. I'm like, oh you're scared. Yeah, you're scared from the right to yeah
*  Definitely a really shitty right-wing people that are very dismissive of
*  Entire swaths of of people and culture and don't take into consideration the nuance involved in
*  Say like crime-ridden areas and how those things became that way in the first place all that pulled them up by their bootstraps
*  Bullshit all that no need for any social safety net stuff like all that like lack of compassion
*  lack of caring about people that that
*  Masquerades as conservatism
*  That's just as gross and there's a kind of woke if occasion that's happening on the right
*  They've got their own conspiracies their own little trigger points all of these ideas. Do they like what's what's a big one?
*  well, I wrote a piece actually when Tucker went to Moscow because I thought that
*  His
*  Conversation with Putin was I clearly didn't go the way he intended but it was fine
*  I had no issue with him interview Putin but the videos he did afterwards
*  He was he was kind of like it felt to me like he was starting to you know
*  The woke people they hate America and they hate everything the West stands for and there is a movement on the right way
*  It's like they hate the elite so much that they will go to Russia and be impressed and think that the food is cheaper when it's
*  Three times more expensive for the average person, you know in Russia it is. Yeah, of course
*  So was he trying to say it was cheaper. He did say it was cheaper. Yeah
*  It is cheaper as in if you come in with your American salary, but comparatively
*  It's much more expensive because Russian salaries far less, right?
*  So they spent three times as much money on food
*  He talked about how they have these shopping carts when you return it right and all of this stuff
*  Don't you just have to become an oligarch then that's easy
*  Very hard nowadays. Yeah, yeah, they steal your your yacht
*  Yeah
*  so in the 90s the oligarchs basically seized all the money and then Putin came in and he got rid of all the oligarchs and
*  All his buddies are now the oligarchs. It's been like nationalized the corruption. Yeah, I bet they have great parties though
*  They do party with Putin that'd be so scary
*  But you can't go too near the balcony because a lot of their balconies are slippy and they fall. Oh, yeah
*  They slip yeah, they just slip and fall and die man. Yeah, exactly. Listen, we just shoot drones of people. Okay
*  It's like both both of them do shady shit if you look at
*  All the people that have died in mysterious ways in this country where it's a little suspect that maybe there was some government involvement
*  Right. Yeah, basically killed our president, you know
*  We just had the Michael Francis on do you know him? I've seen him online
*  What you think about that? Well, we hadn't it was interesting conversation about the Mafia life and everything else
*  But when we did the paywall section for locals at the end
*  He talked about how like it was an open secret in his circles that the Mafia killed JFK basically
*  That was his take
*  Yeah, and they would they would they were talking about it for ages and they were even joking about it
*  So when for instance Bobby went after the mob
*  People in the mob were going huh killed the wrong Kennedy. Mmm, you know because and he was saying that it was
*  J. Edgar Hoover who was in cahoots with the Mafia and the thing with J. Edgar Hoover was he was gay
*  Matthew ran gay clubs. They had the dirt on him being a gay man
*  Which whenever this was in mid 60s early 60s, you couldn't be an openly gay man, right?
*  And he was also a guy who of course if you're gonna be the guy that has secrets you want the secrets on everybody else
*  So that's what he did like J. Edgar was famous for that
*  Yeah, bring this guy would bring you into the office and show you pictures of you fucking some lady
*  That's not your wife. You got any questions
*  We're gonna do what are you gonna do I think you know how to vote right? Yeah do that
*  Yeah, stay the fuck out of my office. Yeah. Yeah, I mean dirt back then they could just there was no internet
*  If they printed a story about you, you're fucked. It's rap. Everyone's gonna believe it. There's no way you could be like
*  That's not even real. It's Photoshop. Like there's so many of the photos of
*  Lee Harvey Oswald that are in dispute and one of them. It's a really weird one
*  It's him standing there with a rifle standing in the backyard and photo experts have looked at and go
*  This is like the shadows are all wrong here
*  Like this photo looks manipulated
*  Like they just take this photo of Lee Harvey Oswald to have him holding up some agenda
*  I forget what it was and a rifle like hmm. Have you seen that photo?
*  No, see you can find that I would like to know if like real photography
*  photography experts have ever
*  Examined it because I know that it's a subject of a lot of controversy. They think it was a doctored photo
*  But he most certainly was a CIA guy. He went to Russia. He married a Russian lady
*  They let him come back over here. Like he probably they were probably all in on it
*  He was probably in on it too
*  And they probably had him set up as being the the dummy that they were gonna say and then they had Jack Ruby set up
*  To kill him. So that'll be that's it. We're done here and until the Zapruder film got aired on Geraldo Rivera show
*  No one had any idea there was some weirdness to that assassination
*  Everybody assumed Lee Harvey Oswald was a terrible man and he shot our favorite president and then you know
*  This guy who ran a club hated him because he shot the president so he shot him and that's it. Good night
*  My it's just you
*  When you look at these types of things and the more you dig you the more you kind of realize that
*  There's cover-up upon cover-up upon cover-up and what is initially being fed to you ain't the truth
*  So here's the photograph do they think it's legit here
*  Settling the controversy over photo of Lee Harvey Oswald. This is from Dartmouth
*  So, you know that it's corrupt and funded by the Chinese
*  Just kidding
*  What do they say? Do they say it's real?
*  They think it's legit
*  Are detailed right there
*  Our detailed analysis of Oswald's poles the lighting and shadows and the rifles hand refutes the argument of photo tampering interesting
*  There you go Joe
*  pioneering researcher in digital forensics whose team developed mathematical and computational techniques to detect tampering and photos videos audio recordings and other documents
*  Fareed has examined the photo closely before in studies in 2009 2010
*  But these studies did not address the questions about Oswald's pose and the new study for it and his team conducted a 3d stability
*  Analysis concluding that in fact Oswald's dance does not support the claims of photo tampering
*  Study appeared in the Journal of digital forensics security and law so it seems like in 2009 and in 2010
*  They thought it was monkeyed with and then they got that Chinese money
*  Go back to the photo again
*  But here's the thing. It's like
*  Why wouldn't he pose like that? The guy was a psycho?
*  Yeah, I mean Lee Lee Harvey Oswald was a mess period and and probably an agent
*  What part of it did they think was fake? I don't know
*  Think they thought they was someone else standing there like that
*  Yeah, they I think there was some argument about the proportions of the body that it didn't quite match Lee Harvey
*  Tickets are that big. Yeah, they used to be probably what that big yeah, especially back in the day. No, it's
*  That's the thing with because
*  They definitely killed Kennedy. Yeah
*  What is one guy when when you prove when you put forward that theory where you go?
*  This feels sus and then they never released the documents
*  I think it was time wasn't it still and Trump still and Trump why didn't Trump release them?
*  No, he was going to and he said he was and then he never did that's that's what I'm asking
*  Why didn't he do I think his direct quote was if they showed you what they showed me you wouldn't release it either
*  What the fuck does that mean it means it probably
*  It's probably proof that someone
*  That is trackable had Kennedy assassinated and then there was a conspiracy probably
*  Involving at least some members of the intelligence agency. So why wouldn't because then it would call into
*  People would lose confidence entirely in the intelligence agencies if they knew that the intelligence agencies had
*  Had not just gotten rid of Richard Nixon, which Tucker explained
*  I'm sorry saw that like that's a wild thing to know that a guy was an
*  naval intelligence officer gets a job as a reporter and his first job as
*  like an aspiring reporter is you get the biggest story in fucking United States history and that
*  CIA agents broke into Watergate and that the guy who they had put into position as the vice president
*  Gerald Ford was the the guy was on the Warren Commission report and that Spiro Agnew who is the real vice president
*  They got him on tax evasion and locked him up like this
*  It seems like a coup that that that Woodward was getting his information from the FBI
*  Like the whole thing was wild when you hear about it that way when like the way Tucker laid it out
*  you're like, whoa, so they killed Kennedy and
*  apparently what Tucker was saying is that Nixon had said that he knew why they killed JFK and
*  That was the head of the CIA. He was talking to so it was at the time
*  did not respond at all and
*  Then next thing you know, like within a short amount of time Nixon's out Wow
*  I guess what I'm asking Joe is surely not releasing it undermines confidence as well
*  It certainly does but not as much because it's still a mystery. So it maintains a mystery
*  It's been a mystery since we were kids. It was the first conspiracy that I ever got into
*  I was in New York and a friend of mine gave me a book
*  He said you got to read this is it called best evidence by David Lifton and it's all about
*  this guy who was an accountant went over the
*  Warren Commission and he found all these real problems with it all his contradictions like didn't make any sense was all pieced together
*  No one thought everyone's gonna anyone was actually gonna read the entire warning. It's like 9,000 pages or something and he did and
*  There's a lot of problems with it. The big one for me was always the bullet the bullets ridiculous
*  The bullets ridiculous that bullet did not go through two fucking people and come out looking like that
*  That's not what happens to bullets bullets get destroyed. They get blown apart
*  They get fucking they've never been able to shoot a bullet through two people's bodies and have it ricochet and move around like that
*  Not distort and look like they just shot it into a pool. Looks like they shot it into a bag of pillows
*  It doesn't look anything like something that shattered bones and they found more
*  They found evidence of like fragments in Connolly's wrist and there's not fragments missing from those not enough fragments missing from this
*  Magic bullet that they found and the only reason why they found the magic bullet at all
*  They had to come up with this theory because a guy had gotten hit by a ricochet in the underpass
*  so then they had to attribute all these different wounds to one bullet wounds on two different people and
*  Bullets do weird shit the path of the bullet doesn't bother me as much when people say like bullets not gonna go here and hearing it
*  Yeah, it would yeah. Yeah, they do. Yeah, they do
*  You can shoot someone in the eye and they're fucking the the bullet will bounce around inside their head and come out their face
*  Weird things happen with bullets and guns so that doesn't bother me as much
*  But the idea that you're completely discounting the fact that he grabs his neck in the beginning and then his head goes back into the left
*  Like what's going on there? Is he getting shot from behind and it's a spinal movement
*  Like a shock nerve thing perhaps or perhaps he's getting shot in the head by two different people, too
*  it could be someone from behind and some there could be like a whole line of fire where they're shooting on this guy and
*  To try to the only reason why they try to attribute all those wounds instead of saying more people were shooting is because they wanted
*  One conclusion and that was Lee Harvey Oswald did it and they didn't think he'd be able to shoot more than three times in that
*  Short amount of time that the the president's car was going through there
*  Do you think Trump said that if we take if I knew what he say if I if you knew what I knew
*  You wouldn't want me to release it either. Yeah, right. Do you think that you said that to someone and then that someone report?
*  You know, it was that guy who was the Fox legal
*  analyst
*  An older gentleman Alan Dershowitz. No, no, no, no, no, no an Italian guy
*  fuck
*  but
*  Scar
*  What is his name?
*  Scar no, no, no scar. No, not scar. Mucci. God damn it. I don't remember his name
*  But he's a guy that was like a legal guy who was always on Fox
*  He's a and he had a conversation with Trump allegedly where he said that trumpet said that you wouldn't have released it, too
*  Do you think they'll ever release them? No
*  No, no, I don't I don't think so. Do you think it's kind of
*  This principle where there's a thread on the sweater if you pull the suit if you pull the thread the sweater unravels
*  Do you think that?
*  The America is a country wouldn't be able to take the reveal of whatever happened
*  Because it would then go on to undermine people's faith in the nation too much
*  Because if an organized agency like the CIA can go and kill the president of the United States
*  Yeah, cover it up for however many years then what else is possible and what does that mean in people?
*  Who believe in this country?
*  Yeah, yeah, I think that's exactly it and then how much scrutiny would the intelligence agencies of today have to encounter now?
*  Just from things that we know right we know that they put agents in
*  Crowds at protests. We know that for a fact
*  Okay, but what are those agents do are those agents there in case things go sideways or are those agents making sure things go sideways?
*  Because those are two very different things so we know both of those things have happened
*  So we know that they definitely put agents in place to make sure that if something happens
*  There's a law enforcement presence. They could arrest people
*  We also know that there are rogue agents that will get into these situations and whether it's their job or whether it's they just
*  Act on their own where they want to cause someone to do a crime so they can bust them. We know that's real
*  It's agent provocateurs. It's a legitimate strategy. It's always been in place
*  Yeah, and it happens in other countries as well happens all governments to all governments to it agent provocateurs false flags
*  All those things are real. Yeah, they the the Northwoods report which Kennedy vetoed
*  Operation Northwoods they were gonna blow up a fucking drone jetliner and blame it on the Cubans. They were gonna
*  Arm Cuban friendlies and fuck up Guantanamo Bay
*  They were just gonna try to get us to war with Cuba by bullshit
*  And this was the Joint Chiefs of Staff they signed off on it like sounds good
*  I like it good plan solid plan and the argument against it is well
*  They draft a lot of different plans and that one got vetoed obviously like what but no no you can't
*  You can't lie you can't say one of our plans is to lie dump
*  Like that shouldn't be on the table you shouldn't be able to lie to people not just lie but set up fake attacks
*  Especially after you just did it in Vietnam
*  They didn't got away with it the Gulf of Tonkin incident. They got us into Vietnam
*  So they've always been doing that and so if they came out and gave us all the information on the Kennedy assassination
*  It would cause an erosion in our faith in government that is never been seen before and I don't know how would we would survive it?
*  I mean, maybe they're right. Maybe they're right. Maybe keep it quiet
*  Maybe don't do it anymore, but maybe keep it quiet because if you do release that information
*  I bet the only thing that makes sense is that that's the case
*  Yeah, it doesn't make sense that it's innocuous and there's nothing to it and the Harvey Oswald Act alone. They would release that
*  For sure. Well, there's definitely something going on the question is what is it? That's the dude. Yeah
*  Judge Neapolitanum
*  Yes
*  He's saying that Trump told him. Yes, exactly
*  Exactly. Wow, so fucking crazy man. Yeah, I mean that's the thing about Trump
*  Is that you listen to what that guy says you went? Yeah, Trump definitely said that but they hide things from Trump, too
*  Apparently they were hiding the Chinese weather balloons. They were hiding the spy balloons from him because they were afraid he was gonna shoot him down
*  I
*  Know that's true. I might have seen that on reddit. I might have been on our conspiracy. Oh man
*  Knowing Trump he tried to do it himself as well. That's not shocking. No, I think he'd be up there in a helicopter with the fucking missile launcher
*  himself
*  I've got the best accuracy
*  I've never seen accuracy like this before
*  Boom!
*  He died like a dog. He'd finished with that. He died like a dog. Yeah
*  Yeah, three Chinese balloons flew over US during Trump presidency Trump wasn't offered chance to shoot them down at the time
*  It's true
*  That's fucking insane
*  Trump wasn't I like how they say they hid it from him
*  This is how they say they hid it from Trump wasn't offered chance to shoot them down at the time
*  He wasn't offered the chance at the time. Cause they knew what would happen again
*  Cause they didn't tell him that he could shoot them down
*  That's so funny man
*  They're hiding that from the they don't trust the president and they're hiding that that's insane
*  It's insane. It's insane. Well, who the fuck are they? Who voted for them? Exactly. Yeah, exactly
*  Yeah, that's the thing. But when you get a guy like Trump who becomes president
*  It seems so ridiculous that he's president all rules go out the window
*  Yeah, but fuck you half the country voted for this guy. 100%
*  Look I probably wouldn't have voted for Trump in 2016, but half the country did it was like the same with brexit
*  They tried we didn't vote for brexit, but half the country did. Yeah, that's what democracy looks like is sometimes you don't get your way
*  Yeah, how fucking complicated is that to understand? Yeah
*  But if you're a corrupt piece of shit and you're very un-american then you feel like you should be able to do that or
*  Frame it another way if you believe that this guy Pru is such a danger to democracy
*  But you that's how you argue it with you. So it's great. You go look I'm doing the right thing here
*  I'm protecting my country. I'm stepping in when this person is clearly, you know, not fit to hold office blah
*  but I'm not saying I agree with that's the real problem with the
*  The real misinformation the media narrative like the Russia collusion hoax
*  That's a real problem because that in in so many boomers minds
*  That guy was corrupt Russia had something on him. There's the steel dossier his hookers and PP and all that stuff
*  Pentagon may have purposely hidden spy balloon from Trump
*  He made the claim but what was that other articles quote that Trump wasn't offered the opportunity to shoot it down
*  And it was a source of that. This is so
*  He's saying this because Trump denied that it even happened under his administration
*  Oh, but it did but they did happen. So they didn't tell him so they didn't or or he lied
*  That's what this is is he spoke that would never happen
*  And there's some speculation I talked to Trump the White House officials over the weekend that the Pentagon
*  Deliberately did it because they thought Trump would be too provocative and too aggressive
*  Yeah, unbelievable, but it's amazing that they think that they could tell him that but listen
*  That's the whole idea if you really want to have a president and this ladies and gentlemen is how AI is gonna take over
*  Because AI is gonna be so much more reasonable how it runs a country just given to Microsoft AI. I yeah
*  One thing if you really want to blow your own mind with this is if you think about where
*  The large language models are getting their information from where the AI is gathering its opinions about what human beings are
*  We all know that everything that happens online is not representative of the real world
*  But that is where the AI models are gathering their information. That's what they're reading what people are writing online
*  So we are training these systems to think of us as the online shit that we all know is fake
*  We all know people don't talk online the way they talk like in person, right?
*  We all know that everything that happens there is a warped perception of reality
*  Yet that is exactly what AI is learning about who we are
*  But don't you think that the Google AI is a little bit more sinister than that
*  I don't think it's as simple as it's just getting all of its information online because then there would be arguments
*  There's a lot of arguments online as to whether or not, you know
*  Trans women who should be able to compete in women's sports. Yeah, but if you ask those AI's they come up with reasons
*  Why it should yeah, and if you have an ideologically programmed AI, that's not really AI
*  It's kind of like a propaganda
*  It's you're it's it's not just looking at the opinions of all the people online. It's just not no no no
*  What there is I think is probably just because most of the people who are doing the programming lean that way to them
*  This isn't this is an ideological to them. It's the truth. Yeah. Yeah, they have they have the truth
*  They know what it is hashtag no debate. Yeah hashtag no no point debating no point discussing
*  We know what the truth is and anyone who disagrees with us. They're far right. Yeah
*  What do we do with people who are far right? Yeah. Yeah canceling put them in jail cancel or put them in jail
*  Or maybe we need a final solution job
*  Well, you know if somebody is a gender critical maybe you know, maybe they just need to be put somewhere permanently
*  Well, they certainly shouldn't be allowed to work. No, absolutely
*  Yeah, it's so funny these people went so far they're like they think JK Rowling is a Nazi
*  They still haven't woken up. They still haven't gone
*  Maybe there's something wrong with our argument if JK Rowling is on the other team. It's like oh
*  Man, it's so funny. Did you see this tweet? She's a beast though, man
*  Yeah, she's going on. Yeah, she's got her heels in. Yeah good for her. Yeah good for her
*  You know, there's this left-wing journalist
*  I'm not gonna say the name but her tweet made me laugh so much. She put out this tweet going
*  I am writing this tweet to apologize on March the 13th. I called JK Rowling a Holocaust denier
*  it's just like
*  Why did she call her that
*  Because in her mind it's the same thing
*  Yeah
*  If you say trans women are women you to also say Auschwitz didn't happen and I feel so strongly about it as someone who?
*  Lost relatives in the Holocaust what they've done to those words Holocaust denier Nazi far-right is
*  Abominable it really is what they have done to those words the way they've diluted the meaning of these words that have very specific
*  meanings
*  It's horrific and it's by the way
*  It's costing us now because we can't have a genuine conversation about like some people are Holocaust deniers
*  Some people are actually supportive of those ideologies, right?
*  And you have to be able to distinguish between that and someone who thinks
*  Trans women shouldn't be fighting in a cage with real women. There's like some fucking difference there. There's a gap
*  But yeah, just a little bit of a gap and we and words like they have a meaning for a purpose so that we can have a conversation
*  Yeah, yeah, it's it's such an important point and the worst bit is is you have these people were genuinely far-right. They're terrifying
*  They have these awful views and then when they challenge they go
*  I'm not far-right because you've said this person is far-right that term doesn't mean anything and you're like, you know what Adolf?
*  You've got a point, right?
*  Yeah, it's a real problem because it's gonna get clipped man
*  People dangerous far-right people are real just like dangerous far-left people are real and
*  That's why being on this goofy team left or right is so stupid. You've got to think for yourself
*  Yeah, you've got to think for yourself
*  Yeah, and life is complicated and it's full of complexity and nuance and nobody has the full picture of reality
*  That's why you gotta talk that's why you need Jesus. I mean that's what Jordan is talking about
*  That's what Jordan's talking about. Yeah, he is
*  well
*  Structure some kind of divine structure something whatever it is
*  I mean
*  I know a lot of people that are Muslims that are very happy and they they're happy because the discipline that it gives them
*  They believe they believe it gives them a structure
*  And a lot of people out there don't have that and I don't think that's good either
*  No
*  No, it's he's really in the inquirer of it
*  His current tour is called we who wrestle with God and he's really I mean what he's really doing is telling people stories from the Bible
*  And illustrating and breaking down how they apply to your life and it's amazing. I mean, I'm not a believer
*  well, yeah, I'm not I guess but
*  Seeing the difference that makes to people just him telling them how to live a good life
*  Thousands of people every night and then they aren't there for his like culture war takes, right?
*  They aren't there to see him take down Justin Trudeau or whatever
*  They're there because he's like we were in the cigar bar in Tulsa with the guy who does the music David Cotter
*  And we were just sitting there and the guy came up. He was at the show
*  Started talking and before we knew it there was like three guys there and one of them
*  I mean, I remember one of them especially Devon black guy
*  He was saying like I don't know about his politics people say all this crazy shit like when my sister died
*  Jordan Peterson's
*  32nd clip on the internet is the only reason I didn't kill myself Wow
*  And and I've been hearing those stories every night man. It's well, he has a very profound impact for sure
*  Yeah, and he also struggles with fame, which is a weird thing to be introduced to when you're in your 40s
*  Yeah, you know you've been anonymous your whole life and then all sudden you're a polarizing
*  Often misrepresented world figure. Yeah. Yeah, and and that's the that's how unfair
*  It is is the way in I would take real exception to this the way that he's been portrayed where people go
*  He's just like Andrew Tate
*  Yeah, he's got a penis
*  They drink water. Yeah
*  Yeah, man, it's it's an insane but you know what I have to say from what I've observed over the last couple of weeks
*  He's on the other side of all those troubles. That's good. Yeah, you know, he's I've never met anyone
*  Whose message and and the person are so closely aligned like he's he's a great man
*  He is a great man and last time he was here. He was like at his best
*  He struggled coming back from the benzodiazepine problem. Uh-huh. That's a that's a scary one man. That's a really scary one
*  He's through that and like just observing him day to day cuz you know when you spend time with people you see them at their worst
*  Yeah, and at their best. Yes
*  I've never met anyone who's inspired me as much to like be a good person. That's awesome
*  Yeah, I always say he's insanely misrepresented and he's a great guy, but he's so polarizing
*  You see like whenever there's some sort of a Jordan Pearson thing a story or anything
*  I'll read like what people have to say about it. It's like god damn like it's again. He's
*  Also indicative of the kind of people that post things like that
*  Like that's not generally a healthy person is posting like aggressively shitty
*  Misrepresenting but it's like very common that there's people like that, especially on
*  Twitter or on Facebook or any of these places that just encourage mental illness, which is a lot of what it is
*  Yeah, here's the thing though man in the real world. He's selling out fucking basketball arenas
*  Yeah
*  And it's full of well-dressed people who are there with their partner that they met because of the advice he gave them or they're there
*  To meet him because he's changed their life or they didn't kill themselves or they got a job or whatever
*  Yeah, that's the impact. He's actually making yeah on people's lives and it's it's so impressive
*  Yeah, we need more people like that. We need way more people like that. Yeah, we need more people that show an example like an interesting
*  Fascinating example of how to live your life
*  The problem is is that we live in a world of shortcuts
*  You know if you want an online following we all know what we can do in order to get an online following
*  It's not particularly hard. You can game the system
*  You know the tweets to write and that will then you know gain traction which will gain you followers whatever else
*  Yeah, you know what you have to do if you want to create a
*  Content online when it comes to podcasts that will get people talking we all know it
*  Yeah
*  but actually it's far far far more difficult to be authentic and to actually say you know what I'm
*  Gonna do something because it's the right thing to do not but it because it's gonna benefit me in the short term
*  Not because it's gonna lead to certain deals not because it's gonna lead me to this particular place where my ego demands that I should be
*  I'm actually gonna take the long route
*  I'm gonna do what's right and we live in a society where we're constantly being offered the shortcut
*  Right all the time and we know that if we take the shortcut
*  We're gonna get a little bit of a response from our brain will go well done on taking the shortcut
*  Yeah, it takes a hell of a lot of discipline hard work and sometimes
*  Real frustration to go I'm not gonna take the shortcut. I'm not gonna be inflammatory
*  I'm not gonna say the thing that I know will guarantee clicks and more money and more revenue
*  I'm gonna go this path and I just have to have the courage of my own
*  Convictions that where this path will lead me will be somewhere where I want to be as opposed to somewhere that I know
*  Definitely in the long term will take me on the route to hell because that's where some people are it's so interesting
*  You say hell because I never really understood when people ask Jordan about heaven and hell
*  He always brings it back to heaven and hell on earth
*  And what he's really saying is like every decision you make when you know, it's the wrong decision
*  You're gonna pay for that not in some fucking magic world afterwards when you're dead
*  You're gonna pay for that in this life. Yeah, and when you make good decisions
*  That's not to say that good things don't happen to bad people and bad things that happen to good people
*  But over the course of a lifetime
*  Every bad decision you make will come back and and we all know this is true
*  Like it's a kind of what you're talking about is the opposite of the marshmallow test, right?
*  Like the ability to suspend gratification is the most the best predictor of long-term success, right?
*  And so if you're able to just wait and not jump on this dopamine hit right now over the course of your life
*  That will be rewarded and that's that's basically the model. He's he's giving people the opportunity
*  The model he's he's giving people just be good. You know what you know, and and his argument is you do need god
*  His definition of god is different to most people
*  But it's fundamentally he's just going around telling people how to live their lives in a positive way
*  It's it's how is it different? How's his his?
*  View of god. It's very difficult to get a kind of to get to it
*  He doesn't like being asked if he believes in god because his thing is like well what you're doing is you're saying like
*  There's a garden gnome in the sky. Do you believe in that and it's a way of trivializing
*  His his belief about it. You'd have to ask him directly
*  But I think you know him and I've gone back and forth
*  He really brought me over to argue with him and try and challenge his ideas
*  From a from just an outsider perspective really
*  So we've gone back and forth and I think his idea is
*  that
*  The way he talks about is like god is the opposite of evil
*  God is god is how you know what is right and how what is wrong and it's something that
*  Leads you up instead of leading you down. That's what he thinks of as god
*  It's like the fundamental question is where does morality come from and his argument is the evolutionary theory
*  May well be true, but it's insufficient particularly insufficient to give us meaning and
*  For the west to survive. How do you survive?
*  How does a civilization of people who don't know what they believe in
*  Survive in the battle of civilization with people who do know what they believe in who have a strong idea
*  But you mentioned, you know islam for example, right?
*  How do you how do you navigate that when you don't know what you believe when you don't know what you stand for when you
*  Can't even say
*  Not believing in free speech is unamerican. Right? Yeah, how do you how do you if you've got no values of your own?
*  How are you going to navigate the world in that way? Right?
*  And so his argument is very much that we need to
*  We need to be inspired by something divine to be our best selves and to know who we are
*  That's such a profound thing because when people say to be inspired by the divine they automatically think of god
*  But the reality is you can find god in anywhere, right? And if you to be inspired by the divine
*  For me, it's to be the thing that I love the most
*  is to be creative is to write is to
*  Be in that moment where you were writing and you're like, oh this idea and this idea and this idea and you feel
*  Whatever
*  Disregard the old to the end product
*  But that moment is to be divine because you were truly at one with what you are who you are
*  And what you love and you are passionate about the most that is the divine now for somebody else. It can be another type of thing
*  But love would be a big part of it
*  Like when you are in love and you're truly present with the person you love it kind of feels infinite
*  It kind of feels like that moment is
*  It's you can't it can't exactly be measured in time
*  You can't go that was 63 seconds where we stared into each other's eyes and said nothing or whatever that was, right?
*  um, and I I think part of it's exactly what you're saying is there's these states that we go into in relation to ourselves or to
*  other people
*  that
*  Transcend the reality in which we exist and I think that may well be a part of his you know
*  You have to ask him because it's too easy complicated, but it's kind of part of his definition
*  I think of what god is. Yeah, because and I think deep down
*  That's what we're all looking for really is to be in this state where we're not
*  Thinking about ourselves because thinking about yourselves is why we're so miserable because we're being trained
*  Continually going on social media doing this. What am I doing? My myself myself myself? That's with a way to end up
*  Perpetually thoroughly miserable and aversion of hell
*  Yeah
*  But to be in a state where you are creating where you are doing something that you love where you are with people that you love
*  We were you with your children your wife your partner whoever it is and you have that connection
*  That really is that's life is the connection and the opposite of life for me is
*  Disconnection to me there is nothing more tragic than when I sit down at a table and I see I look over
*  At a restaurant. I see a beautiful young couple doing the bloom of life. They're youthful
*  They have they they're in that moment where potential seems limitless
*  And they're both staring down at their phones and they're not looking into each other's eyes
*  And you want to say to them? What are you doing?
*  You know, and I know we all do it and i'm as guilty of it as anyone
*  I'm not saying that i'm not
*  But that moment when you have that connection with love
*  I think that's what we're all seeking deep down
*  It's what we all crave there is you know, and his argument is that you know what we saw in the 20th century
*  is
*  As nicha predicted the death of god causing
*  The the breakdown of our belief and therefore world war two and and everything that happened there mao the soviet union, etc
*  About the 21st century though. I think there's there's maybe something else going on as well
*  Which is we've mentioned the sexual revolution and people having fewer kids and also
*  People being crammed into cities the urbanization that we've seen over the last 150 years changes everything like
*  I remember reading a book by a guy called he was a zoologist the desmond morris
*  And the book was called the naked uh, the human zoo. He wrote a book called it naked
*  But the human zoo is the one i'm thinking of
*  And his central argument was when you put animals in the conditions that human beings live in big cities
*  You get the same pathologies mental health violence, you know atomization depression all the same shit happens. And so
*  You've got urbanization
*  You've got the pill which changes testosterone levels
*  in men
*  Women are attracted to men with lower testosterone. That would be one driver
*  Another driver would be to get an in the water supply, you know the alex jones making the frog gay point turns out
*  It's kind of true
*  and
*  Then you put all that together and then you add the death of belief and you've got a very powerful mix to explain what's going on
*  So yeah, the alex jones thing it's atrazine, right? Is that what it is? Yeah, it's um, it's a pesticide. I believe
*  Okay, is it an herbicide or a pesticide? So it's not the pill. It's not the contraceptive pill getting into the water
*  That's not what what he was saying was turning the frogs. Okay
*  There's a thing called I believe it's called atrazine and what it does is it will actually turn male frogs into females
*  They actually morph and it makes a bunch of them
*  Incapable of breeding it has like very weird endocrine disruptor effects
*  So that's in the water stuff in the water supply that's messing with the hormones and all that kind of stuff
*  I think birth control pills are in the water supply too. Yeah, yeah for sure and plastics in the microplastics and then they have
*  And even like anti-depressants, right? Some water supplies have trace elements trace amounts of anti-depressants and cocaine
*  Yeah, well there's some good news
*  Particularly energetic population. Yeah. What are you making your pasta with Mike?
*  So and then you know
*  The sexual revolution also causes the breakdown of the family far fewer people are growing up in an intact household
*  You put all that shit together and you get to where we are. Yeah, it's
*  It's so interesting as well
*  Like you see people talking in the uk and they go oh britain doesn't have there's no such thing as british culture and you're going
*  You just let's just look at what britain has created in terms of literature
*  art
*  philosophy theater
*  music
*  You're saying there's no culture and then but if you said this to a lot of young people
*  They simply look at you and nod. Well, why are they allowed to say that because it's white people
*  Yeah, a lot of it I think I think a lot of it would be yeah, but it's also like that seems so silly though in terms of
*  Like arguing the evidence. I think the confusion that people have is I think especially after world war two
*  There was this idea that nationalism
*  Like that was nationalism
*  And patriotism leads to nationalism. Therefore you shouldn't be patriotic because then you you're going to end up just like hitler
*  Which seems a little bit tenuous to me like there's quite a lot of intermediary steps there people are allowed to be
*  Proud of their country and love their country without being aggressive about it. Yeah, you don't you don't have to be hitler
*  You don't have to fucking obvious. Yeah fucking obvious, right? Yeah, especially in a country like this. That's essentially founded by immigrants. Yeah
*  Obviously, there's some people here first
*  But after that it's immigrants and so the the whole idea is that we all agree
*  This is supposed to be a place where you have the first amendment. It's freedom of speech
*  It's a very important part of what it means to be an american
*  It's a big part of the whole setup the whole way it runs
*  His people had to have very controversial ideas to be willing to risk their lives and come here from another country to try to set
*  Up shop try to set up this new way of living and it's the best way
*  It's not perfect, but it's the best way currently available
*  And if you're trying to fight that in any way specifically if you're trying to fight the very first amendment
*  You're unamerican. It's really simple and to your point
*  If you think about what you're just talking about which is the history of your country 1776 and all the rest of it
*  If you had these people trying to shut down freedom of expression as they are now that would never happen
*  The pamphlets go out. Oh, this is hate speech ban it
*  They're disrupting the fabric of you know, whatever the argument exactly shut it down shut it down. Yeah
*  What do you when you do you ever take like an overview approach?
*  To like society and just stop and think like where's this all going and why is it so contentious and chaotic?
*  Is this just the only way that human beings are able to progress?
*  As they have to be constantly at battle and then they kind of both have to kind of improve their positions as time goes on
*  Well, look look at our societies. I mean
*  It's kind of weird discussing any of these conflicts around the world because you have to be able to hold two things in your head
*  At the same time on the one hand war is horrific. It's fucking horrific
*  So the one of the worst things that humans being do to each other and on the other hand is completely normal
*  Look at look around you go to london you go where you go to trefalgar square named after the battle of trefalgar
*  What do you see there nelson's column named after admiral nelson you go to paris. What do you see the arc of dr trump, right?
*  Every society defines itself by the conflicts. It's four and one
*  So it just seems like this is in I mean we're bands of chimps and chimps go to war and so do we
*  It just seems like I don't I don't think we're ever going to get out of that paradigm until
*  Where those fat motherfuckers with milkshakes floating around on pods?
*  Maybe that's what we need to do in order to guarantee world peace, but you'd love that wouldn't you?
*  Yeah, I would do mate just we're going to my base instincts fucking
*  I'll be like definitely but it's also we had a guy on the show way back when we started a guy that I grew up
*  With called dr. Mike martin and he's a professor of war studies former military guy really smart guy
*  And he was talking about oxytocin and he wrote a book called why we fight which is the
*  Evolutionary biological analysis of warfare. Why is that human beings fight and he talked about oxytocin and oxytocin?
*  Is the hormone that you feel you feel it?
*  it's a tingly hormone when you go to a concert and you know the band comes on and does a big hit which is massive and
*  Anthemic and everybody sings along and you get the little tingle in the back of the neck
*  And
*  That hormone has two functions number one it creates an in-group
*  To say we are the group. This is who we are right and that was very very necessary for evolutionary reasons for
*  Obviously the second part of its function it creates suspicion of the out group
*  So you go it's kind of hardwired into us now
*  We're like we're this group and we're a little team
*  Yep, and then we don't like them and then when you kind of see society people going I'm liberal
*  I don't like conservatives and vice versa and all the other nonsense you go
*  How much of this is actually conscious and how much of this is actually?
*  Biologically programmed and is there another factor because I go a bit smug and I go
*  Yeah, I don't have any for tribe or whatever else and I get on my little high horse and start lecturing you go. Well
*  That ain't true either
*  But also maybe I don't feel the hormonal
*  Maybe it doesn't have as profound impact on me as it does on somebody else when the moment they're in a tribe they feel this
*  Overwhelming sense of acceptance and joy. Yeah, but if someone invaded your town you'd get to that point very quickly
*  Yeah, like fuck these guys. Yeah, we're going to the front line. Yeah, we all would right?
*  Yeah, you're a fighter you do that if someone was your family is under threat you'd lay down your life for them, right?
*  And people think they're engaged in a virtual war. Yeah, yeah really do yeah, they think they're on the right side of things
*  Everybody else is a Nazi
*  Well, that's the thing to try and get away from both left and right I think can be guilty of that
*  We just got to try and remember weird with we are on the same team
*  What was your take on all this Candice Owen daily wire stuff? Oh
*  I don't know if I can say it
*  well, I
*  I
*  Think that she she's very charismatic and
*  Very talented as a broadcaster
*  but I
*  Thought her branching out beyond the core issues that she initially focused on was a bit of a disaster
*  You mean like McCrone's wife being a man?
*  So I just I think the the big tragedy of this whole fallout is like
*  It was the wrong hire for the daily wire. It was wrong place
*  But it was great at the time well
*  Yeah, it's because if you're charismatic and you're talking about issues on which you are, you know accurate you're gonna do well
*  Wasn't like her billboard when they first signed her for the daily wild didn't say like uncancellable uncancellable was it?
*  I think so
*  I think that's what it said
*  Disrespect people and anything I just think it was the wrong partnership
*  Probably, you know, what did she say?
*  What that got her fire? Oh, I don't know. I have no idea. No, I don't know
*  someone said that one of the controversies online is that she had wrote Christ is King and
*  Put that and someone had said that she was a Christian
*  One of the controversies online is that she had wrote Christ is King and
*  Put that and someone had said that that was anti-semitic. I think she liked a tweet that was kind of like blood libel
*  uncancellable since 1989
*  It's the problem that if you if you if you create an organization whose slogan is free speech
*  You're never gonna be able to have an editorial policy, which is what they're now trying to have
*  They're trying to say well if you work at this organization
*  It's like Fox News or CNN or anywhere like as you get bigger
*  You start to be faced with the fact that like people have different opinions and some people's opinions are gonna be outside of the scope
*  Of what the people who run it believe so if you want to be independent
*  You're gonna have to stay independent by the way
*  Some of those people that have opinions outside the scope of what you're supposed to think are fun
*  Sure, they're interesting to listen to I don't necessarily know if McCrone's wife is a man
*  But the story is hilarious
*  That there's actual journalists that are working on this and she's reporting their work
*  The real the true story about her meeting him when he was 15 is crazy enough. Mm-hmm
*  Yeah as a drama teacher, that's crazy enough. Yeah, when did you guys start hooking up? Yeah
*  I so I agree with you about fun, but I also think when you are communicating to millions of people
*  There is an accuracy issue that has to has to also happen. Yeah, right, especially that one
*  Like that's kind of like kind of a big deal. Well, my take is if there if that's a man, right?
*  Doesn't that man you just want to talk about my crone's wife?
*  Sorry, I misunderstood this conversation
*  She has children look it's a dumb shit it's a dumb thing to say it's not fucking true. Yeah, right, right
*  Yeah, so so my and so why but if it's not true, why do these journalists think it's true? I have no idea man
*  It's no internet as well man
*  Is the best yeah, I mean I
*  think
*  The issue like again it comes down to the fact that you get this huge platform
*  You do very well you build up this massive audience and then you start going
*  Well, I'm a public figure. I need to have opinions on
*  Whatever is going on right, right and the problem comes like take Israel Palestine
*  I've never spoken about it publicly as to what I think because the reality is I don't fucking know I
*  Don't know. I know I know I've got enough to formulate some kind of opinion, but do I want a challenge?
*  Do I want to go up against an expert? Do I want someone to push back on my ideas?
*  No, because I don't really know I read about it and I'm just
*  Formulating my opinion, but I think the danger comes when you have that type of audience and that type of platform and
*  You are a political commentator, so you feel compelled to have an opinion about everything
*  Yeah, you rapidly wade into things that you know nothing about and by the way just to say like good point
*  Francis and I we have that attitude to ourselves, right?
*  So we're like we I'm not sure we should be talking about this because we we don't know that we know enough
*  Yeah, you know so and it's it's a hard thing to navigate because what happens is and you see this with stand-up comics, too
*  It's like you're on stage in front of a hundred people or a thousand people or five thousand people
*  Oh, then suddenly your opinion is like important
*  Suddenly, you know what you're talking about because lots of people listen to you and there are some things on which you do know what?
*  You're talking about but there's also a shit ton of things that you don't know and you've got a show tomorrow
*  And you've got to have an hour's worth of content. So here's my opinion on Ukraine. Here's my opinion on Israel
*  Here's my opinion about McCrone's wife. Here's my opinion on this shit and before you know it
*  Unconsciously I suspect you're in over your head and you're saying things that you that you are not qualified to comment on you
*  You're not you haven't done the research you haven't understood that issue
*  But here you are giving your opinion and and that's a trap for a lot of people in our space
*  It really is it's a trap when you have a mic and you don't know to do what you just said
*  Wait formulate these opinions take in the information try to figure out what's true and what's not true. Yeah
*  You know
*  And there's a difference between like three guys having a conversation and you go here's my opinion and I go here's my opinion
*  And you go here's my opinion
*  Let's have a chat and find out and none of us is attached to that opinion being true
*  Everyone's willing to change their mind. We're not telling the audience. This is the truth, right?
*  But when you're doing your own show
*  Just you just you and you're reading an hour's worth of stuff that you've written or someone's helped you right to the camera
*  That's a very different ballgame. It's a very different conversation
*  And so I think ultimately the conflict between the daily wine Candace Owens is about that not about
*  You know anti-semitism, whatever. I just think it was not the right fit and over time those cracks have widened
*  That's my understanding from you know, speaking to people on various sides of it
*  I think everyone's better off being independent anyway. Yeah. Yeah, you know, yeah, I'm sure she's got a giant audience independently now
*  Sure, I wish her every success, you know, I agree or disagree on issues. You always want people to do well
*  You know so but I just think it was a conflict based on the fact that there's you know, different values different attitudes different
*  You know, you see that the professor at Columbia today a Jewish professor who is pro-israel
*  he got locked out and so there's these videos of him standing in front of the the crowd and
*  Saying they are locking me out. They won't let me teach they won't let me into the building
*  My car doesn't work anymore because he's pro-israel, right?
*  Joe there's the funniest thing you got to see this this 2015 NFL skit. Have you seen this? No Jamie
*  Could you go on my Twitter? It's one of my recent tweets. It says how did they know?
*  This is the funniest thing I have seen in years. This is from 2015
*  2015 and it's a sketch about a guy dropping his daughter off at college. Wow
*  Jamie you about able to find it
*  Thank you my brother. Cool. This is 2015 was that right when Jordan Peterson started becoming famous was it?
*  He was 2016. Yeah, it was 2016 2015. What was going on in 2015 2015 was definitely when he was experiencing that stuff
*  Yeah, in Toronto. What was it was 2015 evergreen go go full screen with this. Oh
*  my god, that's
*  2015 what was that sketch?
*  SNL I said NFL before SNL that wouldn't be that was on SNL. Yeah, that's one of the best things SNL's ever done
*  Yeah, that's how good is that man?
*  That bit when he goes death to America I was like, yeah, that's what they're saying
*  Yeah, that's what they're saying on college campuses. Yeah, they're saying that and this pro Israeli guy got kicked off. You just
*  You actually stop at times and go what is actually happening? What is actually happening?
*  Well, we've all been talking about a man for how many years we've been talking press or press dynamics inevitably creates the shit
*  Yes, inevitable. Yeah, it's inevitable. It's also being influenced by foreign countries. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah, they will always do that
*  Yeah, they will always did an amazing job with universities, but we have to we have to weaken our own immune system for them to be able to be successful
*  Yeah, yeah true. Yeah, and we've also got to offer up our kids. I don't think enough people make this point
*  There's lots of people pointing the fingers going kids are stupid kids are this kids are this kids or whatever yet?
*  You're gonna raise kids a certain way. They're gonna turn out a certain way. How have you raised them?
*  Is it really the kids fault or actually is the reason you're pointing at them and mocking them and deriding them because you know
*  You've fucked up and it's the easy thing to do to point at the kids when the fact that they actually they've been raised wrong
*  Yeah, on the other hand and when you become a parent you'll maybe
*  See this differently as well is you only have a certain amount of influence in a society where you send your kids to school
*  You send them to college. That's what they're taught the things that they're taught
*  They naturally will want to rebel against their parents
*  What all kids want to do and if they're fed this very simplistic narrative about you know life is about there's some people who control
*  everything and they're oppressing everyone and
*  There's lots of people who are oppressed and the way, you know, who's oppressing who's by who's successful, right?
*  So what you've built in then is if you're successful
*  You're a bad guy and if you're struggling you're a good guy and then you look at all the different ethnic groups and suddenly
*  You know Asian Americans Jews and whatever these groups that are
*  Quote-unquote overperformed. They're over represented once you create the idea that some people are over represented and some people are under represented
*  You inevitably come to this point inevitably people will inevitably start hating successful minorities
*  And they will stop and they will look at everyone else as the
*  Oppressed underdog. I mean Thomas souls. Hmm latest book social justice fallacies
*  He talks about how every single brewery major brewery in the world
*  Was founded by Germans including Qing Tao the Chinese brewery Wow
*  Because those people have perfected the art of brewing over hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years and every group is gonna have its own
*  Advantages and disadvantages some people are better at hockey. Some people are better at basketball
*  Some people are better making money by being lawyers
*  Some people are better making money by being podcasters or something else, right?
*  You can't just look at people as members of groups and go we know everything about this group if this group is doing well
*  Society that means they're oppressors, but that's the position we've come to and it's because of indoctrination in education. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely
*  Let's be honest. It's indoctrination education guided by you know funded and supported by foreign powers. Yeah, and we've allowed it to happen
*  Yeah, we've allowed it to happen and because I could be washed
*  Yeah, and I completely agree and you know, that's why I have real empathy for a lot of these kids
*  I'm like you've just been fed this crap since you since the moment you agent the education system
*  And then you come out at the age of 18 19 and you're spouting this nonsense
*  Yeah, but what do we tell our kids what I used to work in a school
*  What did we say when we when I was a teacher listen to your teacher?
*  Don't question don't challenge particularly with the younger ones
*  You do what your teacher tells you to do if your teacher tells you to do this in math you do this in maths
*  No, yeah
*  It's a person in a position of authority that has control over an entire group of people
*  Which we already know how that dynamic goes with cults and with presidents with everything else
*  And then you have this group of people that are filled with anxiety that want to make it in life
*  And if there's a very clear path that you have to follow
*  They're just gonna be influenced to follow it. It's it's real simple to do to young people
*  You take them away from their parents their parents probably overbearing
*  They finally get to be themselves and free pals time and then they just from the river to the sea
*  They're just out there in the streets and it's absolutely true
*  And if you look I don't know in America but in the UK a teacher is described as being in loco parentis
*  Which means in the role of the parent?
*  So that is your role when you're a teacher in the UK. It's in the role of the parent
*  That's your responsibility to look after these kids teach them, but also there's a pastoral aspect to it
*  so if you're in the role of the parent and
*  You have these dangerous ideologies and you might not even have any kids. Oh, yeah
*  Right, then you have blue hair and a bunch of yeah, like the lips of tik-tok
*  I mean she's posting this stuff every day. Yeah, and you have 18 different pronouns that you like to use
*  Yeah, and you're one of these awful teachers where you're like, I want the kids to be my friend
*  You're like, why do you want to be friends with a nine-year-old? Did you ever see any footage from though?
*  The stuff we did at the protest we went along to I went along to a few protests and talked to people
*  Have you seen have you seen any of this? No, we have like a five minute clip. Which protests both
*  So in London I went along to
*  March against antisemitism and I went along to pro-palestine protests two of them and an extinction rebellion protest
*  That was fucking incredible. What is extinction rebellion?
*  Extinction rebellion is a group that's fairly small in this country, but very big in the UK
*  and they basically want us to stop using oil and gas and
*  Producing energy through fossil fuels. So the folks that glue themselves to the wall. Yeah
*  Yeah, yeah, but
*  Interesting we have Jamie we have a couple of minutes clip if you're interested Joe from me and I was very journalistic about it
*  I didn't go in to try and misrepresent anybody. I just talked to people
*  Okay, that's all I did and I'd ask them, you know, you've got this placard with this free Palestine oil from the river to the sea
*  What does that mean? Right and
*  We we didn't edit it. We didn't massage it. We showed you every over the course of the 30-minute video
*  We showed you every single person we spoke to pretty much right and it's just fascinating you talk about like these kids don't know anything
*  I you have no idea how much they don't know anything, you know, and they're well-intentioned people. They're not bad people
*  They're there because they've seen kids being blown up on their timeline and I you know, that's understandable
*  You'd be freaked out by that and if you're a human being you'd be freaked out by that
*  But Jamie if you're able to play a minute or two, I think you'd find it interesting Joe. Okay
*  Where's where's that it's on YouTube, but it'll be one of our most recent YouTube clips. Oh, yeah
*  So I just noticed the signs you've got from the river to the sea Palestine will be free what does that mean?
*  Well, it's quite self-explanatory
*  It was a little bit more complicated than that, isn't it?
*  Because I guess what I mean is how would that come about what would happen to the Israelis?
*  I
*  Don't I'm trying to think about the word it
*  Isn't it just as self-explanatory as the area of land
*  It's Palestine's land. Yeah, so when you say Palestine, which puppet do you mean?
*  Yeah, the Gaza Strip
*  West bank
*  Yeah
*  I'm getting confused. I thought it's self-explanatory. What about either of you?
*  Bullshit question why well tell me why is it?
*  Yeah, it's just really inflammatory
*  Yeah, it's inflammatory what why
*  Okay
*  All right, I was just asking what it meant Oh
*  What does it mean to you
*  Palestinians to be free, you know in what it says Palestine's I was asking them which bit of the area
*  Yeah, the people that are being oppressed for them to be free, you know Gaza West Bank them people to be free
*  Yeah, Gaza West Bank. Yeah all Palestinians in general, you know, because we know that what's going on
*  All of them are being oppressed so for them to be free, you know, it's nothing nothing, you know, it's clear as day
*  Yeah, yeah
*  I was just asking them which bit of the land they mean because some people mean
*  All of the land including the bit where Israel is now and that's why there's some debate about you know
*  the main message is
*  Palestinians that are being oppressed for them to be free, you know and
*  for everyone to live in harmony regardless of your religion or wherever it is because
*  historically speaking the
*  We say Muslims Jews Christians have been living there for centuries, you know living in good peace
*  But when early in recent times all of this issue has been started going on, you know
*  But I think it's how long how long would you say this issue has been going on as far as I know
*  Obviously, I'm not as educated on this topic for example with other people
*  But for roughly around 75 years since I think the mandate from 45 just before after World War
*  I think is when the issues, you know when people when the British came and started cutting up lands and taking the
*  The the lands of the Palestinians. I think that's when the issue started, you know
*  Yeah before that you had the Ottoman Empire there which had very strong control over the area
*  Yeah, that makes sense any attack on civilians is not justified, you know regardless of
*  Whatever happened, you know, but I think the the issue really should what is the origin of this problem?
*  You know history has not started October 7, you know
*  We have to see the real origin of this was as I said 75 years ago
*  Obviously, I'm not as educated on this topic
*  but for because what I see now is this whole issue is being portrayed as if
*  Civilization and history started from October 7th and onwards
*  But no, that's not the real that's early aspect
*  The whole issue is obviously as we said from you know
*  70 80 years ago and I think that contributes to what is going on today from from both sides
*  You know from the Palestinian side as well as the Israeli side. All right
*  So we are now forward a few seconds. Just a few seconds. We don't need me talking just and there's one more bit
*  Here we go. It's alternative to Sunak and Salma for a socialist inter father
*  What's a socialist into father if I'm being honest with you? I just got this at the stand over there
*  Okay, but do any of you know the definition of the word into father stop bombing Gaza that makes sense. What about that one?
*  Yeah, and what does that mean?
*  Well, it means to
*  It's a to stop the Israeli occupation of
*  From which River to which sea?
*  From from the Jordan
*  To the Mediterranean Sea. Yeah, so does that mean that all of Israel should be what is now Israel should be Palestine in your opinion?
*  No, I personally don't think that I think there's I mean it this time
*  Definitely not the person to talk to about this, but I know that there's multiple
*  Strategies that people have come up with like a two-state solution one state solution. I think ideally I would like to see one
*  Multifaith state that is neither Israel nor Palestine
*  Strong opinions to be out there marching. Yeah, I'm at least it had done a lot of research
*  Can you imagine marching with a sign that you don't know what it means?
*  Well, also they're being handed those signs right while too so that's organized right and then they also know that people are very
*  Gullible and people like to be out in protests. Yeah, and that and like I said, they're not bad people
*  No, look at this. They're decent people informed. They're not informed at all. And yet they're protesting which is interesting
*  so most of the people I spoke to were somewhere along that so
*  Pretty decent people and not hateful most of them. There is a minority, but most of them
*  They're not hateful. They're not bad people, but what they are is very ill-informed
*  and the other thing is I'm starting to kind of see the distinction there are some people who have a
*  activist mindset and there are some people who have a pragmatist mindset and that's the activist mindset which is if we
*  Complain enough if we make enough noise if we draw enough attention
*  Then someone else will fix things right the pragmatist mindset is like how do we move forward from here?
*  And that's the question I was putting to them is like you say we need from the river to the sea that that you know
*  That means there shouldn't be any Israel right because right because that's what that means
*  If from the River Jordan to the Mediterranean that means there would be no Israel and then when you say to them
*  Well, is that is that what you're asking for? No, I want everyone to live in peace and harmony
*  Well, have you been to the fucking Middle East?
*  Yeah
*  Good luck with that. Yeah, right
*  So these these things are very very complicated very complicated and that's why they haven't been resolved for 75 years
*  So the the way to try and resolve them is to think about how do we move forward?
*  We can get stuck in 75 years of history. That's not going to take you anywhere
*  You think bickering about what happened in 1945 is going to solve anything. Is that what you think?
*  1960 that's gonna solve something. No, man. This is the way forward is to find a way for both sides to live a
*  ideally separately from each other and
*  Be for economic growth and development to be happening there and for security to be available to the Palestinians and to the Israelis, right?
*  And I'm not saying that from any deep place of expertise. It's just like the obvious thing, right?
*  People don't fight when they're happy and comfortable and safe
*  Right
*  How you get there is very very complicated discussion, but but it's not protesting with a sign you don't understand
*  Well, that's just indicative of just human nature, right?
*  Right people want to be on the virtuous side
*  They want to be on the side the right side of the protest and obviously you say something like free Palestine
*  Who's gonna argue with that? Of course. Everyone should be free free free Palestine. Yeah, definitely. And so you're out there with a sign
*  I'm doing the right thing and it's that simple and it's hard to really pay attention
*  It's hard to really formulate it especially that one
*  That's a complicated one. Super complicated and and also as well. It's not it's not just the complicatedness of it
*  It's the fact that the Middle East is so emotionally charged. It's so
*  Emotionally, I'm at equally put my friend
*  To the point that it makes it impossible to kind of have a rational discussion about it without people going
*  Oh, you're being like this. You're being like this
*  Everybody's invested in it and you go
*  You know, there's a very famous story during Northern Ireland when they had the peace talks in Northern Ireland
*  Well, I think it was Clinton came in and sat down with both sides and these these were people who'd been at war literal war
*  I mean Northern Ireland was in a state of civil war. They call it the troubles, but that's essentially
*  Yeah, but it's essentially what it was and Clinton went you know what?
*  Before we get started before you say anything
*  Can we agree it's Wednesday?
*  They're like, yeah, and they were like, can we agree it's 1130?
*  Yeah, and can we agree that?
*  I'm drinking a cup of black coffee. They're like, yeah, okay. Okay. So we start from a point of agreement with that
*  let's see if we can navigate the rest and
*  Try and find a place where we can find some common ground and
*  I think the put the challenges that we're facing right now
*  We can't even agree what words mean
*  And if we can't even agree with what words mean, how are we going to agree on?
*  something as
*  difficult to solve as the Middle East and
*  Find a solution that not everybody is happy with that everybody's prepared to accept because the reality is when you strike any deal
*  You there needs to be a large dollop of pragmatism involved where you have to accept
*  I'm not gonna get everything I want and I've got to accept
*  What I am happy with what I can accept
*  At that moment and if you're not prepared to do that and if you can't even agree on what words mean and if you
*  In this kind of oppressor oppressed mindset
*  How are you gonna come to any kind of agreement or solution the way we have the conversation about it is not intended to find
*  A solution people aren't looking for a solution people are looking to say, you know, what's happening is horrible and it is horrible
*  I mean who like this is the thing with social media is
*  You know, you spent two two minutes on your phone looking at what's going on and you're like fuck, you know
*  We someone someone's got to do something. Yeah, the oceans boiling but but
*  But doing stuff is hard talking about shit is easy
*  Right. Yeah gluing yourself to the wall. The museum is easy. That's right. That's right
*  And so yeah, and with this conflict, it's it's it's the same
*  I mean, I listened to Jared Kushner on Lexus podcast and I thought he was very good about talking about a positive way forward
*  It's probably why he was able to pull off the Abraham Accords, which was a big step in that region
*  Very very smart guy. Very smart guy. He's very nice to met him very friendly. Yeah, you see him on the
*  You see him on the
*  Media depictions of him during the Trump administration. It's like oh, it's Damien from the Omen. So it is
*  You've seen that compare them to Damien like there's a photo of him right next to Damien from the Omen
*  Do you know that the movie? No, no, no, I don't see it. It's the devil's baby. Oh, right
*  Yeah, lady gets pregnant by the devil right and Damien's the devil's baby Damien's a very bad boy
*  And Damien looks exactly like
*  Damien I was you find that Jamie I was very impressed with what he had to say. It's a brilliant guy
*  Yeah, yeah, and you can see why he was and his whole thing is like, what's the positive vision for the future?
*  How do we get everybody what they need to stop being angry and fighting and killing each other?
*  Yeah, but you can have as many fucking protest marches as you want. It's not gonna change anything
*  Yeah, and we saw that with Iraq. I protested against the war in Iraq. I was on the street
*  It does add to the confusion that young people are experiencing
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah so similar there's photos of there's like a side-by-side of him and Damien
*  There it is. There it is. The window there. Well, there's one down there that one the one to the left that right there
*  Look at that. I mean, come on son. I
*  Mean if you didn't know him you could eat that's why it's so insidious with the media is capable of doing man
*  So creepy that they do that and that they think that almost it's their obligation to do that, right?
*  You know
*  Well, this is what I was saying about disagreeing with people like I've heard from every single person that knows Tucker that he's a great guy
*  I still disagree with him on some things, but it doesn't mean he's not a great guy
*  Right, yeah, and and but what the media conversation is always about this person has the wrong opinion therefore
*  He's bad or she's bad. Yeah, and that's dumb
*  Someone can be really wrong and still be a really good person who's trying their best and they may learn from their mistakes over time
*  If they're doing things wrong, dude agreed agreed, you know, yeah, man, so it's a it's a crazy world, but we're here
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, we're having fun. I mean, we're very fortunate
*  We're very fortunate that this has come along during this time
*  But it's also part of the cause of this time
*  Yes
*  You know
*  but the fact that there is this newfound Avenue to be able to express things and just really just talk about whatever the fuck you
*  want and not be
*  confined by some organization
*  That's telling you what to talk about what you can't talk about and then censoring you if you disagree
*  Firing you
*  That's that is and that's what we need
*  We need more conversation and we need to start seeing people not as avatars who need to be destroyed
*  But actually as somebody else over the other side who has their own way of looking at things has arrived
*  At this point now you may think it's wrong. You may think it's stupid
*  You may think all of these things but it's still a human being they've still got this point and sit them down and go why?
*  Why is it because maybe here's the thing maybe?
*  By reaching your hand out you might be able not only to understand them a little bit better
*  You might actually be able to understand yourself a little bit better and by seeing the blind spots in them you go
*  What about my blind spots? Yeah, what about the thing where I have I don't actually I have an unconscious bias
*  I actually have a bias
*  Because of the way I was raised because of the way I was brought up because of what I seen growing up and maybe
*  Actually, even though they might be wrong about this thing
*  I kind of get why they're saying this and not only that
*  They might have a point about something else that I haven't thought about
*  And this is why the ethos of self-improvement is so important
*  And why it also gets attached to right-wing ideology
*  Because you're taking responsibility right and for some reason
*  Some people want to make the right the only place that's about personal responsibility. I don't think that's nice
*  That's ridiculous. It's crazy. You can exercise and be left-wing right-wing
*  Of course, you can take care of your family and be left-wing and people have always done that
*  I think that the people that aren't interested in that both on left-wing and the right-wing have the most problematic views
*  The people that have no interest in self-improvement both on the right and on the left. They're the people that are the biggest problems
*  Yeah, yeah, it's it's a people the worst people are the people are utterly entrenched in their views and they think to themselves
*  You know what? I've got everything right. I don't need to change. Why do I need to improve?
*  Why do I need to why don't I change the way I think because I am right? Yeah. Well great
*  So what you've actually done is
*  You've actually stunted your own growth
*  Emotionally physically spiritually, but the good thing is I think that becomes evident over time
*  I think those people become exposed and it becomes very clear what they're doing over time. Mm-hmm
*  Then go and I think we're going through that right now. Yeah, and I was tumultuous period
*  I think the economics of podcasting in new media is gonna is gonna make more daily wire style organizations
*  I think it's inevitable people are gonna come together under one umbrella or in partnership or somehow
*  Because it's like no one wants to give no one wants to subscribe to their favorite 50 sub stacks
*  You know, no one wants to listen to their favorite give five dollars a month to their favorite 30 podcasts, right?
*  It's just not gonna happen. You're gonna want to come to one place where you've got, you know
*  Barry's doing it with the free press. For example, she's bringing people together under her umbrella
*  That's a very good point because if you have like ten podcasts you like and it's ten bucks a month
*  Okay, now it's getting a little pricey and the admin alone is gonna kill you
*  Yeah, it's getting pricey and then it's also it's like you're gonna lose out on a lot of people that are interested in your
*  Stuff if you have to pay for it
*  But if you can get a bunch of really good ones all together, but then you got an organization
*  And before you know it new media will become old media. It will have the same corruption
*  It will have the same power structures
*  Hierarchy and power is prone to corruption as we know from our good friend. That's why I believe in organic networks
*  Yeah, so what I try to do with my friends with comedians
*  I instill this notion of we are we are on a network. It's an organic network
*  We know contracts with each other, but we're all friends and we all support each other
*  So we help each other so our reach is all grown together. It's all tied in together
*  You know, if you listen to your mom's house, you probably listen to Joey Diaz. You probably listen to me
*  There's like a whole group of us and you might like Duncan Moore or you might like Ari Moore whatever it is
*  but there's there's a whole group of people that are connected that are essentially on the
*  Equivalent of the podcast version of NBC, you know that transition was so good for us
*  But also so hard because coming from the UK comedy circuit where which is where we started
*  It's the exact opposite of that. What was in America to every man for himself
*  It was like a bucket and then when we started coming over here
*  It was like a whole new world was open to us and now we are bringing that back to the UK
*  We are helping people out. We are like, oh, here's a talented new writer. Let's give her an opportunity
*  He is a talented new guy doing YouTube
*  Let's bring him in and give him a boost and yeah
*  We are kind of using that to try and create a community of people who are working together
*  Not necessarily towards the same goal, but just just like people who are looking out for each other
*  Yes, and that's such a powerful transformation of the way you view the world because suddenly everyone's your friend
*  Yeah, then that's one of the best-bent things that came out of the whole internet revolution for comics
*  Is that we realized that we are not?
*  In competition but that we can would benefit from all the things that benefit you from being in competition with someone you can be inspired
*  You can be forced to work harder and really raise your levels
*  but more importantly we're in collaboration and and that we're a tribe and
*  that we all benefit from each other being around and it's beautiful when your friends do well and that that
*  philosophy was possible because the internet because before that we were all competing for the same amount of jobs on television right and
*  Late night talk shows whatever it was and once that went away
*  Then comedians became an asset because like if I could get Tom Segura on my podcast
*  We're gonna have a lot of fun
*  And then his podcast will grow and my podcast will grow and everybody be happy and that that helped us a lot
*  But it's also this
*  Mentality that we have at the Comedy Store that was different
*  It's like we were a tribe and we were supportive of each other even before the podcast thing
*  Where did that come from?
*  Was it you that kind of led that or was it someone else because it always comes from like someone being the inspiration doesn't it?
*  It was probably me because it came from martial arts because that's that's how I think about martial
*  You have to have training partners. You don't get good by yourself
*  You have to have training partners like the only way you get good at jujitsu
*  You have to do you have to roll with other people that are really good. You have to do it
*  You have to train together. You have to realize high levels the high levels around you and if you have a gym that has a specifically
*  Especially rather high level of jujitsu
*  You're gonna get a lot of high level people that come out of that gym and you'll see the difference when they go to a lower
*  Level gym. They're just way better just like you see a comic that works, you know at the cellar in New York
*  They go somewhere else like that's a high level comic
*  They're in they're in a high pressure high talent situation and it benefits everybody. So my my feelings
*  From martial arts. I just transferred over to comedy. I was like this is the best way to do it
*  I know it seems counterproductive you think like we're all fuck him
*  I'm the man like get rid of that get rid of that like everybody can be good together
*  And when someone's good
*  It actually feels good to tell people that person's good and blow them up and help them if you can help
*  You know get some shine on get some light on someone who's really talented
*  It's good for the art form
*  Which is the whole reason why we got into it in the first place and the more people that do it the higher the level's
*  Gonna get you're gonna get more people that rise to the top
*  More competition more creativity more influence more excitement more inspiration
*  It's good for everybody and it's good for you as well
*  Yes, because it's when you have that mindset of no, this is my thing. You're not gonna touch my thing
*  You know, it's a gross mindset
*  It's a gross mindset and what gross mindsets do is they corrupt the individual and this is what people don't talk about enough
*  If you have got a terrible mindset, okay
*  It's bad for everybody around you and of course that's important but the person it's worse for it's you
*  Yes, it's cancerous
*  So if you have this mindset of I'm not gonna help anybody because what about me?
*  You know what you're gonna end up on your own and you're gonna end up being deeply deeply miserable bitter and resentful here here
*  Yeah, you know I asked Jordan about this because his whole crew is like
*  It's it's everyone works together. It's a team game
*  We're all pulling in the same direction and I said to him how did you like and he goes I realized very early on
*  The right amount of drama to have on a tour is zero
*  Zero drama. Yeah, if you're a drama guy
*  You don't you're not gonna work here. Yeah. Well, you know, and it's not an angry thing. It's a practical thing
*  We're all working towards the same thing. I'm trying to make you better. You're trying to make me better
*  I mean the guy literally invited someone over from another country to argue with him on stage in front of his own audience
*  Mm-hmm, and it works. Yeah, and that's what high quality leadership looks like and what you're talking about what Jordan's talking about
*  It's and coming here man and talking to people like you and others
*  It's been just revolutionary for us in the way we think about everything. That's beautiful. That's not that mindset is
*  Everything yeah, it is and it's good free. Like you said it's good for you, too. Yeah, it's good for everybody
*  It's good for me. It's it's important for me when people I got benefit when people do well, it really it really does
*  It helps me. Yeah, yeah because it challenges you and that's what I love about the Austin comedy scene
*  Is that when you come here people are so much more open, you know
*  You don't get that in a lot of other comedy scenes where people are, you know, they you know people it's you know
*  People do help each other. Of course they do but there's still this crabs in a bucket mentality
*  Whereas you come here and people are just far more open. They go come and do ten minutes at my club. Come here
*  Oh, you're great. Come and do this come and do that
*  That collaborative process is how everybody wins. Yeah, it's how everybody gets better
*  It's how we all become better at what we want to do
*  Because the reality is if you're denying someone the chance for them to flower and flourish
*  You're denying something of yourself as well
*  Because later on that person will be like
*  That guy helped me. Yeah, you know, hey, why don't you come and do this thing?
*  You know, do you remember you did this for me? Well, what but and then bam and then you've both won and then you've both
*  Created things something. Yeah, and it's just a positivity
*  Which is why I love coming here
*  I love coming here because there's a
*  positivity here that there's a can-do attitude of we can go out and we can do this and we're gonna work together and we're gonna
*  Collaborate and we're gonna change things and we're gonna improve I come here and I just feel so much more creatively energized. I
*  All of these past like 10 days I've been in Austin most the time apart from going out and meeting people
*  I just spend all my day writing
*  I spent all my day writing because I'm going oh
*  I've got all these gigs so I can test it out on and I feel energized and I feel creative and I know that I
*  Can do this and yet I know if I fail like I did it, you know one particular gig
*  For Hans Kim bless him. I did too much new it didn't go
*  Well, I came out going oh, I know that I'm not gonna get limited because I didn't do well at that gig
*  But I came away knowing that
*  I've got so much to improve and I know how to improve it and then I went and did another gig and it was great
*  Yeah, you got to be able to take chances
*  that's it's a very important thing and people have to know what what you're capable of and
*  When you're starting off with new stuff or you're trying new stuff out some of it goes terrible
*  It's just part of the process and everyone here knows that they get it
*  I mean we we had the the benefit of not being attached to Hollywood too, right?
*  That was one of the best things like New York is not really attached to Hollywood either
*  But there's still like the Hollywood adjacent, you know, you can get gigs and there's obviously, you know
*  There's talk shows that are there still Letterman was always there. But with California you're just so
*  Infected by the the Hollywood bullshit and here that's none. It's non-existent
*  So you you get to exist in a purely
*  Creative environment in that the comedians are just trying to be better at comedy
*  That's it
*  This thing not just try to audition for a television show try to be better at comedy, bro
*  When I went to LA for the first time I spent three days there and I told you I'm not a religious person
*  After three days I got on the plane and I was like these people need God Satan. Yeah, fuck me
*  gentlemen death to America
*  All right, appreciate you guys very much trigonometry available everywhere and then you have there's a sub stack
*  So how does it work the the subtext?
*  It's just constant and kissing sub stack head there read read the shit. All right, and do you guys have?
*  Some of your episodes are available behind a subscription wall
*  Is that how it is?
*  so what we do is we do usually about 20 minutes to half an hour bonus content with
*  Questions from our audience for the guest and that goes behind a paywall. Oh, that's cool. And there's some pretty cool stuff there
*  That's a good way to do it questions from the audience. Yes, that's smart
*  Oh, yeah
*  We tell people who's coming on in advance and then they send in a bunch of questions and we're like what's most up voted?
*  What's the most interesting? What's the funniest and we do that and it goes on our locals is 20 30 minutes extra content for you
*  I guess beautiful. It's pretty cool. And the interesting thing is you look at the questions you go down some of them are better than mine
*  Got a crowd source. Yeah, thank you gentlemen. Really appreciate you. It's a lot of fun. Thank you. All right. Bye everybody
