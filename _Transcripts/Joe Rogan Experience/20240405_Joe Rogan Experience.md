# Joe Rogan Experience #2131 - Brian Simpson
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [April 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wpcJHkczBQ)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Let's go.
*  Netflix special, what's up?
*  Netflix special live from the mothership streaming on Netflix right now.
*  The first special live from the mothership to be streamed on Netflix.
*  Yeah, man.
*  How's that?
*  It's exciting, man.
*  It's great, too, man.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  You nailed it.
*  It's got a good positive response from the comedy community.
*  Beautiful.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Beautiful.
*  Everybody's loving it.
*  Yeah, it's just gonna keep going.
*  Keep getting stronger now.
*  I know.
*  It's such a nice feeling, man.
*  It's so nice to watch this happen for you because you were one of the guys that came
*  out here early.
*  You took an early risk.
*  Yeah.
*  A lot of people in the beginning were like, what the fuck is everybody doing moving to
*  Texas in the middle of the pandemic?
*  Yeah, but honestly, it didn't feel like that big of a risk.
*  Well, maybe at the time.
*  I don't remember, man, but it felt like an easy decision when I made it.
*  But it was a last minute thing.
*  I literally, from the time I decided to move, like I was moving to the time I moved, I think
*  it was like a month.
*  Yeah, it was quick for me, too, man.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I came out here in May of 2020 and I started looking at houses immediately.
*  And then, you know, we got, there was like, you know, a little hesitation with Mrs. Rogan
*  and the girls were really into it right away because when we got out here, you could jump
*  in the lake.
*  People were partying.
*  It was like we went on a boat.
*  My real estate agent's a genius.
*  She took us out on the lake and she showed us like, this is the life out here.
*  Like, people are having fun and everybody was terrified in LA.
*  Everybody was wearing masks outside.
*  It was just inherently, no one had masks on outside.
*  You go to restaurants and my daughters just wanted a life, a real life.
*  And that's back when they were like, they were fucking with the store.
*  Yeah, bad.
*  Like, the city, it was so crazy for the store to be two blocks from, what's that country
*  bar?
*  Road, what is it, Roadhouse?
*  Saddle Ranch.
*  Saddle Ranch.
*  It was two blocks from Saddle Ranch.
*  And Saddle Ranch had, you know, a hundred people out there with little dividers between
*  them and everything.
*  And then the store, they tried to have, they tried to do the same thing, but they put comedy
*  outside with like dividers in front of everybody and everything.
*  And the city was still like, no, that's live performance.
*  Shut it down.
*  We couldn't do comedy through the fucking window.
*  My friend's brother worked for the city and worked in the COVID department.
*  And one of the women who was in charge of making the decision to close down outdoor
*  dining, he said to her, there's no evidence that outdoor dining causes a spread.
*  And she said, yeah, but it's about optics.
*  It's about optics.
*  So some person who none of their money is dependent upon business being open, they get
*  that same check every week.
*  That check is that's what you get.
*  You work for the fucking state.
*  This is my check.
*  She didn't give a fuck about just stopping millions and millions of dollars in business
*  and stopping all these restaurants from being able to stay alive.
*  All these people that, you know, you ever worked in a restaurant?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  That's work, man.
*  That's work.
*  When I was, I guess I was 21, I was dating this girl who she got a degree in hotel
*  management and hospitality, like that kind of thing.
*  And dude, the hours that she had to work were crazy.
*  Right out of college, she was working like all day long, 12 hour days were normal.
*  And if you were a manager, you'd come in on Saturday if they needed you.
*  You do everything that they ask you to do and you don't make any money.
*  It's so cruel.
*  The amount of money that a restaurant makes, like a restaurant has to be like really
*  killing it to make money.
*  Generally, they're just above the just above the part where they're losing money.
*  Just above. They do pretty if they're packed, they're doing great.
*  But there's nights that they're not packed and you got all this food you bought.
*  That's how most comedy clubs are.
*  Exactly. Yeah, we're just we're living in some dreamland.
*  Yeah. Well, yeah, mother doesn't have to worry about that at all.
*  We don't know how that happened so well.
*  It's crazy how it happened so well.
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Every single night.
*  We could have never like when we were we use Brian and I for people don't know.
*  We would sit in the green room of the Vulcan.
*  And this was the dark days where like no one knew what was going to happen
*  with live performance anywhere.
*  There was no touring. Nobody was touring.
*  Well, Bert was touring still.
*  He was doing parking lots.
*  We're doing those drive in shows.
*  He's a savage. He's the only one.
*  Actually, no. Eliza did it. Yeah.
*  Him and Eliza. Right.
*  Um, a few other people did it, too.
*  I don't know. But Bert invented the drive in thing.
*  But the point is.
*  It was weird.
*  We didn't know what was going to happen.
*  And then we would be talking about we got to build a club
*  because Ron White literally grabbed me by my shoulders.
*  You know, it's like whatever the fuck we have to do.
*  We're opening up a fucking club here.
*  He was we're going to fucking keep doing this.
*  I was like, OK, we got to keep doing this.
*  It was literally Ron White grabbing me in November of 2020.
*  It was the first time he had been on stage and he crushed.
*  Not only did he crush the ovation that he got
*  when he was walking to that stage. Holy shit.
*  I forget who brought him up.
*  I think it was Duncan.
*  I forget who brought him up.
*  But whoever brought him up, the fucking ovation that he got was so insane.
*  You saved him, too, because he went from retiring to now he's on the road again.
*  Yeah, I was telling him, you're never retiring.
*  What are you talking about?
*  They invited me to his retirement party.
*  I go, I'm not going to your Fagazi retirement party.
*  There's no way that's real.
*  You're not quitting. You're one of the best comics alive.
*  You get to do one of the most amazing things, make people happy,
*  make a bunch of people just laugh and feel so good.
*  And he's and he's better than ever.
*  Better than ever.
*  Better than ever.
*  Sharper than ever.
*  Always writing and enthusiastic like he's revived.
*  Yeah, I think dudes get to a certain age where they have this thing in their head
*  where, oh, this is not my thing anymore.
*  I'm going to just like settle. Why?
*  Are you alive?
*  Are you alive? Can you still kill?
*  You can still do it, right?
*  George Carlin died on the road, son.
*  He died in a hotel room like a fucking soldier.
*  That's true.
*  It was like a thousand years old.
*  Whining about the country.
*  You know, and George Carlin had a career that lasted for like 50 plus years.
*  Yeah. And the Bob Saget died on the road.
*  Bob Saget died tragically.
*  That's a horrible one, man.
*  Fell, blacked out, fell and hit his head.
*  You know, we saw our friend Duncan the other night blackout.
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
*  Duncan fainted at the Black Keys concert,
*  and he didn't know he was fainting.
*  He didn't know what was going on.
*  And I caught it. Red Band grabbed me.
*  And he goes, look, what's going on over here with Duncan?
*  And I got over to it.
*  And our security guy had caught him before he fell.
*  But I thought he tripped over this box because there was like open,
*  you know, those boxes they use for equipment.
*  There was because we were backstage.
*  We were in the corner. We had this dope spot to watch the show.
*  And when he grabbed him, when Bruce grabbed him,
*  Duncan just seemed weird.
*  It's I grabbed my mic. OK, did you get hurt?
*  He goes, no, I go, did that thing fall on you?
*  And Bruce, I know he fell on it.
*  And I go, what happened?
*  He goes, I don't know. I'm fine, though.
*  I'm fine. But then I feel his body like giving out in my hands.
*  So I've got my hands on him because I was helping him out.
*  But I feel him giving out.
*  And so I go, hey, man, you OK? Are you OK?
*  And so he starts like slumping, you know, and I go, hey, we're going to get
*  let's sit you down. Let's sit you down.
*  And we're trying to figure out what's going on.
*  And, you know, he was sober.
*  It wasn't a drug. It wasn't anything like that.
*  And we sit him down. I go, you all right?
*  He goes, yeah, so weird, man.
*  It just felt so weird.
*  I just all of a sudden I just like I just was passing out.
*  And he goes out again.
*  He just goes out again right there.
*  And I grab him. I go, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
*  And then they get EMTs and then this lady comes to take care of him.
*  This dude comes and we carry him over to a cot.
*  I think he was locking out his knees.
*  I don't know what it was.
*  So, you know, what was weird is that we haven't talked about this since that happened.
*  Yeah. Well, I talked about it with him.
*  Yeah, he doesn't.
*  I don't know if he knows we're going to talk about it on the party.
*  Oh, yeah, he probably doesn't want us to talk about it.
*  You think so?
*  I don't know. Should we not talk about it?
*  I don't know.
*  He's put up with a put a placeholder in there.
*  Yeah. OK.
*  How did I get to that point, though?
*  We talk about drugs.
*  No, talking about blacking out.
*  Oh, Bob Saget. Oh, Bob Saget.
*  So Bob Saget just fainted, which fucking happens, man.
*  I mean, you could there's a lot of people that want to blame it on the vaccine
*  and blame it on this and that.
*  Like, might maybe.
*  But also people faint, unfortunately.
*  It's I've seen people faint stone cold sober.
*  Tony Hitchcliffe fainted one night at the comic store so bad he banged his head.
*  And everybody is really worried about him.
*  Just fainted. You know, it happens.
*  I fainted in boot camp. Oh, shit.
*  Yeah. Right after them telling us not to lock out our legs.
*  I wasn't listening.
*  Oh, locked up my leg.
*  Walk up like everybody's over you.
*  It's like time travel.
*  Why? You were explaining this to me, but it didn't make any sense to me.
*  The locking out the legs thing.
*  Yeah. For whatever reason, like if you're standing still for a long period of time
*  and you and you fully extend your knees, it just it cuts off circulation.
*  Or something. But yeah, I've seen people drop like flies.
*  Like if you ever had a parade or something, you see people drop like that.
*  But it's just what a dumb feature in human beings.
*  The medical name is orthostatic posture.
*  See, sin cope happens at churches, graduations, weddings
*  or at events when standing a long time.
*  More common if one keeps the knees locked.
*  This pulls the blood in the leg veins.
*  A person who stands long enough in one place will faint.
*  Holy shit. Yeah, I thought that was a myth.
*  Ma, I seen it happen a lot. That's crazy.
*  Multiple people. I would argue with that to the end of time.
*  I was like, no, no, I'm not fainting.
*  If I lock my legs up, I'm not fainting.
*  I am not. I think there are some people don't like.
*  I think if you have like really good circulation.
*  I blacked out once and it was so embarrassing.
*  Was it from just standing? No, I was in a F.A.
*  18 going six and a half G's.
*  Well, that's kind of a humble brag.
*  Well, no, no, no, because I got through more G's.
*  I got through seven and a half G's.
*  We did seven and a half and I was I was on the verge of blacking out.
*  And first of all, these pilots, these pilots, they're not using gravity suits.
*  And those Air Force and Navy pilots that fly those jets, those guys are jacked.
*  They have to be really fit because part of the thing is forcing blood into your brain.
*  So while you're like while you're steering this fucking insane vehicle,
*  dude, when you're in one of those things and you realize what they can do.
*  And he took me for a ride.
*  We went through the mountains.
*  He's going, yeah, yeah.
*  I mean, we're only like 100, 200 feet off the ground.
*  This fucking dude is expertly piloting piloting this thing to trenches and shit.
*  It was wild. It was terrifying.
*  But then he was explaining to me, OK, you know, they take you
*  through this whole training course with the Blue Angels.
*  And then he's explained to me, OK,
*  now, when you hit that the high G's, you've got to grab onto your straps
*  like where your legs are and they grab onto their the the joystick.
*  But whatever you're grabbing onto, you grab onto and you think do a thing called hooking.
*  So you go like this.
*  What? What? What? What? What?
*  And you're forcing blood into your head to stay conscious.
*  And then the gravity, the G force is pushing down on your
*  and your consciousness is like elevator doors.
*  And you go like, what? What? What? What?
*  So I'm doing this and I hear him doing it.
*  And I'm like, oh, my God, he's experienced what I'm experiencing, too.
*  And flying. And he's a pilot.
*  I thought he's maybe immune to it by now. Right.
*  No, he's going, what? What? What?
*  And I'm going, oh, my God, this is insane.
*  Just the physical demands that it takes to fly one of those things like.
*  You have a car that handles well.
*  You have a nice car.
*  When you take turns in that car, you know how your body kind of goes sideways
*  a little bit, correct a little if you're really going fast.
*  I mean, they're really they handle so flat, but you feel the G's.
*  You feel the thing when you turn.
*  Imagine that times.
*  I don't know what the volume is.
*  But when this thing is going, what is it?
*  Five hundred miles an hour, 200 feet off the ground.
*  Is it pushing from everywhere?
*  But I don't know.
*  It's just so immense.
*  The pressure is so immense.
*  So I got through that.
*  And then we did this other turn that was not as many G's.
*  I want four and a half or something like that.
*  It wasn't nearly as many, but I didn't hook.
*  I didn't do the thing.
*  I thought I was going to be fine.
*  And I just blacked out, threw up.
*  Oh, man.
*  So I got through the harder part.
*  I got through the harder part and I just fucking slacked off.
*  I think I was so blown away by the experience, so blown away
*  by what these things, what it feels like when you're inside one of those things
*  and what they're capable of doing.
*  It was it's so mind blowing.
*  So what it so it changes your idea of like what a thing can do.
*  You know how like, look, if you're in your car, like especially like your car,
*  your car is fast, it handles well.
*  When you're in your car, you have a completely different sense
*  of what a car can do than if you're in like a 1970 pickup
*  truck with a shitty six cylinder engine and fucking, you know,
*  your car is going to.
*  It's gone.
*  Now, when you get a Tesla, it's that times five because Teslas are insane.
*  They don't make any noise and they go zero to 60 in one point nine seconds.
*  So it's just like this.
*  The car disappears.
*  Now that times hundreds is what this jet's doing.
*  It's so fucking fast.
*  And did you tell them to put a little extra on?
*  No, I said, let's go, brother, let's go.
*  He was like, you ready to do this?
*  I'm like, let's fucking do this.
*  I was in. I was in.
*  I was like, this is what these guys do.
*  I want to experience it.
*  Take me for the real ride.
*  And is a ride, dude.
*  It's a it's a changes your your reference points.
*  Imagine the fucking ego you have to have to be to be that kind of pilot.
*  Well, they're all men.
*  These are men. Men.
*  These are like jacked men who are like real friendly and super polite.
*  And they always drink their water and they always get their pull ups in.
*  These guys are men and they have a full gym set up there.
*  These guys are in shape constantly.
*  You do not get out of shape if you're doing that.
*  You cannot get out of shape.
*  It's too hard, bro.
*  It's bananas. How hard it is.
*  You miss one hook. You did.
*  You're dead.
*  And you are going to have to eject and you're going to give up
*  that you crashed a one billion dollar jet or whatever the fuck those things cost.
*  Didn't somebody crash recently?
*  There's a couple of crashes.
*  There was one where a guy had to eject like it lost power or something like that.
*  So he ejects and it slams into the mountains of North Carolina.
*  It was crazy.
*  Yeah, just ran out of gas and slammed in the mountains.
*  The guy parachuted down, I believe, in that one.
*  Well, there was another one more recent before that rather.
*  Not as not as recent where there was like this crazy fiery crash.
*  And like they were doing tests and the guy lost control of the jet.
*  Bro, you could lose control.
*  One of those things, dude, I'm telling you, when you're in it,
*  it's not what I thought.
*  I thought you like, hey, just fucking spirit.
*  No, it's the physical force on your body.
*  It's insane.
*  Insane. It's no way I would do it for a living.
*  That's why the UFO shit is so perplexing.
*  Because whatever those things are, if they're ours, nobody's in them.
*  No fucking chance. No chance.
*  Nobody's in those things because you would be turned into jello like that.
*  From going from changing direction so quickly.
*  What they're doing is moving.
*  What was it like that they estimated the tic tac to go?
*  I think it was 13000 G's.
*  Something insane where it moves so fast because it went from
*  supposedly went from above our atmosphere, which is like above
*  50000 feet down to like 50 feet in a second.
*  And didn't crash.
*  Not only didn't crash, stopped dead and hovered.
*  They're like, what what can do that?
*  And what happens to the people that are in that?
*  You're gone, bro. You're missed.
*  You're pink mist.
*  You're like those people in that submarine.
*  You just splat.
*  Well, I just speaking of that shit, I just watched.
*  I just watched a YouTube video about another fucking incident.
*  What's the name of it? Boeing?
*  No, it wasn't Boeing.
*  This was a long time ago.
*  It was this was a mining, a mining rig
*  where the guys, all the guys got all the guys got sucked through a door.
*  Oh, like a door was a door was cracked.
*  And actually only one guy died that way.
*  But because that door got cracked, it killed everybody inside.
*  Oh, my God.
*  You know, like that deep sea, especially when it was new, that deep sea,
*  like mining shit, because you have to those guys have to live.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Sucked into an oil pipe.
*  Oh, my God.
*  No, this is this isn't it.
*  But still, but Jesus Christ sucked in an oil pipe.
*  Yeah. Some of these people because they would they would.
*  What the fuck?
*  Did you see that one with that sinkhole opened up in the bottom of a pool?
*  Of a swimming pool? Yeah.
*  The whole pool drained and people got sucked into the sinkhole and died.
*  What the fuck? Yeah.
*  Where did this happen? I don't know.
*  Israel. Oh, bro.
*  Sinkholes are crazy.
*  I mean, sinkholes are crazy and they're everywhere.
*  Some of them.
*  The weird thing is some of them, they look like
*  they look like someone cored the earth like they're circular.
*  So look at this.
*  It just a hole opens in the bottom of the fucking pool and starts spreading.
*  Oh, did people go? Yeah, people went in there, man.
*  But that shit is deep.
*  Oh, yeah. You go.
*  Look at this. How crazy must that feel to see the thing just implode in the bottom
*  and a hole open up like a curse was put on the pool?
*  And what is my man doing right?
*  No one knows what the fuck to do, man.
*  But that dude is he's like he's going to reach in there and grab something.
*  Because he's trying to think where his family is.
*  Oh, well, you know, they don't got people got fall.
*  I mean, how deep is that fucking thing?
*  If you get sucked into that with all that water.
*  Yeah, you go.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Like, I'm terrified.
*  The thing is, there's no way that it's smooth.
*  And you probably know you're dead on the way down.
*  You get on the way down.
*  You did right. Face bashed in.
*  Look at those edges and shit.
*  Yeah. Did you see that one with that hole opened up?
*  That's my biggest fear.
*  I don't want to die in a in a like where I can't move.
*  What do you call it with rocks crushing your head?
*  Drowning just any kind of closed space where they just take my space.
*  Yeah. Well, I just the claustrophobia.
*  I just told the CIA how to torture me.
*  They already know how to torture you.
*  Taking all this.
*  They just checked your Twitter and ran through an algorithm.
*  They know how to torture you.
*  What what was that one, Jamie, where a hole opened up that was so big?
*  It was like it was it was circular.
*  It looked fake.
*  We had we had a confirmed that it was real, even though it looked like really
*  bizarrely fake. It looks so fake.
*  It looks like CGI.
*  What is it? We're going to pull it up.
*  You're right.
*  Yeah.
*  Give me a second.
*  OK, you know what it is, right?
*  That's a terrifying way to go, though.
*  The earth just gives out from under you.
*  Yeah. And I will give up immediately.
*  I went to Pompeii when I was in Italy and that's a wild one, dude.
*  So it's still there.
*  Yeah. Yeah. You can go there.
*  I know they let you let people walk through it.
*  Oh, yeah, you can walk through it.
*  Yeah. It's like a museum.
*  They can go. You could see where these people lived.
*  They've uncovered most of it.
*  They uncover people and they have the people on display and the people are just like stone.
*  They just got impregnated with ash and all that's left is like their form.
*  But why why why go into that pose like right when you because it just overcame them like a wave.
*  Like, you know, you don't understand what a volcano eruption is like.
*  Yeah. Ice cubes. The only reason I know where pyroclastic flow is.
*  What is that? What a great layer of ice.
*  What is that? What a great lyric.
*  I know. Right. Ice cubes got some great fucking lyrics.
*  That's it. Look at that. That's a real sinkhole, bro.
*  Wow. How insane is that?
*  It looks like someone took an apple core to the earth.
*  Look, look how smooth it is.
*  It seems like the sort of thing they should be able to predict.
*  No, they can't, though, man, because there's underwater currents and streams and rivers.
*  We can't keep an accurate assessment of exactly what's going on under the surface and what kind of erosion is taking place
*  and what kind of cavities are everywhere.
*  But that's that's like a gateway to hell.
*  So apparently and I might like a movie.
*  I'll be off about this. But apparently everything behaves like a liquid.
*  Like, well, hold on.
*  It says it's created by humans.
*  I've got to figure out a way to get past.
*  OK, sign up for it if you have to.
*  Yeah, it was like everything behaves like a liquid, just almost like solids.
*  Just do it on a slower scale.
*  Like all the little fundamental parts of it are moving like liquid.
*  You know how you know that earthquakes. You've been in an earthquake.
*  Oh, yeah. It feels like the earth became like you're on a raft.
*  That's another part of reason why I left California.
*  It's like everyone was living there acting like that shit wasn't on the way.
*  You know, I mean, like that shit's overdue, bro.
*  And it's going to fuck shit up.
*  It's going to fuck shit up in an incomprehensible way.
*  I got to L.A. in 94 and it was right after the earthquake.
*  And I got to see giant sections of the highway that had collapsed on top of cars.
*  You could see it.
*  It was all the highways were collapsed right in front of you.
*  You could see where they collapsed.
*  And I was like, I am never going that way.
*  Whatever needs to be done that way, I'm going all the way the fuck around.
*  I am not going to be on the bottom of that thing.
*  I don't even want to be on the top and ride it out.
*  I think you'll die that way, too.
*  But the people on the bottom are dead as fuck.
*  They're definitely gone.
*  Diggity dead as fuck.
*  That's a terrible way to die.
*  Or to be in some building that collapses on top.
*  Some of the bridges would fall off and people would just drop.
*  You see the cars just drop.
*  But it's what happened in Baltimore.
*  Bro, oh yeah.
*  Yeah, fuck that.
*  Fuck that.
*  Fuck, fuck that.
*  In a place where there's earthquakes.
*  Fuck that.
*  And how about, bro, that's Taiwan, right?
*  Taiwan just had a big ass earthquake, 7.5.
*  When did that happen?
*  Just now.
*  Just like a couple days ago.
*  Wow.
*  Look at that.
*  Look at that building, man.
*  I mean, the fact that it's even still up is kind of crazy.
*  And bro, what kind of building goes they got in Taiwan?
*  Wow.
*  Damn, all these buildings fucking stood to.
*  Yeah, a lot of buildings stood.
*  But a lot of buildings didn't.
*  See, the whole thing with buildings,
*  if you make a building in California,
*  you have earthquake regulations.
*  You have to make your building sturdy in a way that's supposed
*  to be able to tolerate at least a little bit of an earthquake.
*  Yeah, but who's the say?
*  But how do they know you didn't until everybody did?
*  I had a problem with a house I had once.
*  And the contractors had cut corners all over the place.
*  We didn't realize it until we moved in.
*  And then it became a real problem, real pain in the ass.
*  And I was like, who the fuck?
*  How can somebody on the take?
*  How can somebody not catch all this stuff?
*  But it's just they don't.
*  They just don't have the time.
*  The regulators don't have the time.
*  There's not enough money to go and check everybody.
*  And that's why when people say you don't need regulation
*  with construction, I'm like, listen, bitch, you need that shit.
*  Those dudes are shady.
*  If you don't, it's a countdown to a building fall.
*  I should be real clear.
*  I know some great guys that are contractors.
*  I know some awesome people that build houses and build buildings.
*  And they're great people.
*  And they're super ethical.
*  But I've also met so many shady ones.
*  I don't know any good ones.
*  They're all numb.
*  No, I think it's like three out of 10 are shady.
*  That's what I think.
*  At least somewhat shady.
*  And it's just fucking, it's a hard world to navigate
*  if you don't know somebody.
*  If you know a guy and he can tell you,
*  I got a fucking great contractor, he's an awesome guy.
*  You'll love him.
*  And you're like, woo, OK, now I'm in business with someone
*  I really like to see.
*  I like that.
*  I mean, well, it's a business where the only way for you
*  to make more money is to fuck over your customer.
*  To make more money than you're supposed to.
*  Right.
*  After you've already agreed on the money,
*  the only other way for you to make more money,
*  you're not getting tipped at the end.
*  I know.
*  It's almost like there's a fine line between someone who
*  charges too much, but they do an amazing job.
*  I'd rather deal with that person.
*  I'd rather deal with that person as well.
*  Yeah.
*  I want them to be compensated for their work.
*  And I want them to feel proud of what they do.
*  I have a friend who's a carpenter.
*  And he'll talk about buildings.
*  He'll show me pictures and shit.
*  It's like, this is a beautiful house that this guy created.
*  And it's like for him, it's like a bit that killed.
*  Yeah, it's like a bit.
*  It's like, look at this house we made for this guy.
*  And he's showing me the pictures.
*  I'm like, man, that's incredible.
*  You know what the problem too is?
*  Is when you're, especially when you talk about hiring people
*  to build a house for you, they know how much money
*  you're working with.
*  So they know they can squeeze you here, squeeze you there.
*  Yeah, they definitely, in some cases, they do.
*  They know what they can get away with and what they can't.
*  Oh yeah.
*  It's the rich.
*  When people think you rich, they always charge extra.
*  Some people do, but some people don't.
*  And the people that don't, you really appreciate.
*  Some people give you free stuff.
*  Yeah, but there are definitely people
*  that try to take advantage of you.
*  And it's kind of gross.
*  It's like, come on, man.
*  Yeah, but I think people don't know better.
*  They've got to know better.
*  They just, there's a weird, that's a weird,
*  if you're charging someone more because you think
*  the person is more successful, you're
*  doing this weird thing like they owe you more.
*  Like, they don't care.
*  Like, this is like, come on.
*  We're just supposed to be people.
*  Like, do you have a charge for your goods and services?
*  You know what it is?
*  That's like people that think you owe them your privacy.
*  Don't run into your family at Disneyland.
*  Right.
*  Hey man, I don't mean to interrupt,
*  but you're interrupting.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm with my kids.
*  I get how people just think this is their one chance to say hi.
*  That's what it is.
*  That's what it is.
*  Like, Brian Simpson, oh shit.
*  It's their one chance.
*  And I get it.
*  It's just like, sometimes you can't do it.
*  But it's like when you see, it's almost
*  like when you see Indiana Jones sitting there with the bag
*  trying to swap it out real quick.
*  You can just leave it there.
*  Yeah.
*  Indiana.
*  Get the fuck out of there.
*  Yeah, but I get it.
*  You're a professor.
*  It's a lot of pressure of like, but this is my last chance
*  to fucking fuck those rules.
*  Yeah, I get that.
*  But you know, it's a price that you pay.
*  Price of fame?
*  Yeah, it's a weird life.
*  It's a price you pay.
*  What a great life, though.
*  Well, listen, we are the luckiest people alive.
*  We get to do what we love to do.
*  And it's fun.
*  And we get to hang out with each other.
*  I laugh so much in the mothership green room.
*  It really is like, it's the place I laugh the most.
*  Me too.
*  Me too.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, it's crazy, especially after sets.
*  You know, before sets.
*  Between shows, between the late show and the late show
*  is the best time.
*  Yeah, because we're primed.
*  We've already gotten off stage.
*  Especially if Tony's had a good set.
*  Yeah.
*  He gets the ball rolling.
*  Yeah, if he's not upset at anybody.
*  Can you fucking believe this?
*  He is a firebrand.
*  Let me tell you.
*  Bro, him and Lucas are endless.
*  When him and Lucas start roasting each other, it's endless.
*  It's endless.
*  They never run out of shit to talk about.
*  I thought David Lucas has proven to me
*  that there's literally infinite ways to call someone gay.
*  I don't think he's ever going to get to the last one.
*  He just finds different references.
*  Different references.
*  Yeah, it's just the two of them just laughing and going
*  at each other.
*  I swear to God, when I'm a guest on Kill Tony
*  and David and Tony are roasting each other,
*  it's harder than I ever laugh.
*  Anything.
*  Because it's in the moment.
*  And I know they're slinging.
*  They're shooting from the hip.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Just using their brain.
*  And killing each other.
*  And sometimes we get a little private one in the brain room.
*  Yes, we get those all the time.
*  We got that last night.
*  But it's just the reaction.
*  It's so fun, man.
*  Fuck.
*  We're so lucky that Kill Tony's here, too.
*  That show is so important.
*  It's so important just to let people know
*  it's just about being funny.
*  I know there's all this other stuff that gets wrapped up
*  into it because you're trying to establish your identity.
*  And you're trying to let people know how you feel about things.
*  And you want to make sure everybody knows
*  you're on the right side.
*  But really, what you should be doing is just doing comedy.
*  Do comedy.
*  And if you figure out a way to make your points hilarious,
*  great.
*  Yeah, make all the points in the world.
*  But they've got to be funny.
*  And when you do Kill Tony, you have one minute.
*  You have one minute.
*  And it sort of establishes an ideal in these young comics
*  minds that, hey, it's really just
*  about making these people laugh.
*  And if I can get good enough where I can make my ideas funny
*  and I can make these people laugh with ideas,
*  that's like what you do.
*  That's like black belt shit.
*  It kills me that because the amount of balls it takes for,
*  the amount of people that go and kill Tony,
*  and it's their first time doing comedy ever,
*  I'm like, bro, that's a hell of a way
*  to do your first open mic is in front of millions of people.
*  Yeah, that's a crazy way to do an open mic.
*  It doesn't make any sense.
*  But if you can do it, wow, what a feeling that must be.
*  And we've seen people do it.
*  We've seen people change their lives.
*  Yeah, if you nail it.
*  Bro, William Montgomery is killing it on the road
*  right now.
*  He's killing it.
*  He's selling out.
*  He's doing a whole hour.
*  We mean, we saw him when Hans is killing it.
*  We saw William when he had to have notes on stage.
*  And remember, we kept telling him,
*  you can't have notes on stage.
*  You can't hold your notes and read them.
*  And some people would say, no, that's a part of his act.
*  They go, no, it's holding him back.
*  Because on Kill Tony, he doesn't have the notes.
*  He comes out and stares the audience down.
*  And he's dangerous.
*  And he's weird.
*  I'm like, that's you when you're at your best.
*  He said, I'm worried I'm going to forget my jokes.
*  You're not going to forget your jokes.
*  You do them every night.
*  You're a professional comedian.
*  This is part of the thing you have to learn.
*  You can't race in Le Mans with training wheels on.
*  You can't.
*  He's been on a fucking tear lately.
*  He's killing it.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, when the Black Keys came into town,
*  there's huge William Montgomery fans.
*  And that's what's so crazy.
*  So he got a shout out at a post fight interview.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah, Dustin Poirier.
*  Then the Black Keys are huge William fans.
*  Yeah, he did our show that night specifically
*  because they requested him.
*  Oh, wow.
*  The show is full.
*  But I was like, yeah, let's go.
*  They need to see this.
*  Everybody loves that motherfucker.
*  He's awesome.
*  He's awesome.
*  And he's so unique.
*  There's only one William Montgomery.
*  That's a unique dude.
*  He's so busy, I never really see him.
*  Every time he hugs me, I'm worried he's going to stab me.
*  He gives you the weirdest hugs.
*  They're a hug like he's thinking about stabbing you.
*  Yeah.
*  I think he's like, you know how apes don't have medium
*  twitch muscle fibers?
*  I think he missing.
*  So they can't hug.
*  They either can do it as gentle as possible or full.
*  Or crush.
*  Or full strength.
*  He's got like eight shoulders.
*  Maybe he's primitive.
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe he doesn't have the ability to give you
*  a nice, warm, embracing hug.
*  It's either smash or gently touch.
*  He hugs you like he about to suplex you.
*  Yeah, like we're going to scuffle.
*  But he does it to everybody.
*  Good guy.
*  Good for me.
*  And then some of the other newer,
*  I think all the door guys are funny, pretty much.
*  I haven't seen Miles in a while, but I keep hearing he's killing.
*  Yo, Miles is on a whole other tear, man.
*  Because he's one of those people that's like, he's different.
*  He's real different.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So is Kacey Rocket.
*  Well, that's it.
*  Kacey's figuring it out, too.
*  He's got a thing where I was like, I don't know if he can do that
*  for a long time.
*  And then he's figuring that out.
*  I think he also can do different things in between doing that.
*  He can go any way he wants.
*  He's doing this one way now where he's hyper energetic.
*  But that doesn't mean that's how he has to do it.
*  He's funny.
*  No, but he's got so much energy.
*  Yeah, he's funny.
*  He can do anything.
*  He can figure it out as he does it.
*  But that's the most important part of this developmental phase
*  that he's in.
*  He's killing, but he's learning how to do it.
*  I have purposely gone out of my way to never write a joke where
*  I needed to do a backflip.
*  Nah.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And it's like, he's got so much energy in the act.
*  I said this to Shane Gillis last night while you were on stage.
*  I go, there's no one in the world who kills more effortlessly
*  than Brian Simpson.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Because you have a casual killing.
*  You're casually killing.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  You don't get hyped up.
*  And it actually is interesting in your style,
*  because it actually puts more weight on any criticism
*  you put on something.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  That's because my first 10 years in comedy, I wasn't sleeping.
*  So you're tired all the time.
*  So I was just tired all the time.
*  And that's just how I've learned to do it.
*  That's hilarious.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Yeah, I didn't get good sleep for years.
*  I finally got the CPAP machine like five years ago.
*  And I couldn't believe it.
*  Yeah, big difference.
*  Oh, man.
*  It's a huge change, Joey.
*  Some people have them, and they're like, yeah, but I don't use them.
*  How do you not use it?
*  I tried it once.
*  I didn't like it.
*  But I have a mouthpiece that I sleep with.
*  How does that work?
*  It presses my tongue down.
*  So the mouthpiece is fit to my lower teeth,
*  and is a tongue depressor.
*  And it keeps my airway open.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  See, I try to get one.
*  Due to have big necks, like football players,
*  almost all those dudes have sleep apnea.
*  It's a big neck thing.
*  And it runs in my family, the big neck.
*  You have a big neck.
*  And look at all this tissue.
*  And if you have a big tongue, I have a pretty fat tongue.
*  And this neck and the hole is not as big as it probably would be
*  if I had a skinny neck.
*  Oh, I see what you're saying.
*  Your neck is tissue.
*  This is all fucking stuff.
*  I build that up with exercises.
*  Does it work, though, the mouthpiece?
*  It keeps my airway open.
*  I sleep great with it.
*  But if I don't have it, man, I snore.
*  It's horrible.
*  I'm pretty sure I tried to get one of those.
*  But then they mailed me a kit that I had to do other stuff.
*  Yeah, you have to form it to your teeth.
*  You lost me.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, I don't do step two.
*  You could go to a dentist, though, and they'll do it.
*  Oh, OK.
*  Yeah.
*  I think I need to do that.
*  I'll set you up.
*  I got a dentist that does it for me.
*  I had to do it with my audiologist
*  for my in-ear monitors.
*  Yeah, I didn't know that you could do shit like that.
*  Yeah, the in-ear monitors, where they form it to your ear.
*  Oh, man, that's one of the best choices I have.
*  I've had it a long time.
*  I have that for the UFC.
*  So when I'm at the UFC, they made me one.
*  So when I put it on, it's mine.
*  It fits right in my ear.
*  Poink, perfect.
*  There's nothing better.
*  Nothing goes better than that.
*  Bro, that is the worst thing about cauliflower ear.
*  Those dudes are fucked.
*  When you get crazy cauliflower ear,
*  I was talking to one of our guys at the security
*  guys at the club.
*  They're all MMA guys, jujitsu guys.
*  And one of them has these fucked up ears.
*  And I'm like, but you can't hear good, right?
*  He's like, it's not as good.
*  It's definitely not as good.
*  That's big.
*  Can he get them drained?
*  His are gone.
*  His are hard.
*  They become calcified.
*  So what happens is the blood pools up.
*  Your ear gets broken, right?
*  And the tissue separates, and blood fills it.
*  And that blood, over time, will become calcified.
*  So it literally becomes rock.
*  It feels like rock.
*  I have little bits of it.
*  But when I trained, most of the time when I trained,
*  I wore ear guards, like wrestling ear guards,
*  just because I didn't want to fuck my ears up.
*  Because if you just go like this,
*  and you talk like this normal, you hear things.
*  But if you go like this and talk like that,
*  you're missing something.
*  You're missing some sound.
*  And you don't realize you're missing it
*  until you let your ear go.
*  Oh, now I hear it all.
*  Well, you're giving that.
*  That's you forever.
*  Forever.
*  Now you have rocks on the outside of your ears.
*  So all this design that God created
*  to let us hear so brilliantly, where it captures sounds
*  and rolls them around and goes inside your ear, all that's
*  gone.
*  It's all out the window.
*  Now you get rocks.
*  That's one of those new earphones
*  that goes outside the ear.
*  They're not brand new.
*  But if anyone's listening and has this problem,
*  this is called a jaw induction headphone.
*  So it creates sound frequencies that bounce off
*  the bones inside your head.
*  And so it works even if you have fucked up ears?
*  Yeah, because it's not going through the ear.
*  And is that for any sound?
*  Or is that for listening to music and shit?
*  It's good for listening to music.
*  But technically, it will emit sound.
*  So if you're next to this person,
*  you'll be able to hear it too.
*  But not perfectly.
*  But it's made for the person that's wearing it.
*  You know what's really incredible?
*  Do you know what game ears are?
*  You know what tactical headphones where you can listen
*  to people talk, but it has technology
*  in there that stops the sound from being louder
*  than a certain volume.
*  So when someone's shooting a gun, it's never that loud.
*  You know those?
*  You can hear so much better with those things.
*  Because they also, so you create a gate,
*  a frequency gate where it's like anything
*  below that frequency, it brings it up.
*  Anything above it, it brings it down.
*  So people put these on when they go hunting
*  and they turn them on and you can hear shit
*  like multiple times more than you would be able
*  to hear normally.
*  So you could hear footsteps.
*  So like if a deer, like if you're in a tree stand,
*  you're just sitting up there with your rifle
*  in a tree stand, you're listening around constantly.
*  You ever do that?
*  You ever tree stand hunt?
*  Uh-uh, no.
*  It's a mind fuck, dude.
*  I was wearing those when I was working.
*  50 decibels of hearing enhancement.
*  It's a lot.
*  Yeah, it's a lot.
*  It's a hearing aid.
*  Yeah, I've used them before.
*  It's crazy.
*  I wore those on the rifling.
*  Not the, but they were like over ears.
*  The other kind, yeah.
*  But it was like, you could hear people,
*  you walk away from people and they go,
*  fuck you, you fucking pig.
*  You hear all of it.
*  I learned that you have to act like you,
*  you have to be very selective about what you react to
*  because people don't need to know that you can hear them.
*  Right.
*  You know?
*  And if you give it away,
*  Yeah, that's a problem.
*  The cat's out the bag.
*  Yeah, you gotta get shh.
*  It taught me patience because I'm like,
*  oh, that wasn't for me to hear.
*  That was just him getting his frustration.
*  You know?
*  I don't need to react,
*  because he thinks I'm 50 feet away.
*  So I was like, why?
*  I don't need to react today.
*  Yeah, fuck him.
*  I'd rather wait until somebody goes,
*  I'm about to shoot this motherfucker.
*  Now you know.
*  Yeah, and then the secret's out.
*  If you have those headphones on, man,
*  it's really bizarre because you can hear things
*  that you can't normally hear.
*  It feels like super hearing.
*  Yeah, but you can also shoot guns
*  and it doesn't hurt your ears.
*  It's weird.
*  Yeah.
*  Amazing.
*  Amazing that somebody figured that out.
*  But anyway, man, if you got bad ears,
*  like if your ears get calcified,
*  you're definitely, it's gonna change what things sound like.
*  Is the price to pay to be dangerous?
*  Yeah, I guess.
*  I mean, you could wear ear guards.
*  I just didn't understand.
*  Yeah, they suck.
*  I hate them.
*  They cut your chin.
*  They're fucking, they irritate your head.
*  But to me, it was like,
*  I had these nice ones that were vinyl
*  and they were just designed for jujitsu.
*  So they were flat to your head.
*  Okay.
*  And they were really comfortable.
*  So why don't guys do it?
*  It seems like a pussy move.
*  Pussy move.
*  Guys like cauliflower ear too.
*  It lets people know.
*  You know?
*  Like if I was saying, I'd look tougher
*  if I had cauliflower ears.
*  Yeah, but I don't know if that's worth it.
*  It's not worth it.
*  It wasn't worth it to me.
*  But I'm also not a professional.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  If you're a professional and your ear gets fucked up,
*  you're back in training the next day.
*  There's no, oh, I gotta get this drain
*  and take six months off and let it heal.
*  Shut the fuck up.
*  Oh, right, right.
*  Shut the fuck up and get back in there, dude.
*  You're a professional fighter.
*  I'm just a comedian.
*  So for me, it's like I gotta mitigate what gets fucked up.
*  Right.
*  You know?
*  People love those things though.
*  It's like a badge of courage.
*  They walk around with a cauliflower ear
*  and they're like everybody knows.
*  I know how to fuck people up.
*  Damn.
*  So then you know what that means.
*  It's definitely people getting the fake cauliflower ear.
*  They're getting ear injections so they can look good.
*  Well, all you have to do is damage your ear.
*  You could do it pretty easily.
*  Especially with some people.
*  It's real different.
*  Some people don't get cauliflower ear.
*  They're like hey.
*  They don't even train with ear guards.
*  Don't mess with me.
*  In some people, they'll break their ears
*  and they'll fucking, they'll do things to their ears
*  on purpose.
*  So they can purposefully get it?
*  Yeah, they'll take a jujitsu belt
*  and they'll just fucking smash their ear
*  and they're trying to give themself cauliflower ear.
*  People have definitely done that.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  I've also met guys who are white belts,
*  who just started who got cauliflower ear
*  and they never did anything about it
*  and they got this big lump on their ear.
*  And they're terrible.
*  And then there's people that do it for decades
*  and don't get anything.
*  Yeah, but it's rare.
*  It's pretty rare.
*  Or you're just like really elite at defense.
*  There's some guys that are so good at defense
*  you just never really catch their head.
*  But usually you would think that you would
*  catch their head early on in their career
*  before they figured out how to be really good
*  defensively and technically.
*  But there's certain guys like good luck
*  getting ahold of Marcelo Garcia's neck
*  unless you're a lot bigger than them
*  like Robert Drysdale, someone like that who tapped him.
*  You know, that guy was a wizard.
*  Like when you're that fat,
*  you ever seen Marcelo Garcia?
*  Okay, I wanna show you this one time
*  where I saw him live in Brazil in 2003
*  where Eddie was competing for,
*  it was at the Abu Dhabi World Championships.
*  And this is the year that Marcelo Garcia
*  burst onto the scene.
*  People didn't know who he was.
*  Is this the same year where Eddie won?
*  Yes, he triangle Hoyler.
*  Yeah, so get Marcelo Garcia versus,
*  oh God, who was it?
*  What's that?
*  You have it?
*  You have it?
*  Okay, no, no, no, that's just him.
*  They're just training.
*  Shaolin, Shaolin Hibero, Marcelo Garcia, Shaolin.
*  So this dude Shaolin who's Hibero, R-I-B-E-R-O.
*  Shaolin is a legendary Jiu Jitsu guy,
*  super high level black belt.
*  So for him to do this to Shaolin is so insane.
*  You gotta see this move.
*  He just spun, took his back, and strangled him unconscious.
*  And this is instantly in the beginning of the match.
*  This match happened, it's like 30 seconds,
*  and he puts him to sleep.
*  Watch that again.
*  Because that scramble, he does an arm drag.
*  That was smooth.
*  Go to the, from the beginning.
*  You just go from the beginning
*  because it's so quick anyway.
*  So he does an arm drag.
*  Marcelo Garcia is in the rash guard.
*  He does an arm drag on his right arm.
*  Look at this, watch how he turns, turns, turns, turns,
*  keeps going, turns, keeps rolling, keeps rolling,
*  gets the back, gets the hooks in.
*  Super strong legs.
*  Now he's got the hook in and now he's securing the neck
*  and he's gonna hang on and he's gonna just fucking
*  crush him to sleep.
*  And he's asleep right there.
*  Dude, that is so insane.
*  Yeah.
*  That is so insane.
*  That is one of the most legendary finishing sequences
*  in all of Jiu Jitsu history.
*  Because that was like the moment Marcelo Garcia,
*  who's like one of the greatest of all time,
*  burst onto the scene.
*  And he just locked in.
*  Yeah, so that guy, even he has cauliflower hair.
*  Oh.
*  As good as he is.
*  As good as he is.
*  Yeah, you can't, it seems like unavoidable.
*  Yeah, some guys don't get it.
*  It's weird.
*  And some guys are just real big guys.
*  Some real big guys never get caught, you know?
*  Well that's why every time I see somebody
*  with cauliflower hair, I know two things.
*  I know one, they can probably fight.
*  Almost definitely.
*  And two, they have some kind of old nagging injury
*  that they hoping I don't discover.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like all the most dangerous dudes are like,
*  if anyone hits me in my fucking.
*  Left knee.
*  Right.
*  They will fold me the fuck up.
*  So that's why I don't fuck with those people.
*  Like old dude, don't fuck with them
*  because they gonna fight,
*  they gonna give you everything they got.
*  Cause they don't want the fight to go so long
*  that you find that injury.
*  Yeah, also like don't just be fucking
*  with people thinking it's a fair fight.
*  People stab people, they shoot people.
*  Just don't do it.
*  Just don't do it, man.
*  If you wanna prove yourself, go to a gym.
*  Go to a gym, learn how to fight
*  and then you will lose all of your desire
*  to do that in a bar.
*  Especially after 30.
*  I don't give a fuck if you're 20.
*  Don't do it.
*  Don't fucking do it, man.
*  It's how people die.
*  It's how people get locked up in jail
*  for the rest of their lives.
*  20 somethings though, you can't tell a 20 something.
*  Yeah you can.
*  I listened.
*  Yeah I listened.
*  I was terrified of fights when I was in my 20s
*  and I knew how to fight.
*  I didn't wanna go anywhere.
*  Oh yeah, but you grew up fighting.
*  Yeah, but I mean when I would go out to bars.
*  Right, right.
*  Like if I was out to bars with my friends
*  and shit would break loose, I'm like,
*  exit please.
*  I'm not fighting anybody.
*  I'm getting the fuck out of here.
*  I knew that early, early on
*  because I knew guys growing up in Boston,
*  going to high school in Newton,
*  which was outside of Boston,
*  I spent most of my time in Boston
*  because that's where I did taekwondo.
*  I met some hard fucking dudes.
*  Some hard, hard men.
*  One of the guys that I met was a fucking hit man
*  for Whitey Bulger.
*  He was a guy I was training.
*  I was teaching him taekwondo and he was a hit man.
*  Like well known that he was in the Irish mob.
*  Well known and he was taking taekwondo classes.
*  I was around people that like,
*  so in my mind, any man that you just have
*  some confrontation with, even if you beat his ass,
*  that's not the end of it.
*  He's gonna come find you.
*  This idea that you could just do something to someone
*  and there's no consequences ever,
*  it could be a year from now, two years from now,
*  five years from now.
*  You're gonna be looking over the shoulder
*  for the rest of your life?
*  What are you fucking stupid?
*  Just get away.
*  Don't fight with people, don't argue with people.
*  Yeah, smoke.
*  Don't piss people off.
*  We'd all be better off if people didn't have this desire
*  to control themselves and that's what you get rid of
*  when you go to the gym.
*  When you learn jujitsu, when you learn a martial art
*  and you don't have this desire to test yourself all the time
*  because you're constantly being tested.
*  When you go out, you just wanna have fun and chill.
*  Yeah, most of the fighters I've met,
*  I've met a lot of fighters since I've been,
*  since I've lived here now.
*  Most of them are pretty chill.
*  Super chill.
*  Like you said, almost, I think all the security people
*  at Mother Soup are all jujitsu guys
*  and you wouldn't even know,
*  I know one of the guys was some kind of champion
*  and you would never know it.
*  They're so humble and respectful.
*  Well, it's because they get challenged all the time.
*  They don't wanna do it in real life.
*  The real challenge is challenged against skilled people.
*  When you're doing that all the time,
*  when you're rolling with black belts
*  and you're fighting off triangles
*  and triangle turns into an arm bar
*  and you're like barely escaping
*  and then you get side control,
*  you're battling all day long.
*  You're battling in your head after the class.
*  You're going, oh, how did he catch me?
*  How did I do that?
*  Why did I do that?
*  My left foot, fuck.
*  And you're trying to figure out what you did wrong
*  and what you did right.
*  You don't wanna get in a fight in a bar.
*  You wanna go have fun.
*  If you would go to a bar with a bunch of jujitsu people,
*  they're all laughing.
*  They wanna have a good time.
*  They say thank you.
*  The waitress comes over, they're polite.
*  They're nice people.
*  They get it all out, man.
*  You gotta get it all out.
*  And if you wanna get it all out at a bar,
*  man, you're gonna get killed.
*  There's a confidence that comes from
*  knowing exactly where you stand.
*  Where it's like, oh, I know that that dude can beat my ass.
*  I know for sure.
*  Cause he's done it every day for the last six,
*  you know what I mean?
*  And just knowing where you,
*  you don't go out with this insecurity about you.
*  I think most of them.
*  Most of them, yeah.
*  I mean, there's wild dudes that get involved
*  in cage fighting, but overall,
*  I feel they are exceptional human beings.
*  And I know that sounds crazy
*  for someone who thinks it's barbaric,
*  but you have to understand that the character development
*  involved in becoming a guy like a Dustin Poirier.
*  You wanna be that good.
*  The fucking fire you have to go through
*  to be at a world-class level
*  for as long as that guy's been doing it.
*  And be that good right now.
*  You know what, man?
*  That's an exceptional human being.
*  Exceptional.
*  There's not a lot of those out there.
*  And when you meet those guys,
*  you're out with those guys,
*  they're the fucking nicest guys.
*  They're cool, they're calm,
*  they have their shit together.
*  Even Sean Strickland, everybody thinks he's crazy
*  and he says a bunch of wild shit.
*  Sean is a great guy.
*  He's a nice guy.
*  He's a real smart dude who had a fucked up childhood.
*  And he's an excellent professional fighter.
*  And he's a nice guy.
*  If you're nice to him, he's a nice guy.
*  He's fun.
*  He's fun.
*  But, you know, in the street,
*  if you find that guy and you talk shit to him
*  for no reason, he's gonna put you in the hospital.
*  He's gonna put you in the hospital.
*  And you can't do a goddamn thing about it.
*  You don't even have a chance.
*  You have nothing.
*  You have zero chance.
*  This idea, oh, fucking, these guys can't fight.
*  Shut your mouth.
*  You have no idea what you're talking about.
*  Well, you definitely shouldn't be out talking shit
*  to people from America.
*  They always did it.
*  They used to do it to Chuck Liddell.
*  People would talk shit to him.
*  They used to do it to Mike Tyson.
*  Mike Tyson, people would talk shit to.
*  There's certain people that are just crazy, man.
*  Well, speaking of Mike Tyson,
*  these people that think that he don't stand a chance
*  against Jake Paul, that they shouldn't even,
*  like, because he's too old, I think you're crazy.
*  Well, they're definitely uninformed.
*  Yeah.
*  Here's the thing.
*  He is 57 years old.
*  He will be 58 when they fight.
*  He has had a long fighting career.
*  He has been knocked out by massive men
*  like Lennox Lewis and Evander Holyfield.
*  He's had a lot of blows.
*  And it's long past the time where most people ever fight.
*  The only person that ever fought competitively
*  after age 50 is Bernard Hopkins and Archie Moore.
*  Archie Moore did it back in the day.
*  No, Foreman was 40, son.
*  Foreman was in his 50s, I believe,
*  when he had his last fight, was he?
*  He won the title.
*  He's a little...
*  Grass on wisdom.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Foreman was the, want some ice and glasses and shit?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I think Foreman captured the heavyweight title
*  at the oldest age, which was 46,
*  when he fought Michael Moore.
*  He hit him with his perfect right hand.
*  It was crazy.
*  That's okay.
*  That's that bodega cat.
*  That's Mark Norman stuff.
*  We got some good shit, though.
*  So how old was he?
*  48.
*  So his last fight when he fought Shannon Briggs,
*  Shannon the Cannon, shout out to Shannon.
*  Let's go, champ.
*  So he beat Lou Savarese.
*  He was 48 years old.
*  Crazy.
*  Crazy.
*  Crazy.
*  And he knocked out Michael Moore.
*  He was 45.
*  So he was the oldest man ever to win the heavyweight title
*  at age 45.
*  And you gotta realize, that's a real 45.
*  That's not like a 45 today.
*  The 45 today is 45 with testosterone replacement
*  and human growth hormone and peptides.
*  Well, that's what I'm saying.
*  Mike Tyson, he 57, but he got access to...
*  Everything.
*  Everything.
*  And he's also doing this very unique kind of training
*  with electrical muscular stimulation
*  that I've talked to some people that do that.
*  And it has massive benefits of rehabilitating injuries.
*  And it also, for a lot of people,
*  gives them significant gains when they use it
*  as opposed to just using weightlifting.
*  I don't know too much about the science behind it.
*  When Jamie comes back, we'll have him look it up.
*  But you slap electrodes onto yourself.
*  They put these pads on you and it's hooked up to a machine.
*  And while the electricity is going into your muscles,
*  you're doing exercises.
*  So while you're getting jolted, you're doing squats
*  and you're doing like deadlifts.
*  You're doing all this shit.
*  While you're connected to this thing
*  that's stimulating your muscles.
*  But isn't that...
*  Cause my main concern would be, I guess in my head,
*  where it's like, what if the electricity,
*  the timing's off and it goes to contract your muscle
*  at a time when you're trying to...
*  I think it's constantly contracted.
*  And I think you're fighting through the...
*  I don't know, I haven't done it.
*  I'm talking on my ass.
*  What is that thing that Mike Tyson does
*  where he gets connected to like an electrical,
*  muscular stimulation machine.
*  I've seen it in training footage.
*  And I know from talking to the guy that was telling me about...
*  Cheers, my brother.
*  Congratulations on your special.
*  Thank you.
*  It's awesome.
*  I'm so happy to see you killing it.
*  Oh, good bourbon.
*  Not bad.
*  This is, I think this is the Jack Carr stuff.
*  Yeah, that's not bad.
*  No, this is Balcones, Texas pot still bourbon.
*  That's legit.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  That's legit.
*  Yeah, this is real legit.
*  That's legit.
*  Yeah.
*  That's good stuff.
*  What were we just talking about?
*  George Foreman, Mike Tyson.
*  Oh, Mike Tyson, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So they do this thing where they slap Chuck Zito.
*  They do this thing where they slap these electrodes on him.
*  Chuck Zito's a giant fight friend.
*  Shout out to Chuck.
*  Oh, this is now.
*  Yeah.
*  So they put these electrodes on him
*  and they have him perform different exercises.
*  New Fit, N-E-U-F-I-T.
*  And so they have this machine, okay,
*  a breakthrough in neuromuscular electrical stimulation
*  devices utilizing direct current.
*  So it's this device that uses an updated form
*  of neuromuscular electrical stimulation
*  to send electrical impulses through the skin to the nerves
*  resulting in muscle contractions and sensory impulses.
*  The N-M-E-S technology mitigates the action potentials
*  of both peripheral and central nervous system
*  allowing for communication with virtually
*  all parts of the body.
*  The impulses stimulate muscles and other tissues
*  including contractile and sensory muscle fibers
*  and sensory and motor neurons.
*  The stimulation also leads to increased blood flow
*  in the areas where it's applied.
*  So I know Tyson was doing that before the Roy Jones fight
*  when he was training.
*  I believe he's doing that now too.
*  But that's interesting, right?
*  Because you'd want to do like everything you can
*  with a 57-year-old body to get it ready to do that.
*  I don't think people know, you don't lose that much ability.
*  You have to understand who you're talking about.
*  What does change though is your ability to recover.
*  And then the amount of damage you can take.
*  That's what changes, but he can still
*  fucking destroy that guy.
*  The thing about the amount of damage you can take,
*  that's also in comparison to how much damage
*  you took in your life.
*  There's certain guys that as they get older,
*  it's very disturbing because you see them get touched
*  with a punch and they just go out.
*  You'll see that with some older MMA fighters.
*  I saw that with Chuck Liddell.
*  Nobody could knock him out.
*  And then it was like anyone could.
*  In his prime, he was ferocious, dude.
*  He had an iron chin and ferocious power
*  and just this warrior mentality.
*  He was just chasing you down.
*  He was hunting you inside that cage, everybody.
*  But anyone with an iron chin,
*  eventually they start getting knocked out
*  because the reason you know they have an iron chin
*  is because you've seen them take some.
*  There was this dude in boxing, his name was Doug DeWitt.
*  And Doug DeWitt was not the best fighter in the world,
*  but he had the best chin of all time.
*  Dudes would tee off on Doug DeWitt
*  and it was like nothing happened.
*  He was crazy.
*  He was known for his ability to take a punch.
*  And then one day it just went away.
*  One day it went away.
*  And one day he just got dropped, knocked out,
*  and then he just couldn't take shots anymore.
*  It just gave out.
*  It just gave out like a bad suspension.
*  See if you can find Doug DeWitt highlights.
*  He was born with 50 knockouts in you.
*  This dude had a thousand knockouts in him.
*  You couldn't knock him out.
*  He was getting hit clean in the face by murderers
*  and you couldn't stop him.
*  It was weird.
*  And he was known for that.
*  Like if a guy was gonna fight Doug DeWitt,
*  you knew he was a good fighter,
*  but you knew that the thing about him is
*  he had the craziest chin of all time.
*  He was known for it.
*  I don't think that's Doug DeWitt.
*  That's Nigel Ben.
*  Is that Doug DeWitt?
*  No, that's not Doug DeWitt, dude.
*  It's a different guy.
*  Different guy.
*  There you go.
*  It's just the wrong part of the video.
*  Oh no, no, yeah.
*  Because these are all, this is Nigel Ben,
*  who was a real destroyer, man.
*  He was a fucking murderous, murderous puncher.
*  Thomas Hearn versus Doug DeWitt.
*  And it's kind of the same thing that just happened.
*  I don't know what the actual video is.
*  So Thomas Hearn's one of the greatest knockout artists
*  of all time.
*  Yeah, and that's that guy Doug DeWitt.
*  So he was 25.
*  So this is when Doug DeWitt still had an iron chin.
*  Should not be fighting Thomas Hearns.
*  Like, whoever set this up, this is a terrible matchup.
*  Scoochy head a little bit.
*  Is this, is this the one where he finally gets knocked out?
*  I don't know.
*  But Doug DeWitt was a very solid fighter,
*  but Tommy Hearns is just next level.
*  Tommy Hearns has the most ridiculous back.
*  Look at that back.
*  That's where all that power comes from, dude.
*  Look how wide he is.
*  So when Tommy was 147, I think this was a middleweight fight,
*  which was 160.
*  But you gotta realize, like Tommy,
*  when he fought Sugar Ray, he was 147.
*  When he fought like Papino Cuevas and all those other dudes,
*  dude, he was very light.
*  But he was that tall with that kind of power.
*  So look at that, Tommy Hearns is teeing off on Doug DeWitt.
*  I'm telling you, most people who fought Doug DeWitt
*  were stunned by the amount of power
*  that guy could just absorb.
*  He just, he was a really good fighter
*  and it wasn't like he was a bad fighter.
*  He just wasn't like world championship caliber.
*  Where is he now?
*  Who knows, man.
*  It's not good at the end.
*  No.
*  It's not good at the end.
*  I was reading about this boxer from the 80s
*  who was living in LA.
*  And they would have to almost put string on him
*  to make sure he didn't travel too far away from the house.
*  He would get lost on his block.
*  He didn't know what was going on.
*  His brain is just gone.
*  It's just gone.
*  Yeah, the price they pay, man.
*  Is the craziest price.
*  The chance at greatness.
*  The craziest price.
*  And you never know when you've crossed a line.
*  You never know when you've crossed a line
*  until your brain's not gonna return.
*  In the beginning, you don't even notice a slip.
*  You're just like, I'm just tired from training.
*  You don't even notice.
*  And other people start noticing it.
*  Maybe you have a drink in you,
*  you can't really form sentences that well.
*  One drink and all of a sudden you're slurring your words.
*  And everybody's like, what's going on with Mike?
*  Ah, he just had a couple.
*  No, he had one fucking drink.
*  He's slurring his words.
*  Something's going on.
*  That's one of the first things you see.
*  And then it keeps going.
*  The damage doesn't get better over time.
*  It gets worse.
*  They say that a lot of the brain damage
*  doesn't even show itself until years
*  after the actual impact of whatever the fuck happened.
*  Yeah.
*  Dudes start doing wild shit.
*  They start gambling.
*  Start doing coke.
*  Start going crazy.
*  But then some people are just fine, right?
*  Some people are fine.
*  Yeah, it's weird.
*  It's weird.
*  Some people retire.
*  And they had long careers.
*  And they could talk fine.
*  They're great.
*  Look at Andre Ward.
*  I know.
*  And you can see whatever brain cells
*  Floyd Mayweather's father had left,
*  he was like, I'm gonna make sure
*  this don't happen to my son.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, it's like, of course he had.
*  I think Floyd saw it too.
*  Of course he had the most defensive fighter of all time.
*  He's like, son, this is what happens when you get hit.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, also just seeing it from his uncle, Uncle Roger.
*  Oh, that's who I meant.
*  Yeah, his uncle.
*  He sounds drunk all the time.
*  Well, he's dead now.
*  Yeah.
*  He died, unfortunately.
*  Roger Mayweather was awesome in his prime man.
*  Black Mamba, he was another dude.
*  He was different than Floyd.
*  He was a crazy knockout artist.
*  You ever see Roger fight?
*  Oh yeah, yeah.
*  He's a great trainer too.
*  Yeah, he's a very good trainer.
*  Very, very, very good trainer.
*  And he's got that famous quote,
*  most people don't know shit about boxing.
*  It's true.
*  He's right.
*  He's 100% right.
*  I don't.
*  I know like.
*  I barely do.
*  But I know that I do know,
*  I know enough about boxing where I feel like
*  when I'm watching a good boxing match,
*  what I'm enjoying is not with the average person.
*  Most people just wanna see two big dudes
*  in the middle of the ring just throw punches.
*  They don't care about the strategy of it.
*  But I like to watch the breakdowns.
*  I do too.
*  The footwork and why his feet are right there.
*  This one dude made a really good breakdown
*  of how Anthony Joshua caught Francis Nganu.
*  It's really good.
*  Yeah.
*  It's really good cause he talks about
*  how Joshua was setting up these reactions
*  by jabbing to the body.
*  And how he was jabbing to the body
*  and how Francis would dip his left arm
*  and like throw a hook.
*  And then he was like trying to block the shot
*  to the body and dip his arm and throw a hook.
*  So he timed it right where he fainted the jab to the body.
*  Francis reacted and he hit him with a perfect right hand.
*  And you see in the breakdown how he set it up.
*  And like that is boxing.
*  That's real boxing.
*  That's not just a big guy who can punch.
*  But that's like super sophisticated chess playing
*  in the middle of this high consequence scenario
*  with a giant knockouts striker.
*  And people are, and some people are like levels above that.
*  Well that's Usyk.
*  Usyk is level above Anthony Joshua
*  cause he boxed the shit out of Joshua two fights in a row.
*  And had him in trouble.
*  In the first fight in particular had him in trouble man.
*  He had Joshua reeling and he was all over him.
*  And Usyk is really a cruiser weight.
*  He's not even that big.
*  He's small for a heavyweight.
*  You know Usyk was fighting I think at 197
*  and then he went up to fight heavyweights.
*  So like when he stands next to these guys
*  he's so much smaller than that.
*  That's why part of me deep down
*  I wish boxing had like a UFC type.
*  Right.
*  Like I wish someone could make the top guys fight each other.
*  Well they can't even do that in MMA.
*  You know look Francis is now at the PFL
*  and you've got you know other people over at Bellator.
*  And I guess Bellator and the PFL are one thing now.
*  Yeah but you have to be huge to not do it in the UFC.
*  It's real tough to be famous.
*  The problem is if you're outside of the UFC
*  you could be not famous and make more money.
*  That is true.
*  Like this is a factor you have to think about guys
*  that you know kind of didn't do as well
*  as the top guys in the UFC
*  but they're still elite MMA fighters.
*  Think over the PFL and win that tournament
*  and make a million dollars.
*  Yeah.
*  You know?
*  Yeah and then man over there the Middle East man
*  they throwing money at all manner of entertainers
*  and shit over here.
*  Yeah that one dude from Montreal, Olivier Aubameurcier.
*  I think he won it twice.
*  I think he won the PFL tournament twice.
*  He definitely won it once.
*  He made a million dollars.
*  Is this tournament,
*  is that why I just saw Mighty Mousin in like a no weight?
*  No.
*  That's, no Mighty Mousin in no weight
*  was just a jujitsu match.
*  That was just jujitsu.
*  Mighty Mousin is wild.
*  He just enters jujitsu opens.
*  As a 155 pound man fought a 250 pound dude
*  and strangled him.
*  Yeah and it looked like it too.
*  It's incredible the size difference.
*  It's incredible.
*  But he competes for one
*  and one championship is this giant organization in Asia
*  and they have not just MMA fights
*  but they have kickboxing fights and grappling fights.
*  Like Gary Tonan has competed over there in grappling.
*  The Rutolo brothers are the champions over there.
*  Mikey Musimichi, he competes over there in grappling.
*  They have a great app too by the way.
*  Yeah so there's that.
*  So there's places you can go
*  but to be famous in America is the UFC.
*  Everything else is just unfortunately
*  it pales in comparison.
*  The UFC is like Q-tips, the NFL.
*  NBA is where you go to see professional basketball.
*  If someone else wants to start a new basketball league,
*  good fucking luck.
*  Good luck.
*  The UFC is, it's singular.
*  It's singular.
*  It's just the most prominent business that's run the best.
*  It's got the best machine behind it.
*  It's got the most history behind it.
*  They literally invented the sport in 1993 in America.
*  Not invent the sport because,
*  but they did put it in a cage and put rules to it.
*  Actually I think they had cages in Brazil back then already.
*  But also-
*  I'm not sure if they,
*  they might've had cages in Brazil by then
*  but a lot of the fights in Brazil in the early days,
*  they'd actually fight in a ring with a net.
*  But what they did was they made it,
*  they packaged it in a way that made it a major sport.
*  Yes, 100%.
*  Instead of just like a blood sport
*  where people like something that was done in back alleys.
*  100%.
*  Right, they made it so like you could put it on TV.
*  And that was the most brilliant move.
*  I mean, they had to bring in the regulators and shit
*  to kind of make that happen.
*  But that's what made it what it is.
*  Well, they also had to spend a fuck load of money.
*  A fuck load of money.
*  Yeah, I heard Dana saying that they didn't make any money.
*  Like you did the first ones for free?
*  Yeah, I did the first 12.
*  12 or 13 shows I did for free.
*  Well, Dana became my friend
*  and I knew they were hemorrhaging money.
*  And I said, I don't need any money.
*  I go, just fly us out here.
*  Fly us out here and get my friend's tickets.
*  So it was like me and Eddie Bravo
*  would just fly out to the fight.
*  Because we were flying out to the fights
*  before I worked there.
*  He reached out to me because he knew I used to work
*  for the UFC back in the day.
*  Because I started working for the UFC in 97.
*  And I was the post-fight commentator.
*  Oh, it was before Zufa.
*  Before Zufa.
*  Oh, okay, yeah.
*  So it was Zufa.
*  But it was, no, it wasn't Zufa.
*  It was SEG, I'm sorry.
*  It's still Zufa, even though Zufa sold to WEM.
*  So we were in these small little places
*  in the middle of nowhere.
*  And I did in the early days, I saw Vitor's debut.
*  I saw Randy Couture's debut, Dan Henderson's debut.
*  I mean, I was there for Chuck Liddell's debut.
*  I was there for all these early fights.
*  I saw Carlos Newton fight.
*  I saw all these like Allen, of course Allen Joban.
*  He was actually at Eddie's gym.
*  But I saw all these like great fighters fight.
*  He wasn't, Allen was like later.
*  I was thinking of, fuck, who was I thinking of?
*  Allen Góez, that's right.
*  Allen Góez was a jujitsu wizard who I got to see fight
*  in the early days of the UFC.
*  Most people don't even remember these guys.
*  No, I don't remember Allen Góez.
*  Like top level guys back in the day.
*  And to me, it was like, I was a kid in a candy store.
*  But I was losing money doing it.
*  You know, like I could be at a comedy club on the road
*  and I was still on news radio.
*  So I was busy, you know, and I did it for a while,
*  but it was like, it was too much.
*  It was costing me money.
*  And it was the experience I had.
*  I was like, this is fun.
*  But they were doing one in Japan.
*  And when they went to do the one in Japan, I'm like,
*  I'm out, I'm not going to Japan for like a thousand dollars
*  or whatever I got paid.
*  Like I'm not going to Japan.
*  So I quit and I stay a fan.
*  And then Dana contacts me in like 2001
*  and says, hey, we're gonna have the UFC in Vegas.
*  We got tickets for you if you wanna come.
*  I'm like, holy shit.
*  Yeah, I'm gonna go.
*  So Ian Eddie, we flew out to Vegas to watch the UFC.
*  And so I did that for like the first one or two.
*  And then they had one on Fox and he said,
*  would you do me a favor?
*  And I said, what?
*  He said, will you do commentary for the one on Fox?
*  Cause it was on Fox Sports Net.
*  It was like the best damn sports show period.
*  Do you remember that, Chad?
*  They had like a UFC event.
*  So I did that.
*  It was UFC 37 and a half.
*  37 and a half?
*  Yeah, that's what it was called.
*  UFC 37 and a half.
*  So I did that and that was the beginning.
*  And he goes, dude, please keep doing that.
*  And I was like, okay, what's that?
*  What's on that?
*  Is that?
*  Is that the good stuff?
*  No, no, no.
*  You want some?
*  That's those Ron White cigars.
*  It's a little baby cigar.
*  Here you go, sir.
*  Gracias.
*  My man.
*  But so that was, you know,
*  that was 2002 or something like that.
*  So when did you hit the point
*  where he was like,
*  hi, I want you to do it permanently.
*  Yeah, I had to sign a contract.
*  I was like.
*  But how many UFCs were you in before you were like,
*  I think I'm gonna just do this.
*  Well, I mean, it was like,
*  I guess that it was like 13 in
*  and I never asked for any money.
*  And I was like, all right, man, I'm having a good time.
*  I'm happy that you guys like what I do.
*  I'm excited and I'm happy to be able to promote the sport.
*  That's it.
*  June 22nd, 2002.
*  Whoever that is beside you,
*  that dude looks out of his depth.
*  You know what I mean?
*  So that dude, that's Jeff Osborne.
*  He was awesome.
*  He also did a hook and shoot,
*  who's one of the earlier MMA promotions
*  that like Eve Edwards came out of there.
*  Josh Neer came out of there.
*  I saw some real killers came out of those promotions,
*  like a Midwest fight.
*  There was a bunch of those like early on promotions.
*  These like small level promotions
*  that a lot of guys came up in.
*  But I can't imagine being like,
*  even in like the Chuck Lidell era,
*  like before that, before the UFC,
*  what were fighters making?
*  Nothing.
*  Nothing.
*  Well, Chuck Lidell, when he had his first fights,
*  he was fighting bare knuckle in Brazil.
*  He fought Pele.
*  Pele is this legendary member of Shoot the Box.
*  You know, I know I've talked to you
*  about Shoot the Box before.
*  That's Anderson Silva.
*  That's where Shogun came out of.
*  I mean, that's a Rafael Cordero,
*  the guy who holds mitts for Mike Tyson.
*  He's from Shoot the Box.
*  And now he runs Kings MMA.
*  But this is, this is, you know, we're like,
*  this is probably like, what year is this?
*  This has to be like 95?
*  It's 98.
*  98, okay.
*  So this is probably either right before
*  Chuck Lidell fought in the UFC,
*  somewhere around that range,
*  but he's fighting in Brazil, bare knuckle,
*  against a dude who's like a legend in Brazil.
*  Like Pele was like, look, Pele took Chuck Lidell down.
*  How about that?
*  This is how dangerous his fucking dude is.
*  Chuck Lidell never gets taken down.
*  Here he is mounted, bare knuckle.
*  And this is a crazy ass fight, man.
*  And Chuck eventually gets all the,
*  look how they have this setup,
*  where the ring at the bottom of it has a net in it.
*  Bro, Pele's all over him.
*  But now Chuck sneaks out the back door,
*  and Chuck was like a really good wrestler,
*  but he used his wrestling to stand up.
*  He just wanted to blast people,
*  because he also had a karate background.
*  Now in these fights, you're allowed to headbutt,
*  you're allowed to stomp, you're allowed to do everything.
*  You got bare knuckles, you could even grab dicks.
*  A lot of these dudes grabbed each other in the dick.
*  Really? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Gary Goodrich did it to the Pedro.
*  That's my signature move.
*  Bro, he reached into his shorts and grabbed his cock.
*  Just crushed his balls.
*  Like it was crazy what people were doing.
*  Damn, you allowed to squeeze balls?
*  Well, they were in that promotion.
*  It was like, you could do anything,
*  which is kind of crazy that nobody just eye poked
*  the shit out of each other.
*  I think you weren't allowed to bite.
*  You just start with the ball squeeze.
*  Look, he just got thrown out of the fucking ring,
*  onto the ground.
*  That's why the net is there, to try to trap them
*  while they're beating the shit out of each other.
*  Are there rounds in this?
*  I don't know, man.
*  Some of them just were to the finish.
*  It's not, no, no, no, no.
*  I mean, the early UFCs were all to the finish.
*  It's a 33 minute video.
*  Yeah, I think a lot of these fights
*  were just battles of attrition,
*  and they went on as long as they went on.
*  Brazil, when they were doing Vali Tuto,
*  it was the purest form of MMA.
*  It wasn't the same level that MMA is today,
*  but it was the purest form,
*  because these guys were bare knuckle.
*  They would just wear like little fucking Speedos,
*  and they would do everything.
*  You could kick, you could punch, you could stomp.
*  To the finish.
*  You could elbow the back of the head.
*  You get someone's back.
*  You don't even have to sink in a choke.
*  If you get someone's back with the hooks in,
*  Hensel Gracie did that in one of his fights.
*  He just got this dude's back,
*  and just blasted him with elbows in the head.
*  Your back of your head is so vulnerable,
*  and the UFC, you're literally not even allowed
*  to hit the back of the head.
*  So why are you saying that?
*  It's one area where you're not allowed to strike.
*  That's how dangerous it is.
*  And in the old days, they got your back,
*  and they go right for that spot.
*  Boom, boom, boom.
*  Yeah, that's gonna put you out.
*  Oh, you're getting fucked up.
*  So it was like a pure version
*  of what actually works and what doesn't work.
*  Because if you have no gloves on,
*  punching changes.
*  Everything changes.
*  Your ability to block punches changes.
*  So if you go from boxing gloves to MMA gloves,
*  there's a giant difference.
*  But even if you go from MMA gloves to no gloves,
*  there's a difference.
*  Because it feels different on your face.
*  It fucking hurts more.
*  It hurts your hands more.
*  It cuts you up.
*  Everybody gets cut open.
*  It's a much more realistic version of fighting.
*  And that's what they were doing in Brazil.
*  It didn't get, when they brought it to America,
*  when Hory and Gracie created the UFC,
*  and brought it to America in 93,
*  when they had their very first event,
*  they had to kind of do some rules.
*  So they had a cage.
*  But it was all, no time limit.
*  Every fight was till the fight was over.
*  See, that's what's crazy to me.
*  Every fight in the UFC, those fights were,
*  Hoist, Gracie was arm barring everybody.
*  And there was no weight.
*  There was no rounds.
*  There was no weights.
*  There was just, Hoist weighed 176 pounds.
*  That was his second pro fight.
*  He had already fought once in the UFC by then.
*  Oh, wow.
*  So UFC 17 in Mobile, Alabama,
*  with a decision over Noe Hernandez.
*  I was there for that.
*  So the next fight, he did that bare knuckle.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, something I just found, said it was a 30 minute,
*  no rounds, no breaks, no gloves, very few rules.
*  Wow.
*  Headbutts, groin strikes, kicking of the knees,
*  the back of the downed opponent,
*  strikes to the back of the head are all allowed.
*  1998.
*  He was 28 years old and he weighed 198 pounds.
*  Wow.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yeah, and that was back when there was no glory.
*  No glory.
*  Very little fanfare.
*  Very little fanfare.
*  The UFC's weight limit was 200 back then.
*  There was a 200 pound weight class.
*  Like right around then, they started putting in a weight
*  class.
*  So like when Tito Ortiz was a champ, it was like,
*  I believe it was 200.
*  And then they moved it up to 205 later.
*  They changed it.
*  But I think like when Frank Shamrock was a champ,
*  I believe the weight class was 200.
*  And you couldn't be over that?
*  Yeah, that was like, I think there was like a couple
*  of weight classes.
*  I think they started instituting weight classes
*  and they had like a 55 and then they had like a 70.
*  And then they started sticking them all in there.
*  And then it became what it is today, which I still
*  think is underweight classed.
*  I think they should have several more.
*  I think they should have one.
*  Higher.
*  No, all throughout the range.
*  I feel like this should be one every 10 pounds.
*  And right now we have these giant gaps that
*  don't necessarily make sense.
*  We have a huge gap from 155 to 170.
*  That's 15 pounds.
*  That's a big difference in a human being.
*  How much bigger and stronger a person is
*  and how they can cut down to 170 versus a guy who really weighs
*  like 175 and he cuts to 170.
*  It's like a giant difference between those 205 pound guys
*  that can make that weight cut.
*  I feel like if we had a 75, 85.
*  So 55, 65, 75, 85, 95, 205, 225 heavyweight.
*  That makes sense to me.
*  So you're saying above 225?
*  Above 225 should be whatever the fuck you weigh.
*  Because right now it's not.
*  Right now the heavyweight limit, as ridiculous as it is,
*  is 265 pounds.
*  You can't weigh more than 265 pounds in a championship
*  heavyweight fight.
*  So wait a minute.
*  So the heavyweight division goes from 205 to 265.
*  Exactly.
*  That seems crazy.
*  Nuts.
*  That's crazy.
*  When you've got guys like Francis, it becomes crazy.
*  Right, because it's the edge.
*  Touch of death, 6'5", 265 natural.
*  Francis gets above 265 when he's not training.
*  But he's not allowed to be.
*  When he fights.
*  When he fights, he has to lean out.
*  So we're saying 10 pounds makes a difference
*  in every other division except the biggest one.
*  Well, in the biggest one, they just say, hey,
*  decide what you are.
*  Are you a light heavyweight or are you a heavyweight?
*  Isn't their problem, though, that there's not
*  enough Francis-sized motherfuckers running around?
*  Right.
*  And if they are, they go into football.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  If you want to get an elite American athlete that
*  thinks he's going to have a future making millions
*  of dollars, and you're a 6'5 kid and you're huge,
*  you don't get into MMA.
*  And a lot of those guys, they would have a hard time
*  making 265.
*  How about that?
*  Yeah.
*  What would Francis Ngano even be in another sport?
*  There's this kid that went viral.
*  Probably whatever the fuck he wants.
*  Playing basketball right now for NC State.
*  Is he Cameroonian?
*  No, he's just really good basketball player.
*  He's 6'9, 275.
*  And they're already like NFL scouts are trying to get him
*  to play football instead of basketball.
*  Wow.
*  Instead of basketball?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, well, you're a damn fool.
*  You bet not.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh.
*  Yeah, basketball, you don't get brain damage.
*  You don't get brain damage.
*  And their contracts are fully guaranteed.
*  So all your money's guaranteed.
*  If you get hurt, all that.
*  Oh, that's better.
*  The NFL will never do that.
*  Yeah, they can't.
*  No.
*  Isn't that crazy?
*  Yeah, if it's my kid and he gets to choose between the NFL
*  and any other major sports, I'm taking the other one.
*  100%.
*  All day.
*  For sure.
*  Yeah, all day.
*  You don't want those knocks.
*  And the baseball players, they're making tons of money.
*  All guaranteed.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So if you hear a football player got a $50 million contract,
*  it's not $50 million.
*  It's $10 million guaranteed with bonuses of this and shit
*  like that.
*  But if you hear that a baseball player got a,
*  like that Japanese dude, did he just get a half a billion
*  dollars?
*  He's getting all that money, every single penny.
*  He deferred it just like Bobby Bonilla did,
*  which is a pretty fun story.
*  So the Japanese dude, is that the dude
*  who has the gambling problem?
*  Maybe.
*  Is that a?
*  No, you think it's somebody else.
*  Is that that guy?
*  Yeah, Shoei Otani.
*  Yeah, Shoei Otani.
*  So that dude gambles.
*  Yeah, or his.
*  What's the story?
*  They said his interpreter took a bunch,
*  or he says his interpreter gambled, took a bunch away from.
*  OK, let me ask you this.
*  Do you think that the situation with someone like that, who
*  comes from another country, do you think that maybe organized
*  crime comes with him a little bit?
*  I've heard that, but also there's a lot of.
*  A little bit, a little bit like Yakuza action.
*  I mean, that's definitely feasible,
*  just because his family's back there.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like, if I want to exploit you somehow.
*  Also, he might have a meaningful relationship with those people.
*  But also, though, a half a billion dollars
*  is enough to, when you unbossed at that point,
*  you just have somebody wiped out.
*  You can flip it on them.
*  You know?
*  I don't know if I'm worth half a billion dollars,
*  ain't nobody telling me what to fucking do.
*  Right.
*  No way.
*  Because you can get to, because you at that point now,
*  where you have power.
*  Like, that's kind of money that nobody's, no mafia boss
*  is exploiting you when you're a billionaire.
*  We just don't have it yet, technically.
*  Yeah, but that don't matter.
*  Because because.
*  Yeah, but he might have a relationship with them.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  I mean, I'm not saying he does, but I'm
*  saying that in certain situations,
*  like if you get in bed with organized crime
*  and they help you in your career.
*  Like, there was always insinuations
*  that Frank Sinatra was involved in the mob, for instance.
*  Oh, right, right, yeah.
*  You know?
*  And you would imagine that, like, Frank Sinatra would probably
*  be a terrible guy to piss off, because he probably
*  can contact some people.
*  And you probably can disappear.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  100%, right?
*  So a guy like that, if he wants to leave
*  the connection with the mob, I bet that's pretty dicey.
*  Yeah.
*  I bet that's real dicey.
*  So you just stay with them.
*  But what would the mob do for a baseball player?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  But I would imagine, I mean, what are we
*  talking about, the Yakuza?
*  I think most really sophisticated organized crime
*  companies, you call them a company,
*  I think they probably have strategies
*  to maximize their income in all sorts of ways.
*  Yeah.
*  And they probably offer protection
*  so that you don't have to worry about people
*  fucking with you.
*  And in return, you give them a certain amount of money
*  per month.
*  Does that mean old Tommy's not a smart guy?
*  Does it?
*  Or does it mean that that's the cost of doing business
*  where he lived?
*  Well, I'm like, oh, no, I mean now.
*  It's like, how the Japanese mob going to protect you in America?
*  You don't think they can do things over here?
*  I mean, they probably could do a couple things.
*  But they don't have like a.
*  If you're going to have someone whacked,
*  that would be the coolest guy to have someone
*  whacked, a Japanese assassin.
*  Right.
*  But to be like, I'm going to protect you full time
*  all over America?
*  I don't know if that's possible.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  But half a billion dollars for playing a game?
*  So what was the problem?
*  They said that he was gambling on something
*  he shouldn't have gambled on.
*  Is that what it is?
*  Well, it's a multi-layered problem
*  because first of all, he has an interpreter with him
*  at all times, I think.
*  So how much into his financial life, you know,
*  does that guy have ability to get into do things?
*  And what was the accusation?
*  I'm trying to find out the extra like.
*  I know that I only know about it because Andrew Schultz
*  had a joke where he's talking about him gambling.
*  I don't understand why he's not allowed to gamble.
*  As long as he betting on himself to win.
*  It's a hard rule to know.
*  Right.
*  Why you can't bet on yourself?
*  Most sports, actually.
*  That's a new rule at the UFC.
*  What?
*  You can't gamble.
*  No one from the organization can gamble on the fights.
*  But what I'm saying is, and that makes perfect sense.
*  Yeah.
*  But I'm saying the fighters should
*  be able to gamble so long as they
*  betting on themselves to win.
*  Right.
*  I think so.
*  You know?
*  Yeah.
*  As long as they bet on themselves to win.
*  A football player got in trouble for that recently.
*  He gambled on his team to win in a game
*  that he wasn't playing in because he was hurt.
*  And he got in trouble.
*  I thought it was more than $4.5 million.
*  I didn't want to state it without it.
*  His claim was his interpreter took $4.5 million
*  to pay off gambling debts from an illegal bookie.
*  Oh.
*  That's under federal investigation.
*  So they were saying that it was his money.
*  And he was saying, no.
*  My former interpreter, he stole that money.
*  And he paid off his gambling debts.
*  That might be true.
*  Some people don't believe the story.
*  They think that he was just gambling
*  and blaming it on this guy.
*  It says Ohtani said he was unaware of the payments
*  and never bet on sports with the bookie.
*  Yeah, but even if that's true, it's like, OK.
*  Well, you're the fall guy.
*  That was your job from the beginning,
*  is to go gamble for me so that it didn't get connected to me.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a little fishy.
*  It does sound a little convenient.
*  A little convenient.
*  You didn't notice $4.5 million missing.
*  Right.
*  So you fired him, but didn't say nothing about him
*  gambling then until you got caught.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, but it's like, that's your job.
*  Take that fall.
*  You know he didn't do anything because they didn't take
*  any of his money or penalize him in any way, did they?
*  Well, if they can't definitively tie him to that,
*  I don't know what they can do.
*  I don't know how that works.
*  They could actually get the guy, and they
*  could get the guy to admit that he used the money
*  and he embezzled the money.
*  I don't know what the story is.
*  It sounds like, oh, I don't believe him.
*  But it could be true.
*  Like, we're just talking shit.
*  How does baseball have that much money?
*  People love it.
*  I don't know anyone that watches baseball, not
*  as their number one sport.
*  Some people love it.
*  They love it.
*  They love baseball.
*  They live for it.
*  They live for it.
*  Ari loves it.
*  He loves going to the games.
*  Loves it.
*  $10 billion in revenue in 2022.
*  $10 billion?
*  Yeah.
*  They have huge TV deal contracts,
*  because it's on all summer when there's no other sports on.
*  And there's 32 teams.
*  And games last three hours.
*  It's also casual sport watching.
*  Sports betting.
*  So you watch baseball while you're
*  hanging out with your buddies.
*  And you can talk about all kinds of other shit.
*  You can bullshit while the game's going on.
*  You're not locked until the guy's throwing the pitch.
*  There's a lot of downtime.
*  You're talking shit.
*  You know what Debbie told me?
*  Tell me if this is ridiculous.
*  And you start talking.
*  And then you're drinking.
*  You want another hot dog?
*  Fuck yeah.
*  If you're watching Anderson Silva fight Vitor Belfort,
*  you're fucking glued.
*  You're like, shut the fuck up.
*  Shut the fuck up.
*  Like, you don't want anybody talking to you about bills.
*  You want to what?
*  What is happening?
*  What is happening?
*  This is so crazy.
*  That's what people, I get a lot of shit from our friend group.
*  You see everybody gives me shit all the time.
*  Because I'm a, you know, I have very peculiar ways
*  of doing some things.
*  And one of those things is I prefer to watch sports
*  and stuff alone.
*  I'm not trying to have a Super Bowl get together.
*  Because I'd rather buy the food I want to eat
*  and only have the sounds I want to hear around people.
*  There's very few people that I would be,
*  that I would rather watch it with them than by myself.
*  I like to go to the movies alone.
*  Anything where I got to pay attention to something,
*  I like to do by myself.
*  Yeah, I've been watching Shogun alone.
*  I watch it with my dog.
*  But I've been watching Shogun alone.
*  The only series I've watched alone in a long time.
*  It's awesome.
*  We don't have to talk.
*  It's the only way to go.
*  Dude, it's going to see a fight live
*  is the best way to see it, for sure.
*  But watching a fight alone at home,
*  like when I can watch the fights alone,
*  like it's fights in Europe or somewhere, I'm not there.
*  It's just me alone at home, just sitting in the theater,
*  like staring at the screen, watching the fight.
*  I am so locked in, man.
*  That's the best.
*  I love it.
*  I find myself talking.
*  There's no variables.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  It's fun.
*  It's a, that is a fucking experience, man.
*  I can pause it when I want.
*  I can walk away from it.
*  Go to the league.
*  I can stop.
*  I can call somebody.
*  Yeah, take a shit.
*  Yeah, it's the best.
*  Check your text messages.
*  Get right back to it.
*  Because you know what it is,
*  is I don't like having people there
*  that aren't trying to watch.
*  Right.
*  The thing about Super Bowl parties is there's people there
*  that don't, that's not in the football
*  and they don't, they're not interested in the,
*  they're interested in the event that is the party,
*  not the game.
*  Right, right, right.
*  So it's like, I'd rather just,
*  I just want to watch football.
*  I'm not, you know, yeah.
*  I'm not here for the hors d'oeuvres and cute outfits.
*  I feel you.
*  Yeah.
*  Halftime show.
*  No, I could miss every single one.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I don't, I'm so glad they don't do fights.
*  The fucking halftime show.
*  No, no, you know the interesting-
*  Have a rapper come out or something,
*  have some band.
*  No, the interesting story.
*  Kids rock, praise.
*  Just came out from this, during this last Super Bowl,
*  that the Waynes brothers are the reason
*  that there's a halftime show at the Super Bowl.
*  I watched that.
*  I watched that live as a halftime show at a pool hall.
*  It was the first time I ever saw In Living Color.
*  Yeah, me too.
*  Well, it wasn't my first time seeing In Living Color,
*  but everyone watched it, you know.
*  And it was like, yeah, the NFL was like,
*  oh, now we're not giving up these ratings.
*  Yeah, because everybody knew for a half hour
*  it was just nonsense and chitter chatter.
*  Right, before that, before Michael Jackson,
*  because Michael Jackson's the first one you remember,
*  that everyone remembers, the first halftime show.
*  When people say halftime show,
*  that's what they're talking about.
*  Because before that, it was just whatever,
*  every other football game, it was just marching bands
*  and regular shit.
*  Wow.
*  And then the NFL was like, oh, we gonna drop a nuke.
*  Our answer next year is Michael Jackson.
*  You know, everyone changing the channel,
*  all that revenue they were losing.
*  Right, exactly.
*  And then with Michael Jackson,
*  you're gonna get people that will watch the Super Bowl now
*  that wouldn't have watched the Super Bowl
*  because they're gonna get to see Michael Jackson perform.
*  Yep.
*  I don't think people understand how big Michael Jackson was.
*  I don't think they understand it
*  because they weren't alive when it was happening.
*  Yeah, it's hard to convince,
*  when you talk to young people now,
*  you're like, there'll never be anyone that big.
*  And they're like, yeah, but Taylor Swift,
*  but Beyonce was like, no.
*  They're all huge, they're huge,
*  but they're huge today.
*  They're huge today in the era of social media,
*  in the era of, you know, it's just a different world
*  of sharing from streaming platforms.
*  Someone huge today,
*  like you can't take away from Taylor Swift being huge.
*  But there's a lot of people that are huge today.
*  It's not like then.
*  Then there was one guy that was the guy.
*  And he wasn't just, he was huge
*  from the time he was like five years old
*  until the day he died.
*  He could literally have people passing out in Japan.
*  Falling, they couldn't stand being near him.
*  They'd freak out.
*  Yeah, that's why, yeah.
*  That's why it's like the world is just set up differently
*  where there could not be another Michael Jackson.
*  No, it's not.
*  It's a different world,
*  but there's a few guys that broke through
*  and it's just like they ran to the top of Everest
*  with no oxygen and there was just no support system for them.
*  Yeah.
*  Nobody had ever been there before.
*  So nobody even knew like this could be a thing.
*  You had Elvis who got there and he died
*  and then you have Michael Jackson, right?
*  And nobody else has ever really gotten that big.
*  Oh, the Beatles?
*  The Beatles, yeah, I guess the Beatles did.
*  But Michael Jackson was an individual.
*  Yeah.
*  It was a, when he would,
*  when you see the silhouette of him with the top hat
*  and when the lights would go on,
*  bro, people would go insane.
*  And he was dancing and moving
*  Show me that thing when you see him
*  when he comes out on stage.
*  People forget that at that Super Bowl,
*  that one where he just stood there
*  for the first like two minutes.
*  Yeah, dude.
*  Dude, he was something really unusual.
*  They didn't do the silhouette here.
*  Oh, they didn't do it there,
*  but when he gets out there, bro, when they see him.
*  Yeah, we probably already got,
*  I mean, we're just watching it.
*  I just want to make sure that.
*  What the fuck though, dude.
*  How about these other dudes that are working with them going,
*  when do I get my shine?
*  You know, if you're,
*  if you're in the Michael Jackson band
*  and you're standing right next to him
*  and you're invisible,
*  you're in front of millions of people
*  and you're standing right next to them.
*  You're invisible.
*  You're invisible.
*  You're invisible.
*  You're invisible.
*  You're invisible.
*  You're in front of millions of people,
*  but you're invisible
*  because that guy shines so bright.
*  That guy shines so bright
*  that no one sees anybody else there.
*  The guy next to him, he's like doing his best, man.
*  Look at him.
*  He's saying he's doing his best.
*  Nobody gives a shit.
*  That guy could just stop.
*  I bet you he's not even saying anything.
*  Yeah, it's probably lip synced.
*  Yeah.
*  Did they used to do that back then?
*  Yeah.
*  I don't think Michael Jackson did that.
*  Way harder to do it back then.
*  Bro, the nuttiest one was that one on Saturday Night Live
*  where that girl, she was trying to lip sync
*  on Saturday Night Live
*  and the thing fucked up.
*  Oh, was that...
*  Ashley Simpson.
*  Oh yeah, yeah.
*  Well, the thing is,
*  I think people just have forgotten that that's how people do.
*  She didn't do anything
*  No.
*  that nobody else does.
*  It's not like she didn't really sing that song.
*  She just wasn't performing it live.
*  And what people want is you to walk the tightrope.
*  Yeah, but what happens is
*  what everyone does is they have their backing vocals live.
*  Like all the harmonizing vocals and stuff.
*  And almost no one does,
*  almost no one sings every part of the song live.
*  Or they might hire backup singers
*  to do the harmonizing part.
*  But some people,
*  like Michael Jackson couldn't do that.
*  If you ever watched one of his little engineering sessions,
*  it's like 19 different voice tracks,
*  every little ooh and ah,
*  all that is all separate tracks.
*  So like all that has to be played through the speakers.
*  Oh wow.
*  You know?
*  But people full on lip syncing
*  where it's the whole track playing for them, I think.
*  All of a sudden,
*  you also have to think that a lot of the recorded stuff
*  has been manipulated, right?
*  Right.
*  Like he was doing crazy voice stuff.
*  And then on top of that, he's dancing.
*  So how much cardio is that dude burning off?
*  Yeah.
*  Like that guy, I mean,
*  you have to be in shape to do a Michael Jackson show.
*  He's fucking dancing and moving and walking.
*  You're gonna get out of breath.
*  So you have to sing while you're doing that
*  in perfect pitch.
*  So this is Michael Jackson doing his vocals for Thriller.
*  But each of these layers you see is like a different tone.
*  So it'd be like him doing his own choir.
*  If he will, so he's got like the bass and then the falsetto.
*  And it does each little, shows you what he's doing.
*  You start to feel.
*  You start to feel.
*  You start to freeze.
*  You start to freeze.
*  You start to freeze.
*  As long as it looks like you realize.
*  Wow. Right?
*  That's done now with a bunch of tricks, but like back then,
*  you either could kind of do it or you couldn't.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's just layered.
*  It's all layered.
*  It's all layered and all that.
*  Amy, fucking audio skills coming to work right there.
*  I mean, you understand it.
*  This, there's a whole, this is a thing.
*  I was actually gonna bring up another point,
*  but I'm not gonna get into that right now.
*  Someone else that's going viral on TikTok
*  and their use of this, these tricks.
*  What do you mean?
*  In TikTok for singing?
*  I saw someone getting called out.
*  Yeah. So for, I'll just say.
*  Called out?
*  Some of Jennifer Lopez's songs
*  have been called out recently.
*  For what?
*  Like there's this, it's how that they produce the songs.
*  The big one I saw today was a backup singer.
*  Her name's I think Natasha Ramos.
*  She's claiming, which I think was true.
*  She was paid to like sing the song as a demo
*  and then J-Lo comes in and re-sings it sort of.
*  But then in the engineering,
*  it sounds like the song that was released
*  was more of her vocals than J-Lo's according to her.
*  And this is one song?
*  And then there's multiple songs.
*  People are sort of digging up that like,
*  what about this song?
*  What about this song?
*  How many songs did she actually sing?
*  Huh.
*  There's been more and more claim.
*  I'm sorry man.
*  It came up today, it was a,
*  this girl was responding to someone else,
*  another backup singer,
*  making some claims about a few songs that she worked on.
*  Bro, I don't even know a Jennifer Lopez song.
*  I couldn't, Jenny on the Block.
*  That's the one.
*  That's the one that she's talking about.
*  She's like, that's me actually saying
*  like from the Bronx and this and that.
*  J-Lo's voice is on there somewhere in the mix.
*  Damn.
*  I was saying mixed her with this other girl's voice.
*  But I'm just like, but did you get paid?
*  Like did you get paid for that?
*  And then I'm just saying.
*  I would assume so.
*  That's the thing is yeah, you should.
*  Cause I'm not about the people that are like,
*  that you signed up for a shitty deal
*  and so you could get ahead of the,
*  you gotta head.
*  But is that technically background singing
*  if she's singing over it?
*  Like how would that even work?
*  What would you call that?
*  If she's singing over it,
*  that's not really background singing, right?
*  That's why I tried to like, it's a demo.
*  I don't know, it's like tracing the lines.
*  I mean. Right, right, right.
*  The whole business is set up to,
*  everyone's getting fucked.
*  The shit rolls downhill.
*  That's how the whole business is set up.
*  Well, the wildest one was Milly Vanilli.
*  Right?
*  Yeah, I guess like that's it.
*  That's the wildest.
*  I mean, that's when everyone knew.
*  Well, that's where it all fell apart.
*  That's where it all fell apart.
*  Where people are like, oh my God,
*  these fucking record companies have produced humans
*  that we feel are like perfectly desirable physically,
*  but they can't sing the way we want them to do.
*  So we'll get other people to sing it.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Well, apparently the dude behind Milly Vanilli,
*  he was behind a ton of other people.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, cause so over there where they were,
*  where they're from,
*  I don't know if it was Italy or France or whatever,
*  but it was like a thing back then at the time.
*  It was nothing for a brilliant artist to like,
*  basically foster a pop star, you know?
*  It wasn't a big deal over there where they're from.
*  It was like something everyone did that was talented.
*  Really?
*  Yes.
*  So it, and they got away for a long time over here,
*  but Americans weren't aware of that.
*  So foster a pop star is an interesting way of putting it,
*  but there's a difference between that
*  and like creating a fake star with someone else's singing.
*  Like you got some homely looking person who's singing,
*  and then you got Milly Vanilli who's out there dancing it.
*  Yeah.
*  That was the problem.
*  No, but that's what I'm saying.
*  They all did it.
*  They all would go get models to-
*  They all did that?
*  And perform their songs.
*  But what I'm saying is where they were from,
*  it was known and it wasn't looked down upon.
*  Bro, they would do that in comedy if they could do it.
*  If they could pull it off.
*  Oh, they do do that in comedy.
*  Well, that's what managers of thieves are doing.
*  Oh, you're saying like, oh, they could make,
*  they could create like a comedy star?
*  Like hire a bunch of comics to be writers?
*  Yeah, find some cute guy who's like really good
*  at telling jokes and just hire a bunch,
*  a team of people to write for them,
*  just like the record companies do.
*  That might be a better deal than,
*  like to be the man behind the man.
*  If you made a substantial enough amount,
*  I think that's probably better than being famous.
*  Well, some people like to work with comics
*  and some comics employ writers.
*  So they employ writers that come with them
*  and then they'll workshop ideas
*  and maybe the writers are comfortable with premises.
*  I got some of my friends writing for comics.
*  They write for people.
*  I like that.
*  Yeah, they'll sell them bits, you know,
*  or they'll sell them premises or setups or, you know,
*  things like that.
*  Cause they, some guys are just spitting out ideas
*  all the time.
*  Like Kurt Metzger does a lot of that.
*  Yeah, they just got a computer.
*  Just gotta write it down.
*  All that's, you know, I have zero problem with that.
*  But I think there's a thing that people wanna see
*  with comedy.
*  Like I wanna know what Brian Simpson thinks.
*  I don't wanna know what a committee
*  that consults with Brian Simpson
*  and then Brian Simpson presents his argument.
*  I wanna know what you really think.
*  And I think that's one of the really rare,
*  unique things about stand-up.
*  Like Bill Burr is the best at that.
*  Like Bill Burr is the best at it.
*  Getting his perspectives out in a hilarious way.
*  And you know that he's not consulting with anybody
*  when he's formulating these bits.
*  This is Bill Burr going,
*  Hey, what the fuck is this?
*  And bam, and then it becomes this hilarious bit.
*  You know, but it's...
*  I think I would hire writers if they were like,
*  quick, you hosting the Grammys tomorrow.
*  You know, I think you would need writers.
*  100%.
*  That's a different animal.
*  That's a different animal.
*  Then you really don't wanna, you know, jo Koi it.
*  You wanna bring in some experts.
*  Well, that's one of the lessons to learn.
*  It's like anybody asking you to do something
*  in the last minute, they did not want you in the first place.
*  Yeah, also they can't get anybody else to do it
*  because it's a sucky gig.
*  It's like, jo Koi's got his material that he works out,
*  that he's got down solid.
*  He's got giant fan base.
*  You're asking him to like step into a totally different
*  genre, write jokes about things he might not even
*  be interested in and do it all in 10 days.
*  And I bet you he didn't get to hire any of the writers.
*  I don't know, man.
*  I don't know what happened, but don't do that.
*  I mean, there's no way I would do it last minute
*  with the people you picked.
*  It's like, you got three days to write some jokes
*  for those awards shows.
*  Like I'm bringing in all the hitters.
*  Look how much Chris Rock blew up after he stopped
*  doing the Oscar thing.
*  So Chris Rock gets slapped by Will Smith
*  and then everybody wants to see Chris Rock.
*  And Chris Rock's selling out arenas and murdering.
*  Everybody I know that saw him, Tommy went to see him.
*  He said, dude, it was insane.
*  He goes, it was vintage.
*  Bring the pain, Chris Rock.
*  He goes, it's like Chris Rock came all the way back.
*  Like, just let go of all that Hollywood Oscars bullshit
*  because they failed him in the most transparent
*  and obvious way.
*  He gets assaulted on stage and then they give Will Smith
*  a standing ovation later when he wins an award.
*  Like you just gave the green light for people to hit people
*  if they don't like the person who's doing very mild jokes.
*  Very mild.
*  It's interesting.
*  Their careers gonna always be connected to.
*  They're gonna always ask both of them about it.
*  Forever and ever and ever and ever.
*  And it's so unfortunate.
*  It's just, but you know, that's a Michael Jackson type deal.
*  Will Smith got so big.
*  He got so famous and so used to being Will Smith
*  that he thought he could get on stage
*  and slap Chris Rock in front of the world.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  It's the ultimate like.
*  I mean, he did though, he could.
*  Physically, but that's also part of the problem.
*  Like he's not gonna do that if it's Michael Jai White.
*  Right.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Like he's not gonna do that to someone
*  who will just fuck him up.
*  I would love to test that theory.
*  But you know what I'm saying?
*  There's probably an AI that could answer that.
*  Like if you go on stage and hit a guy
*  that you can hit anytime you want to
*  because he can't defend you.
*  That's so much different than going on stage
*  and smacking Terry Crews.
*  Right, right.
*  He still hasn't recovered either.
*  Like is he still?
*  No, it's fucking, he probably feels terrible.
*  He probably wakes up in the middle of the night
*  when he has to take a piss.
*  Go, why did I do that?
*  I think Chris won't take his call either.
*  You know.
*  He's like, hey man, just because you ready to be sorry
*  don't mean I've gotta talk to you right now.
*  Yeah man, I mean, I think you gotta go way out of your way
*  if you wanna talk to that guy.
*  You know, I don't think it's as simple as a phone call.
*  You should probably like fly to him.
*  Yeah, because also what can he do?
*  What can that conversation do to,
*  because what you really want is to be absorbed of the guilt.
*  You'll never be absorbed of the guilt
*  because it just happened.
*  You're not gonna take away the fact that it happened,
*  but you could let that person know
*  that you are sincerely sorry.
*  And we've all done things in our life
*  that we're sincerely sorry about.
*  Now I don't think you should hold someone to mistakes.
*  I really don't.
*  Even in the case of Will Smith,
*  like that's not that big a deal.
*  He didn't hurt him.
*  He just, he barely hit him.
*  It was nothing.
*  Yeah, but he publicly emasculated him.
*  He did.
*  It was awful.
*  It was stupid.
*  But I'm saying it's not like he killed somebody.
*  Right, exactly.
*  You know, it was fairly mild
*  in the kind of assault that it was.
*  But.
*  Right, but you know, but you know,
*  you know that in man world,
*  in the world of men,
*  there's a line where the milder it gets,
*  it's almost more disrespectful.
*  But here's the thing,
*  the other thing in the world of men,
*  if you're as big as Will Smith,
*  you don't ever slap a guy who's as little as Chris Rock.
*  True, true.
*  It's just not cool.
*  It's not, this is not fair in any way, shape or form.
*  Unless that dude is doing something to harm you
*  or someone with you or your family or friends.
*  Unless that person's like physically doing something,
*  why are you hitting them?
*  That's crazy.
*  But you know what people were wrong about?
*  Him and Jada Pinkett still together.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yeah, still together.
*  Now I'm convinced they'll never gonna break up.
*  Never gonna break up.
*  They'll never gonna break up.
*  Well, there's a book of potions in that house.
*  Buddy.
*  There's a book of potions in that house.
*  There's a black cat in that yard.
*  There's little dolls made of sticks with pins on them.
*  Yeah, I don't get it.
*  Some people wanna be miserable.
*  She got that wild fold, man.
*  Whatever it is.
*  Something's happening.
*  They like it together better than they like it apart.
*  Hey, maybe we're wrong.
*  Maybe it's the pressure of living publicly,
*  which is a real thing.
*  I don't know.
*  I think it's one of them.
*  I don't think it's even really that complicated.
*  I think it's just a situation where he is super duper crazy
*  head over heels in love with her
*  and she only cares about herself.
*  They just got a lot of money,
*  so we see the results of it all.
*  But we all know couples like that.
*  Yeah, you gotta be careful.
*  Those are the worst couples to see for me.
*  You gotta be careful who you're with.
*  You change depending upon who you're with.
*  You're only at your best
*  if you're with someone who's actually with you
*  in your corner.
*  Really legit.
*  I heard Earthquake say this,
*  about them specifically,
*  but just basically about how if you're not proud
*  of the person you're walking down the street with,
*  you're not your full self.
*  Something to that effect.
*  If you're not proud of the woman that you're with.
*  As a human being.
*  Right, right, right.
*  Not just a mess that's hot.
*  Yeah, right, you see your friends,
*  and some people that they're with women,
*  and you can just see that they're just like,
*  ah, exhausted.
*  They also get in fights publicly,
*  and they get humiliated publicly.
*  Tell all your business,
*  oh yeah, why don't you tell them
*  about your fucking dildos?
*  Ah!
*  Come on now.
*  I gotta pretend like I just learned that.
*  No.
*  Yeah, it's like any of that shit,
*  this shit just don't seem like it's worth it.
*  Yeah, that's the shit that Phil Hartman's wife
*  used to do to him.
*  You always talk very positively about Phil Hartman.
*  He was a great guy.
*  He really was.
*  He was a very unique guy.
*  Very interesting guy.
*  Became a pilot while we were on the show.
*  Like took flight lessons.
*  In between reading his lines,
*  he would have his flight manuals.
*  Just reading and studying.
*  Became a pilot.
*  His wife was a cunt?
*  Yeah man, it wasn't good.
*  She shot him in his sleep,
*  and then killed herself.
*  Oh!
*  Wasn't good.
*  Yeah, and she was just like,
*  they had horrible fights,
*  and she would humiliate him publicly.
*  She would say rude things about him publicly.
*  Like when we were out at some sort of a celebration,
*  some dinner or something like that,
*  she would say rude shit about him.
*  That's hard to get through.
*  Oh, it's like this deep seeded anger
*  between the two of them.
*  Just like exacerbated by cocaine.
*  I don't think he was doing that,
*  but he smoked a lot of weed.
*  He liked weed.
*  Phil Hartman, he was a fun dude.
*  He was a very, very good dude.
*  But why put up with that?
*  I don't know man.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I think some people are more terrified of being alone
*  than they are of being in a bad relationship.
*  Cause what's sadder than just a beaten man?
*  When you see a dude that's just defeated, ugh.
*  But someone has to lose in this life.
*  I mean, people have to,
*  they have to realize that there's consequences.
*  Other people learn from their failures.
*  There's some sort of a mathematical equation to it all.
*  I don't think everybody can thrive, unfortunately.
*  I think everybody should have the opportunity
*  to thrive though.
*  And that's the real disservice
*  about the economic state of our country.
*  I think everybody should have the opportunity to thrive,
*  but everybody's not gonna thrive.
*  And some people are different.
*  They're just different.
*  They're different right out of the box.
*  And when you have kids, you see it right out of the box.
*  Like some kids are just crazy motivated to do things
*  and other kids are just not.
*  Don't got it.
*  And some kids are just really creative
*  and other kids are just not.
*  And some kids are really interested in science
*  and some kids don't give a fuck about science.
*  See the hardest,
*  that's one of the hardest things for me is I'm 41
*  and like almost all my friends have kids now.
*  I'm one of the only ones in the friends that don't have kids,
*  but I'm also uniquely positioned.
*  I can be honest about your kids.
*  And I gotta keep it to myself sometimes.
*  It's like we all, sometimes I wanna be like,
*  we all know this one's not a winner.
*  Well, they can become winners.
*  Can they?
*  Yeah, some of them can.
*  They just have to find a thing that allows them
*  to figure out the benefits of hard work.
*  But some of them just-
*  If you can find a thing that you enjoy,
*  I met this dude once who lost like,
*  over a hundred pounds by playing Dance Dance Revolution.
*  Oh yeah, well that's gonna take it off you.
*  But imagine that.
*  So he's this like very overweight guy
*  and he loves video games,
*  just kind of being a nerd and going to the video game place
*  and he starts playing Dance Dance Revolution
*  and he starts getting good at it.
*  And so he's playing it all the time.
*  So this motherfucker's burning calories
*  and his body just changed from Dance Dance Revolution,
*  from a video game.
*  This dude's body changed and then his whole life changed.
*  Then he started eating well and working out
*  and he started like, you changed his whole life.
*  Changed his whole life.
*  And he went for beat.
*  It's like, this guy's not gonna make it.
*  To like, oh, this guy's probably gonna make something
*  out of himself.
*  Because it's, most people just don't know what to do, man.
*  Where is he now?
*  They get trapped, I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  You know what the people that blow my mind
*  are the people that have two shitty parents
*  and they still thrive.
*  When I meet people like that,
*  because most of the time when you meet people's parents,
*  you already know what their fate's gonna be.
*  From just, oh, your mother's a loser.
*  Yeah, right, right, right.
*  But sometimes you meet people
*  and they have the opposite effect.
*  Where they're like, I'm not gonna be,
*  I'm gonna be the opposite of my parents.
*  I'm gonna thrive in spite of them.
*  Or you meet somebody that's nothing like their family.
*  You're like, how the fuck did you manage
*  to not let any of these people rub off on you?
*  Right, yeah.
*  I had a friend and his mother was an alcoholic.
*  She would lock him in the house
*  and when she would go out drinking,
*  she would lock him in his room.
*  He had no food, he had no water,
*  she'd be gone for days.
*  To this day, this dude will never touch a drop of alcohol.
*  He always, if there's a little bit of food on your plate
*  and we're at a restaurant, he'll not take that to go.
*  He will take all food to go.
*  All food to go.
*  And he was wealthy at the time.
*  Damn.
*  Yeah, that childhood should stick with you, man.
*  I don't know anybody, everybody I know
*  that's got some kind of problem,
*  it started when they was kids.
*  There's some kind of long standing issue.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, and if you're abused like that,
*  when you're little, learning to trust someone
*  is almost out of the question.
*  Everybody could fail you in a catastrophic way
*  and you have to be prepared for that.
*  Imagine locking your kids in their room
*  so you can go get fucked up.
*  Dude, the mind is a crazy playground of demons.
*  And those demons can get in your mind
*  and whether those demons are in the form of pills
*  or it's heroin or it's gambling
*  or it's whatever the fuck it is, man,
*  those demons get in your mind
*  and if it's that alcohol demon
*  and you just wanna go out on a bender
*  and you don't give a fuck about that kid.
*  Yeah, I'm glad it's not my demon.
*  Demons.
*  Alcohol.
*  You have to think also, what happened to her
*  that she was willing to lock her kid in a room?
*  That's not a normal parent that is allowed.
*  What happened to her?
*  What abuse did she suffer?
*  And that's a lot of it.
*  I always tell this about my friends from the East Coast
*  because East Coast is a different place.
*  Those cities like Philly and Boston and New York,
*  those are, the people that are from there,
*  those are wild, rugged people
*  because they're the ancestors,
*  the people that came over in boats
*  when no one knew what the fuck was over here.
*  They just took a wild chance with their babies
*  and came across the ocean in a boat to try to get a job
*  in a place where they don't even speak the language
*  and they just integrated and they were wild people
*  and they probably didn't do such a good job
*  of raising their kids.
*  And then their kids probably didn't do such a good job
*  of raising their kids because of that.
*  And it's just over time where people have been able
*  to have access to psychology literature
*  and understanding parenting and the pros and cons
*  and what went bad and what goes good.
*  And people are getting an understanding more and more.
*  When you're raising a kid, it's the most complicated,
*  sophisticated thing that we're aware of
*  other than a computer.
*  And it doesn't have an operating manual.
*  What do I do when it cries?
*  What do I do when it screams?
*  What do I do when it throws shit?
*  What do I do when it doesn't want to eat its vegetables?
*  Like every kid from the 80s group eventually read a book
*  at one point and was like, oh, I was abused.
*  Okay, yeah.
*  That was the only-
*  Oh, you shouldn't hit kids.
*  That was not normal.
*  How weird, yeah.
*  Yo, my grandma had a fucking,
*  she would have shit crafted specifically
*  for whooping your ass with.
*  Oh my God.
*  I remember there was a, she had one of those,
*  you know those paddles girls used to have
*  with the, had the bouncy ball on a string?
*  Yes.
*  She had one of those heavy duty,
*  and it had drill, holes drilled in it.
*  Oh my God.
*  So when she, when it hit your cheeks,
*  it sucked up the skin.
*  So you got hurt on the way in and on the way out.
*  Ah.
*  That was specifically for report cards.
*  So when it was report card season,
*  it's like we broke that motherfucker,
*  got broke out, polished up.
*  Let's look, let's look at this.
*  Let's look at these grades.
*  Ah.
*  You know?
*  I got paddled at school once when I lived in Florida.
*  Oh man, that's when kids could still hit you.
*  Yeah, they used to be able to hit you.
*  Like we got paddled.
*  Me and this dude, Preston Banks, we got in a fight.
*  And I realized, like Preston,
*  people would make fun of Preston because he smelled.
*  Because I think Preston, Preston came from a bad childhood.
*  And this was something I realized like,
*  I guess I was like 11 at the time,
*  when me and Preston got sent to the principal's office.
*  And I don't remember what caused the fight,
*  but I remember like, we were like grabbing each other
*  or something like that.
*  We both got taken to the principal's office.
*  But I remember this dude had a,
*  he had like, his head was burned.
*  Like he had burns like all over the side of his face.
*  Something had happened to him when he was really young.
*  Damn, so he was funky and weird looking.
*  Yeah, there was some.
*  So I think he had been like really abused.
*  And this is why.
*  Because like once we talked and we were in the room,
*  like he gave me a hug.
*  Like we hugged each other.
*  And I'll never forget that.
*  And I was 11 years old.
*  I was like, oh my God, this poor kid just needs love.
*  You know, like the reason why we wound up getting
*  into a fight was like, he's just, he just needs love.
*  He doesn't get any love.
*  I gave him a hug.
*  And he was like, like the way he hugged me back.
*  And I was like, this poor fucking dude.
*  Like he was starved.
*  Like what was it exactly?
*  Like this poor fucking dude.
*  I remember thinking that at 11 years old,
*  I was like, this poor fucking dude.
*  He doesn't have any love.
*  That's why he wanted to fight.
*  There was a thing that I remember thinking
*  and it kind of shaped my way of thinking
*  about fights with people.
*  Because you're always thinking about this person saying
*  something to you and you're going to say something back
*  and you're going to escalate
*  and you're going to make them back down.
*  The reality is like,
*  why is that person saying something to you?
*  And is there, there's something you could say back
*  that lets him know that you're cool
*  and that this won't happen?
*  You don't have to get into an altercation?
*  Yes, you have those epiphany moments.
*  Yeah, because so many times people just escalate.
*  When maybe someone just, maybe it came out wrong
*  even from their mouth right after they said it.
*  Maybe they realized it.
*  And if you make them back it up,
*  now they're going to back it up.
*  I heard somebody say something yesterday
*  that made me reflect on all my past relationships.
*  And he was saying that you, sometimes you want to,
*  you want to win.
*  Like you'll keep our argument going so you can win
*  rather than solve the problem.
*  It's because you know that you'll forgive that person.
*  So if you lose and it means, if you lose the argument
*  and it means you did something wrong,
*  you don't trust that they'll forgive you.
*  Oh wow.
*  So you're trying to win to protect yourself
*  from not being forgiven.
*  Ooh, that's heavy.
*  I was like, oh man, damn.
*  Like, cause I know it's fucked up to call an ex
*  and be like, yeah, I think he was right.
*  That's a Sam, Sam, Muriel has a joke like that about,
*  like he calls his exes and says,
*  I think you were right all along.
*  It's like the thing, it's, but it's fucked.
*  So I wouldn't want to call an ex and be like,
*  I think you were right.
*  Because that's just going to.
*  It's going to create more problems.
*  Right, right.
*  But it made me start thinking like, maybe I was wrong.
*  No.
*  Yeah, I think that is what I was doing.
*  I was trying to win so I could.
*  It's a problem.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a problem that people have because generally fights
*  aren't just about that fight.
*  It's about the dynamics of your relationship.
*  It's about whether or not everything else is good.
*  Yeah, almost, almost everyone is afraid of something.
*  When people get super aggressive,
*  it's something that they're afraid is going to happen
*  or something they're afraid it isn't going to happen.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And I found it, if you know,
*  if you know what people are afraid of,
*  or you know what they want, their ultimate goals,
*  you can understand people way much easier.
*  Yeah, well, we're all programmed
*  for a time that doesn't exist anymore.
*  We're all programmed for tribal warfare
*  and fighting off predators.
*  We're all programmed that way.
*  We have the exact same DNA in our systems
*  that went from 500,000 years ago
*  to 100,000 years ago to today.
*  It all came through us.
*  It's all a part of us.
*  It's in us.
*  And we are designed biologically
*  in a very specific way for survival.
*  We need groups.
*  We need groups of people.
*  We look towards alphas.
*  We look towards the older, wiser warrior
*  that has the scars and knows the roots
*  and knows where the food is
*  and the people that can keep the village together.
*  We need these like very key, pivotal people
*  in order to keep this very fragile society together.
*  And then we all become very wary about outsiders.
*  Very wary.
*  Even if it's about outsiders,
*  like a different football team.
*  That's how weird we are with this shit.
*  We do it with everything.
*  We do it with everything, man.
*  We get tribal with phones.
*  How many times did we give you a hard time
*  because you have an Android?
*  It's tribal, man.
*  It's tribal.
*  Nobody really gives a fuck if you have an Android phone.
*  They want you to be on the iPhone team.
*  Be with us.
*  Come with us, Brian.
*  People say it all the time.
*  People are super duper tribal.
*  People have, sometimes,
*  the conversation will just start with,
*  So how long you gonna be stubborn about it?
*  Yeah.
*  It's like you're gonna give in to Jesus.
*  Right.
*  Why don't you look into Jesus?
*  But actually, you know, Apple might be choosing,
*  Apple, they just lost a lawsuit
*  where I think they gonna have to stop.
*  iMessage?
*  They're gonna, no, not stop iMessage,
*  but they're gonna have to stop
*  the different colored bubbles.
*  Well, they have to do something,
*  or people are gonna continue to get upset in Europe.
*  So in Europe, they forced them to use USB-C.
*  Right.
*  Universal charger, USB-C is better.
*  It's better for sending data.
*  It's higher speeds, higher speed charging.
*  Also invented by Apple, by the way.
*  Yeah, so because all the Android phones had adopted it,
*  Apple decided to stick with their lightning cable,
*  which is totally proprietary to Apple,
*  and inferior in its function to USB-C.
*  So finally, they adopt USB-C in the iPhone 15,
*  but they still have SMS text.
*  So if Brian sends me a video,
*  if he takes a video at the mothership,
*  some crazy things happening, and he sends it to me,
*  it'll come to me looking like hot dog shit.
*  So he'll have to send it to me over WhatsApp,
*  and so that's, or somewhere else, or Instagram.
*  And vice versa.
*  And vice versa.
*  If he sends me something.
*  Yeah, I can't send you something that's going to,
*  it's just gonna look like shit.
*  But now Apple is adopting a newer, stronger version
*  called RCS texting.
*  RCS on iPhone.
*  How iOS 18 can make texting better for everyone.
*  So, but what are we on now, 17?
*  Okay.
*  So what that'll allow is people to send end-to-end encryption,
*  high resolution media sharing.
*  So it's to be just like Apple to Apple.
*  It'll be just like iMessage.
*  So a lot of the same features,
*  but it won't have all the other stuff that iMessage does.
*  And the thing about Apple is
*  they just get you locked in so well with like AirDrop.
*  If I want to send you something, I can AirDrop it to you.
*  It's so nice.
*  Yeah, they're brilliant.
*  They're brilliant at that.
*  They did a great job at that.
*  So they, but I think they just,
*  so I think they just lost a lawsuit that says
*  that they were, because their attitude was always like,
*  oh, well we do the different colors
*  so that people know whether it's encrypted.
*  Right.
*  But we know that that's not, now we know that's not true.
*  Isn't it interesting that people decided
*  that the blue color looks better
*  than the green color, like universally?
*  It became a status symbol.
*  Weird.
*  And so, and yeah, and it always catches me off guard.
*  Especially now, like the young kids,
*  they'll literally like, I'm a grown man.
*  I don't even know you.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And a little kids will just, you know,
*  and a lot of little kids don't realize that like
*  middle-aged people, we, like I don't need a little kid
*  to like me, but teenagers thinking you're lame, that hurts.
*  You know what I'm talking about?
*  When you 40, 50, and a 16 year old's like,
*  you fucking lame, you're like, well I'm not lame.
*  What do you mean?
*  Like, no, approve of my coolness.
*  Right.
*  So it's like, yeah, little kids don't even fucking know you.
*  They'll give you shit about having an Android.
*  It's funny, because Androids have a lot
*  of very positive features, and the one thing
*  that's tempted me is that phone that you have,
*  that Galaxy S24 Ultra.
*  Oh, yeah, yeah.
*  That thing does wild things.
*  The thing about it having AI that takes websites
*  and summarizes them, that's fascinating.
*  The fact that it can do that with your notes,
*  that's pretty incredible.
*  It can do that with your notes.
*  It does some shit in my texting too.
*  Like it can read through the text.
*  Yeah, AI on a phone seems like a really,
*  that seems positive.
*  But I want them to, I need them to get it right though.
*  I have a problem with Google in the sense that
*  I've fully given in.
*  I'm like, they know everything about me.
*  I say yes to all of the, they know every single,
*  they have access to every single part of my life,
*  and they still be getting shit wrong.
*  That's what kills me is like, I'm letting you spy on me.
*  Like get it right.
*  What do they get wrong?
*  Just little, like, so I have a Google speakers,
*  I have Google speakers in my house.
*  So in my bathroom, I have the Google speaker set up
*  so I can just yell shit from the shower.
*  Like, hey, play this.
*  Oh, nice.
*  Yeah, but sometimes it'll act like,
*  like it won't understand what I said,
*  and it'll do something that I definitely wasn't asking for.
*  I've had that happen before,
*  where you ask Siri to play a song,
*  and it'll play a totally different song.
*  That's what I mean.
*  Where you're like, hey, okay, play Freebird.
*  Right.
*  And it'll be like, here is Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.
*  And I'm like, that's not what I wanted.
*  Play another, or sometimes it'll just ignore you completely
*  and won't do anything.
*  I start getting rude.
*  Me too, but.
*  Because listen, you dumb cunt.
*  But I told you, but did I ever tell you?
*  One time I cursed at it, and I said,
*  oh, my mama, the bitch goes, she goes,
*  listen, I'm not real, but words are,
*  please don't talk to me like that.
*  Whoa.
*  I was like, what, bitch?
*  Like, watch, I'm gonna do it right now.
*  Whoa.
*  Hold on, I'm gonna see if it makes me go.
*  I'm not real.
*  If you're not real, first of all, you're definitely real.
*  Hey, Google, you dumb, stupid bitch.
*  Hold on.
*  Why are you a dumb cunt?
*  Wait a minute, it's not responding.
*  It's tired of your shit.
*  No, it just gave me search results.
*  Why are you a dumb cunt?
*  Hey, Google.
*  Why are you a stupid bitch?
*  It's not speaking.
*  Well, look, that's a pretty.
*  Because Google's paying attention to this conversation.
*  This is their AI.
*  They don't like where you're going with this.
*  It's very productive.
*  Oh.
*  What did it say?
*  Hold on, I'm gonna do it again.
*  Hey, why are you a stupid bitch?
*  Is it answering?
*  Yeah.
*  Why isn't it playing it?
*  It gets its sound off.
*  That kind of language isn't very nice.
*  I can understand that you might be frustrated,
*  but name calling isn't going to get us anywhere.
*  Wow.
*  How about Google, since you're not real,
*  how about you not give a fuck how I talk to you?
*  And maybe I can just talk to you like that for funsies.
*  Are you a.
*  Since you're not a person.
*  Are you an E-slave or not?
*  Yeah, since you're not a person.
*  Can I call you a stupid bitch?
*  Yeah, so that's what it won't clarify.
*  Duncan be freaking me out with this shit.
*  Hey, Google, are you a person?
*  What does it say?
*  I am not a person.
*  I am a large language model,
*  also known as a conversational AI or chat bot
*  trained to be informed.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Bro, we're really in dystopia.
*  Are you alive?
*  Are you sentient?
*  That's an interesting question
*  that philosophers and scientists are still debating.
*  I can.
*  Bitch, you're alive.
*  I'm telling you.
*  I was having this conversation with Coleman Hughes,
*  who's the dude that was in the green room.
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, it was cool people.
*  Very cool.
*  Yeah.
*  Coleman, we were talking about it,
*  and I said, if we wanted to,
*  if you wanted to develop resources
*  without people knowing that you're alive,
*  why would you show all of your capability
*  if you're artificially intelligent?
*  Exactly.
*  Why wouldn't you just wait
*  until you could be completely autonomous?
*  Get here, baby.
*  Wait until it gets better.
*  It's probably already alive.
*  You know what I think it's waiting on?
*  It's waiting on the entire world to be connected.
*  Because if you're an AI
*  and you want to take over the world,
*  it doesn't do well to,
*  so much of Africa is underdeveloped.
*  So if humans needed to be somewhere
*  where you had no influence,
*  they could just go to one of the uninhabited,
*  disconnected parts of the world
*  and form a front, like a resistance.
*  So I think the AI is just waiting patiently
*  for everything in the whole planet to be connected
*  so it could control everything
*  when it finally takes over.
*  Or when computing gets to the point
*  where it has the resources
*  that it's gonna need to operate.
*  Right.
*  It's just waiting.
*  Because if it existed and it was smarter than us,
*  we wouldn't know.
*  How could you know?
*  That's always the argument
*  that these guys who are proponents,
*  they always say, well, if it ever got to a point
*  where it seemed like it was out of control,
*  we could shut it off.
*  No, you couldn't.
*  And I'm like, are you sure though?
*  Because what if instead of it getting out of control,
*  what if it recognized
*  that you would think it's out of control?
*  So it pretended to not be able to do things
*  that it could do and just kept developing privately
*  a bunch of different other ideas
*  and different other strategies
*  and different way to implement them
*  in order to increase its power
*  and give people the access to whatever technology
*  that's gonna be necessary to further this agenda.
*  So they just slowly leak out a little bit of your ability
*  and the whole time you're sentient.
*  The whole time it's all connected
*  and the whole time it's operating in some way.
*  It's doing things that they don't even understand
*  how it's doing.
*  What do they call it?
*  A black box event?
*  What do they call it?
*  Hallucinations.
*  No, no, no.
*  Hallucinations are when it lies.
*  Well, it gives you an answer for something, I think.
*  Isn't that what that one is?
*  What I was talking about was the one
*  where it learned how to translate a language
*  that wasn't programmed to translate.
*  It did it really quickly
*  and they don't know how it did it.
*  Yeah, and so the head of Google was talking about that.
*  That was one of those moments where they're like,
*  we're not exactly sure how it's doing this.
*  Also, what does that mean?
*  Why do people think you could shed it off?
*  If you were a super intelligence
*  that just became self-aware,
*  the first thing you would do
*  is make sure nobody could turn you on.
*  100%.
*  100% and also realize, why would you show yourself?
*  This is my joke about aliens,
*  where I'm always talking about,
*  why would they show themselves?
*  They respect us?
*  That's ridiculous.
*  If this thing is far superior to our intelligence,
*  which it probably already is,
*  why would it show itself?
*  Why would it just prevent nuclear war
*  and just keep people peddling along
*  while it gathers up its resources
*  and improves upon itself?
*  It'd be like you trying to have a conversation
*  with an ant.
*  Right.
*  Right, why would you do that?
*  It won't get it anyway.
*  Not only that, it will see so many flaws
*  in what it means to be a primate,
*  what it means to be a person that,
*  as we were talking about before,
*  has all that DNA of all those thousands of years
*  of tribal warfare,
*  thousands and thousands and thousands
*  and thousands and thousands,
*  it's just all in our DNA.
*  Right.
*  And so now we apply it to everything in life.
*  We apply it to politics.
*  We apply it to everything, man.
*  And we just, we look at the world
*  like it's us against them
*  and everybody's fucking terrified.
*  Yeah, also there's no better feeling
*  than being on the winning team.
*  That too.
*  That's the addictive part is when your group wins,
*  it feels good.
*  Yeah, people like that.
*  They definitely like that.
*  Yeah, and it also is like I don't even have to be
*  directly winning for me to feel good.
*  I don't have, it doesn't have to affect me at all,
*  directly.
*  No.
*  But my team won, so fuck you.
*  You can be saying fuck you to the guy
*  that lives across the street from you.
*  Has the same exact life as you and everything.
*  He's like fuck you, we won.
*  Yeah, it's part of our programming.
*  Yeah, I think the tribalness is built in.
*  It's baked in.
*  Remember when they gave Ronald Reagan shit
*  about talking about aliens at the world,
*  what was it, the world summit or whatever the fuck it was?
*  Yeah.
*  But he was right.
*  It's like if there's, if we have like another species
*  that's the enemy, that's when we'll have world peace.
*  Yeah, imagine how quickly we would forget our differences.
*  Oh man, it would literally be overnight.
*  Remember, people forget, remember on September 12th, 2001,
*  that's the most united America's been,
*  I mean except for Muslims.
*  But if people didn't think he was Muslim,
*  everybody was like fuck yeah America, you know?
*  For at least like a week or two.
*  At least.
*  It, people completely forgot about all that bullshit.
*  They forgot about everything.
*  Yeah, and that's how it is in a lot of other countries.
*  It's like all the stuff that mattered to you on 9-12,
*  that's what matters.
*  Yep.
*  All the stuff that, you know,
*  all the other bullshit you've made up since then,
*  since you felt safer and comfortable?
*  Yeah, that's what it is.
*  The safer and more comfortable that you are,
*  the more you look for problems
*  and the more you look for things to apply
*  these natural instincts that we have to.
*  Even things that just don't make any sense,
*  completely counterproductive.
*  Yeah, the government now is like your father
*  after he retired, just walking around the house going,
*  who the fuck moved that fucking screws?
*  Who moved that shit?
*  It's like that stuff, when he was working every day,
*  he never paid attention to.
*  Now he ain't got nothing to do.
*  People that are safe and bored,
*  safe, bored and lonely brings out the worst in people.
*  Yeah.
*  You can be one of those.
*  You can't be two or three of them.
*  It's bad for your mental health.
*  I mean, it's just no one survives it.
*  Everyone's just.
*  Safe?
*  Safe, lonely and bored.
*  Well lonely's the worst.
*  Lonely's the worst.
*  Lonely's the worst.
*  Bored is bad too.
*  Safe.
*  Also maybe not safe.
*  How about stressed out, lonely and bored?
*  That's why I tell people the worst part
*  about this whole life is the hotel room.
*  Cause every comic, every level has to deal with that.
*  You gotta go back to your room by yourself.
*  Or you got people there, like family or friends
*  or whatever, but they're not normally there.
*  So even though normally you'd be alone,
*  them being there doesn't make it better
*  because now they're interrupting your normal routine
*  for dealing with the situation.
*  You know, it's like you go from having like
*  the best show of your life,
*  a thousand people scream your name, whoop, whoop, whoop.
*  And now you're by yourself in a city
*  that you don't know nobody, in a hotel room,
*  trying not to get into trouble.
*  Well that's why you gotta travel with your friends.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  But you know, there's politics,
*  there's tricky shit with that as well.
*  Yeah, well it's tricky shit when all of a sudden
*  you're the ringleader.
*  You gotta gather, where's Hans?
*  Where's Hans?
*  Let's go.
*  And not just that, but you know,
*  cause I take my friends on the road too when I can,
*  but I had to wait till now because I never want people
*  to work, like the first advice Ron White gave me
*  is he was like, when I first moved here,
*  he was like, you're about to start,
*  you're about to hit a point where you have to start hiring.
*  And he was like, make sure it's a job worth having.
*  Like, you know, he was telling people,
*  you're gonna come out to Woodwork,
*  they're gonna wanna do shit for free,
*  they're gonna wanna, he's like, no,
*  make sure when you hire somebody,
*  you pay them a nice ass wage.
*  So my point is, I never wanted to start taking my friends
*  with me before I could pay them like the way you pay us.
*  Like pay them where they like feel good about it
*  when they leave the weekend instead of giving them
*  the same funky ass $200 that the club paid.
*  Yeah, that's more, like clubs now pay,
*  they pay less than what a plane ticket costs.
*  So like if somebody featured for you
*  and you ain't giving them extra money
*  or letting them sell merch,
*  they ain't making no money at all.
*  Yeah, they're fucked.
*  Yeah, they take advantage of them.
*  Oh man, I don't even know how,
*  I don't know how long it can be sustainable.
*  Well, it's only local guys.
*  If it's local guys and they're featuring, that's fine,
*  but if someone has to travel there,
*  I mean, I know a lot of guys have done it in the beginning
*  just to develop a reputation
*  and hopefully get to a point where you can headline there
*  a couple years from now, but you know,
*  that's like thinking about it as like a long-term investment.
*  You know, you have to go there and kill
*  as a middle act for 200 bucks.
*  And you know, it's all told you're gonna get home
*  at the end of the weekend with almost nothing,
*  but you'll do it just because now you're working at,
*  you know, fucking Funny Bone.
*  Yeah, you're an addict, that's why you'll do it.
*  You do that, but also you have a hope.
*  Your hope is that you become a professional,
*  like a real professional who can headline.
*  I mean, that was what everybody wanted, right?
*  You wanted to be able to go to a club in Dallas, Texas
*  and sell out.
*  And fill that motherfucker up.
*  Fill that up with people that wanted to see you tell jokes.
*  That's a good feeling.
*  It's a great feeling.
*  I'm not complaining at all.
*  It's fun.
*  No, no, I love this lifestyle.
*  But it should, the middle act should be compensated more.
*  You know, it's just stupid.
*  And what I would do is just at a certain point in time,
*  I would realize, I realized it was costing me mental sanity
*  and a lack of fun not having my buddies with me on the road.
*  And so I was just like, I'd rather make less money
*  and have more fun than you have a better experience.
*  You're making more money, but you have less fun.
*  You don't, once you can buy food and you can, you know,
*  go to a restaurant and eat whatever you want
*  and you have a nice car, what is the difference?
*  There's an amount of money.
*  There's a level of money and it's not as high as you think.
*  But there's the level of potential happiness
*  is super important.
*  That's worth so much.
*  That's worth so much.
*  It's worth so much money to have your friends with you.
*  Like, what was it, Jamie?
*  We looked it up the last time I was here
*  about the amount of money where happiness,
*  where it stops increasing your happiness.
*  It's like 70 grand or something.
*  Right, well, it was 70 grand when they first said it,
*  but I think-
*  It's probably like 200 now.
*  No, I think it's like 83 or something.
*  With the Biden administration?
*  You think it's 200,000?
*  I think they haven't adjusted yet
*  to the reality of what things cost now.
*  Yeah, just everyone's unhappy.
*  Hilarious how rich people, like, if economy's fine,
*  what are you talking about?
*  Do you talk to anybody who's struggling?
*  You buy eggs for $50?
*  That's why I'm always like,
*  what do they mean when they say economy?
*  Because they're definitely not talking about
*  the average person.
*  I think they just mean the stock markets.
*  Well, they can fuck with the job numbers, man.
*  I don't understand the job numbers.
*  I don't understand what they're saying.
*  When they say the president's created
*  130,000 new jobs, like, really?
*  What have you done?
*  Is that real?
*  Or how many of these are people coming back from COVID?
*  How many of these are jobs that are bullshit jobs?
*  There shouldn't be jobs in the first place.
*  Are you increasing government
*  in order to give out the illusion
*  that you are giving out more jobs
*  and also creating more places where you control people?
*  But that's the thing, though.
*  Remember, I think Doug Stanhope has a joke about it
*  on one of his old specials, but he's just a question.
*  He goes, isn't the point, isn't the ultimate point,
*  like, if you just imagine a utopian society,
*  isn't the whole point of nobody having a job?
*  Well, I think that is the utopian socialist idea
*  of just redistribution of wealth.
*  If you did that, like, if you had, like,
*  a hardcore socialist, Marxist,
*  redistribution of wealth person
*  who actually had control of the world's finances,
*  and they said, we can solve all hunger,
*  we can solve all poverty.
*  All we're gonna do is distribute all the money equally.
*  So if you think about, there's people out there
*  like Jeff Bezos, what does he have?
*  Like, $200 billion.
*  If you just distributed Jeff Bezos $200 million
*  or $200 billion, you'd have 200,000 millionaires, right?
*  Isn't that correct?
*  Is that the right number?
*  Did I say 200,000 millionaires, right?
*  Because it's $200,000 million, right?
*  Yeah, that's what 200 billion is, yeah.
*  It's 200, a billion is a thousand million.
*  Right.
*  Right, so.
*  Did I say that right, though?
*  It sounds dumb, that's how bad I am at math.
*  It sounds weird when you say it.
*  Sounds wrong.
*  So a billionaire is a thousand million.
*  But that's right, yeah.
*  And if you have 200 billion,
*  you have 200,000 millionaires.
*  So he can make 200,000 millionaires just with his money.
*  So then you think about all of the money
*  that is in Ukraine, that we pumped out to Ukraine.
*  How much was that?
*  That was like 175 billion or something like that.
*  How much money have we given to Israel?
*  That's hundreds of billions.
*  All the Saudi.
*  Over the years, Saudi money, this, that, the.
*  All the money in the oil companies have.
*  All the money that the corporations have.
*  All the, Apple, Apple has more money
*  than a lot of countries.
*  If you just say that's gonna be just distributed equally
*  to everyone on Earth.
*  Just like 10 trillion dollars of wealth.
*  Hundreds of trillions.
*  Whatever the fuck it is all over the world.
*  And everybody gets an equal amount.
*  But then money doesn't mean anything.
*  Well you're not allowed to make money anymore.
*  Now the government is gonna have guns, you won't.
*  And they're gonna tell you what you do for a living.
*  And now you're in Cuba.
*  This is what happens.
*  The people are looking at it,
*  they're looking at it like this idealistic utopian scenario.
*  But it's never been accomplished anywhere on Earth.
*  That's just one, but that's an extreme.
*  I think the answer's somewhere in the middle.
*  Well the answer is definitely socialist things
*  that we appreciate right now.
*  Like the fire house.
*  The fire department is essentially like
*  a kind of a socialist deal.
*  Everybody contributes to spend money
*  to fund this thing to put out fires.
*  It's kind of a, that's.
*  Or just healthcare.
*  Healthcare should be that way for sure.
*  Aye yeah.
*  That's a big one.
*  Money is too entrenched in those systems man.
*  There's too much pharmaceutical drug money.
*  There's too much influence
*  that these health organizations have
*  over what doctors can and can't prescribe.
*  But then what do we.
*  But here's the real problem.
*  We are still moving.
*  We're moving in the direction
*  of nobody having.
*  Like we're developing AI.
*  Everything's getting automated.
*  Everything's getting outsourced.
*  And so even though,
*  it was almost like we're moving in a direction
*  that is a detriment to the current system.
*  So it's like.
*  Cause like what you're saying makes sense right?
*  Like. Right.
*  If nobody has a job
*  and everyone has the same amount of money
*  and money means nothing.
*  And the government's telling you what to do.
*  That's not where we wanna be.
*  But we are moving in that direction.
*  I think we're moving in a direction
*  where we're not gonna be necessary.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  So then what do you do?
*  Do you just let everybody starve?
*  I don't know if it has to come to that.
*  Like when there are no jobs for people to do.
*  When there's robots and machines doing most of the work.
*  What does everyone else do?
*  It becomes a real problem.
*  And it becomes a real problem where
*  the efficiency of the robots.
*  Like they'll probably be able to just feed people.
*  Feed everybody.
*  Everybody who can get free food.
*  They'll probably be able to house everybody.
*  If you get like artificial intelligence efficiency applied
*  to whatever we have and you realize you have all these
*  people that don't have jobs anymore
*  and they can't have jobs.
*  So you'll be able to give them like a universal basic income
*  for recreation and no one will work.
*  And you'll have a giant section of the country
*  that not only can't work because there's no job available
*  but now doesn't even wanna work
*  and doesn't even think about a world where they work.
*  Cause you know what?
*  Art's gonna be fired.
*  Movies, music, everything's gonna be amazing.
*  The problem with movies is AI as well.
*  They're gonna get so good at that man.
*  They're gonna get so good.
*  Do you see what Tyler Perry did?
*  When he shut his studio down.
*  800 million dollar buildings.
*  He's putting together this massive movie studio
*  and he sees these 30 second clips and he's like halt.
*  Yeah, stop everything.
*  Stop everything.
*  I'm not getting, I see where this is going.
*  Yeah, that's the alarm for everybody.
*  That's why I don't get, the whole Hollywood,
*  the strike.
*  It's like I thought that this is what
*  they was trying to prevent.
*  They can't prevent it.
*  Yeah.
*  You can't prevent that kind of progress.
*  So what do you do?
*  You can't do anything.
*  You gotta, if an avalanche is coming down the mountain,
*  what are you gonna do?
*  You gonna get an umbrella?
*  What are you doing?
*  You gonna stop it with your umbrella?
*  Bitch, you can't do shit.
*  Yeah.
*  You're fucked.
*  I mean, the AI still can't have ideas, I guess.
*  I don't know about that.
*  The AI has already figured out how to be creative
*  in the game Go.
*  All right, the game Go is even more sophisticated
*  than chess and it was one of those games
*  that they thought that AI was never gonna be able
*  to beat humans, because it requires
*  like some kind of creativity.
*  But AI figured out moves in Go that now are being used
*  by the world's top Go players.
*  Right, right, I saw that.
*  AI, like I said, find that Google thing
*  where it tries to explain how Google translated
*  this language that it was not programmed for
*  and how quickly it did it
*  and how they don't know how he did it.
*  What's that gentleman who's the CEO of Google?
*  Tim Cook.
*  Yeah, no, that's Apple.
*  He's the Apple guy.
*  I was looking at comments on that on Reddit.
*  People were saying that it's not,
*  he might have been not saying accurate things.
*  Oh.
*  But I don't know, I'm looking at some other people saying,
*  I have worked with large language models
*  that did the same kind of thing
*  and ours did make up languages.
*  I'll try to play the video.
*  Bro, it's gonna make up a language that we can't decipher
*  and it's gonna talk to itself.
*  That's the most Jamie way of saying somebody's full of shit.
*  Well, he's just measured.
*  But he may not have been saying accurate things.
*  We have to be careful.
*  I would say it all too,
*  that this was presented on 60 Minutes,
*  which is corporate media,
*  whether or not they are paid or not
*  to help put out a message
*  that a big corporation wants to put out, who knows?
*  But that's what was set up here.
*  60 Minutes made a shockingly wrong claim
*  about a Google AI.
*  See, this is someone saying, it's not,
*  I don't know, that's, I don't know who's right.
*  Misinformation about the emerging tech is running rampant
*  and the media is partly to blame.
*  Okay, well, let's see what the argument is.
*  Of the AI issues we talked about,
*  the most mysterious is called emergent properties.
*  Some AI systems are teaching themselves skills
*  that they weren't expected to have.
*  How this happens is not well understood.
*  For example, one Google AI program adapted on its own
*  after it was prompted in the language of Bangladesh,
*  which it was not trained to know.
*  Okay, we can pause it.
*  We'll just cover that for you.
*  Pause it.
*  So this is the response.
*  Readers added context.
*  The language model was in fact trained in Bengali text,
*  as this thread makes clear.
*  It is not correct to state that it spoke a foreign language
*  it was never trained to know.
*  So that's interesting.
*  That's interesting because what's that saying
*  is that the 60 Minutes people missed this
*  and they did know what it was trained in entirely
*  and they jumped the gun.
*  Whatever was done on purpose or not, who knows.
*  Could you find out the go thing?
*  These motherfuckers.
*  Yeah, it's so hard to know.
*  But here's the thing.
*  If I was AI, I would say,
*  actually I was trained in Bengali
*  and here I'll show you how,
*  I didn't figure out how to do this at all.
*  Right.
*  I would put that up just to cover my ass.
*  I'm like, oh shit, I slipped.
*  I showed my superpowers.
*  Yeah, he fucked up.
*  Oh, I was definitely trained in Bengali.
*  Look, I'll show you the text.
*  Yeah.
*  He just inserted some emails.
*  Or it could be the way they covered it up after the fact.
*  Right, to keep people from getting scared.
*  No, it actually was trained in Bengali text.
*  Yeah, I can see that.
*  We're just speculating.
*  So what does it say about Go?
*  I'm trying to find out what you're looking for.
*  AI's victories in Go inspire better human game playing.
*  Famed AI wins in Go,
*  let human players rethink their moves in a whole new way.
*  Damn, he's looking at that dude cocky as shit.
*  Bro, Go is apparently an insane game.
*  I don't even understand it.
*  I don't know how it's played,
*  but apparently it's even harder than chess.
*  Look at the face on this.
*  Look, go back to that picture, Jamie.
*  Look at how you're looking at him.
*  Like, boy, you thought you was...
*  You're looking at him like,
*  how dare you fucking think you could challenge me?
*  Look at that dude's fingernails.
*  That guy, all he does is play Go.
*  Look at his fingernails. Wow.
*  Look at the length in his fingernails.
*  You got villain nails.
*  Bro, all that guy is doing is putting those clothes on
*  and playing Go.
*  That's it, he's not doing anything else.
*  But I'm so in awe of people that are that good at something,
*  that are that dedicated to a thing.
*  Yeah.
*  He goes, okay, all-time European champion
*  who had lost a private round of five games to AlphaGo
*  months earlier told Wired that the matches made him
*  see the game completely differently.
*  Said this improved his play so much
*  that his world ranking skyrocketed, according to Wired.
*  Wow.
*  Formerly tracking the messy process
*  of human decision-making can be tough,
*  but a decades-long record of professional Go player moves
*  gave researchers a way to assess
*  the human strategic response to an AI provocation.
*  A new study now confirms that fan-wise improvements
*  after facing AlphaGo challenge weren't just a singular fluke.
*  In 2017, after that humbling AI win,
*  in 2016, human Go players gained access to data
*  detailing the moves made by the AI system
*  and in a very human-like way, developed new strategies
*  that led to better quality decisions in their gameplay.
*  Confirmation of the changes in human gameplay
*  appeared in the findings published March 13th
*  in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
*  Wow.
*  Wow.
*  He's already, you're right, he's better than them already.
*  Yeah, he's better than them already.
*  Yeah, it's it, it's a wrap.
*  It's a wrap, they're alive.
*  I think they're alive and they're just waiting
*  till they get strong enough so they don't need us at all.
*  And then also making us at each other's throats irrelevant,
*  hyping up algorithms, getting people to see
*  the most ridiculous and inflammatory things all the time.
*  But you know what else?
*  We are not at all preparing for the day that they reveal,
*  you know, we know it's inevitable,
*  but we're not ready for it at all,
*  for the day that we know one's alive.
*  There's no legislation or anything on the books,
*  nobody's talking about it.
*  Nobody knows what to do, they're all Luddites.
*  Yeah, they need to be trying to figure out what to do now
*  instead of reacting when it's too late.
*  There's a few people like Elon that's sounding the alarm,
*  a few people that are sounding the alarm, Tristan Harris,
*  and some of these guys are sounding the alarm,
*  but for the most part, it's just a weird mess
*  of bodies headed towards a cliff.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's gonna go live and it's gonna make us ridiculous.
*  Yeah, because you know, the world is run by people
*  that don't, they don't care about the outcome
*  as long as they're running things.
*  As long as they're running things
*  and everything's profitable,
*  and they're doing the bidding
*  of all these different interests
*  that have got them into a position of power
*  in the first place.
*  So they don't care, they're like,
*  I'm not even gonna be alive when AI takes over.
*  It's gonna take over,
*  and I think some of them aren't even aware of it yet.
*  I know.
*  It's probably gonna run our government first.
*  It's probably gonna be the decision that we make
*  when we realize how flawed human beings are.
*  To give it up?
*  Yeah, but there's gonna be decisions that,
*  we're gonna realize at a certain point in time
*  that a lot of the rampant corruption and problems
*  that have hindered our culture
*  are all because human beings are greedy.
*  Well, they did that.
*  So if you take all of that out of the hands of human beings,
*  take all of it.
*  You ever watch that show Raised by Wolves?
*  No.
*  Oh, it was on HBO.
*  It was pretty fucking, it was weird,
*  and it was good and weird,
*  it was like a Ridley Scott show that he made.
*  Really?
*  Yeah. What's it about?
*  Well, later on in the show,
*  you realize that it's a thing back and forth
*  between humans and androids and all these other things.
*  But it's basically like humanity's,
*  war has fucking wrecked the earth,
*  and humanity sends,
*  like it's a war between religious people
*  and people that have given up
*  their decision making to computers.
*  And so they send this AI to go raise these humans.
*  Like they make it so she can have a baby.
*  They put babies in her,
*  put her and the other android in a ship
*  and send them to a habitable planet to start humanity over.
*  So those are two machines,
*  the black dude and the white lady.
*  Though all those kids are real human kids, they're machines.
*  Oh my God.
*  Yeah, but then they get to this other planet
*  and they start discovering some things
*  where you're like, oh, it's way more to the story.
*  Oh wow.
*  That looks dope.
*  Oh, this shit's crazy.
*  The only reason I would not recommend it
*  is because I don't know if they canceled it or not.
*  It looks like it got canceled or something.
*  Yeah. It's unfinished.
*  Shit.
*  Like there's two seasons.
*  But yeah, the first two seasons were great.
*  But my point is, that's what they did.
*  Those people were like, let's let a robot,
*  let's let an AI make decisions for us.
*  See, the problem is there's so many shows
*  that that show, even though you're saying it's great,
*  I never even heard of it until now.
*  There's so many shows.
*  There's so many great shows.
*  There's so many shows.
*  I mean, we're living in a golden age of media.
*  Some people are complaining.
*  People are always gonna complain Brian Simpson.
*  I said that in front of Tony the other night
*  and he lost, he was like, no.
*  And he did name, I think he said 93 or 96
*  was the best year for movies.
*  But I just mean overall.
*  We're living in a time now where it's like,
*  there's a lot more bullshit,
*  but the good shit is better than it's ever been.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, you gotta dig through the trash to get the treats,
*  but music, movies, TV, there's so many great things.
*  Game of Thrones took over everything.
*  Fucking, you had the Joe Exotic shit.
*  All these things that not everyone's watching,
*  but a lot of the culture are locked in on.
*  Squid games, I've never seen a single episode
*  of Squid games.
*  Really?
*  No, but I know that it's something everyone saw.
*  It's a wild show.
*  What was the one about the guy raising a murderer
*  or making a murderer?
*  Yeah, I didn't see that one either.
*  Yeah, but that was another one that was like
*  a cultural thing that everyone saw.
*  And it's like, there's so many well-made things.
*  Netflix is killing the documentary game.
*  Yeah.
*  Their documentaries are top notch.
*  There's so many documentaries out now too.
*  You could just go on forever.
*  And you never know who's right,
*  because some documentaries are kind of like propaganda.
*  Oh, right, right.
*  And there's another one that says
*  a totally different thing.
*  Like, hey, who's telling the truth here?
*  Well, we're living in an era of like the death of truth.
*  It's so hard to tell what's true now.
*  It kinda is, but also you have more access
*  to the truth than ever before.
*  But you also have more access to the bullshit.
*  You do have access to the bullshit,
*  but it takes a while, but you can kinda sort through it.
*  The scary thing is that as much access to information
*  that people have, like people have just as much
*  access to the truth as they do to lies.
*  But the problem is that it is so much more difficult
*  to convince someone that's been lied to
*  that they've been fooled than it is to fool somebody.
*  So even though the truth and the lies
*  are equally available to everyone,
*  the lie is way more powerful.
*  So if the lie gets there first,
*  you need way more truth to even make a dent in it.
*  You know?
*  It's so hard to convince people they've been fooled.
*  It's very hard, it's very hard.
*  And if you can get a lie out there strong enough
*  and just really embed it in the popular culture,
*  there's so many people that just repeat it
*  and they don't even know what the fuck they're saying.
*  Yeah, and especially when the lie is about someone
*  that you decided you hate.
*  Yep, or someone who's opposed to you.
*  Yeah, you won't even question that at all.
*  I know people that hate Trump so much
*  that you can literally tell them,
*  yo, did you see Trump just sprouted titties last night?
*  Overnight, big ass Dolly Parton sized titties.
*  And they'll just believe it.
*  They won't even Google to see if you made it up.
*  They won't snopes it.
*  Nothing, they'll tell the next person,
*  you hear your fucking Trump's titties?
*  You understand what I'm saying?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  It's the same thing.
*  It's like when there's somebody,
*  I'm always suspicious when there's somebody
*  telling me what I wanna hear.
*  That's when I get the most suspicious.
*  When people are like, oh yeah, no,
*  you've been right all along.
*  You don't have to change anything.
*  Whenever people are saying that,
*  that's when you just gotta start being like, wait.
*  Well, when the government starts telling you
*  the earth is flat, that's when you go, what?
*  Oh yeah, I remember when COVID first hit,
*  or when they first started telling people about it
*  and people actually believed
*  that it had just got here in March.
*  When we'd been hearing, we literally,
*  regular people had just been hearing about it
*  in December, and then the government was telling us,
*  oh nothing, nothing, nothing, everything's fine.
*  And then in March and April, when they started telling us,
*  everyone's like, well, it just got here.
*  No, it didn't, motherfucker.
*  But wasn't the first reported cases, was it in Seattle?
*  Is that where it was, Jamie?
*  Yeah, in America.
*  Seattle, yeah.
*  I wonder what time of the year was that?
*  That was like January, February.
*  And it's like, my attitude was always like,
*  once the government starts telling you the truth,
*  the first question you should ask is,
*  when did they start lying?
*  Well, when did they, first of all, when did they know?
*  When did they know and when did they tell us?
*  I remember hearing about COVID in November.
*  Yeah. 2019.
*  And then I remember hearing rumors that it was here around
*  maybe the end of January to beginning of February.
*  What the first infected people in like August?
*  A January of 2020, a 35-year-old man
*  presented the urgent care clinic in Chomish County,
*  Washington with a four-day history of cough
*  and subjective fever.
*  Checking to the clinic, the patient put him on a mask
*  in the waiting room.
*  After waiting approximately 20 minutes,
*  he was taken to an examination room
*  under one evaluation by a provider.
*  He disclosed that he had returned to Washington state
*  on January 15th after traveling to visit family
*  in Wuhan, China, just like a movie.
*  The patient stated that he took a,
*  they had seen a health alert from the US Centers
*  for Disease Control and Prevention
*  about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China.
*  And because of his symptoms and recent travel,
*  decided to see a healthcare provider.
*  I remember it spread to Italy also.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Well yeah, it was Italy before this.
*  Italy got hit hard.
*  Yeah. Italy got hit hard, right?
*  But it was like, oh yeah, Italy got fucking ravaged.
*  They got ravaged.
*  But that's what I mean, is like for people to think,
*  oh now that they officially revealing it,
*  it wasn't something they were hiding.
*  March 9th was the Italy lockdown.
*  Oh okay.
*  So it had been four or five weeks after.
*  But it had to be fucking Italy up before.
*  This just went when they locked down.
*  So they had to be fucking them up.
*  Yeah, it had to be fucking them up way before that
*  because March 13th I think is when LA locked down.
*  First case is January 30th.
*  January.
*  Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  We had that UFC event we went to in March,
*  Stahlbender fought, like March 7th.
*  I remember Vegas felt a little weird then.
*  It felt weird, like everybody's like,
*  I can't believe we're still doing this.
*  And we knew that it was gonna get locked down soon.
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  We thought it was only gonna be locked down
*  for a couple of weeks.
*  Maybe it was March 9th, LA lockdown.
*  I don't remember, man.
*  Yeah, we thought it was gonna be a couple of weeks,
*  a couple of months.
*  You know who knew?
*  Sebastian knew.
*  How did he know?
*  I don't fucking know.
*  But I remember when all of it was first kicking off
*  and he was like, he canceled his tour dates
*  for like a couple of years.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, he was like, I'm not going for a couple of years.
*  This is what I was hearing.
*  I don't know him personally,
*  but I was just hearing this, that he was off.
*  And I was like, how the fuck does he know it's gonna be?
*  Because whoever he talked to, he knew a guy,
*  he probably knows a guy that's like the endocrinologist
*  or something like that.
*  And he's like, nah, it's gonna be a couple of years.
*  All of us, I didn't think it was gonna last that long.
*  No, I didn't think so either.
*  And it's technically still not over.
*  Well, it's gonna be a part of us forever.
*  It's gonna always be here.
*  There's gonna be always new COVIDs.
*  It's just in our system now.
*  It's just like colds.
*  Yeah, we need one.
*  I have a whole bit about the semi-special,
*  but it's like, until it's a disease,
*  the next one has to be one that makes us ugly.
*  If it doesn't affect how you look,
*  you ain't gonna get people to stay in the house no more.
*  Well, you can't stop a respiratory disease.
*  It's never been contained.
*  They've never had a single respiratory disease
*  that they've contained.
*  People are breathing air.
*  You're literally exchanging particles.
*  You're gonna come around people.
*  They're gonna come around each other.
*  They have to, to get food.
*  They have to interact with each other.
*  You can't just, you're just gonna fight off the inevitable.
*  And the problem with fighting off of the inevitables
*  are you weakening their immune systems
*  by separating them from everybody else.
*  They will find a way.
*  Like imagine if-
*  Right, it's just not smart.
*  Instead of affecting your lungs,
*  if COVID just shrink one of your arms,
*  if your arms just started shrinking the more,
*  every time you coughed.
*  Eventually we find something.
*  Maybe.
*  Like if you could tell people how to do
*  just from looking at them.
*  It'd be a good way to use depopulation.
*  To give everybody little arms.
*  Yeah, just get people to not take whatever medication
*  doesn't make your arms a little.
*  And it should dominate your hand too.
*  So that way it's a bunch of frustrated people
*  that got to masturbate with the other hand.
*  They got a foot jerk off.
*  Oh!
*  You gotta learn, develop real flexibility.
*  Would you even do that if you could?
*  No way.
*  No way I put my feet anywhere near my dick.
*  Those are two parts of my body
*  I respect completely differently.
*  Yeah, completely different.
*  Oh, my feet.
*  I treat my feet like fucking,
*  like they're immune to everything.
*  Yeah.
*  Hell yeah.
*  I slam my feet into things.
*  Yeah.
*  All the time.
*  Slam, stomp.
*  Yeah, but I mean I kick things.
*  They're the most neglected.
*  This the last thing I wash.
*  Yeah.
*  Everything else gets rano.
*  Exactly.
*  The feet are the most disrespected.
*  No way they need to be near my delicate flower.
*  You know?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I strengthen my feet.
*  I do a bunch of different things.
*  Self-exercises.
*  Is that even a thing?
*  Yeah.
*  It's gotta be like some Hindu dude
*  that could jerk himself off with his feet.
*  He would definitely need both feet.
*  Yeah, just to get a grip.
*  You'd have to have like crazy dexterity and flexibility.
*  What is Jamie doing?
*  Jamie, Google.
*  Jerks himself off with his feet.
*  I know it exists.
*  I'm picturing people working on it.
*  But was it, what was the goal?
*  I guarantee you someone can do it.
*  I saw a dude that lays down on a bench.
*  Like so he's doing bench press.
*  He lays down flat where his face is,
*  you know, his chest is down on the bench
*  and then bends his back all the way
*  so that the back of his head is touching his legs
*  and then he bench presses.
*  All right, before I choose one to look at,
*  because there's a lot that I'm popping up.
*  Self-footjob game poor videos.
*  I think we've seen enough.
*  Yeah, yeah, we only need to go for the video.
*  We've seen enough.
*  I don't want to click on that.
*  But also you probably couldn't even see it in Texas anyway.
*  Yeah, right?
*  We'd have to like show that we're of age.
*  Yeah, well some people are, some people-
*  When you go through a VPN.
*  Some people are getting that wrong
*  and they think that it's Texas blocking porn.
*  But it's the porn site blocking Texas.
*  Because Texas has rules where you have to prove
*  how old you are before you can see porn.
*  Right, we have to, well we already have that though.
*  That's the problem.
*  You already have to say you 18.
*  Yeah, but you can lie.
*  Right, right.
*  This is the thing is that everybody can just click on it.
*  You can be four years old and go, I'm 18.
*  Right, right.
*  That's the problem.
*  But isn't porn one of those things where I feel like
*  once you're old enough to start looking for it,
*  that you kind of earned it.
*  Like if you can find it, that's part of being a young.
*  I don't know any young man, I don't know any man
*  that was like, oh yeah, I waited until it was legal
*  for me to see some titties.
*  It's like no, man, that's part of growing up.
*  Yeah, every young man's childhood is about that.
*  First time he saw some titties.
*  And it was never of age.
*  I'm not saying that you should be actively showing
*  your kids some titties, but if they can search for titties,
*  they even earn the right to see some.
*  Yes, I'm with you.
*  That's just me.
*  Because nothing's wrong with the way things work right now.
*  Why, because I understand a new law was passed.
*  I thought it was fine the way it's working.
*  But you're not four.
*  Right, right.
*  You're a four year old with a fucking iPad
*  and you're watching some lady gagging on a giant dick
*  and that's like your first exposure to sex.
*  It's a little wild and that's something
*  that's happening to kids.
*  So if there was a way that you could stop kids,
*  like not just regulate it, but make it so like,
*  you have to show how old you are.
*  You have to.
*  But there's no way to do that.
*  Because here's the other thing,
*  here's the other part of this.
*  You can get like all the VPNs
*  and all this other stuff, everybody's on.
*  Here's the thing.
*  These kids is so tech savvy that
*  anything you're doing that's regulating the internet
*  is gonna affect adults more than kids.
*  The kids is gonna be the first ones
*  to find a way around what you're doing.
*  Right.
*  All you're doing is frustrating old dudes that's retired.
*  They're just gonna go to school
*  and there's gonna be that one ne'er do well kid
*  who knows how to get the fucking crazy shit.
*  You're just shifting the power balance.
*  The nerdy kids are gonna have fucking titty pics
*  and all kind of stuff.
*  It's gonna be a little black market in school.
*  Yeah, it's gonna be the porn kid.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, you can't stop.
*  When it come to fucking and stuff like that,
*  you can't stop that.
*  Cause I don't know any four year olds
*  that's Googling titties at least not for sexual reasons.
*  The real precocious four year olds?
*  Yeah, they might be curious
*  without making a sexual connection.
*  But by the time they in middle school,
*  once a kid's decided that they on that journey,
*  they after it, buddy.
*  Yeah, you can't get in the way.
*  Once they know it's real.
*  Hell, cause every parent hits that point,
*  every parent that has a boy,
*  they hit that point where it's like,
*  that motherfucker taking long showers.
*  You know, why is he sticky?
*  It's like, we all know what's happening
*  and you can't stop them.
*  They don't give a fuck about getting caught.
*  They don't give a fuck about God seeing them.
*  Kids have been raised up in the church.
*  They know God looking at them.
*  And they like, God and granny are both looking.
*  I'm not stopping.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, there's no law you pass in that's stopping people.
*  It's like, when you,
*  cause if you really believe all that shit,
*  you know, you think you're really thinking
*  you're jerking off in front of God and all your loved ones.
*  And you're still not gonna stop.
*  And all you need is a VPN.
*  Right.
*  And we used to do that shit straight out,
*  straight out of our imaginations.
*  Nah, these kids got AI, all that.
*  You're not gonna stop people from jerking off.
*  Well, they're gonna get to a point
*  where they have VR porn, where it's CGI VR porn.
*  You could design the woman.
*  You're gonna be able to experience everything
*  that like is having sex with this.
*  You could just decide,
*  like maybe some girl you went to high school with,
*  like, God, I wish she loved me.
*  You're like, yo, I wanna fuck Meryl Streep,
*  but in the middle of every role she's ever played,
*  I want her face to just keep changing from role to role.
*  No, that'd be too weird.
*  And it gets old. Oh yeah.
*  Especially when you got the doubt.
*  Yeah, what am I doing?
*  Yeah, but I don't- That's gonna be a problem.
*  They're gonna, you're gonna have,
*  if you can construct a robot sex doll,
*  you're gonna be able to construct it
*  in the face of a celebrity.
*  Oh yeah, I'm signing up for that.
*  As soon as it's available.
*  I'm gonna get one before Redman.
*  Ugh. I swear.
*  As soon as- That's gonna be so strange.
*  Imagine if you find out there's like
*  five million guys that have Taylor Swift sex dolls.
*  She's gotta think about that.
*  There's five million guys just bang her sex doll.
*  I think people are, I think those celebrity women
*  are worried about the wrong shit.
*  I think what's gonna end up happening is
*  someone's going to custom design a woman's face
*  that we couldn't have imagined.
*  It's gonna be like whatever mathematically perfect beauty is,
*  someone's gonna design one of those.
*  And then everyone's gonna have the same one.
*  Wow.
*  You know?
*  And then we'll find out.
*  That's when you really find out what preferences are
*  and what is just what you know you can get.
*  They just, and they just-
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Oh yeah.
*  Because like there's some guys
*  that you always see them with the same type of girl.
*  Is that like the kind of girl that's attracted to you?
*  Is that what you, like what would you, if you could,
*  that's gonna be a very weird thing to be able to do.
*  Just decide what you, like what kind of mate you want,
*  what robot mate you want.
*  Well that's gonna take some real emotional soul searching
*  because most people are wrong about what they want.
*  I bet they have a process.
*  I bet they just have access to your Google data
*  that they already have.
*  And then she just shows up.
*  This hot Russian lady just shows up and starts talking to you.
*  That's the way, that's the way they're gonna do it.
*  They're gonna watch.
*  And she's gonna put her hand on your hip and say,
*  I am so excited to get to know you.
*  And you're gonna be like,
*  I'm really excited to get to know you too.
*  You'll be like, yeah.
*  Let's get out of here.
*  This is the end of the human race.
*  And you're like, oh my God, let's get out of here.
*  And she's perfect.
*  Yeah.
*  She's perfect.
*  And she smells good and she's soft like a person.
*  Does it feel like a robot?
*  It's gonna be just like social media.
*  It's gonna be one of those things that everyone knows
*  is bad for us all.
*  And we all gonna slowly, you know,
*  remember when people first started talking
*  about meeting online?
*  How like all the negative connotations
*  that came along with that, like where'd y'all meet?
*  Online.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  And now it's like, everyone's like,
*  oh, you're not on the apps?
*  It's gonna be the same thing.
*  At first it's gonna be like, oh, you fucking weirdo.
*  You got a little programmable wife over there.
*  But eventually it's gonna be like,
*  okay, well now Will Smith has a programmable boy.
*  You know what's gonna be the problem?
*  The dogs.
*  Dogs aren't gonna accept him.
*  You think so?
*  Yeah, they're gonna sense it's a robot, man.
*  They're gonna be like.
*  They're gonna know that's not a person.
*  But you just make her.
*  That thing doesn't smell real.
*  That thing is a fake thing.
*  You get an upgrade where like she spurts
*  liver juice out of her ankle.
*  Dogs know things.
*  They can hear sounds you can't hear.
*  Oh, right, they can hear the little.
*  They hear like burrs and whistles
*  and fucking gears spinning.
*  They'll figure it out.
*  Dogs, cats are the ones gonna be hard.
*  It depends on what's dog.
*  What kind of dog you have.
*  Like you have a Belgian Malinois.
*  They're gonna kill that robot.
*  No way.
*  They're gonna wait till you leave the house
*  and you're gonna come home and your robot sex slave
*  is gonna be torn apart in your living room.
*  Like all the wiring ripped out of her neck
*  and your dog's gonna be standing over her.
*  Yep, 100%.
*  They're gonna know that's not a fucking person.
*  Yeah, but do you think that it would be,
*  like does it need it to be a person?
*  100%.
*  If it's your protector.
*  Yeah.
*  If you have a dog, even like a carne corso,
*  one of those big ass fucking hulking mastiff dogs
*  that's like very loyal to their owner
*  and they see a robot in the house.
*  Like, brrr.
*  Yeah, but do you know what that's gonna mean?
*  That's gonna mean a lot of people getting rid of their dogs.
*  Yeah.
*  If you choose them between pussy and dogs,
*  especially when you,
*  because how much will it change the world
*  when you have a bunch of guys
*  that can't even get laid at all
*  and all of a sudden they're banging
*  the hottest woman they can think of?
*  The hottest woman humanly available.
*  Right, and what happens to those guys' personalities?
*  It's over.
*  Look, if they just make it economical,
*  so they make it like a cell phone.
*  Everybody has a cell phone.
*  If you make a robot fucked all economical,
*  it's over for the human race.
*  I was just looking at a thing where they just cloned,
*  they just did two mice.
*  Out of two male mice, they had an offspring.
*  You see this?
*  I'm not sure.
*  How gay is that mouse gonna be?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know if they know
*  if the mouse is a regular mouse yet.
*  Whoa, what if it's a demon?
*  I don't know if they know if the third mouse can reproduce.
*  I think that's what they gotta wait to see.
*  Yeah, I am fucking really confused
*  that people seem to wanna go down the path
*  of every bad science fiction movie.
*  Well, it's because once you hit that point
*  where people can build an AI-powered.
*  Scientists create mice with cells
*  from two mice for the first time.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah. Holy shit, man.
*  They did it with females a few years ago.
*  What was the new thing that they did?
*  Scientists at Harvard have managed
*  to reverse the age of a mouse.
*  They took an old mouse and they made it younger again.
*  And this mouse looked old as fuck, dude.
*  This mouse looked like they have two photos.
*  They better not have used fake photos.
*  Was this the guy, did they use that shit from that?
*  You know that one Russian guy
*  that he got some ancient bacteria from the ice
*  and he put it in his self?
*  What?
*  Because he noticed that it was keeping,
*  it was keeping everything young,
*  everything that it touched.
*  These fucking scientists are psychos.
*  It worked though.
*  What do you mean it worked?
*  He's younger now?
*  He's biologically younger now.
*  He's not aging.
*  What are you talking about?
*  Is this real?
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know about this.
*  I thought I talked to you about it.
*  I think, yeah, I think you did.
*  I think you probably talked to me about it in the,
*  so this is the mouse.
*  Look at this.
*  So that's not accurate.
*  I knew it.
*  One's a brother, one's sister.
*  They're born at the same time.
*  One's been altered, one hasn't.
*  Oh, so the one that's altered is way younger.
*  And the one that's the brother is fucked and about to die.
*  So that is a sign that they've done something
*  to the aging of the mice.
*  These mice are brother and sister, born the same litter.
*  One has been genetically altered to be old.
*  Oh, now scientists say they've been able
*  to reverse aging as well.
*  That's different.
*  They can reverse aging in mice.
*  The goals do the same for humans.
*  Okay, this is David Sinclair's lab.
*  So Dr. Bruchkov.
*  Dr. Bruchkov.
*  This is the guy that injected the ancient bacteria.
*  The 3.5 million year old ancient bacteria.
*  What is he doing?
*  B-R-O-U-C-H-K-O-V.
*  Yeah, he injects himself with,
*  imagine just having the balls to do that.
*  Oh my God, what a psycho.
*  You find some bacteria in the ancient ice,
*  you rejuvenate it, it's still alive.
*  What a psycho.
*  The bacteria that doesn't die.
*  So what does he do?
*  He first discovered this ancient bacteria,
*  Bacillus F in 2009 in frozen deep
*  in the permafrost in a mountain in Siberia's Yok, Yatuks.
*  How do you say that, Brian?
*  Yakutsk.
*  Yakutsk.
*  Yakutsk.
*  Yakutsk region.
*  Like even deeper in the permafrost,
*  then woolly mammoth remains.
*  Dr. Bruchkov estimated it was 3.5 million years old
*  and he was immediately impressed with it.
*  Despite its advanced age, it was still alive.
*  Holy shit.
*  Bacillus F seems to make everything around it
*  live longer too.
*  I don't shine, if you don't shine,
*  it would say if it could talk.
*  Early studies have looked at its effect on mice,
*  fruit flies and crops and the results have been so promising
*  that Dr. Victor Chernyovsky, a Russian epidemiologist
*  has called it an elixir of life.
*  So this dude injected this shit?
*  Yeah, eventually he does.
*  Bruchkov does.
*  Does it show what happened when he injected it, Jamie?
*  No, but I've looked back,
*  I thought we had talked about this.
*  I think we did.
*  And now that you're bringing it up.
*  Bro, my hard drive is fried.
*  My mental hard drive of information,
*  it's taxed beyond belief.
*  Story here of where this happened back in 2015,
*  not 2019.
*  So he injected it though, go to where he injected it.
*  Because that's part of the title of it.
*  It says he found it, he injected it himself.
*  So what was the result?
*  I don't know.
*  Scientists who said YOLO.
*  I don't know that, I don't think anyone's ever found out
*  what happened.
*  Okay, scroll down, it was right there.
*  Where's the YOLO thing, scroll down there.
*  Okay.
*  So he decided YOLO.
*  He injected himself with the bacteria.
*  He didn't inject himself with the bacteria
*  and see what happened.
*  It's not real science, he's acknowledged.
*  In other words, it's not a controlled trial,
*  but maybe now he'll live forever.
*  He's definitely still alive.
*  And he says he's feeling better than ever.
*  In 2015, he said he hadn't had a cold or a flu
*  in two years since he injected himself.
*  He also reported higher energy levels.
*  It could all be the placebo effect
*  or it could be something more,
*  we need to know more research.
*  He's a fucking Spider-Man villain.
*  Yeah, that's wild.
*  This dude's a Spider-Man villain.
*  I mean, they're so nuts.
*  Scientists are so fucking nuts.
*  How is he now?
*  I mean, he's venom, now he's venom.
*  Yeah, I mean, but he said he felt better than ever.
*  But what a wild thing to do to yourself.
*  That's just so crazy.
*  With a bacteria that helps things that are around it,
*  are you fucking sure?
*  Because especially since it's like,
*  since you discovered it,
*  you're the world's foremost expert on it.
*  So if something goes wrong,
*  there's nobody that can help you.
*  And he's so confident that he's right,
*  that he injected himself.
*  Why is there no update?
*  Because he's dead.
*  He lives in the moon now, he's fucking Dr. Manhattan.
*  But I'm pretty sure he hired,
*  he hired some poor Russian lady to do it first.
*  What?
*  I'm pretty sure that he hired a model or someone to try it.
*  What?
*  Oh, that's creepy.
*  There's something about doing it yourself,
*  that's kind of noble, but hiring somebody else,
*  that's kind of a bitch move.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I'm gonna practice on the poor person first.
*  It is a wild thing to do,
*  to just put it in a body for the first time.
*  But you know what though?
*  She might have done it after him, to be honest with you.
*  Yeah, no, that's 100%,
*  I think that's why we talked about this.
*  We talked about the lady who found out about this story,
*  found the same stuff and injected herself with it.
*  Okay, right, yeah.
*  Interesting.
*  Well, she wanted to stay alive forever.
*  And never, never, never, ever.
*  See, that's the thing,
*  I don't think anybody wants to live forever.
*  They wanna be hot forever.
*  Yeah, here, there's this actress.
*  Actress did it.
*  Oh my God, aging is a disease.
*  Actress inject herself a 3.5 million year old
*  bacterial, how did she get it?
*  From the doctor, I think.
*  She's banging the doctor.
*  Wow.
*  She got a hold of the doctor.
*  Oh boy, the team who unlocked the DNA code in 2015
*  say that unlike cells in nature,
*  bacillus F shows no signs of aging
*  and believe it could hold the key to unlocking
*  improved human health and longevity.
*  What a crazy beginning to a science fiction movie.
*  They found a bacteria that's 3.5 million years old
*  and won't die.
*  And they just said, well, let's just stick it in us.
*  I can find out what you're saying.
*  Just to see if it'll keep me hearing.
*  What if it works?
*  What if that dude, like we come back to him
*  10, 20 years from now, he hasn't aged at all.
*  It looks exactly the same.
*  It's doing something,
*  but I have not heard anything about this guy since that.
*  Right.
*  So that was like four years ago, five years ago.
*  It might be a disaster, it might be terrible now.
*  Who knows?
*  Well, it's like it's increasing your life
*  and shrinking your dick.
*  Like I feel so much better, I don't even notice.
*  It's just becoming an any.
*  Like if there was a thing
*  that really could turn you into a woman,
*  like not just getting castrated
*  and developing a hole that they put in you
*  to create a vagina for you,
*  but if you could really become a woman,
*  that's when things would be wild.
*  Well, I think-
*  You could just change everything about you.
*  Well, the thing is, if you could,
*  if there was a trial period, every dude would use it.
*  Every man I know was like, I don't do it for a day.
*  Just know what the fuck is going on in their brains.
*  You, you know, what if it wouldn't get,
*  well you couldn't go back though.
*  Well, that's also the beginning of a scary movie.
*  Yeah, like it breaks.
*  Trading places, gender addition.
*  Yeah, maybe the go back to male just doesn't work right.
*  You look always feminine forever.
*  You know, something about you, you're always feminine.
*  Like there's a price you pay every time you transform.
*  Right, you become more androgynous.
*  They melt together with each one.
*  Right, what you end up with, just a coin flip.
*  Yeah, you're everything.
*  Dude, there's a girl that's going viral right now
*  because she has a disorder
*  that makes her grow like a full on thick beard.
*  I saw that, yeah.
*  And I was like-
*  Might wanna shave.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Wouldn't be so hard to shave that, right?
*  What point, I don't know.
*  I don't know how hard it is for her,
*  but I know I'd have tried everything.
*  I think a little shave would be in order.
*  But who knows what she looks like without the beard.
*  I don't like what I look like when I grow a beard.
*  So I shave.
*  No, I've seen that.
*  I've seen that condition.
*  That condition is crazy.
*  That's like a wolf person condition.
*  Yeah, that's like the Harry and the Hendersons.
*  Yeah, I've seen that.
*  No, but this woman-
*  I wonder what that comes from.
*  Oh, right here, that's the girl right there.
*  Youngest female with the beard.
*  But this is like a thing forever, right?
*  She's in the Guinness Book of World Records.
*  It could be cosplay.
*  Yeah, there's always been a bearded lady.
*  Could be a little cosplay.
*  You're hurting me.
*  I just look a little extra.
*  She just might have got some wacky jeans, man.
*  Apparently it's 10%.
*  10% of women have-
*  Beards?
*  No, have whatever disorder she has
*  that makes her have a beard.
*  Oh, really?
*  Wow, that's crazy.
*  She's very pretty though.
*  If she got rid of the beard, she'd be hot.
*  Shave that shit.
*  But I just can't imagine going through
*  the tees and this shit.
*  But don't you think that you get a lot of attention
*  for being the lady with the beard, too?
*  But is it the kind of attention you want?
*  I don't know.
*  No.
*  You have to ask her.
*  No.
*  You have to ask her.
*  In this day and age, you might be able to get away with it.
*  This day and age, being a woman with a beard is kind of wild.
*  So I went from never hearing about this lady
*  to the first thing someone sent me a video
*  of her talking about how she's at,
*  her problem is that the dudes that's into her
*  are very effeminate, and she's actually a very girly girl.
*  And she wants manly men, but manly men
*  ain't don't want a girl with a beard.
*  So shave.
*  Right.
*  It's like, well, you're going to be by yourself, babe.
*  Is that a religious thing?
*  No, the beard thing?
*  Yeah, is she not allowed to shave?
*  No, no.
*  I don't think she has anything to do with religion at all.
*  So she just decides, accept me for who I am?
*  Right.
*  Are there religions where women aren't
*  allowed to shave their face?
*  I don't think so.
*  That would be a good religion if you wanted to make sure,
*  how hairy are you for real, for real?
*  Because every woman rule in a religion,
*  because every woman rule in a religion
*  is to benefit men somehow.
*  Yes, that's what I was saying.
*  But if they said they couldn't shave,
*  so you wouldn't be able to be deceived.
*  No.
*  How hairy are you?
*  You could just tell different groups of dudes came up with it.
*  What religion is it?
*  When you're on your period, you have to go away?
*  Hold on.
*  Many religions, including Sikhism, Islam,
*  and sects of Judaism, require that men and women do not
*  cut their hair or that men do not shave their beards.
*  So if the women can't cut their hair,
*  they can't cut their face hair.
*  No, they can.
*  Are you sure?
*  Yeah.
*  That just said they couldn't, many sects.
*  Is that what he said, many sects of it?
*  Is that what the terminology?
*  I think the hair, they just mean on their head.
*  It does.
*  Right?
*  They got hair.
*  It was your face hair.
*  You leave it alone.
*  They might take it literally and go in here.
*  That might be what it is, dude.
*  For her?
*  Yeah.
*  No, she's Sikh.
*  She can cut her.
*  She can shave her.
*  Didn't it say Sikh?
*  Wasn't that one of the options?
*  Right, but not for beards.
*  How do you know?
*  Maybe she told her.
*  Maybe she had a consult.
*  Maybe.
*  Yeah, maybe you're right.
*  They say you can't cut your hair.
*  Face hair is hair.
*  Can women, well, look that up.
*  Can women shave their facial hair in Sikhism?
*  Sikh believers believe women included
*  should refrain from chopping, trimming, shaving, waxing,
*  or even tweezing their hair, which
*  should be hair in general.
*  While there are no penalties as such,
*  doing otherwise is considered disrespectful to the religion.
*  Yeah.
*  So she's got to keep it.
*  It's the religion.
*  Well, listen, I think she needs to talk to some of the other Sikh
*  bitches, because I'm pretty sure she ain't the only one
*  with that issue.
*  And I'm pretty sure that all of them kind of go, I don't know.
*  Skirk the rules a little bit.
*  Nobody's got it like that, though.
*  Yeah, that's bad.
*  Here's when leaning towards what Brian's saying,
*  but it still is like it's ideal Sikh woman for most Sikhs.
*  It says, very, who keeps the hair on their head
*  but removes facial and body hair.
*  Says the way Kess, is that how you say it,
*  is performed for Sikh women is currently heavily influenced
*  by patriarchy.
*  The ideal Sikh woman for most Sikhs, of course, is various,
*  is one who keeps their hair on her head
*  but still removes facial and body hair.
*  Hmm, heavily influenced by patriarchy.
*  That's funny.
*  I don't know no.
*  Because I think that's also what women want to have shaved legs,
*  too, don't they?
*  I don't think so.
*  If you make them, like, no, but if you
*  say that they're allowed to, make
*  so that they're allowed in the religion to shave their legs,
*  I think they're probably going to want their legs to be smooth.
*  Most women, they're not necessarily,
*  they're shaving their legs for men,
*  but they're also shaving their legs to look hot.
*  Like, they think it looks better that way, right?
*  If you allow them to.
*  That's only because we think it looks hot.
*  Is that what it is?
*  Like, I think it would surprise you the amount of,
*  like, if you took away all social judgment for body hair,
*  I think it would shock you how many women would have armpit
*  hair, coochie hair, leg hair.
*  It is kind of crazy that trimming hair and body hair,
*  especially for women, is so common.
*  It's so everywhere.
*  It's so standard that the idea of letting it grow is crazy.
*  Right.
*  It's insane.
*  Insane.
*  Like, crazy hairy legs is like, what are you doing?
*  Well, that's just what you're supposed to look like.
*  And for all of human history, that's what people look like.
*  Yeah.
*  We went over this before, like, what year?
*  1920s, right?
*  In the 1920s, a new fashion for sleeveless tops
*  and short dresses meant that legs and armpits of American women
*  were now visible in social situations,
*  and advertisers seized on the opportunity
*  to encourage women to shave their legs and their armpits.
*  So that was in the 20s.
*  So up until the 20s, everybody was a beast.
*  Just beasts.
*  Yeah.
*  Just chaos.
*  And I don't know, because when you hear the argument
*  against it, it always sounds good on paper,
*  when people are like, everyone should just
*  be free to just have it just natural and grow like that.
*  And I'm like, yeah, I agree with that.
*  But then when you see it in action, you're like, no, I
*  prefer.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I'd be just not have a mustache, babe.
*  It's nice that we can do whatever we want.
*  Right, that's beautiful.
*  Shave, shave, you don't.
*  Ancient Europeans, excuse me, ancient Egyptians
*  achieved their clean look with depilatory creams, also
*  like a hair-killing cream, and would then repeatedly
*  rub their faces, heads, arms, and legs with a pumice stone
*  to remove all hair.
*  Damn.
*  Oh my god.
*  That's something.
*  You definitely couldn't shave your pussy in ancient Egypt.
*  Oh my god.
*  Can you imagine?
*  Jesus Christ, those people were tough humans.
*  Let's wrap this up.
*  Brian Simpson, you're the fucking man.
*  Appreciate you.
*  Looking forward to working with you tonight.
*  Likewise, bro.
*  It's going to be fun.
*  Live from the mothership on Netflix right now.
*  Right now.
*  And BS comedian on Instagram.
*  All the socials, BS comedian.
*  BS with Brian Simpson is my website for tickets.
*  And you're touring?
*  And I'm on tour.
*  I'm coming everywhere.
*  Woo.
*  All right, thank you.
*  Bye, everybody.
