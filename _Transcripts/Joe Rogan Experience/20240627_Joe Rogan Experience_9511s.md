# Joe Rogan Experience #2068 - Cameron Hanes
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=0.0s)]
*  Shrain by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6.0s)]
*  What's up, Joe Rogan fans? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=10.0s)]
*  You know, juiced up with stem cells, you feel any different? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=14.0s)]
*  Are we live yet? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=17.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're live. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=19.0s)]
*  Oh, we are? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=20.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=21.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I feel... [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=22.0s)]
*  I don't know, you said I can't do anything for a few days, though. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=23.0s)]
*  Yeah, you really should be taking time off. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=26.0s)]
*  We were talking about how Shane Dorian went down to Tijuana, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=29.0s)]
*  and he got this full body stem cell treatment, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=32.0s)]
*  and they injected his discs, and they did all this jazz, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=35.0s)]
*  and they told him, don't do anything for eight weeks. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=37.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=39.0s)]
*  You'd like walk, but just let it heal. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=40.0s)]
*  Let it heal. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=43.0s)]
*  Eight weeks? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=44.0s)]
*  I know, it's hard. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=46.0s)]
*  Hey, could I get a little more volume? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=48.0s)]
*  Oh, you can turn it right there. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=49.0s)]
*  Oh, wait. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=50.0s)]
*  On that little thing? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=51.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=52.0s)]
*  We're like a radio station now. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=53.0s)]
*  We've got real equipment. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=54.0s)]
*  You've got a cough button, too. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=56.0s)]
*  Oh, there we go. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=57.0s)]
*  See? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=58.0s)]
*  Pretty cool. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=59.0s)]
*  That's pretty... [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=60.0s)]
*  See, I don't have this. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=61.0s)]
*  See, I'm bare bones. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=62.0s)]
*  I'm like, you know, Mattel version podcast. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=63.0s)]
*  You're like the highest. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=66.0s)]
*  You're way ahead of me when I started. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=68.0s)]
*  I started with a webcam. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=70.0s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=72.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=73.0s)]
*  I know, but you're the godfather. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=74.0s)]
*  You're the OG. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=75.0s)]
*  I'm definitely not. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=76.0s)]
*  No, Adam Curry's the godfather. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=77.0s)]
*  He's the pod father. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=79.0s)]
*  He was doing it like five years before me, at least. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=81.0s)]
*  At least five years before me. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=85.0s)]
*  Well, you caught up. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=87.0s)]
*  Yeah, I caught up. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=88.0s)]
*  But he does it like much more underground. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=90.0s)]
*  Like, he stays... [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=92.0s)]
*  He's got everything... [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=94.0s)]
*  How does he have his setup? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=96.0s)]
*  Everything is like subscription-based. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=98.0s)]
*  I don't think he even has advertisers. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=100.0s)]
*  They have it tied into crypto, so everything's... [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=102.0s)]
*  You can tip with bits and stuff and it's distributed. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=104.0s)]
*  But he's a super nerd. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=107.0s)]
*  He's into all that crypto shit. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=109.0s)]
*  I just... [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=111.0s)]
*  It's too much for me. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=113.0s)]
*  I like bow hunting. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=114.0s)]
*  I like bow hunting. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=115.0s)]
*  That's all I'm into. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=116.0s)]
*  I don't have time for this crypto stuff. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=117.0s)]
*  I believe in it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=120.0s)]
*  I think it holds promise. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=121.0s)]
*  Every now and then, one of those FTX things happens [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=123.0s)]
*  where everybody loses billions. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=125.0s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, exactly. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=127.0s)]
*  That's why I didn't get involved in any of that shit. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=129.0s)]
*  There was a few of those companies that tried to get me involved [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=131.0s)]
*  in sponsors and stuff like that and do ads. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=133.0s)]
*  And I was like, what are you doing? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=136.0s)]
*  What is this? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=138.0s)]
*  Coins? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=139.0s)]
*  And also, what about those card things? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=140.0s)]
*  Oh, you mean an NFT? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=142.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=145.0s)]
*  Yeah, see, that is not real. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=146.0s)]
*  I guess it's sort of an NFT, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=147.0s)]
*  but that's really just an art gift from this guy, Beeple. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=149.0s)]
*  And Beeple, who is this really cool artist [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=152.0s)]
*  who puts up a new piece of art every day, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=155.0s)]
*  365 days a year, he does stuff like that. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=157.0s)]
*  And it's all... Have you ever seen his stuff? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=160.0s)]
*  I think maybe. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=162.0s)]
*  Pull up Beeple's Instagram. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=163.0s)]
*  It's wild, wild shit. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=165.0s)]
*  Yeah, I want to look. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=166.0s)]
*  But he actually has a gallery. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=167.0s)]
*  And in his gallery, he has things like this, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=169.0s)]
*  but enormous ones, like big giant things that he's made [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=171.0s)]
*  and all these like... It's really cool stuff. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=174.0s)]
*  So that's a different kind of an NFT. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=177.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's pretty sick. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=182.0s)]
*  His NFTs are... [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=184.0s)]
*  You're getting digital, actual digital art, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=186.0s)]
*  and it actually comes like this thing that he sent us. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=189.0s)]
*  It's like it moves. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=192.0s)]
*  It's got like a little QR code, and you can scan that. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=194.0s)]
*  It's pretty cool. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=198.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a different sort of experience. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=199.0s)]
*  But for the most part, I think the NFT shit, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=201.0s)]
*  that's Sam Bank from Freedom Jail. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=203.0s)]
*  Wack it off to pictures of his ex. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=205.0s)]
*  That's him. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=207.0s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=208.0s)]
*  That's his cell. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=210.0s)]
*  He's got the other guy on the wall with his eyes crossed out. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=211.0s)]
*  That's the guy that ratted him out. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=214.0s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=215.0s)]
*  An I heart. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=216.0s)]
*  See, there's a lot. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=217.0s)]
*  Look at his. That's his ex-girlfriend. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=218.0s)]
*  See his lotion there? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=219.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=220.0s)]
*  Luberderm. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=221.0s)]
*  Hilarious. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=222.0s)]
*  I mean, this is the kind of shit this guy does, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=223.0s)]
*  and he does it every day. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=225.0s)]
*  That is funny. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=226.0s)]
*  Hilarious. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=227.0s)]
*  He's a super cool guy, too. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=228.0s)]
*  We had him in. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=229.0s)]
*  He was a lot of fun. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=230.0s)]
*  So that, I understand. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=231.0s)]
*  That is digital art. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=233.0s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=234.0s)]
*  But there's a lot of the NFTs, like the Bored Ape Yacht Club. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=235.0s)]
*  I was like, what is it? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=239.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=241.0s)]
*  For a while there, it seemed like everybody was making millions. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=242.0s)]
*  I'm like, what do I got to do here? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=245.0s)]
*  And so can I make a hunting photo, an NFT, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=248.0s)]
*  and just make a bunch of money? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=250.0s)]
*  How does this work? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=252.0s)]
*  I think a lot of people thought that at first. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=253.0s)]
*  And maybe if you hopped on the bandwagon at the very beginning [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=255.0s)]
*  before everybody kind of woke up, there's no there, there. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=257.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=261.0s)]
*  So here's the thing. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=262.0s)]
*  People are like, well, it's yours, and you own it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=263.0s)]
*  Yeah, but I could take a screenshot of it, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=266.0s)]
*  and I have it on my phone. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=268.0s)]
*  And where are you going to look at it other than your phone? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=269.0s)]
*  I literally have what someone paid a million dollars for [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=272.0s)]
*  if I wanted to get a screenshot of it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=276.0s)]
*  I could get that, and then it's on my phone. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=278.0s)]
*  It's not even a different resolution. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=280.0s)]
*  Like, what? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=282.0s)]
*  Oh, but it's not your crypto wallet. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=284.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=286.0s)]
*  I guess you win. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=287.0s)]
*  I love this argument. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=288.0s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=289.0s)]
*  But like, that's the same. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=290.0s)]
*  Like, do you have a screenshot of the Mona Lisa on your phone? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=291.0s)]
*  You don't own the Mona Lisa. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=293.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=294.0s)]
*  It's very different, because the Mona Lisa is a physical painting [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=295.0s)]
*  made by a master artist that's in a frame, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=298.0s)]
*  and you could look at it, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=301.0s)]
*  and you could ponder the thought behind it, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=302.0s)]
*  the artistic expression, the technique in brush strokes [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=305.0s)]
*  and painting. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=309.0s)]
*  This guy from hundreds and hundreds of years ago [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=310.0s)]
*  created this masterpiece that endures today. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=313.0s)]
*  Couldn't you do that on your phone, too? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=315.0s)]
*  I mean, if you'd like... [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=317.0s)]
*  Yeah, but it's a painting. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=318.0s)]
*  Look, if you had a copy of the Mona Lisa, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=319.0s)]
*  like a print, and you put that on your wall, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=322.0s)]
*  I could... [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=325.0s)]
*  I mean, that still has merit. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=326.0s)]
*  That's still a piece of art. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=328.0s)]
*  But like, the board ape yacht club, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=329.0s)]
*  you could pull up one of them board apes. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=332.0s)]
*  Well, I was gonna say, with this, with the Salvatore Monday, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=334.0s)]
*  it would solve a lot of the problem with this, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=336.0s)]
*  because you would have known that Leonardo made it, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=338.0s)]
*  because when it was first printed [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=341.0s)]
*  and he made it for sale, ideally 500 years ago, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=343.0s)]
*  it would have been on the blockchain, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=346.0s)]
*  and the history of that would have been known, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=348.0s)]
*  and there was only one of them made and all of that. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=350.0s)]
*  If it was an NFT 500 years ago? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=353.0s)]
*  I'm saying, if it was equivalent to what NFTs are now, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=355.0s)]
*  the problem that existed with that whole documentary [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=359.0s)]
*  on who made it, was it repainted, and all that kind of stuff, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=361.0s)]
*  that whole thing would have never existed. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=364.0s)]
*  Okay, but this... [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=366.0s)]
*  That's not the best example, I see what you're saying. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=368.0s)]
*  That's an example, though. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=370.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is a way more complicated story. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=371.0s)]
*  Do you know about that thing? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=373.0s)]
*  Go back to that image again, please. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=375.0s)]
*  That thing is wild, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=377.0s)]
*  because that is supposedly a lost Leonardo da Vinci. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=379.0s)]
*  Supposedly. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=383.0s)]
*  But the problem is, there's a whole documentary on it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=387.0s)]
*  Is it called The Lost Leonardo? Is that the documentary? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=391.0s)]
*  It sounds right. I mean, the picture's called Salvatore Monday. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=394.0s)]
*  Right. What is the documentary about? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=397.0s)]
*  But that painting was the most expensive painting, I believe, ever sold. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=399.0s)]
*  Or one of the most expensive. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=403.0s)]
*  And they auctioned it at Christie's, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=405.0s)]
*  and it sold for $450 million. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=407.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=409.0s)]
*  Now, here's the problem with it. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=411.0s)]
*  Most of that painting has been recreated. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=413.0s)]
*  Most of that painting has been touched up by a modern artist. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=417.0s)]
*  It's this woman. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=421.0s)]
*  And they show her doing it over, like, I think it was over a decade, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=423.0s)]
*  of working just on this one, you know, like, 36 by 24, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=426.0s)]
*  whatever the size painting is. It's not a really big painting. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=431.0s)]
*  This lady worked on this one painting. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=433.0s)]
*  So I think some... [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=435.0s)]
*  So she influenced it. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=437.0s)]
*  Not just influenced it. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=439.0s)]
*  Most of the work is her work. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=441.0s)]
*  Like, show the original... [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=443.0s)]
*  This is what happened. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=445.0s)]
*  Someone found it somewhere at some sale, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=447.0s)]
*  and they bought it for, like, really cheap. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=450.0s)]
*  And then as they're starting to go over this, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=452.0s)]
*  it's all documented in this Lost Leonardo movie, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=454.0s)]
*  as they're starting to go over it, they start thinking, like, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=457.0s)]
*  I think this is Leonardo da Vinci's work. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=459.0s)]
*  And so then it sells for quite a bit more, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=463.0s)]
*  but then they have it brought to this lady who's an art restorer, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=467.0s)]
*  and she retouches it. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=470.0s)]
*  But there's a lot of problems with it. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=472.0s)]
*  And some of the problems are that it seems like it was multiple times [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=474.0s)]
*  it was painted over, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=478.0s)]
*  and it seems like more than one artist painted it, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=480.0s)]
*  and what they had originally versus what it is now looks very different. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=483.0s)]
*  Like, see if you can find... [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=488.0s)]
*  I'm trying to find the correct example that you're describing, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=489.0s)]
*  but here's one example of it. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=491.0s)]
*  This was a 1913 version of it, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=493.0s)]
*  and then it got cleaned up in 2005. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=496.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=498.0s)]
*  Right, but there was a way worse version of it that they bought. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=499.0s)]
*  So yeah, yeah, I mean, so that was two years later. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=503.0s)]
*  That's it. That's the one. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=505.0s)]
*  Here's the restored version where they took everything off of it. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=507.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=508.0s)]
*  So is that what that is? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=509.0s)]
*  Like all those white stripes is the restored version? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=511.0s)]
*  This is clean state. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=513.0s)]
*  Clean state. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=515.0s)]
*  Okay, so they had to take off the paint that was put on [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=516.0s)]
*  to clean it up after they restored it in 19... [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=520.0s)]
*  What was it? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=522.0s)]
*  I mean, that... [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=524.0s)]
*  The first year? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=525.0s)]
*  This was just found in a collection in like the early 1900s, I think. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=526.0s)]
*  That was the other one that was restored? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=528.0s)]
*  Yeah, like the pencil one. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=529.0s)]
*  Yeah, that one right there. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=530.0s)]
*  So the one on the left, they were saying like, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=532.0s)]
*  maybe this is Leonardo, and so they cleaned it up. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=536.0s)]
*  But then this lady goes and paints over it. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=538.0s)]
*  So like, go back, back up, please. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=541.0s)]
*  Go back up to that. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=544.0s)]
*  So that image is kind of fucked up. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=545.0s)]
*  If you're going to buy that, how much is that worth? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=547.0s)]
*  I mean, it's beautiful. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=549.0s)]
*  Like, look at the hand. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=550.0s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=551.0s)]
*  You would think, well, maybe this is Leonardo da Vinci. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=552.0s)]
*  But so then this lady goes over the whole thing [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=554.0s)]
*  and then show the final version. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=557.0s)]
*  I think it's at the bottom. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=559.0s)]
*  Okay, and the final version is pretty stunning. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=561.0s)]
*  This is the after restoration is on the right. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=563.0s)]
*  Yeah, but it's so much more detailed [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=566.0s)]
*  than the original one that was all fucked up. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=572.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=575.0s)]
*  So like, is that a Leonardo or is it that lady who did it? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=576.0s)]
*  It seems like it's that lady. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=580.0s)]
*  It's a collab. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=581.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a collab. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=582.0s)]
*  But that's not how it's being sold. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=583.0s)]
*  If you get the Mona Lisa, that's the fucking Mona Lisa. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=585.0s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=588.0s)]
*  That is Leonardo da Vinci's work, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=589.0s)]
*  and they kept it in pristine condition for all these years. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=591.0s)]
*  This is like some weird shit. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=594.0s)]
*  So MBS, the ruler of Saudi Arabia, owns it, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=595.0s)]
*  and he just keeps it on a yacht. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=598.0s)]
*  The Mona Lisa? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=600.0s)]
*  No, that thing. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=601.0s)]
*  Oh, that one? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=602.0s)]
*  The lost Leonardo. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=603.0s)]
*  He tried to make a deal. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=604.0s)]
*  Apparently, they talk about this in the documentary, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=605.0s)]
*  that he wanted to put it at the Louvre in Paris [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=607.0s)]
*  next to the original Mona Lisa. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=609.0s)]
*  And the people in Paris were like, yeah, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=612.0s)]
*  and we don't even know what this is. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=615.0s)]
*  Take four of those. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=617.0s)]
*  Four? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=618.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'd take four or six if you want to be smart. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=619.0s)]
*  I didn't take your whole bottle. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=623.0s)]
*  Come on, man. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=625.0s)]
*  We're shooting you up with stem cells. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=626.0s)]
*  We're giving you alpha brain. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=628.0s)]
*  You're having the full Austin experience here, Cam Ains. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=629.0s)]
*  So... [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=635.0s)]
*  Here's these oofy apes. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=636.0s)]
*  I don't know if that's why we brought it up. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=637.0s)]
*  Well, those are worth millions. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=638.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=639.0s)]
*  Well... [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=640.0s)]
*  Jamie bought these. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=641.0s)]
*  I have one. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=642.0s)]
*  Did you know the last time we mentioned his T-shirts [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=643.0s)]
*  and he made... [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=646.0s)]
*  It was a nice little pop. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=647.0s)]
*  $3,000. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=648.0s)]
*  Which ones? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=650.0s)]
*  The Pull That Up Jamie T-shirts? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=651.0s)]
*  Which T-shirts? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=652.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=653.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was mostly, I think, what it was. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=654.0s)]
*  We just did a little mention at the end of the podcast [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=655.0s)]
*  because he said he had this big spike in sales [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=657.0s)]
*  and he's like, what the hell happened on this day? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=659.0s)]
*  And it was like us talking... [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=661.0s)]
*  Because I mentioned something about Young Jamie. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=663.0s)]
*  The best one is the... [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=665.0s)]
*  I looked into it, the rainbow. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=666.0s)]
*  That's a fun one. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=668.0s)]
*  I was thinking of giving that to Grush. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=669.0s)]
*  I didn't have it in my head on time. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=670.0s)]
*  He's looked into it the most. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=671.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's looked into it the most. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=673.0s)]
*  So you were saying that you're on the fence, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=675.0s)]
*  off the fence about Grush. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=677.0s)]
*  The story I was hearing is it's a lot. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=678.0s)]
*  I'm going to skip a lot of it, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=681.0s)]
*  but what I was reading and slash what they were saying [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=683.0s)]
*  is that one possibility that could be going on [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=686.0s)]
*  is there is a... [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=689.0s)]
*  I think we're taking in some of Graham Hancock stuff too. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=691.0s)]
*  If people were around on Earth 500,000 years ago, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=694.0s)]
*  in some way, there was some split [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=698.0s)]
*  and a second set of humans continued on [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=700.0s)]
*  and we're like in this inter-dimension space [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=704.0s)]
*  where they're both happening simultaneously. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=706.0s)]
*  And that's where like if... [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=708.0s)]
*  He was saying this? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=710.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=711.0s)]
*  This is from the... [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=712.0s)]
*  I'm gathering this all from that video. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=713.0s)]
*  I'm adding in some of Graham Hancock stuff too [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=715.0s)]
*  because this kid had also interviewed him, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=717.0s)]
*  Jesse Michaels, on his podcast. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=718.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=720.0s)]
*  And they're talking about some of the same stuff. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=721.0s)]
*  But something they said in the Grush interview [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=722.0s)]
*  on his podcast was that an idea would be [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=725.0s)]
*  that these people exist on a split timeline from us. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=728.0s)]
*  Like we had cataclysms and died and repopulated and whatnot. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=734.0s)]
*  Now we've ended in this place in 2023 [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=738.0s)]
*  with combustion engines and we're flying around. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=740.0s)]
*  These people would have been in a different antigravity. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=743.0s)]
*  Who knows what they figured out? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=746.0s)]
*  And they went somewhere else? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=747.0s)]
*  I think... [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=749.0s)]
*  They're not even saying that. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=750.0s)]
*  This is where like they're not gonna talk... [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=751.0s)]
*  They haven't talked about that, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=753.0s)]
*  but I think what they're saying or getting at maybe [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=754.0s)]
*  is that they're here and that's why the nuclear thing is so... [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=757.0s)]
*  Important to them. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=763.0s)]
*  They're on the same planet as us. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=764.0s)]
*  And if we blow up the planet, it goes away for them too. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=766.0s)]
*  So they're here, we just don't know where they are? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=768.0s)]
*  And that's where the inter-dimension thing comes in. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=769.0s)]
*  That's what I'm gathering out of what I've heard. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=771.0s)]
*  How high were you when you came up with this? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=773.0s)]
*  It's not... [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=774.0s)]
*  I don't think I'm saying it's my theory. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=775.0s)]
*  This is what they're sort of saying. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=777.0s)]
*  And Grush is sort of like, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=778.0s)]
*  that's an interesting thing you're saying. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=780.0s)]
*  He's not confirming it with them or anything, but... [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=782.0s)]
*  It's a lot to take in. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=784.0s)]
*  That's definitely for sure. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=786.0s)]
*  It's all a lot to take in. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=787.0s)]
*  David Grush is that UFO whistleblower [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=789.0s)]
*  that testified in front of Congress? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=791.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=793.0s)]
*  It's hard to say, man. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=794.0s)]
*  The thing about it is, I believe he's telling the truth [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=796.0s)]
*  as far as what he's experienced and the documents that he uncovered [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=799.0s)]
*  and the people that he talked to. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=802.0s)]
*  But how do you know whether or not they're just using him [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=804.0s)]
*  as a useful idiot to just get out some silly story [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=808.0s)]
*  because they're covering up for the fact that there's some [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=812.0s)]
*  very advanced drone system that the United States government has [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=814.0s)]
*  that they're trying to keep under wraps? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=817.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=819.0s)]
*  It might be both. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=820.0s)]
*  I think it's probably both things. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=821.0s)]
*  Well, here's the thing. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=824.0s)]
*  You're out in the woods all the time. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=826.0s)]
*  You ever see a UFO? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=828.0s)]
*  No. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=830.0s)]
*  Ever see Bigfoot? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=831.0s)]
*  No. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=832.0s)]
*  Ever talk to a hunter that's seen a UFO? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=833.0s)]
*  No. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=834.0s)]
*  Ever talk to a hunter that's seen Bigfoot? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=835.0s)]
*  I talk to... [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=837.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=838.0s)]
*  So, the guys down at San Carlos, the Apache Reservation, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=839.0s)]
*  they said they've seen stuff. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=842.0s)]
*  Okay. Were they on peyote? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=844.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=845.0s)]
*  Because I know a lot of those Indians like to get down. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=846.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=848.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't... [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=849.0s)]
*  And it's been like multiple times. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=850.0s)]
*  What kind of stuff? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=852.0s)]
*  Like square... [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=853.0s)]
*  Like something square flying. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=855.0s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=857.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=858.0s)]
*  Because that is the thing that they describe, right? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=859.0s)]
*  It's a square with a sphere inside of it, like a black... [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=861.0s)]
*  No, the opposite. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=864.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=865.0s)]
*  A sphere with a black square inside of it. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=866.0s)]
*  Yeah, like a force field or something. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=868.0s)]
*  I was fucked up. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=870.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=871.0s)]
*  So that's... [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=872.0s)]
*  I don't know anybody other than that. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=873.0s)]
*  That's the first story I've heard from somebody who I have talked to. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=874.0s)]
*  Well, that kind of makes sense. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=877.0s)]
*  That thing they do spot, that's a common one. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=880.0s)]
*  Some flying square inside a sphere, like a translucent sphere. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=884.0s)]
*  And that's like legitimate pilots have seen that. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=890.0s)]
*  That's a weird one. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=893.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=894.0s)]
*  My theory, and this is totally unfounded without any research whatsoever. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=895.0s)]
*  Those are the best kind. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=900.0s)]
*  This is my favorite kind of theories. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=901.0s)]
*  My theory is that they have this ability to make something move in this insane way with [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=903.0s)]
*  gravity, but they can't put a body in it and they can't put weapons in it. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=910.0s)]
*  They can't... [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=914.0s)]
*  It's just an object that they can get to move at insane rates of speed. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=915.0s)]
*  That's what I think. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=919.0s)]
*  I think the military applications of this thing have yet to be figured out. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=920.0s)]
*  But I think they do have something that can do things that we have no knowledge of. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=925.0s)]
*  But the United States government probably have in their possession something that was [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=930.0s)]
*  either back engineered from something from somewhere else or something that they developed [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=937.0s)]
*  in a completely top secret environment with the top research scientists probably during [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=944.0s)]
*  the wars, during World War II and III, or III, Vietnam. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=950.0s)]
*  That's impending. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=955.0s)]
*  And in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=956.0s)]
*  Think about the amount of money that gets funneled through the government. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=958.0s)]
*  Didn't the Pentagon just for the sixth year in a row fail their audit? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=964.0s)]
*  Imagine if you failed your audit six years in a row. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=971.0s)]
*  Boy, they would crawl up your ass with a fucking microscope. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=973.0s)]
*  Is that what it was? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=976.0s)]
*  Have they ever passed it? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=978.0s)]
*  But yeah, they got this correct. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=980.0s)]
*  It says, failed sixth audit with number passing grades. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=981.0s)]
*  So there's a lot of money flowing around is my point. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=984.0s)]
*  And who knows how much of that money is going to these secret programs that we don't know about. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=987.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=993.0s)]
*  And if they did that and they did have the top scientists and if I was the fucking president [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=994.0s)]
*  and I was the chief of staff and I was running the Pentagon, I would want the best scientists. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=999.0s)]
*  I'd recruit the best scientists and I'd say, hey, you know, this is national security. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1004.0s)]
*  We're working on this project. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1008.0s)]
*  It uses gravity propulsion. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1010.0s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1011.0s)]
*  Don't tell anybody. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1012.0s)]
*  But you get to work on some cool shit. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1014.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1015.0s)]
*  And you get paid a lot of money. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1016.0s)]
*  You get paid a lot of money and you get to be a part of one of the most insane discoveries in human history. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1017.0s)]
*  So this is what we're working on. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1021.0s)]
*  I think that's likely too. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1023.0s)]
*  But then you got to go back to like the Foo Fighters from the 1940s and the crash at Roswell. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1026.0s)]
*  And that you also have to be open to the possibility that like, look, there's a lot of planets out there. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1032.0s)]
*  A lot of planets out there. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1037.0s)]
*  It's very possible that we're not alone. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1039.0s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like we would have found something by now. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1041.0s)]
*  If you could go to another planet and bow hunt. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1044.0s)]
*  That'd be sick. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1047.0s)]
*  I wouldn't do it. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1048.0s)]
*  No? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1050.0s)]
*  Imagine if you be the first guy to eat a deer from another planet and you just fucking die instantly. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1051.0s)]
*  That's a good way to go. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1055.0s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1057.0s)]
*  It's a dumb way to go. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1058.0s)]
*  The good way to go is send some fucking prisoners over there. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1059.0s)]
*  Send some murderers. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1063.0s)]
*  Send some like school shooters. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1064.0s)]
*  Send them over there to eat a space deer. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1066.0s)]
*  I guess you could, yeah, test them out. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1069.0s)]
*  To say either you kill this and eat it or you die because there's no food. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1071.0s)]
*  So good luck and then see what happens. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1074.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1076.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1077.0s)]
*  So, but some housekeeping real quick. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1078.0s)]
*  Thank you for getting me down here for the stem cells. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1081.0s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1084.0s)]
*  Ways to Well. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1085.0s)]
*  Shout out to Ways to Well. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1086.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's good. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1087.0s)]
*  I think I like that, you know, I had blokes is kind of coming on too. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1088.0s)]
*  They offer the same Ways to Well offers the same thing. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1094.0s)]
*  But it seems like those type of outfits are really going to gain popularity because of the distrust in the medical. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1097.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1104.0s)]
*  Whatever you like. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1105.0s)]
*  You're your regular doctor that was telling you, oh, yeah, you got to get this vaccine, this and that. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1106.0s)]
*  And now it's, you know, obviously there's distrust there. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1111.0s)]
*  So I think people are thinking, do I need a doctor? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1114.0s)]
*  What do I what's a doctor for? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1118.0s)]
*  Just pushing prescriptions on me. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1120.0s)]
*  So now they can kind of take their health into their own hands, get their blood panels done, see where they are. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1121.0s)]
*  You know, on a bunch of different markers. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1126.0s)]
*  And that's what Ways to Well and blokes does. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1129.0s)]
*  And I think a lot of people are going to be doing that instead of calling their their right family doctor. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1131.0s)]
*  Well, a lot of family doctors, unfortunately, just don't have that knowledge base. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1137.0s)]
*  They don't understand peptides. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1141.0s)]
*  They'll tell you not to take things and they don't have any knowledge of it themselves. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1143.0s)]
*  You talk to them and they have a pot belly. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1146.0s)]
*  Well, you don't need any vitamins. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1148.0s)]
*  You can get everything you want from a balanced diet. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1149.0s)]
*  Why they're eating cheeseburgers. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1151.0s)]
*  Well, and they do that. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1153.0s)]
*  You're like your markers and they're saying, well, this is say with test. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1154.0s)]
*  They'll say, well, your testosterone is within a normal range. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1159.0s)]
*  Normal range. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1162.0s)]
*  Normal compared to another fucking normal guy. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1163.0s)]
*  You see the normal American these days. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1166.0s)]
*  I don't want to be anywhere near that guy. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1168.0s)]
*  I want to be like my own category. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1170.0s)]
*  So yeah. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1173.0s)]
*  So yeah. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1174.0s)]
*  Optimized, built for performance, you know, get your body at the highest level, not compared to the average American. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1175.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1182.0s)]
*  So that's where I don't know. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1183.0s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of peptides that are very beneficial and some of them they've even pulled from the market because they're beneficial. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1184.0s)]
*  And it's one of the things they did with thymus and thymus and was used during covid. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1189.0s)]
*  A lot of people using it to help them recover from covid. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1193.0s)]
*  So they pulled it. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1195.0s)]
*  So they made it so you can't access thymus. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1196.0s)]
*  Because they're trying to make money off of exactly. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1199.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1201.0s)]
*  And these compounding pharmacies can make it and they make it fairly cheaply. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1202.0s)]
*  It's not expensive. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1205.0s)]
*  And they're doing that with BPC 157 as well because so many athletes use BPC 157. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1206.0s)]
*  It's a very common one for helping heal injuries. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1211.0s)]
*  And it works. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1214.0s)]
*  Works really well. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1215.0s)]
*  I know a lot of people that use a lot of fighters can't use it, unfortunately, but a lot of Jiu Jitsu guys use it. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1216.0s)]
*  MMA fighters in the UFC at least. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1221.0s)]
*  So they test for it. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1223.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1225.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, I don't think they should because I think what it does is help you heal. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1226.0s)]
*  And I think if you're in a sport that literally most of the time you're getting smashed, most of the time you're getting kicked and punched and you're always dealing with injuries. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1230.0s)]
*  Wouldn't we want to help these guys get to the finish line, like get to the fight? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1239.0s)]
*  Because a lot of injuries like Gordon Ryan was supposed to compete the beginning of December and then the end of December in Jiu Jitsu. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1243.0s)]
*  And he just fucked his rib up. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1253.0s)]
*  He just tore his rib. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1254.0s)]
*  This is a normal thing that happens with Jiu Jitsu guys. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1255.0s)]
*  It's a normal thing that happens with UFC guys. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1259.0s)]
*  But Gordon will have access to ways to well and they'll give him all the best peptides. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1261.0s)]
*  They'll figure out what's the best protocol in order to help heal that. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1268.0s)]
*  And he'll get back on track much quicker than someone if they were fighting in the UFC who had no access to those things because they're being constantly tested. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1271.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1280.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think they should test for that. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1281.0s)]
*  You know, I think they should figure out like what's cheating and what's just helping you heal. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1282.0s)]
*  And let's you know, let's not let guys take trend and fucking D ball and all this crazy shit. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1287.0s)]
*  Yeah, let's not do that. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1292.0s)]
*  But I don't see any problem with things like BBC one five seven that are just all it's going to do is help your body heal quicker. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1293.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1301.0s)]
*  That's what we want. We want to get better quicker. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1302.0s)]
*  You're in the business of breaking bodies. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1303.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1305.0s)]
*  You're in the business of literally kicking guys legs out from under them and punch them in the stomach. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1306.0s)]
*  Like we should have some shit that makes you heal quicker. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1310.0s)]
*  Right. Just be healthy. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1313.0s)]
*  It's not gaining an advantage over another fighter. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1314.0s)]
*  The only advantage is you won't be injured as long, which is a very good thing that we should apply to everyone. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1317.0s)]
*  And it's not dangerous, doesn't have horrible side effects. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1322.0s)]
*  It's not something that's scary. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1325.0s)]
*  It's going to fuck up your reproductive system. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1327.0s)]
*  It doesn't do any of those things. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1329.0s)]
*  It just helps you heal faster. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1330.0s)]
*  And I think these organizations, UFC and all the other ones as well, they should embrace all these different things and just stop treating it like the problem is really was baseball. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1332.0s)]
*  This is the problem. This is where everybody got it in their head that is cheating. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1344.0s)]
*  It was Mark McGuire and Sammy Sosa. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1347.0s)]
*  And when those guys were on that fucking home run competition and they were cracking them out of the park and they both looked like superheroes. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1349.0s)]
*  It was awesome. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1357.0s)]
*  Don't forget Barry Bonds. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1358.0s)]
*  Barry Bonds, right? [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1359.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1360.0s)]
*  Barry Bonds as well. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1361.0s)]
*  But yeah, that was like that was a heyday of baseball. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1362.0s)]
*  So you're trying to make people not care. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1364.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1366.0s)]
*  But those guys were juiced to the tits. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1367.0s)]
*  And baseball, which is the American pastime, we associated steroids and baseball with cheating. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1369.0s)]
*  He's a cheater. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1376.0s)]
*  We're not cheaters. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1377.0s)]
*  We're Americans. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1378.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1380.0s)]
*  You know, but listen, if you could get a hold of any NFL player in between camp, like what what are the odds? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1381.0s)]
*  What are the odds? [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1392.0s)]
*  They're not sportsmen of the year. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1393.0s)]
*  What year was that? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1394.0s)]
*  I think whatever like 98. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1395.0s)]
*  Why they were in togas? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1399.0s)]
*  Because they're gladiators. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1401.0s)]
*  But gladiators were togas? [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1403.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1406.0s)]
*  Who wears togas? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1407.0s)]
*  Those guys were. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1408.0s)]
*  Oh, Animal House? [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1409.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1410.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1411.0s)]
*  They were with John Belushi. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1412.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1413.0s)]
*  Look at Mark Maguire with the glass of milk in the baseball bat. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1414.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1417.0s)]
*  Milk gave him those guns. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1418.0s)]
*  Besides those guns. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1420.0s)]
*  Going, going, gone. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1422.0s)]
*  I'm drinking milk. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1423.0s)]
*  Let's see Barry Bonds. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1424.0s)]
*  I want to see him. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1425.0s)]
*  Oh, Barry Bonds got super jacked. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1426.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1428.0s)]
*  He was so good just naturally. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1429.0s)]
*  And then he added all that muscle. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1431.0s)]
*  Oh, look at this. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1433.0s)]
*  Yeah, if they could allow those guys to do the sauce. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1435.0s)]
*  Look how skinny he was at first. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1438.0s)]
*  And then boom. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1439.0s)]
*  But he was so good when he was skinny. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1440.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1442.0s)]
*  Oh, he was great in the beginning. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1443.0s)]
*  And then got that extra horsepower from all that clear. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1445.0s)]
*  The stuff they were rubbing on him. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1448.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1450.0s)]
*  I had that guy on. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1451.0s)]
*  The guy from Balco. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1452.0s)]
*  Victor Conte? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1453.0s)]
*  What was his name? [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1454.0s)]
*  Victor Conte. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1455.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1456.0s)]
*  He explained it all and how it's all done and what they did. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1457.0s)]
*  Very fascinating. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1459.0s)]
*  Yeah, because I remember McGuire said he was taking like Androl or it was some supplement [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1460.0s)]
*  you could buy. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1466.52s)]
*  Andrastein Dione. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1467.52s)]
*  Oh, that's what it just skyrocketed off the shelves. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1468.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1472.0s)]
*  He probably took that too. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1473.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1474.0s)]
*  You know, I know that stuff did work. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1475.0s)]
*  It gave you a little bump. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1476.32s)]
*  I couldn't tell you. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1477.52s)]
*  I couldn't tell you what I take that works because I take 30 different things. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1479.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1484.28s)]
*  He probably wasn't lying. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1485.28s)]
*  He's like, yeah, I take this and here's the results. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1486.28s)]
*  I take a handful of who knows what. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1488.7199999999998s)]
*  I take a lot more stuff now after that Gary Brekker podcast. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1491.6s)]
*  I started taking methylated B vitamins and all sorts of other stuff that he... [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1494.6399999999999s)]
*  Was that a good one? [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1498.8799999999999s)]
*  I didn't listen to that one. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1499.8799999999999s)]
*  Was it good? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1500.8799999999999s)]
*  It's a fucking great one. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1501.8799999999999s)]
*  That's a great one. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1502.8799999999999s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1503.8799999999999s)]
*  He goes deep. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1504.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1505.8799999999999s)]
*  That's an amazing one. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1506.8799999999999s)]
*  He changed Dana White's life. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1507.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, Dana White was basically on Death's Door and he put him on a ketogenic diet. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1508.8799999999999s)]
*  Now Dana looks fucking 15 years younger. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1514.12s)]
*  He does. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1516.9599999999998s)]
*  He looks amazing. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1518.56s)]
*  Well, he's in this light bed. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1519.56s)]
*  He got this red light bed every day and his face just looked better. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1520.56s)]
*  One of the things that happens when you lose fat, and this definitely happened to me recently, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1523.56s)]
*  you lose fat in your face. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1527.8s)]
*  So your face starts to sink in around here. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1529.0s)]
*  It kind of looks like shit. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1531.1200000000001s)]
*  You need Botox. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1532.1200000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1533.1200000000001s)]
*  That's not going to help because you're losing face fat. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1534.1200000000001s)]
*  It's also collagen. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1538.44s)]
*  You don't have as much collagen as you're older, as you do when you're younger. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1539.52s)]
*  If you're a younger person, you have a lean face. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1542.92s)]
*  It doesn't look as bad as when you're an older person. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1544.82s)]
*  You know who said that once? [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1547.56s)]
*  William Schachtner. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1548.56s)]
*  He was like 80 years old. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1549.56s)]
*  He was talking about how he gains weight because it keeps the wrinkles away. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1550.56s)]
*  Because it keeps a fat face and you don't have as many wrinkles. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1553.56s)]
*  My daughter watches all these before and after things, so it's like, I think, buckle fat [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1556.96s)]
*  removal. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1561.84s)]
*  I think buckle fat is somewhere on your face. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1562.84s)]
*  Buckle? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1565.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1566.72s)]
*  Jamie, what's buckle fat? [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1567.72s)]
*  Buckle fat. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1568.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1569.72s)]
*  I think it's like what you're talking about maybe. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1570.72s)]
*  Well, what I'm talking about is if you're a fat person, you're not going to have a [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1572.12s)]
*  gaunt face. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1576.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1577.72s)]
*  But if you're a person who loses weight, here it is. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1578.72s)]
*  Buckle. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1581.5200000000002s)]
*  Oh, B-U-C-C-A-L. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1582.5200000000002s)]
*  Buckle. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1583.5200000000002s)]
*  Fat removal. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1584.5200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1585.5200000000002s)]
*  Oh, so they take that out so they have more like the high cheekbones. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1586.5200000000002s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1588.1200000000001s)]
*  So it's like sculpting. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1589.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1590.1200000000001s)]
*  See like that on the left there. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1591.1200000000001s)]
*  So you're making your face sculpting. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1592.1200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1595.1200000000001s)]
*  So you're just doing that naturally. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1596.1200000000001s)]
*  You're more sculpted. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1597.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1598.1200000000001s)]
*  I lost a lot of face fat for sure. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1599.1200000000001s)]
*  I lost a lot of body fat. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1601.2800000000002s)]
*  But that's all from carnivore diet. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1603.0800000000002s)]
*  That changed everything for me. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1605.14s)]
*  How come, has Dana ever been on the podcast? [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1607.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1609.36s)]
*  He's been on. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1610.36s)]
*  He has? [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1611.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1612.36s)]
*  Yeah, he's been on. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1613.36s)]
*  When? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1614.36s)]
*  A while back. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1615.36s)]
*  He'll do it again. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1616.36s)]
*  I'm sure he'll do it again. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1617.36s)]
*  I don't, man, I never remembered him being on. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1618.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1619.36s)]
*  He was just at the club the other night. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1620.36s)]
*  He came to the club Thursday night? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1621.36s)]
*  Wednesday night? [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1622.36s)]
*  Wednesday night. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1623.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1624.36s)]
*  Just a couple nights ago. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1625.36s)]
*  Oh, good. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1626.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1627.36s)]
*  He was coming to hang out. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1628.36s)]
*  He's great. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1629.36s)]
*  I love that dude. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1630.36s)]
*  He looks fucking amazing. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1631.36s)]
*  He does. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1632.36s)]
*  I know. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1633.36s)]
*  He looks so good. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1634.36s)]
*  He looks so much. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1635.36s)]
*  But it's like, if you want a six pack or you want a fat face, you know, you don't get [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1637.2199999999998s)]
*  both. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1641.1s)]
*  If you've got a fat face, you don't get a six pack. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1642.1s)]
*  No. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1643.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's a given taste. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1644.4199999999998s)]
*  And if you want a six pack, your face gets thinner. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1645.4199999999998s)]
*  But this red light thing is like plumped up his face with collagen and it just looks so [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1648.1s)]
*  healthy. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1652.62s)]
*  His skin looks so healthy. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1653.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1654.62s)]
*  I'm really impressed. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1655.62s)]
*  But his energy level is so different. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1656.62s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1659.24s)]
*  But he doesn't eat any sugar anymore. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1660.62s)]
*  He doesn't drink alcohol anymore. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1662.2199999999998s)]
*  And he's just fucking super healthy. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1664.48s)]
*  No alcohol. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1666.8000000000002s)]
*  No alcohol. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1667.8000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure occasionally maybe he'll have a drink, but he does not drink like regularly. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1668.8000000000002s)]
*  What's the next big fight? [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1675.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, there's a nice card this next weekend in Austin that we're going to go see. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1676.88s)]
*  I'm pumped about that. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1682.24s)]
*  That should be fun. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1683.24s)]
*  But then the big one is Colby versus Leon Edwards in Vegas. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1684.24s)]
*  So for the welterweight title. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1691.6200000000001s)]
*  And that's a couple weeks from now. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1692.82s)]
*  That's a big one. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1694.54s)]
*  That's a big one. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1695.54s)]
*  That one's big. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1696.54s)]
*  That one's exciting. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1697.54s)]
*  Ooh, that's a good one. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1698.54s)]
*  What else is that card? [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1700.1799999999998s)]
*  Pull up that card, Tony. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1701.1799999999998s)]
*  Tony. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1702.1799999999998s)]
*  Oh, that's all right. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1703.1799999999998s)]
*  Tony and Patti Pimblitt. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1704.1799999999998s)]
*  Tony's training with David Coggins, which is crazy. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1705.1799999999998s)]
*  Oh, Pantoja versus Brandon Royvall for the flyweight world title and Shavkat Rockmanov [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1707.32s)]
*  versus Wonder Boy. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1713.9599999999998s)]
*  That's going to be a good one. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1715.52s)]
*  And Vicente Lukey versus Eden Gary. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1717.8s)]
*  Those are good fights. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1721.0s)]
*  That's a good fight. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1722.38s)]
*  I'm very interested to see Tony after he's been training with David Coggins. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1723.38s)]
*  There's a lot of very mixed reviews about whether or not that would be a good thing [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1726.22s)]
*  or a bad thing for him. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1731.94s)]
*  Yeah, I see. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1733.62s)]
*  I read a bunch of those comments. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1734.62s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1736.46s)]
*  It's like, who else is on it? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1738.42s)]
*  Oh, Josh Emmett's on that fight against Giga. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1740.06s)]
*  Oh, Giga Chakadze is on that fight too. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1742.54s)]
*  Look at this card. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1745.64s)]
*  Cardi Gardbrand and Brian Keller. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1746.64s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1748.42s)]
*  This is all on the home. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1750.12s)]
*  Dustin Jacoby and Alonzo Menafield. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1751.8400000000001s)]
*  Wow, these are good fucking cards. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1753.5600000000002s)]
*  This is a good card. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1756.3200000000002s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1758.24s)]
*  Go all the way back down there again, please. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1760.24s)]
*  That card is fucking stacked. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1762.24s)]
*  Yeah, that Cody fight will be good with Brian. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1764.68s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1769.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1770.2s)]
*  And Randy Brown versus Muslim Salikov is a fucking killer fight too. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1771.2s)]
*  These are good fights, man. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1775.8400000000001s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1777.5600000000002s)]
*  That's a card. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1778.5600000000002s)]
*  Top to bottom. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1779.5600000000002s)]
*  That's a really good card. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1780.7s)]
*  How many fights is that? [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1781.7s)]
*  13 fights. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1783.7s)]
*  14. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1784.7s)]
*  14. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1785.7s)]
*  13 in the world. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1786.7s)]
*  That's a long day for you. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1787.7s)]
*  Yeah, that's a long day. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1789.7s)]
*  It's fun though. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1791.7s)]
*  Who's going to win this one right there? [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1793.58s)]
*  Very interesting fight. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1795.34s)]
*  Very interesting fight. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1796.74s)]
*  How is Colby doing? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1799.46s)]
*  Because he was pretty fucked up by that sucker punch, right? [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1800.46s)]
*  Yeah, I think he's doing better now. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1803.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1805.78s)]
*  What was the extent of the damage that? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1806.78s)]
*  I don't know what it amounted to. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1809.44s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not sure. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1811.68s)]
*  Because he was suing them and did they settle that? [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1814.48s)]
*  I think they settled. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1817.3600000000001s)]
*  Did I read that they settled? [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1818.72s)]
*  Did you see that? [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1819.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1820.8400000000001s)]
*  So he just said, baby bitch. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1821.8400000000001s)]
*  I think it was just, you know, proven a point. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1824.92s)]
*  Yeah, you can't be going around sucker punching because it just kicked your ass. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1827.76s)]
*  You had your chance to punch him. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1831.24s)]
*  He had five rounds. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1833.28s)]
*  And it didn't work out at all. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1834.28s)]
*  I think it's just on principle. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1835.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1837.76s)]
*  I think Colby was just like, no, I'm going to make you pay. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1838.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1842.5s)]
*  Well, you can't just let people get away with that because then they're going to do it more [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1843.5s)]
*  often and it's going to really muddy up the sport. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1848.46s)]
*  It's going to be a real problem. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1851.3s)]
*  It's a crime. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1853.58s)]
*  I mean, you're literally committing crime. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1854.58s)]
*  Don't do that. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1855.58s)]
*  I think Colby is going to get that one. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1856.78s)]
*  You think so? [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1861.66s)]
*  I want him to. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1862.66s)]
*  I know you do because you like him. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1863.66s)]
*  I like Leon too. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1865.42s)]
*  It's a good fight. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1866.9s)]
*  I'll tell you that because if you were going to pick someone, Jorge Masada pleads no contest [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1868.0400000000002s)]
*  to charge from altercation. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1873.3200000000002s)]
*  This was November 6th. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1875.2800000000002s)]
*  Oh, so this just happened. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1876.2800000000002s)]
*  So they haven't settled it yet. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1877.2800000000002s)]
*  I think that was the end of it. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1878.2800000000002s)]
*  If he pleaded no contest, okay, it says the plea deal said that two felony charges of [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1881.2s)]
*  aggravated assault and criminal mischief were dropped as part of the plea agreement. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1886.98s)]
*  There is a no stay away order in the agreement. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1890.3600000000001s)]
*  Also a no stay away order. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1894.52s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1896.58s)]
*  What's a no stay away? [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1897.58s)]
*  I can understand a stay away order. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1899.38s)]
*  Like a restraining order. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1900.9s)]
*  But not a no stay away. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1901.9s)]
*  There is no stay away order is what it's saying. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1903.68s)]
*  But it says there's also no stay away order in the agreement. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1906.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1909.06s)]
*  There isn't a stay away order. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1910.06s)]
*  So he doesn't have to stay away. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1911.06s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1912.06s)]
*  So they can hang out with each other. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1913.06s)]
*  The 38 year old has been facing over 10 years in prison. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1914.06s)]
*  The case tends from altercation, punched him twice, breaking his tooth, even causing an [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1918.28s)]
*  alleged brain injury. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1924.2s)]
*  Incident occurred just a few weeks after coming and defeated Masvidal by unanimous decision [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1926.48s)]
*  in the main event. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1930.64s)]
*  Masvidal says I just beat the case. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1931.64s)]
*  I want to thank God. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1934.24s)]
*  I also want to thank my attorney because I'm a free fucking man. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1935.24s)]
*  Fuck you Colby. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1937.94s)]
*  It's going to be a fucking movie now. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1938.94s)]
*  All these orders, all these restraining orders, all these things have been lifted off. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1941.2s)]
*  It's going to be a fucking movie. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1944.68s)]
*  I don't know what that means. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1947.28s)]
*  Who's going to play Jorge? [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1948.28s)]
*  That would be a boring ass movie. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1952.18s)]
*  Like a guy sucker punches a guy and then gets off. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1954.18s)]
*  That's a movie? [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1957.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1958.18s)]
*  Thank you Jesus. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1959.18s)]
*  I don't know if it's going to be a movie. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1960.18s)]
*  I think that brain injury, that's just maybe he had a concussion. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1963.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1966.18s)]
*  He probably had a concussion. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1967.18s)]
*  I mean if he got sucker punched, most likely he got a concussion. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1968.18s)]
*  The thing is you can only get so many of those in your life. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1972.18s)]
*  And if you get a big one right before you're going to fight Leon Edwards, it's good that [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1976.18s)]
*  he took a lot of time off because he did take a lot of time off. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1981.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, he did. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1983.0800000000002s)]
*  It was like two years, right? [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1984.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, almost. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1985.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1986.0800000000002s)]
*  Be pretty close. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1987.0800000000002s)]
*  Leon is fucking good, man. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1989.0800000000002s)]
*  That's a good fight. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1991.0800000000002s)]
*  But if you wanted to pick someone who would have a really good shot at Leon, it would [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1992.0800000000002s)]
*  be someone who's an elite grappler, who has an incredible gas tank, who can push a ferocious [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=1996.0800000000002s)]
*  pace. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2000.48s)]
*  That's Colby. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2001.48s)]
*  And Colby wades right into the fire. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2002.48s)]
*  He starts it off like that just to, I think, keep him honest. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2005.88s)]
*  He'll come in throwing bombs because they know he wants to take him down. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2009.3799999999999s)]
*  So he's got to keep that honest, I think, and just get him thinking about the big punches [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2014.3799999999999s)]
*  too. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2018.18s)]
*  Yeah, he's got to get him thinking that this isn't just takedowns. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2019.18s)]
*  And if you just think about takedowns, I'm throwing haymakers your way. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2021.18s)]
*  He's fucking good, man. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2024.78s)]
*  Everybody other than Usman got fucked up by Colby, everybody. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2026.78s)]
*  And the Usman that faced Leon Edwards, man, I don't want to make excuses for Usman, but [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2032.3799999999999s)]
*  there is a reality of that guy's knees. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2038.48s)]
*  It's an inescapable reality that I know firsthand. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2041.0800000000002s)]
*  I've talked to him about it. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2043.48s)]
*  I know people that have treated him. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2044.48s)]
*  I know his knees are so fucked up. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2045.98s)]
*  It is just his mind that allows him to compete at that level. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2049.28s)]
*  We were talking about it during the last fight. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2053.88s)]
*  When you see the difference between his upper body and his legs, his legs are smooth and [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2055.6800000000003s)]
*  they're not that muscular. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2062.12s)]
*  And then you look at his upper body, he's a fucking superhero. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2063.6800000000003s)]
*  His upper body is so much bigger because he can't do much with his legs, man, which is [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2068.1800000000003s)]
*  so crazy. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2071.0800000000004s)]
*  This guy is one of the greatest UFC welterweight champions in history. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2073.0800000000004s)]
*  And he did it with fucked up knees. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2077.0800000000004s)]
*  He has to walk backwards downstairs. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2080.48s)]
*  That's insane what he did. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2084.1800000000003s)]
*  Insane. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2085.48s)]
*  But how old is he now? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2086.48s)]
*  36, 37. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2088.0800000000004s)]
*  And then he just lost to Hamzat. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2089.0800000000004s)]
*  Boy, look, when that fight was announced, I was like, oh, that's a great fight. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2094.78s)]
*  But if I was in Kamaru's ear, I was in Kamaru's ear, I'm like, dude. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2099.78s)]
*  No. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2105.78s)]
*  And I would have said that same thing to Volkanovsky. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2106.78s)]
*  I said, no. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2107.78s)]
*  Not a short notice. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2108.78s)]
*  Not 10 days. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2109.78s)]
*  You're the world champion. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2110.78s)]
*  You're not just the world champion. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2111.78s)]
*  You're one of the best ever. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2112.78s)]
*  And you have a real opportunity to go down in history as the greatest of all time. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2114.78s)]
*  Then he gets head kicked with a 10-day camp and he gets knocked out. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2118.98s)]
*  Well, and it also can change your career. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2124.28s)]
*  100%. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2127.28s)]
*  And a head kick like that could change your life. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2128.28s)]
*  I mean, I don't know what the extent of the damage is, but there's been some headkicks [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2130.28s)]
*  where, like Terry Adam, when Terry Adam fought Edson Barboza, Edson Barboza wheel kicked [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2135.28s)]
*  Terry Adam in the head and we kind of never saw Terry Adam fight at that level ever again. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2141.78s)]
*  It was a devastating kick. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2146.28s)]
*  He wheel kicked him and just shut him off. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2148.28s)]
*  I believe it was the first wheel kick knockout in the history of the UFC. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2151.78s)]
*  I'm pretty sure. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2156.78s)]
*  It was perfect. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2158.78s)]
*  It was just like the perfect example of how devastating that kick is when applied properly. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2159.78s)]
*  And Terry Adam was like a world-class contender. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2164.78s)]
*  He kind of never was the same again and he disappeared. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2167.78s)]
*  That's a risk. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2170.78s)]
*  I mean, everybody likes somebody who will go out on their shield and take any fight [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2171.78s)]
*  and like always game, but man. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2176.78s)]
*  10 days is not enough. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2178.78s)]
*  What's the risk? [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2179.78s)]
*  Because obviously he wasn't in shape. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2181.28s)]
*  So he's having to lose all that weight, you know, 30 pounds or whatever he had to lose. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2182.28s)]
*  You're not going to be your best. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2188.28s)]
*  No way. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2190.28s)]
*  How do you train me? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2191.28s)]
*  You're fighting the champion. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2192.28s)]
*  But then you have the opposite, which is Tom Aspinall. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2193.28s)]
*  Tom Aspinall fights Pavlich and takes that fight on two weeks notice and becomes the [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2197.28s)]
*  interim champion and fucks his back up and can't train at all. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2202.28s)]
*  Also though, he's a heavyweight. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2206.28s)]
*  He doesn't have to cut weight. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2208.28s)]
*  I would say the bigger guys, I think it's not quite the same. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2209.78s)]
*  It's not quite the same. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2212.78s)]
*  He doesn't have to cut weight, which is a giant factor. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2213.78s)]
*  So he doesn't have to do massive amounts of cardio and he could literally just let his [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2216.78s)]
*  body heal. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2219.78s)]
*  And I don't know what he was even able to do. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2220.78s)]
*  His back apparently was pretty fucked up. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2223.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2225.78s)]
*  But the other good thing was that Pavlich is not a grappler. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2226.78s)]
*  In fact, his lone loss was to Ouster over him and Ouster got him down the ground and [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2228.78s)]
*  grounded bounded him. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2233.78s)]
*  That was very early in his career. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2234.78s)]
*  But Aspinall, like that guy, he's something special. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2237.28s)]
*  He really is something special. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2240.28s)]
*  He's a very unusual, very unusual example because he's a heavyweight and he's a big [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2242.28s)]
*  guy, a really big guy, but he moves so fast. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2248.28s)]
*  And his coach, I think it's Colin, I forget how to say his last name. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2252.28s)]
*  How do you say his last name? [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2259.28s)]
*  Colin Hoon? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2261.28s)]
*  It's from Coban, this gym that he trains at in the UK. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2264.78s)]
*  From the time he was young, he emphasized his speed. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2269.78s)]
*  He knew he was going to be a big guy. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2273.78s)]
*  You're always going to be a big guy. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2275.78s)]
*  Colin Herron. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2277.78s)]
*  That's it. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2278.78s)]
*  Breaks down Curtis Blades challenge. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2280.78s)]
*  So this guy, he trained Darren Till. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2282.78s)]
*  He looks tough himself. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2286.78s)]
*  I'm sure he's tough. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2288.78s)]
*  You don't train those guys unless you're tough. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2290.78s)]
*  The point is that Colin from the early days of the career was emphasizing his speed. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2293.28s)]
*  And so his speed has always been extraordinary compared to other heavyweights. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2301.28s)]
*  He just fucking moves in. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2306.28s)]
*  It's all fast, explosive movements. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2308.28s)]
*  So he's got natural speed, but then he's also got a lot of training to execute quickly. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2310.28s)]
*  So when he moves in, he closed the gap. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2315.28s)]
*  You can see, fuck, he's fast for a big guy. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2317.28s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2320.78s)]
*  When I think of Volk, that fight was very close. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2324.78s)]
*  He lost the first time. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2327.78s)]
*  That was at the full camp at his best. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2329.78s)]
*  I think part of it was he said he needed something to do too. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2333.78s)]
*  Wasn't he like that idle time was killing him mentally? [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2337.78s)]
*  But he's got to fight with Ilya Toporya, who is a fucking killer. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2341.78s)]
*  Oh my God, that guy punches so hard. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2346.78s)]
*  He does everything so good. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2349.28s)]
*  Ilya Toporya, that guy is fucking special. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2351.28s)]
*  He's a real challenge. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2355.28s)]
*  When he fought Mitchell, because I thought Bryce Mitchell, I mean he's good. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2357.28s)]
*  And he beat the shit out of him. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2361.28s)]
*  But also Bryce Mitchell apparently was recovering from a flu. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2363.28s)]
*  He said he wasn't making excuses. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2367.28s)]
*  He wasn't making excuses, but here's an excuse. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2371.28s)]
*  Maybe, I mean, I get it. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2373.28s)]
*  I'm sure he's telling the truth. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2375.28s)]
*  It's a normal thing to happen in camp. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2377.78s)]
*  That impressed me how good, what's his name? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2379.78s)]
*  Toporya. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2383.78s)]
*  Well then the Josh Emmett fight was really impressive. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2384.78s)]
*  He beat the fuck out of Josh Emmett. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2386.78s)]
*  Josh Emmett is a hammer. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2388.78s)]
*  He's a scary dude. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2390.78s)]
*  And I think Toporya is special. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2391.78s)]
*  So Volk's fighting him next. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2393.78s)]
*  And he's fighting him after getting knocked unconscious. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2395.78s)]
*  All fair play to Islam, because Makachev looked fucking fantastic. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2400.78s)]
*  He made all the adjustments between the first fight and the second fight. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2405.28s)]
*  One of the first things he did was heavy kicks to the body from the left side, which set up that high kick. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2409.28s)]
*  Threw a lot of front kicks down the middle. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2414.28s)]
*  I mean he was hammering Volk from the outside. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2416.28s)]
*  Volk did a lot of things in the first fight that he just could not do in the second fight. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2419.28s)]
*  Because Makachev had improved so much. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2424.28s)]
*  And I think the embarrassment of having a very close fight with a guy that you're supposed to steamroll. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2427.28s)]
*  And a guy who's the 145 pound champ, you're the 155 pound champ, you're talking about going to 170. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2434.78s)]
*  And you have this incredibly close fight with this guy. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2440.78s)]
*  And you're not able to submit him, and he's laughing at you and talking shit. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2442.78s)]
*  And at the end of the fight he's beating you up. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2445.78s)]
*  He's on top beating you up. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2447.78s)]
*  I think that was a very, very strong motivating factor. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2448.78s)]
*  And Makachev just trained like a fucking monster for the second fight. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2453.78s)]
*  Which was supposed to be not... [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2456.78s)]
*  Who was it supposed to be? [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2459.78s)]
*  Olivera. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2461.78s)]
*  It's supposed to be Olivera. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2463.28s)]
*  Olivera gets injured. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2464.28s)]
*  But the point is like... [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2465.28s)]
*  He was at his very best. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2467.28s)]
*  He's at his very best. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2468.28s)]
*  And he's always getting better. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2469.28s)]
*  He's the best pound for pound fighter in the world now. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2470.28s)]
*  And I'm telling you that argument could have been before that fight, it could have been Volkanovsky. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2473.28s)]
*  You could have said Volkanovsky is the best. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2477.28s)]
*  Even though he lost that fight, he's going up in weight, extremely close. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2479.28s)]
*  I kind of thought he won the fight. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2483.28s)]
*  I gave him the nod, but very close. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2485.28s)]
*  It's not a robbery, but very close. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2487.28s)]
*  But now you got to say, well, Makachev just was bad. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2489.78s)]
*  He's better. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2491.78s)]
*  He's better than he was the first fight. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2492.78s)]
*  And we don't really get a chance to see if Volkanovsky was better. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2493.78s)]
*  Because Volkanovsky didn't have a camp. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2497.78s)]
*  You have to have a camp. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2499.78s)]
*  The difference between these guys with a camp and without a camp is giant. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2501.78s)]
*  It's like the difference between fighting at 40% and 100%. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2505.78s)]
*  I couldn't imagine. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2508.78s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2509.78s)]
*  I mean, mentally you'd have to... [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2510.78s)]
*  I don't know, how could you believe in yourself? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2511.78s)]
*  So Kamarov said, he kept wondering whether or not he had the gas to go. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2513.78s)]
*  Didn't know if he had the gas to step on the gas. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2519.28s)]
*  And at the end of the fight, he started tuning. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2521.28s)]
*  He did. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2523.28s)]
*  He looked good in the third round. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2524.28s)]
*  I was wishing that fight was two more rounds. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2526.28s)]
*  I was wishing they just fucking figured out some shit for his knees. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2528.28s)]
*  If that guy didn't have bad knees, who's going to touch him? [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2531.28s)]
*  He was so good in his prime. God damn. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2535.28s)]
*  Especially when he got that power. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2538.28s)]
*  At first he didn't have it. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2540.28s)]
*  It didn't seem like. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2542.28s)]
*  He was hardcore wrestling. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2544.28s)]
*  He hit Colby a couple of times. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2546.78s)]
*  We stopped Colby. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2548.78s)]
*  But when he knocked out Masvidal with one shot. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2550.78s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that was brutal. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2552.78s)]
*  Power. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2554.78s)]
*  Lights out. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2555.78s)]
*  Yeah, he's a real warrior. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2556.78s)]
*  The thing that impresses me the most is his mind. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2558.78s)]
*  The fact that he can overcome that pain. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2562.78s)]
*  The fucking guy's in pain walking. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2564.78s)]
*  You know? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2566.78s)]
*  It's like Goggins. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2567.78s)]
*  People know now because we talked about it. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2569.78s)]
*  Goggins just got another fucking knee surgery. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2571.78s)]
*  After Tony or before Tony? [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2575.28s)]
*  Before Tony. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2577.28s)]
*  His knees are destroyed. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2578.28s)]
*  It's bone on bone. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2580.28s)]
*  There's nothing going on there other than two bones banging into each other. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2582.28s)]
*  He's running thousands of miles. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2586.28s)]
*  The doctor looked at David's knees and he said, [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2588.28s)]
*  I don't understand how you can walk, never mind run, a thousand miles. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2590.28s)]
*  How the fuck are you doing this? [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2594.28s)]
*  It's just the mind. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2596.28s)]
*  That's the same thing with Camaro. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2598.28s)]
*  Camaro just puts that shit aside. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2600.28s)]
*  How do you think that, what do you think about Tony training with David? [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2603.78s)]
*  What do you think he's going to do? [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2607.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2609.78s)]
*  I don't know because we've never seen anybody train with David before. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2610.78s)]
*  You know, you could say on one hand, clearly when the two of them are training together, [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2613.78s)]
*  David's not struggling at all and Tony is struggling. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2619.78s)]
*  So there is definitely some ground to gain when it comes to endurance. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2623.78s)]
*  And mental strength. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2628.78s)]
*  But endurance, Tony's, I mean, David's not even fucking tired. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2631.28s)]
*  They're going side by side with each other. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2636.28s)]
*  He's like, who's going to carry the boats? [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2638.28s)]
*  He's not even fucking tired because he can go for days. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2640.28s)]
*  He can just go for days. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2642.28s)]
*  There's without a doubt some benefit in that. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2644.28s)]
*  So look at the two of them are doing that and they're doing the workouts together. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2648.28s)]
*  And David looks like he's hanging out at fucking Planet Fitness, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2652.28s)]
*  trying to pick up a chick. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2656.28s)]
*  He's like, so what are you doing after this? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2658.78s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2660.78s)]
*  Yeah, look at Tony standing up. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2661.78s)]
*  Tony's dying. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2663.78s)]
*  I think he pukes here in one of these videos. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2665.78s)]
*  I'm sure he puked. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2668.78s)]
*  But David said that Tony was the first guy to get through Hell Week with him, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2669.78s)]
*  which is incredible. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2674.78s)]
*  So they're doing miles of lunges, miles. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2675.78s)]
*  And David's doing all this. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2678.78s)]
*  Look at his knees, destroyed knees. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2680.78s)]
*  And this is just a few weeks after another fucking surgery. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2682.78s)]
*  They opened up his knee like a fish and sewed that bitch back up together. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2687.28s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck they did to it. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2691.28s)]
*  He's such a stud. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2693.28s)]
*  He's an animal. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2694.28s)]
*  Just a fucking pure machine. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2695.28s)]
*  You know who hates him? [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2697.28s)]
*  Who? [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2698.28s)]
*  Weak men. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2699.28s)]
*  Yeah, weak men hate him. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2700.28s)]
*  Weak men and jealous men and people who don't know him. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2702.28s)]
*  He gets misunderstood, unfortunately, by some people that I like. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2704.28s)]
*  They don't look into it hard enough. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2708.28s)]
*  And then there's also a natural inclination to try to find someone who's just excelling above and beyond everyone [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2711.78s)]
*  and find shortcomings in them, pick them apart, find something. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2721.78s)]
*  Instead of just look at the message that guy's saying. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2724.78s)]
*  What is he saying? [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2727.78s)]
*  He's saying, take control. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2728.78s)]
*  Take control. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2730.78s)]
*  Use your fucking mind. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2731.78s)]
*  Take control of your life and be better at everything. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2732.78s)]
*  And you can do this. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2735.78s)]
*  And I used to be a fat fuck and look at me now. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2736.78s)]
*  That's a great message, man. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2738.78s)]
*  That message resonates with me. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2740.78s)]
*  It resonates with you. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2743.78s)]
*  It resonates with all the people that we know. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2744.78s)]
*  That is a fucking message and a half. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2746.78s)]
*  And he's living it. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2748.78s)]
*  He's not just saying it. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2749.78s)]
*  He's living it. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2750.78s)]
*  I think he's a national treasure. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2752.78s)]
*  Oh, so do I. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2754.78s)]
*  You have this quote. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2755.78s)]
*  I see it's been going around on Reels talking about, God, there's a certain set of men who, [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2757.78s)]
*  that are just, I can't remember how you say it. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2763.78s)]
*  It's so good. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2766.78s)]
*  I've been seeing people put it on their own Reels, but they're just built for, I don't [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2768.28s)]
*  know if it was chaos or something. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2774.28s)]
*  Do you remember this spiel you had? [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2775.28s)]
*  I've said a lot of things. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2777.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2778.28s)]
*  I know. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2779.28s)]
*  But it's a good one that's really popular right now, but it describes people like David [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2780.28s)]
*  to a T. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2784.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2785.28s)]
*  And there are. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2786.28s)]
*  There's a certain group of men who a lot of people aren't going to understand. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2787.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2792.28s)]
*  Because it's so different. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2793.28s)]
*  But to those people, those are the national treasure. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2794.28s)]
*  There's a beacon that's like, okay, that's the goal. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2797.78s)]
*  Well, most people, they don't understand what it's like to really test yourself and [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2799.78s)]
*  to really do something that's difficult all the time. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2806.28s)]
*  I'm doing this thing now where I'm running this boot camp for comedians. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2808.78s)]
*  Yeah, I've heard you talk about it. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2812.78s)]
*  So I did it today. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2814.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2815.78s)]
*  And so Derek Poston just joined today. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2816.78s)]
*  Shout out to my man, Derek. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2818.78s)]
*  So Asana Ma, Derek, Brian Simpson, Duncan Trussell when he's in town. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2820.78s)]
*  He wasn't in town today. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2824.78s)]
*  And Shane Gillis. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2826.28s)]
*  And we get after it. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2827.28s)]
*  These guys are getting after it. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2829.28s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2830.28s)]
*  And they start every day with 100 push-ups, 100 bodyweight squats. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2831.28s)]
*  We do five sets. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2834.28s)]
*  And I tell them, you can't do 100, don't do 100. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2836.28s)]
*  You can do five push-ups in a row and you're struggling, stop at five. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2838.28s)]
*  I'm trying to build a base. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2841.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2842.28s)]
*  So I said, I don't want you to kill yourself. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2843.28s)]
*  The whole idea here is we're just building a base. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2845.28s)]
*  And we're going to keep going. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2847.28s)]
*  And they've been doing it consistently. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2848.28s)]
*  This week was four times a week. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2850.28s)]
*  For how long? [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2851.28s)]
*  We did it four times this week. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2852.28s)]
*  When we were with The Rock, we worked out for three hours. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2853.78s)]
*  We did two hours of work. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2855.78s)]
*  When did you start this? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2856.78s)]
*  The boot camp, how long ago? [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2857.78s)]
*  Four weeks. Four weeks now. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2858.78s)]
*  So they're four weeks in. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2859.78s)]
*  Yeah, nice. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2860.78s)]
*  And we're very consistent. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2861.78s)]
*  They should be seeing results then. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2862.78s)]
*  They're seeing results. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2863.78s)]
*  But they're seeing results in how they feel. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2864.78s)]
*  Like almost immediately. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2866.78s)]
*  Because I'm not killing them. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2867.78s)]
*  I'm not killing them, but when The Rock was here, I killed them. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2869.78s)]
*  When The Rock was here, I was like, we're going to get after it today. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2871.78s)]
*  How'd that big fucker do? [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2873.78s)]
*  He did pretty good, except for the mobility stuff. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2874.78s)]
*  Like windmills. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2876.78s)]
*  He struggled with windmills and he struggled with a couple of things. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2877.78s)]
*  Windmills? Is that the thing? [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2880.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2883.28s)]
*  Nobody can do those. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2884.28s)]
*  Yeah, I can do those. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2885.28s)]
*  People can do them. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2886.28s)]
*  I can do them. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2887.28s)]
*  Well, they require flexibility, but they require range of motion and core strength. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2888.28s)]
*  That's a real core strength thing. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2893.28s)]
*  But that is the thing. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2895.28s)]
*  Those and Turkish get-ups are not sexy. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2896.28s)]
*  They don't give you big biceps, but those apply very well to functional strength. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2900.28s)]
*  Like martial arts and things like that. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2906.28s)]
*  Like if you've got to carry a fucking elk quarter up a hill, they really work for that. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2908.28s)]
*  Because you can throw stuff around like your core. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2912.28s)]
*  It can manipulate heavy things. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2915.78s)]
*  So I do it with 70 pounds, right? [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2918.78s)]
*  So I clean and press 70 pounds. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2920.78s)]
*  And then I have this motion where I'm going all the way down like that and then all the way back up. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2922.78s)]
*  I know, I tried it. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2928.78s)]
*  It works those lower back muscles. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2929.78s)]
*  It works your abdominals. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2932.78s)]
*  It works the strength and stability of your shoulder. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2933.78s)]
*  It works everything. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2936.78s)]
*  But that's not Turkish get-ups. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2937.78s)]
*  No, Turkish get-ups, that's even harder. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2941.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2943.28s)]
*  What do you do that with? [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2944.28s)]
*  Those guys are going to start that next week. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2945.28s)]
*  Now they know. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2946.28s)]
*  So Turkish get-ups... [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2947.28s)]
*  They should be doing it with no weight, right? [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2949.28s)]
*  Well, I'm going to start them with 10 pounds. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2951.28s)]
*  I mean, just doing it is hard. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2953.28s)]
*  Yeah, especially when you're doing reps. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2956.28s)]
*  They're going to do it with 10 pounds. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2957.28s)]
*  With Turkish get-ups is you lie on your back. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2959.28s)]
*  You know what it is, right? [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2961.28s)]
*  You lie on your back, you press it, and then you get up. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2962.28s)]
*  You get up to one leg. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2965.28s)]
*  You lift it overhead, stand up, and then slowly lower yourself back down. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2966.28s)]
*  Lie back down on the ground again. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2970.28s)]
*  Switch hands. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2971.78s)]
*  Get up, hold one leg, stand up, lower yourself down. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2972.78s)]
*  I'm going to show them the technique. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2977.78s)]
*  How to hike your hips up. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2978.78s)]
*  Pop your hips up when you get one leg up. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2980.78s)]
*  So you put one leg up, you pop your hips up, you get the other leg underneath you, and then you stand up. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2983.78s)]
*  It's not sexy, but it's very, very, very functional. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2988.78s)]
*  And it just breaks you down. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2992.78s)]
*  There was this guy back in this gym that I trained. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2994.78s)]
*  It's closed down now. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2997.78s)]
*  It was international fitness, but his name is Will Denwitty. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=2999.28s)]
*  And he was the strongest guy I've ever seen, but he used to do that with 135. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3002.28s)]
*  Like he'd put the Olympic bar with the 45s on it and do Turkish get-ups with 145. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3007.28s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3011.28s)]
*  That's an animal. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3012.28s)]
*  Oh, he also squatted 225 100 times without stopping. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3013.28s)]
*  Just like 100 reps. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3018.28s)]
*  I gave him a t-shirt. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3020.28s)]
*  Just body weight. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3021.28s)]
*  I gave him a t-shirt. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3023.28s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3024.28s)]
*  I gave him one of my t-shirts. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3025.28s)]
*  This was like 10 years ago. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3026.28s)]
*  I'm like, you earned that. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3028.78s)]
*  It took him seven minutes or something like that. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3030.78s)]
*  Was it a keep hammering shirt or was it nobody cares try harder? [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3032.78s)]
*  No, I think it was the greater the sacrifice, the greater the reward or something like that. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3035.78s)]
*  God damn, that's a crazy, that's powerful. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3041.78s)]
*  Yeah, he's a beast. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3043.78s)]
*  But anyway, that's where I first saw Turkish get-up. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3044.78s)]
*  Because he would put on, I mean, he'd be yelling and screaming and putting on a show over there. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3047.78s)]
*  I told my boys they were just starting lifting. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3052.78s)]
*  I'm like, that's the strongest guy in Springfield. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3056.28s)]
*  Nobody knows him really other than in this gym, but he's just a freak. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3060.28s)]
*  Have you ever heard of Tom Haviland? [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3063.28s)]
*  No. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3065.28s)]

*  Go to his Instagram. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3078.28s)]
*  He wears fucking flannel shirts and jeans and shit. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3079.28s)]
*  Private account. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3083.28s)]

*  Well, I can't get access to it until you approve it. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3086.78s)]
*  Shit. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3089.78s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3091.78s)]
*  Why is he private, Tom? [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3092.78s)]
*  I think he doesn't want to be bothered. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3094.78s)]
*  Because all he does is this guy's out in the outback fucking lifting homemade weights. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3097.78s)]
*  He's six foot five, I think. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3102.78s)]
*  And he's 300 pounds. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3104.78s)]

*  And the workout, that's the guy. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3112.78s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3113.78s)]
*  The fucking workouts that this guy does. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3115.28s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3117.28s)]
*  There's not a goddamn chance in hell he'd pass the piss test. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3118.28s)]
*  I bet his piss melts styrofoam. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3120.28s)]
*  But this guy, it's jailhouse strong. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3123.28s)]
*  I don't even know if he's been in jail, but he looks like a guy that you wouldn't want [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3127.28s)]
*  to go to jail with. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3131.28s)]
*  But, I mean, he's just absolutely freakishly powerful. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3132.28s)]
*  Yeah, he is. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3136.28s)]
*  This is like normal, conventional stuff. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3137.28s)]
*  But the stuff that he does, like on his property, he does all this stuff outside. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3139.28s)]
*  So he's got like fucking dogs running around and shit. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3144.78s)]
*  And he's dead lifting 600 pounds and walking around with it. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3146.78s)]
*  He does like freakish shit. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3150.78s)]
*  And he documents it all on Instagram. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3153.78s)]

*  Yeah, he's a stud. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3163.78s)]
*  I don't know, there's some guy, I love following guys like that. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3165.78s)]
*  But it's definitely private. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3169.78s)]
*  So like look at the kind of shit he does. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3172.28s)]
*  So this is how he works out. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3174.28s)]
*  He works out with like a fucking lumberjack shirt on and pants. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3176.28s)]

*  So he's got the most freakish physique ever. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3182.28s)]
*  And he's got it covered up. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3184.28s)]
*  I don't even know how much weight that is. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3186.28s)]
*  Most of the videos are you seeing him. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3188.28s)]
*  749. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3190.28s)]

*  I mean I don't know what his goals are other than that. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3215.78s)]
*  But I mean some of the shit that he does is just fucking insanity. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3218.78s)]

*  Oh Bob Sapp. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3290.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3291.28s)]
*  Bob Sapp was 75 pounds heavier than him. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3292.28s)]
*  I know but imagine this. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3294.28s)]
*  Actually what does he weigh? [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3295.28s)]
*  I think he was actually trying to weigh 400 pounds. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3296.28s)]
*  Tom Havilland. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3299.28s)]
*  Wasn't he trying to get up to 400? [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3300.28s)]
*  That's a good weight. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3303.28s)]
*  That's total doable. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3306.28s)]
*  I think he's pushing, I think he's heavier than 300 pounds now that I'm thinking about it. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3307.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3312.28s)]
*  385? [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3313.78s)]
*  360. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3314.78s)]
*  360. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3315.78s)]
*  What? [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3316.78s)]
*  What? [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3317.78s)]
*  I think that was the thing, that's right now that I'm thinking about it, is the road to [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3318.78s)]
*  400 pounds. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3321.28s)]
*  So he's trying to build himself up. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3322.28s)]
*  I want to see him versus Bob Sapp. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3323.28s)]
*  But what he does a lot of, which is very interesting, is like unconventional type workouts where [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3325.28s)]
*  like he attaches a chain to his right arm and he's dragging behind all these weights [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3330.28s)]
*  while he's carrying a log with his two arms. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3334.28s)]
*  I saw that. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3336.28s)]
*  That was. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3337.28s)]
*  He does a lot of interesting stuff like that that he thinks that that's important. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3338.28s)]
*  Like of course. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3342.28s)]
*  Yeah, like farmers carries and shit with insane amounts of weight. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3343.28s)]
*  I've heard that before from many people that not just pushing things and pressing things [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3346.28s)]
*  but carrying them around is where you get real strength. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3351.28s)]
*  Yeah, you rock. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3354.28s)]
*  See? [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3355.28s)]
*  That's right. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3356.28s)]
*  That rock that you guys take up to Picsca. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3357.28s)]
*  It works. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3358.28s)]
*  Yeah, there's something to that. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3359.28s)]
*  There's something to unconventional movements. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3361.28s)]
*  No, because your body has to hold and correct and your core just gets hammered. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3363.28s)]
*  Just like the Turkish get-ups. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3368.28s)]
*  Same kind of thing. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3369.28s)]
*  Yeah, and that's what it's all about is just like not being just a lot of people can be [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3370.28s)]
*  strong straight, you know, just doing pretty uniform movements. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3375.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3379.28s)]
*  But when you can be strong out of position, awkward things, that's real strength. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3380.28s)]
*  That's real strength. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3385.28s)]
*  And I think that real strength also applies to conventional lifts. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3386.28s)]
*  And that's why guys like this Tom Havilland guy can lift insane amounts of weight also. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3391.28s)]
*  A little bit of Mexican supplements, if you know what I'm saying. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3396.28s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3398.28s)]
*  Creatine. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3399.28s)]
*  Yeah, oh, yeah. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3400.28s)]
*  And branch chain amino acids. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3401.28s)]
*  They're very important. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3402.28s)]
*  And milk. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3403.28s)]
*  Like Mark McGuire. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3404.28s)]
*  Yeah, he's probably eating wild boar milk. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3405.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3406.28s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck that guy eats, but that's a huge fella. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3407.28s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3408.28s)]
*  That's the greatest thing about social media is finding freaks like that. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3409.28s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3410.28s)]
*  And this freak, I mean, I think that's all he's doing. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3411.28s)]
*  I mean, he's not like selling things. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3412.28s)]
*  He's not like telling people, like, hey, you know, I'm going to be a good guy. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3413.28s)]
*  I'm going to be a good guy. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3414.28s)]

*  Whoa. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3500.28s)]

*  Okay, so he was 183 pounds in 2000 and... [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3511.28s)]
*  In 2019. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3515.28s)]

*  That's so crazy. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3527.28s)]
*  That's so much weight. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3529.28s)]
*  And I don't know how, I think he's super young. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3531.28s)]
*  He looks young. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3534.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3535.28s)]
*  Oh, so he covers himself up like that when he works. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3536.28s)]
*  Like even, like show some squats, Jamie. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3539.28s)]
*  There's some good... [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3541.28s)]
*  I don't know if he had it on this list. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3542.28s)]
*  I was just looking behind the video. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3545.28s)]
*  There's not a lot of video. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3547.28s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3548.28s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3549.28s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's on YouTube. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3550.28s)]
*  3.6 million followers. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3551.28s)]
*  See his YouTube? [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3552.28s)]
*  Yeah, he's got a lot of... [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3553.28s)]
*  That's where he gets all his videos. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3555.28s)]
*  Well, like what does he have? [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3557.28s)]
*  Yeah, 2.3 million subscribers on YouTube. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3560.28s)]
*  Just from being jacked. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3563.28s)]
*  Yeah, just a freak though. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3564.28s)]
*  Isn't it crazy that just being jacked could get you millions of subscribers now? [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3566.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3571.28s)]
*  I mean, right. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3572.28s)]
*  So this is what he'll do. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3573.28s)]
*  But he trains frickin' hard. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3577.28s)]
*  So he's doing like all kinds of crazy... [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3579.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's what just... [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3581.28s)]
*  Crazy little mental battle before this set of squats. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3582.28s)]
*  I think it's worth discussing. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3585.28s)]
*  Bro, you can hear the steroids in his voice. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3587.28s)]
*  It's like he's gargling steroids. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3589.28s)]
*  Five plates on there. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3591.28s)]
*  I didn't... [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3593.28s)]
*  The guy's jacked. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3594.28s)]
*  I know. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3595.28s)]
*  But they're... [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3596.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3597.28s)]
*  Look at the fuckin' legs on him. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3598.28s)]
*  Holy shit, look at his fuckin' thighs. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3600.28s)]
*  Bro, that guy must chafe like a motherfucker. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3603.28s)]
*  He needs some good me undies. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3605.28s)]
*  The kind that go all the way down. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3607.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3608.28s)]
*  You know those boxer briefs? [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3609.28s)]
*  Keep your legs from rubbin' in the center. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3610.28s)]
*  Yeah, I don't really know what his goal is, but... [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3611.28s)]
*  Be massiver. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3614.28s)]
*  Huge. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3615.28s)]
*  More massive. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3616.28s)]
*  Maybe it's Tom Havilland. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3617.28s)]
*  Maybe that's his goal. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3618.28s)]
*  These guys, you know, they want to be... [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3619.28s)]
*  When you walk in a room, they want people to be like, [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3622.28s)]
*  holy... [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3624.28s)]
*  Like, pointing. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3625.28s)]
*  Like, holy shit, look at this freak. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3626.28s)]
*  Well, he gained 50 pounds in, what, four years? [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3627.28s)]
*  And he's shredded. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3631.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3632.28s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3633.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3634.28s)]
*  Yeah, you don't do that with oatmeal. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3635.28s)]
*  No. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3636.28s)]
*  You need some help. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3637.28s)]
*  You need a little help. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3638.28s)]
*  Yeah, so I... [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3639.28s)]
*  Step away, Usada. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3640.28s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3641.28s)]
*  Yeah, nothing to see here. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3642.28s)]
*  It's fun to see guys like that. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3643.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3646.28s)]
*  It is fun. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3647.28s)]
*  I don't want to do it, but it's fun to see. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3648.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3650.28s)]
*  I'm obsessed with watching him. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3651.28s)]
*  I think Brian Callan was the first guy to tell me about him. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3652.28s)]
*  But isn't Brian gay? [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3655.28s)]
*  It's like, I'm sure he was attracted to him. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3656.28s)]
*  Callan? [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3658.28s)]
*  No, he's attracted to some men, but he's not gay at all. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3659.28s)]
*  He's attracted spiritually to them. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3662.28s)]
*  Oh. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3664.28s)]
*  Yeah, he's not sexually attracted to them. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3665.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah, to their... [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3666.28s)]
*  You know, he imagines if he was in prison, that he would do with that guy, [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3667.28s)]
*  and that guy would protect him. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3670.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3672.28s)]
*  And he wouldn't snuggle with them, keep them warm. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3673.28s)]
*  Yeah, he... [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3678.28s)]
*  Spooky dudes. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3680.28s)]
*  There's some people out there doing freaky shit, [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3681.28s)]
*  but man, that's a great way to get hurt, too, try emulating that. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3684.28s)]
*  I mean, when you're lifting, like, very, very heavy... [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3687.28s)]
*  I don't lift heavy, obviously. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3690.28s)]
*  I'm not big like that. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3692.28s)]
*  The heaviest thing I lift is like 90 pounds. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3693.28s)]
*  I occasionally do 90-pound kettlebells. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3696.28s)]
*  I think it's good, though, because he... [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3698.28s)]
*  Yeah, you're not going to do that, but you see how hard he's working. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3700.28s)]
*  I mean, he's soaked with sweat doing squats. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3702.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3705.28s)]
*  That's... I think people can be inspired by that and be like... [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3706.28s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3709.28s)]
*  Hey, I need to... I'm not going to be a freak, but I can push harder. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3710.28s)]
*  Also, it might make them take a road trip to Mexico to fill up the trunk. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3713.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3717.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3719.28s)]
*  You know, here for a good time, not a long time. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3720.28s)]
*  Well, that's definitely the case with folks like that. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3722.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3725.28s)]
*  You know, because a lot of those guys, you know, those really big guys, [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3726.28s)]
*  they have real problems. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3729.28s)]
*  It's like, you know, there was that one good rich Piana. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3731.28s)]
*  I know. Love that guy. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3734.28s)]
*  Yeah, that guy was ridiculous. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3736.28s)]
*  I still share his... like, he's got so many good reels, too. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3737.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3740.28s)]
*  Like, he just says crazy stuff. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3741.28s)]
*  Because he's like... The one, my favorite, is that he's sitting with this girl, [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3743.28s)]
*  and he's like... kind of a serious question. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3746.28s)]
*  He's like... he goes, [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3748.28s)]
*  Would you rather have the dick hang lower than the balls [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3750.28s)]
*  or the balls hang lower than the dick? [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3753.28s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3755.28s)]
*  That was his concern? [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3756.28s)]
*  That was his question to her. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3758.28s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3759.28s)]
*  Well, some people worry about stars and asteroids and black holes and aliens, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3760.28s)]
*  and some people worry about balls and dicks. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3764.28s)]
*  Yeah, so he has so many funny ones like that. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3766.28s)]
*  He was so freakishly huge. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3770.28s)]
*  Oh, he's giant. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3772.28s)]
*  He was so stupid. He had an eight-hour arm workout. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3773.28s)]
*  I know. Look at this. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3776.28s)]
*  Yeah. I mean... [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3777.28s)]
*  But he was, like, super open about his steroid use, [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3778.28s)]
*  and, you know, he died from it. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3780.28s)]
*  He died at, like... I think he was, like, in his early 40s or mid-40s. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3782.28s)]
*  I think... I thought he... [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3785.28s)]
*  Look at the size of his neck. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3787.28s)]
*  His neck looks like there's a tumor below his ear. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3789.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3792.28s)]
*  Look at the fucking neck muscles. That's so preposterous. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3793.28s)]
*  Look at those arms, dude. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3796.28s)]
*  Ridiculous. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3797.28s)]
*  He used to do an eight-hour arm workout. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3798.28s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3800.28s)]
*  Insane. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3801.28s)]
*  I know. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3802.28s)]
*  Insane. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3803.28s)]
*  But I guarantee you, no matter where he walked in, [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3804.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3807.28s)]
*  people noticed him. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3808.28s)]
*  And that was the goal. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3809.28s)]
*  Well, that's what he wanted. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3810.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3811.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3812.28s)]
*  I mean... [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3813.28s)]
*  To each their own. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3815.28s)]
*  I mean, I love the fact that it's freedom. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3816.28s)]
*  You can do whatever you want. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3818.28s)]
*  If you want to be that guy, you can be that guy. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3819.28s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3821.28s)]
*  I don't want to be that guy, but, you know, [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3822.28s)]
*  he obviously, that's what he enjoyed. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3824.28s)]
*  Goal, 22-inch calves. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3826.28s)]
*  That's... [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3828.28s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3829.28s)]
*  I didn't know he did legs at all. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3830.28s)]
*  That's like a waist. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3832.28s)]
*  Oh, he did legs. He had giant legs. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3833.28s)]
*  His legs were huge. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3835.28s)]
*  I know. He was just so focused on the arms. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3836.28s)]
*  They're preposterous, but they're probably useless. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3838.28s)]
*  They're probably useless. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3840.28s)]
*  They're probably useless. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3841.28s)]
*  I feel like he had an MMA fight. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3842.28s)]
*  I thought he died from... [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3843.28s)]
*  He passed out and hit his head [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3844.28s)]
*  when he was getting a haircut. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3845.28s)]
*  Really? [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3846.28s)]
*  I think so. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3847.28s)]
*  Really? [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3848.28s)]
*  I thought so. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3849.28s)]
*  Are you just putting that out there, [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3850.28s)]
*  or did you do any research? [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3851.28s)]
*  No, I don't do much research. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3852.28s)]
*  I thought he had, like, a massive heart attack [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3853.28s)]
*  or something. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3854.28s)]
*  No, I don't. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3855.28s)]
*  It's a lot of how those guys go. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3856.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3857.28s)]
*  Like, everything gets bigger. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3858.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3859.28s)]
*  When you're taking... [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3860.28s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3861.28s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3862.28s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3863.28s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3864.28s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3865.28s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3866.28s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3867.28s)]
*  His heart was probably this big, too. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3872.28s)]
*  Yeah, it was probably a basketball. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3873.28s)]
*  Superhuman levels of everything. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3874.28s)]
*  Did you see how he died? [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3875.28s)]
*  He collapsed in early August [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3876.28s)]
*  and died after being in a coma for two weeks. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3877.28s)]
*  Drug involvement could not be ruled out. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3878.28s)]
*  46 years old. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3879.28s)]
*  Drug involvement couldn't be ruled out. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3880.28s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3881.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3882.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3883.28s)]
*  Yeah, he was pretty young to die, [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3884.28s)]
*  but I didn't know he was... [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3885.28s)]
*  I bet if he got vaccinated, they'd rule that out. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3886.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3887.28s)]
*  Heart disease reported in the history of drug use. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3888.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3889.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3890.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3891.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3892.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3893.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3894.28s)]

*  I don't know. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3898.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3899.28s)]
*  Heart disease reported in the history of drug use. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3900.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3903.28s)]
*  Yeah, not good. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3904.28s)]
*  Probably never touched cardio. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3905.78s)]
*  No, because that burns muscle. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3908.28s)]
*  Fuck out of here with your cardio. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3910.28s)]
*  20 bottles of steroids found at his house. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3912.28s)]
*  Only 20? [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3914.28s)]
*  Must have been in between orders. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3915.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3918.28s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3919.28s)]
*  Bottles of steroids. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3920.28s)]
*  Jesus Christ, buddy. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3921.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3923.28s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3924.28s)]
*  Oh. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3925.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3926.28s)]
*  That's a lot. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3927.28s)]
*  Have you shot your new bow yet? [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3928.28s)]
*  I have not. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3930.28s)]
*  No. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3931.28s)]
*  Your Alpha X? [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3932.28s)]
*  No, I've been too busy, unfortunately. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3933.28s)]
*  I was gonna take it today, but obviously I had some stuff we had to do today. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3935.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3940.28s)]
*  But I'm gonna take it on Monday. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3941.28s)]
*  It's a good bow. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3942.28s)]
*  Go to Alpha. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3943.28s)]
*  Archery country. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3944.28s)]
*  Yeah, I'm very excited. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3945.28s)]
*  Look, if it's better than last year's, last year's models were better than the year before, [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3946.28s)]
*  which I don't know how they keep doing. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3948.28s)]
*  I don't either. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3950.28s)]
*  But Hoyt keeps making better bows every year. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3951.28s)]
*  They're just smoother and more accurate. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3953.28s)]
*  Like, I shot my, not this past year's bow, but the year before, I shot it one day just [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3956.28s)]
*  for goof. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3964.28s)]
*  I said, let me just pick up my old bow and see how that shoots. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3965.28s)]
*  It wasn't out of tune, but it was significant. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3968.28s)]
*  Like, I could see the difference in accuracy and the feel in the hand. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3971.28s)]
*  It was like a little more vibration in the hand, a little more clunky in the draw cycle. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3975.28s)]
*  And then I picked up last year's bow and I was like, wow. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3981.28s)]
*  You feel the smoothness of the draw cycle. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3984.28s)]
*  And then it just, I was more confident with it. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3987.28s)]
*  It felt more accurate. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3989.28s)]
*  It's crazy how they just keep making them better. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3990.28s)]
*  I think when you're so dialed in with your bow and you shoot as much as, it doesn't take [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3993.28s)]
*  much of a difference to feel it. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3997.28s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=3999.28s)]
*  You shoot so much. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4000.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4001.28s)]
*  A little change, you're gonna be like, whoa, it feels like a lot, even though it's a little. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4002.28s)]
*  But can you imagine being those engineers and you've got to like fine tune every single [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4006.28s)]
*  aspect of these cams and the limbs and the limb pockets and the riser. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4012.28s)]
*  One little thing they did, which is pretty cool, because you know how you have those [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4018.28s)]
*  little kickstand things, the go sticks? [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4021.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4024.28s)]
*  Last year, the cam would sit in the dirt or whatever. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4025.28s)]
*  Now they have a little shelf that it sits on. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4029.28s)]
*  Even that little tiny, that's an improvement. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4032.28s)]
*  That's an improvement. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4034.28s)]
*  That's a big one because I would be looking at where my cam was sitting and where the [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4035.28s)]
*  string was kind of rubbing on rocks and dirt and be like, God, is that wearing through? [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4038.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4042.28s)]
*  So they pretty much come up, think of everything to make it better, to tweak, to fine tune. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4043.28s)]
*  And then you feel it. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4050.28s)]
*  I mean, the bows this year, that one I just set up, they say, who knows how they, I'm [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4051.28s)]
*  sure they measure it, but it's 25% quieter, I believe. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4057.28s)]
*  And it's, I don't know what percent, but it's quiet. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4062.28s)]
*  Very quiet. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4065.28s)]
*  It's weird. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4066.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4067.28s)]
*  I don't know how they're doing all that. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4068.28s)]
*  I don't either. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4069.28s)]
*  And then there's the factor of heavy arrows versus lighter arrows. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4070.28s)]
*  Lighter arrows make more noise. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4072.28s)]
*  Heavier hours are a little quieter. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4074.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4076.28s)]
*  But not, probably not 25%. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4077.28s)]
*  That's a lot. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4079.28s)]
*  No, you're, you are obsessed with art. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4080.28s)]
*  Like you're always sending me, hey, have you seen this? [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4082.28s)]
*  Have you seen these? [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4085.28s)]
*  Have you seen these heads? [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4086.28s)]
*  Have you seen these? [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4087.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4088.28s)]
*  I mean, it's so cool. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4089.28s)]
*  That's kind of the best part about archery is all the options. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4090.28s)]
*  You know, it's just, how can I tweak this, make it a little better, give you a little [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4095.28s)]
*  more confidence? [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4100.280000000001s)]
*  Is this going to perform better? [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4101.280000000001s)]
*  That's the, I mean, that's the chase every day. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4102.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4105.280000000001s)]
*  I'm excited about those arrow, those broadheads that I showed you, those tooth of the arrow [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4106.280000000001s)]
*  broadheads. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4110.280000000001s)]
*  I like those because they're American made and they figured out some way. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4111.280000000001s)]
*  They, first of all, they cut them out of one solid piece of steel and they figured out [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4114.280000000001s)]
*  a way to have most of the mass in the ferrule. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4118.28s)]
*  So apparently they fly really good. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4121.28s)]
*  So Jordan over at archery country was shooting them out to a hundred. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4123.28s)]
*  He's like, dude, these are incredible. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4126.28s)]
*  They shoot so good. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4128.28s)]
*  And it's a four blade head. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4129.28s)]
*  So like, you said four inches of cut. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4130.28s)]
*  That's what the XL's, the smaller ones are a little bit less, but it's still more than [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4133.28s)]
*  three inches of cut. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4138.28s)]
*  Does the XL's weigh more than a hundred grains? [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4139.28s)]
*  No, they can get them in a hundred grains, 125, I think 150 and 175. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4141.28s)]
*  And all they're doing is just putting more mass in the ferrule. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4147.28s)]
*  It's not a bigger thing. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4150.28s)]
*  Like, so it's still like a heavy field point. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4152.28s)]
*  And so the mass goes deep into the arrow and into the front front point. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4155.28s)]
*  It's not in the heads. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4160.28s)]
*  So they, and especially with the vented ones, they probably won't plane or won't plane much. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4161.28s)]
*  But then you don't have to think about mechanicals, whether they open or not open or shooting [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4165.28s)]
*  them through grass or any kind of stuff. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4170.28s)]
*  So I'm, I got to hunt with Ronella. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4173.28s)]
*  We're going to hunt for white hailed, whitetails in South Texas for meat eater. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4176.28s)]
*  That'd be fun. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4180.28s)]
*  In a couple of weeks. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4181.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4182.28s)]
*  So I'm going to, I'm going to use those heads. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4183.28s)]
*  Okay. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4184.28s)]
*  I'm going to try them out. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4185.28s)]
*  Did you stay with the FMJs or the Axis or are you trying those pro comps? [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4186.28s)]
*  I do not know. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4191.28s)]
*  We were trying to figure out what, what arrows to use. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4192.28s)]
*  We're going to, we're going to sort that out actually this weekend. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4195.28s)]
*  Didn't, okay. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4198.28s)]
*  Cause I'm trying to go a little lighter. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4199.28s)]
*  I mean, it's 520. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4200.28s)]
*  Those pro comps I think would be, cause mine are 484. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4201.28s)]
*  The problem is like, there's not the best options for lighted knocks with four millimeter [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4204.28s)]
*  arrows. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4210.28s)]
*  I sent you like from Gary at Easton that whatever brand he said. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4211.28s)]
*  Halos. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4215.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4216.28s)]
*  He says Halos are the move. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4217.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4218.28s)]
*  So I'll, I'll, I'll give those a try. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4219.28s)]
*  There's also a fire knocks. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4221.28s)]
*  Have you ever seen that guy? [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4223.28s)]
*  I don't use lighted knocks. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4224.28s)]
*  That guy is a fucking mad scientist. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4225.28s)]
*  There's this, there's this gentleman who was a, I think he was a physicist or some kind [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4228.28s)]
*  of a, he's got some sort of background in science and he created this like very high [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4232.28s)]
*  end lighted knock called a fire knock. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4239.28s)]
*  And you have to, it's more difficult to install. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4242.28s)]
*  You have to kind of glue in an insert and then screw it into the insert, but they're [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4245.28s)]
*  supposed to be super legit and very, very tight tolerances. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4249.28s)]
*  So I might try those out too. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4253.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4255.28s)]
*  So fun. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4256.28s)]
*  There's so much to tinker with. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4257.28s)]
*  I know it's so fun. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4258.28s)]
*  But you got to make sure that you're done tinkering like a couple of weeks out. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4260.28s)]
*  So like, so like I, I'll tinker up until a certain point and I'm like, I'm locked in. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4263.28s)]
*  This is what I'm using. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4269.28s)]
*  Now it's time to just practice with that and let's get it all locked in. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4271.28s)]
*  I had to give up on like, I'm a big fan of Garmin. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4275.28s)]
*  I love all their stuff. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4278.28s)]
*  You know, I have this Garmin watch that I love this. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4279.28s)]
*  I just love that it's got GPS on it. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4282.28s)]
*  I can put maps on it. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4285.28s)]
*  I can literally take phone calls, listen to music. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4287.28s)]
*  It's got a stopwatch barometer altitude. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4290.28s)]
*  It's so functional for the, it even has a fucking light. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4293.28s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4296.28s)]
*  If you're out in the woods, you double tap this bitch. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4297.28s)]
*  Bam. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4299.28s)]
*  It's actually pretty bright. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4300.28s)]
*  It's pretty bright. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4301.28s)]
*  I love how long does a battery last fucking weeks. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4302.28s)]
*  Really? [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4305.28s)]
*  Weeks. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4306.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4307.28s)]
*  Weeks. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4308.28s)]
*  That's impressive. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4309.28s)]
*  A month. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4310.28s)]
*  Like it'll tell you, I think I've got like 25 days of battery life. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4311.28s)]
*  I'm blind. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4314.28s)]
*  It's not light right now. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4315.28s)]
*  It's easy. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4316.28s)]
*  But I was running that Garmin site that they have a range finding site. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4317.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4323.28s)]
*  I was having a problem with it though. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4324.28s)]
*  Like sometimes at distance, I was getting multiple ranges on like that foam elk target [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4326.28s)]
*  that I have in my yard. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4333.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4334.28s)]
*  Like I'd be at full draw and I know that it's 74 yards away, but I would be getting 82, 71, [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4335.28s)]
*  65. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4341.28s)]
*  And I'm like, what is going on here? [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4342.28s)]
*  And holding right on it. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4344.28s)]
*  I'm trying to hold right on it. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4345.28s)]
*  Maybe I'm moving a little bit, but how much am I moving? [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4347.28s)]
*  And why isn't it? [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4350.28s)]
*  I don't think it's totally, I think, look, I used it last year and I had a perfect shot [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4351.28s)]
*  on two white tail deer and a Neil guy with that. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4357.28s)]
*  I liked it. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4361.28s)]
*  But that scared me that I'm getting different ranges. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4363.28s)]
*  So like what if I'm at full draw on an animal and it says 67, but it's really 74. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4366.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4370.28s)]
*  That's not good. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4371.28s)]
*  That's a problem. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4372.28s)]
*  That's not good. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4373.28s)]
*  If you're going to have a lot of arrow at that much distance, you're going to have a [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4374.28s)]
*  lot of drop. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4376.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4377.28s)]
*  So I switched before Utah. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4378.28s)]
*  I went back to the Spot Hog and I went to just using that loop hold full draw, which [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4380.28s)]
*  I really like because it shows you the height of your arrow. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4386.28s)]
*  That's giant, man. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4388.28s)]
*  That's giant. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4390.28s)]
*  If you have a gap that you're shooting through and you're like, I don't know what the fuck [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4391.28s)]
*  is going to happen here. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4394.28s)]
*  That thing is so dialed in. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4395.28s)]
*  It measures the speed of your arrow. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4396.28s)]
*  You put in all these different things like how fast your arrow is, what your arrow weighs, [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4400.28s)]
*  and it'll tell you exactly what's the height of the arrow trajectory at the arc. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4405.28s)]
*  So when you range it, and I used it in California because there was a gap that I was shooting [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4410.28s)]
*  through and I ranged it and I knew I had full confidence I was going to get through that [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4416.28s)]
*  gap because I had that line that showed me the line was like four or five inches below [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4420.28s)]
*  where I needed to pass through. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4424.28s)]
*  And that's perfect too because without that assurance, sometimes you're picking a spot, [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4426.28s)]
*  but you're still thinking about that. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4432.28s)]
*  Where's this arrow going? [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4434.28s)]
*  And that can cause that focus to falter and that results in a bad shot. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4435.28s)]
*  So much confidence. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4441.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4443.28s)]
*  Like you have to, you have, when you're executing a shot, you have to say, I know I'm going [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4444.28s)]
*  to hit that thing. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4447.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4448.28s)]
*  If you can't say, I hope. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4449.28s)]
*  No. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4450.28s)]
*  If you say, I hope it, oh, you're fucked. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4451.28s)]
*  It's like pool. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4453.28s)]
*  I know. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4454.28s)]
*  I was talking to Joel Turner about that, that there's real parallels between archery and [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4455.28s)]
*  pool is that you have to have a shot process that you go through. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4459.28s)]
*  Like when I play pool, I have a very specific shot process. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4463.28s)]
*  I go through with every shot. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4466.28s)]
*  And before the shot, when I'm playing well, especially I'll take my practice strokes and [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4468.28s)]
*  then I pause the back end and drive through with like a, I try to use a perfect stroke [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4473.28s)]
*  where it's just the weight of the, the weight of the pool cue and there's the forward motion [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4480.28s)]
*  of the arm is perfectly timed. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4485.28s)]
*  And I'm kind of like allowing that cue to do all the work with the weight of my arm and [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4488.28s)]
*  the stroke. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4492.28s)]
*  And if you don't have that thing in your head, like I am going to make this shot. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4493.28s)]
*  If you say, I hope I don't miss, you're going to fucking miss every time. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4498.28s)]
*  Archery, you have like a more of a window because like you could say, you could put [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4502.28s)]
*  your pin on the target. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4506.28s)]
*  I hope I don't miss. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4507.28s)]
*  But as long as your pins on the target, maybe it'll be like three inches here or four inches [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4508.28s)]
*  there, but still in pool, I'm shooting into a four inch pocket from nine feet away. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4512.28s)]
*  You, there's no room for fucking around. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4517.28s)]
*  If you're off that mushroom or the cues hitting. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4519.28s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4522.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4523.28s)]
*  And then as the distance goes, like if you're shooting a seven foot shot, as the distance [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4524.28s)]
*  goes, if you're off like a half of a millimeter, it's going to over the distance. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4528.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4533.28s)]
*  It's going to be two inches. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4534.28s)]
*  You're going to be fucked. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4535.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4536.28s)]
*  So there's very precise, but that's what I love about archery. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4537.28s)]
*  And that's what I love about pool. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4542.28s)]
*  It's like the arrows don't give a fuck who you are. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4543.28s)]
*  They don't give a fuck where you live, what kind of car you drive. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4548.28s)]
*  Like, it's like, are you doing it right? [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4553.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4557.28s)]
*  There's, it's, there's no room for fuckery. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4558.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4560.28s)]
*  It is, you gotta be dialed in. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4561.28s)]
*  You gotta be prepared. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4563.28s)]
*  You have to have thousands of arrows down range. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4565.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4568.28s)]
*  Thousands where you know, you know what that feel, it feels like when that shot breaks [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4569.28s)]
*  and you watch that arrow, and you practice. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4573.28s)]
*  And you know, like, you know better than anybody, we practice in camp. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4576.28s)]
*  We don't just get to camp and say, we're done. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4581.28s)]
*  No, every time you get a chance, we're lined up at the targets and we're shooting at 90 [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4583.28s)]
*  yards. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4587.28s)]
*  It's, you know, it's so hard to gain that confidence. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4588.28s)]
*  Or you said, you know, am I gonna, do I know I'm gonna hit it perfect or do I hope I'm [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4591.28s)]
*  gonna hit it perfect? [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4596.28s)]
*  So getting that confidence, like, no, I know I'm gonna hit it perfect is so fricking hard [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4597.28s)]
*  and can go away like that. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4602.28s)]
*  Like that. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4604.28s)]
*  I mean, one fucking shitty shot and you're just like, oh my God. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4605.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4608.28s)]
*  It's, yeah. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4609.28s)]
*  I mean, that's where archery can be brutal because once your confidence and you start [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4610.28s)]
*  doubting something, that takes on a life of its own. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4615.28s)]
*  And archery has so many factors. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4618.28s)]
*  There's the, you know, you have your release, you have the sight, you have the rest. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4621.28s)]
*  Maybe your arrows are touching the rest. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4629.28s)]
*  Maybe, maybe you've got your, the way your pins are set up when you have your furthest [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4632.28s)]
*  distance pin. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4637.28s)]
*  Maybe your fletchings are touching the bottom of the housing. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4638.28s)]
*  String stretch. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4641.28s)]
*  String stretch. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4642.28s)]
*  Your string over time. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4643.28s)]
*  You have to make sure that you're, when before you go on a hunt, you got to bring it in and [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4644.28s)]
*  check the chronograph. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4647.28s)]
*  Is it still at 273 feet a second? [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4648.28s)]
*  Oh shit, it's at 265 now. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4651.28s)]
*  My string stretched. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4653.28s)]
*  So now you have to put some twists in the strings and then you have to fire it. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4654.28s)]
*  Or you have to add a couple yards to shoot it. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4657.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4659.28s)]
*  There's so much going on. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4660.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4661.28s)]
*  And then just the preciseness of these sight tapes. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4662.28s)]
*  It's so amazing how much goes on. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4665.28s)]
*  Like when you use archers advantage, you're entering in the weight of the arrow, the length [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4669.28s)]
*  of the arrow, like what is the poundage of the bow? [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4675.28s)]
*  What's the speed per second that you're shooting? [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4678.28s)]
*  Like, yeah, there's so much. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4680.28s)]
*  There's a lot of data going in there. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4683.28s)]
*  But when you execute a perfect shot, not even on just on an arrow, just on a target, just [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4685.28s)]
*  you're shooting at like 75 yards and the shot breaks and you watch that go right in the [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4690.28s)]
*  center. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4696.28s)]
*  It's a beautiful moment. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4697.28s)]
*  Ah, I wish everybody could feel that. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4698.28s)]
*  If everybody, the world goes away. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4701.28s)]
*  The world goes away when you execute a perfect shot. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4704.28s)]
*  That's what I had a Huberman down and he was, you know, he's so intelligent, obviously, [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4707.28s)]
*  but like an analytical and everything. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4716.28s)]
*  But it's like we're, he's focusing so hard at the bow rack, just doing everything, focusing [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4718.28s)]
*  so hard. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4722.28s)]
*  And I'm like, how great is this? [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4723.28s)]
*  I said, what are you thinking about other than shooting this bow right now? [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4725.28s)]
*  And he's like, nothing. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4728.28s)]
*  I'm like, that's it. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4729.28s)]
*  Yeah, you can't. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4730.28s)]
*  That's just so beautiful about it. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4731.28s)]
*  It's like people say therapeutic and all this, but it is because you can't be, if you're [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4733.28s)]
*  distracted, you're not going to hit anywhere close to what you want or not consistently. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4737.28s)]
*  You might get lucky, but it's one of those things that takes all your focus, which is [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4741.28s)]
*  so freeing because then you're not worried about all the other BS of life. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4746.28s)]
*  It's, it cleans your mind. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4750.28s)]
*  It's a, it's like jujitsu does that too. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4752.28s)]
*  Like when you're doing jujitsu, it cleans your mind because you can't think of anything [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4755.28s)]
*  else because someone's on top of you trying to yank your arm off. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4758.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4761.28s)]
*  It's like you have to be completely engaged in the moment. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4762.28s)]
*  And that's very hard for people to do, to find things that keep them in the moment. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4767.28s)]
*  We are so constantly distracted by mostly things that aren't even important. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4772.28s)]
*  Like I can't tell you how many times I'm up at night worried about, I mean, it is a concern, [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4777.28s)]
*  but I'm worried about Ukraine and I'm worried about, you know, Israel and Palestine. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4783.28s)]
*  And I worry about nuclear war. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4788.28s)]
*  I worry about chaos. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4790.28s)]
*  I worry about the fact that they're sending these young men to go and die in these wars. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4791.28s)]
*  And some people are so flippant about it. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4796.28s)]
*  It's so easy for them. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4798.28s)]
*  And I freak out about these things. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4800.28s)]
*  And sometimes it like, it fucks me up because I go to bed with that in my head. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4802.28s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm just lying in bed going, am I like, is this the verge of World War III? [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4806.28s)]
*  Like if you were living in some place, like right before a war broke out, the day before that happens, [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4810.28s)]
*  everything's normal. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4817.28s)]
*  October 6th in Israel. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4818.28s)]
*  Everything's normal. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4820.28s)]
*  Then all of a sudden everything fucking changes and then the world is chaos. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4821.28s)]
*  The world's upside down. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4825.28s)]
*  I think you need something. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4827.28s)]
*  You certainly need to be aware of the world, but you need to, everyone needs something that can take them out of that. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4829.28s)]
*  And for some people it's golf. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4835.28s)]
*  Some people it's pool. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4837.28s)]
*  Whatever the fuck it is, it's running. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4838.28s)]
*  Whatever it is. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4840.28s)]
*  But you need something that takes you out of that and allows you to be in the moment. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4841.28s)]
*  What I like, this is another part to it, but what I like, so like with the Huberman or with somebody like people say intellectuals, [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4847.28s)]
*  but people who operate up here all the time. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4855.28s)]
*  I'm never up there so I don't have to fucking worry about it. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4858.28s)]
*  But it's like operating at this highest level of intelligence of whatever they're at. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4860.28s)]
*  But what I like about archery and hunting is like, this is a basic. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4867.28s)]
*  So you can't get up here unless you're down here figuring out what you're going to eat and how to do it. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4872.28s)]
*  So it's either you can get it all figured out and say, well, I'm not going to kill shit myself, but could you kill something for me? [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4878.28s)]
*  And then here's some money, right? [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4885.28s)]
*  Somebody still has to do the bottom shit. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4887.28s)]
*  But I think I told Andrew, I'm like, God, if you could, obviously you're up here all the time, [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4889.28s)]
*  but if you could also understand the bottom, what it takes to kill and get out there, carry a rock up a fucking mountain, [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4894.28s)]
*  do that hard, gritty lower level shit. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4902.28s)]
*  And imagine what you could, because I always say, I would love for you to have your perspective to be able to explain what hunting is in your way. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4906.28s)]
*  Because I can't, I can do it like what I've been doing my whole life. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4917.28s)]
*  But somebody who operates up here all the time could also understand the basics of survival. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4921.28s)]
*  God, imagine what enlightenment he might be able to shine on why we hunt. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4928.28s)]
*  Yeah, he would definitely be able to have a very unique perspective with his mind. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4932.28s)]
*  And that's what Peter Attia brings to the table. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4937.28s)]
*  You know, because Peter has become obsessed with bow hunting over the last few years. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4939.28s)]
*  And he's so fucking fascinating because he and I will have these conversations where we'll talk about broadheads and this and that. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4943.28s)]
*  He'll shoot an animal and then he will make a video where he does an autopsy. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4949.28s)]
*  And he breaks it down and uses terms. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4955.28s)]
*  I don't understand what the fuck you're talking about. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4958.28s)]
*  All these different, you know, different types of hemorrhaging and this and that and what the area of the lung it hit. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4960.28s)]
*  And this is why it took so long for it to die. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4968.28s)]
*  And that's why it died quickly because it severed these arteries and caused massive hemorrhaging. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4970.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's super interesting. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4975.28s)]
*  I don't get any of that shit. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4977.28s)]
*  I mean, I get the major organs and I know what happens if an arrow goes through there. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4979.28s)]
*  But within those organs, like you're saying different parts of the lungs. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4983.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's who knows what. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4987.28s)]
*  And like he's breaking it down as a surgeon, even even like with Huberman, we're in the borac. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4989.28s)]
*  And he's like talking about we had it on the lift, run, shoot episode. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=4997.28s)]
*  But he's like, he just sounds like, oh, like on skateboarding, you can switch stance like left foot forward, right foot forward. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5001.28s)]
*  And then he goes, can you do that with the bow, like left hand, right hand? [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5007.28s)]
*  And I was like, no, that's your dominant eye. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5011.28s)]
*  You know, you got to use your dominant eye. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5013.28s)]
*  And so he starts to explain why prey animals with their eyes on the side, they if you're not moving, they can't you're basically invisible [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5015.28s)]
*  because they have to be able to see that movement. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5025.28s)]
*  And sometimes it'll go like this to like use both eyes. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5027.28s)]
*  Whereas whereas we're like depth perception because our eyes on the front, we can see movement like this. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5031.28s)]
*  A prey animal can't anyway, he's explaining this whole thing. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5036.28s)]
*  It's like you could talk about anything with hunting where I would be like, this is black and white. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5039.28s)]
*  Oh, you do this because of that. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5044.28s)]
*  And then he would have some crazy explanation with amazing detail on why it's this way or that way. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5045.28s)]
*  It's pretty fascinating. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5052.28s)]
*  So I'm like, God dang, if you could bow hunt and get out there and understand what it means to be, you know, we're we're a predator hunting prey and just what is that? [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5053.28s)]
*  What is that about? [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5065.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5066.28s)]
*  You know, I just want to hear his take on it because that's his like his superpower is he's 20 times smarter than anybody but can talk where I can understand it. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5067.28s)]
*  Yes. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5077.28s)]
*  Not all those smart guys can't do that shit. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5078.28s)]
*  Yeah, but he can. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5080.28s)]
*  So he's gone through an interesting journey with broadheads, too. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5081.28s)]
*  You know, because he oh, Peter. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5086.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, because he shot a two blade single bevel head. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5088.28s)]
*  And do you ever see it? [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5093.28s)]
*  No. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5095.28s)]
*  OK, I'm going to show it to you because it's kind of crazy when you see it. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5096.28s)]
*  You're not going to believe it. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5099.28s)]
*  He had to make a follow up shot. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5100.28s)]
*  Well, you wouldn't imagine it when you see this. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5103.28s)]
*  And now so we had this conversation and he was saying, do you know, like there's there's this thing whether or not you want to have a big cut like you have been using over the last few years. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5106.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5119.28s)]
*  With these the ones that you like the Grim Reaper carnivores, which is a big cut. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5120.28s)]
*  Or would you want to get penetration? [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5127.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5129.28s)]
*  I want both. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5130.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5131.28s)]
*  So well, that's why you shoot like a really, a really powerful bow. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5132.28s)]
*  Now look at the look at the shot placement. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5136.28s)]
*  That looks perfect. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5138.28s)]
*  Perfect. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5139.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5140.28s)]
*  That was he had to make a follow up shot. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5141.28s)]
*  And was it perfectly broadside? [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5143.28s)]
*  Yep. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5145.28s)]
*  That is crazy. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5146.28s)]
*  That's probably what he wants in the crease. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5147.28s)]
*  Perfect. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5149.28s)]
*  Perfect. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5150.28s)]
*  Now imagine if you hit that thing with a carnivore. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5151.28s)]
*  Chaos. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5155.28s)]
*  No, it's not going anywhere. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5156.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5157.28s)]
*  So that's the benefit. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5158.28s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5159.28s)]
*  It's just that you can see right through it. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5160.28s)]
*  Through the lungs. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5161.28s)]
*  Both lungs. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5162.28s)]
*  That is weird. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5163.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5164.28s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5165.28s)]
*  You look at it, you're like how? [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5166.28s)]
*  But I think that's the thing about a small cut, a very small single blade or a two blade [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5167.28s)]
*  rather that slices right through. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5174.28s)]
*  And it's you just get an inch and a half slice. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5177.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5179.28s)]
*  That's it. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5180.28s)]
*  And maybe it can seal up. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5181.28s)]
*  Maybe it takes a long time for it to bleed out. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5182.28s)]
*  I mean, whatever it is. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5184.28s)]
*  But when you have something like one of the things we were talking about was these tooth [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5187.28s)]
*  of the arrows. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5191.28s)]
*  So I sent him these images that I got from this guy named John Lusk and he has these [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5192.28s)]
*  very interesting videos where he does all these tests on broadheads. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5199.28s)]
*  Penetration. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5203.28s)]
*  Everything. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5204.28s)]
*  He's got like a whole system to it. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5205.28s)]
*  He's very scientific about it. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5206.28s)]
*  But look at the fucking holes that those tooth of the arrows make. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5207.28s)]
*  That's the XL four blade. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5211.28s)]
*  Which makes. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5214.28s)]
*  Steel? [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5215.28s)]
*  Through steel. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5216.28s)]
*  Four inches of cut and it makes a canal. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5217.28s)]
*  This wound channel is not sealing up. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5220.28s)]
*  You're going to get blood out of that thing. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5224.28s)]
*  People don't see it. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5226.28s)]
*  That's what it looks like. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5227.28s)]
*  And that's the goal is to kill with an arrow. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5228.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5231.28s)]
*  You need hemorrhage. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5232.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5233.28s)]
*  And that type of hemorrhage, that type of wound channel is going to allow that animal [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5234.28s)]
*  to expire quick. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5239.28s)]
*  I mean, it's going to die fast in seconds. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5240.28s)]
*  That's what we want. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5242.28s)]
*  And also one of the things that he showed in his explanations or his videos, John Lusk [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5243.28s)]
*  did, which I'm very interested about with his tooth of the arrow broadhead, is that [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5247.28s)]
*  it got incredible penetration too. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5250.28s)]
*  So he does this test where he shoots them into styrofoam or layers of cardboard. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5252.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5258.28s)]
*  And I think this 125 grain one had the record. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5259.28s)]
*  It went through 75 layers or 73 layers of cardboard, which is insane. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5265.28s)]
*  That's a lot of layers. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5270.28s)]
*  I wonder how heavy is the arrow? [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5271.28s)]
*  Not sure. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5272.28s)]
*  Not sure. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5273.28s)]
*  Yeah, because that makes a big difference. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5274.28s)]
*  Makes a big difference. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5275.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5276.28s)]
*  But he uses a standard setup. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5277.28s)]
*  He uses a 72 pound bow. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5279.28s)]
*  If it's the same with every head. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5281.28s)]
*  27 inch draw. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5283.28s)]
*  Yeah, same as every head. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5284.28s)]
*  And one's out penetrating the other is not being something. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5285.28s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5288.28s)]
*  Regardless of what. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5289.28s)]
*  And it has four blades as opposed to two. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5290.28s)]
*  So you're getting double the cut at least. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5292.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5295.28s)]
*  I think that, so if you have two blade and the animal is say two foot wide, that's 48 [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5296.28s)]
*  inches of cut. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5302.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5303.28s)]
*  If you got four, that's 96 inches of hemorrhage. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5304.28s)]
*  Big difference. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5305.28s)]
*  Big difference. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5306.28s)]
*  Big difference. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5307.28s)]
*  Imagine a 96 inch cut, how much that's going to bleed. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5308.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5311.28s)]
*  And it's a channel through the body. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5312.28s)]
*  So if you get a pass through, that thing's spraying off both sides. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5313.28s)]
*  And then maybe even more importantly, what you do and what I do is we lift weights so [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5317.28s)]
*  we're strong so we can pull back a heavy bow. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5322.28s)]
*  And so now you're shooting a really powerful 80 plus pound bow that is launching this 520 [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5325.28s)]
*  grain arrow at 300 feet a second. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5333.28s)]
*  So when it does hit is a tremendous amount of momentum and force. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5335.28s)]
*  And it's just boom, blowing through everything. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5339.28s)]
*  So when people say, you don't need that kind of pull back that kind of weight, I've heard [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5342.28s)]
*  that stupid shit so many times, it drives me nuts. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5346.28s)]
*  And it's just people that are trying to make an excuse for why they're not strong. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5349.28s)]
*  Well, you don't need 60 pounds then. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5354.28s)]
*  Because why do you need 60 pounds? [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5356.28s)]
*  And by the way, 60 pounds for you is probably harder than 90 pound is for me because you [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5357.28s)]
*  don't work out. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5361.28s)]
*  And what I always say is, yeah, I shoot 90, you shoot 60, 70. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5362.28s)]
*  I will kill every animal you'll kill if you hit it the same place. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5368.28s)]
*  You won't kill every animal I'll kill. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5372.28s)]
*  Yes. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5374.28s)]
*  That's all there is to it. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5375.28s)]
*  That's all there is to it. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5376.28s)]
*  I'll go through more shit and still kill it than you will. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5377.28s)]
*  But every arrow that you shoot that kills, mine would do the same thing. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5380.28s)]
*  There's no argument that having less power is good. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5384.28s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5388.28s)]
*  The whole idea is maximum lethality and the maximum amount of, you want a humane kill [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5390.28s)]
*  where it kills it quickly and ethically. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5398.28s)]
*  So that means you have to be fucking super dedicated to your practice. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5400.28s)]
*  And I think you should be super dedicated to your fitness. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5403.28s)]
*  And you should be doing rows every fucking day, building those back muscles so that when [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5406.28s)]
*  you do pull back 70 pounds, 80 pounds, whatever, it's not hard. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5412.28s)]
*  It seems pretty simple. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5416.28s)]
*  There's a video of me pulling back that 95 pound bow that Dudley made me, that squirrely [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5418.28s)]
*  bow that I had a couple years ago. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5425.28s)]
*  That thing was ridiculous. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5427.28s)]
*  But I pull that fucker back easy. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5428.28s)]
*  I can do, I lift a lot of weights. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5430.28s)]
*  I lift all the time. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5432.28s)]
*  I'm constantly doing chin ups. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5433.28s)]
*  I do weighted chin ups. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5435.28s)]
*  I do chin ups with a 25 pound vest. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5436.28s)]
*  I do all these things. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5438.28s)]
*  You train. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5439.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5440.28s)]
*  So I get ready for it. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5441.28s)]
*  You train to be at your best. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5442.28s)]
*  So you go, oh, you don't need that. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5443.28s)]
*  Shut the fuck up, pussy. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5444.28s)]
*  I know what you're doing. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5446.28s)]
*  I know why you're saying it. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5447.28s)]
*  The only reason why anyone would say that is to try to make up for the fact that they're [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5448.28s)]
*  not strong. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5452.28s)]
*  That's all it is. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5453.28s)]
*  That's it. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5454.28s)]
*  And hunters love them, love bow hunters, love this whole community. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5455.28s)]
*  But, God, we are so judgmental. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5461.28s)]
*  Some are. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5464.28s)]
*  I mean. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5465.28s)]
*  And they're a loud voice. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5466.28s)]
*  But it's a small percentage. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5467.28s)]
*  It is. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5469.28s)]
*  But it's like, yeah, it just doesn't make any sense. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5470.28s)]
*  And it's hard, too, because when you're so passionate about something, people do talk [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5473.28s)]
*  shit about you. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5477.28s)]
*  You take it, like it means something because, God, I'm pouring fucking everything I have [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5478.28s)]
*  into this. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5481.28s)]
*  And you're talking, it's still not good enough? [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5482.28s)]
*  So I had this guy the other day. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5484.28s)]
*  He's like, why don't you go into the Eagle Cap and pack in and kill a bull by yourself? [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5486.28s)]
*  Like you did for 20 years? [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5493.28s)]
*  Oh, I mean, it's like, it got me thinking. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5495.28s)]
*  It's like, you can, it's never enough. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5498.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5501.28s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5502.28s)]
*  You wrote a book about that, though. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5503.28s)]
*  That's what's hilarious. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5504.28s)]
*  You literally wrote a book. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5505.28s)]
*  I told the guy, I said, yeah, I've heard of that area. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5506.28s)]
*  I said, I read about it in a book called Backcountry Bowhunting. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5509.28s)]
*  I can't remember who wrote it, but it's a pretty good book. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5512.28s)]
*  And I mean, so the point is, it's like, I've been doing this my whole life. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5515.28s)]
*  I started doing that. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5520.28s)]
*  I've killed, I don't know how many bulls I've killed from Backcountry, Do It Yourself, [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5522.28s)]
*  to now some of the best elk in the, you know, 400 inch bulls, done the whole thing. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5527.28s)]
*  That's still not enough? [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5534.28s)]
*  Still there's people say, well, why don't you do this? [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5536.28s)]
*  It's like, well, what the fuck? [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5538.28s)]
*  Is it ever going to be enough? [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5539.28s)]
*  You're going to always hear that though. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5540.28s)]
*  You're going to hear that from everybody, no matter what it is. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5542.28s)]
*  And, you know, imagine if I read the comments on this podcast, on any of my podcasts, like, [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5544.28s)]
*  why do you have her on? [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5550.28s)]
*  She's fucking stupid. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5551.28s)]
*  Why do you have him on? [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5552.28s)]
*  He sucks. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5553.28s)]
*  Like, this is boring. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5554.28s)]
*  You talk too much. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5555.28s)]
*  Well, this one is going to, don't read this one, because it'd be like, oh, this fucking [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5556.28s)]
*  redneck again. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5560.28s)]
*  I'm like, hey, guys, I didn't, I didn't ask. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5561.28s)]
*  I've never asked to be on here, have I? [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5566.28s)]
*  No, you're my friend. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5567.28s)]
*  I want you to come on. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5568.28s)]
*  Plus, we had to get you stem cells. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5569.28s)]
*  I didn't ask. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5570.28s)]
*  It's not my fault. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5571.28s)]
*  If it was up to me, I wouldn't be here. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5572.28s)]
*  Oh, shut the fuck up. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5574.28s)]
*  You like being here. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5575.28s)]
*  Come on, man. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5576.28s)]
*  It's fine. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5577.28s)]
*  We have a good time. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5578.28s)]
*  You're good at podcasting. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5579.28s)]
*  You are great at podcasting. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5580.28s)]
*  You're full of shit, and now you do your own. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5581.92s)]
*  You're lying, son of a bitch. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5583.719999999999s)]
*  Not good at it. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5584.719999999999s)]
*  You're good at it, man. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5585.719999999999s)]
*  No, I'm not good. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5586.719999999999s)]
*  You're good at it. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5587.719999999999s)]
*  You are good at it. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5588.719999999999s)]
*  It's a fun thing to do. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5589.719999999999s)]
*  And look, it's not for everybody, but this podcast isn't for everybody either. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5590.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5593.92s)]
*  It can't be. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5594.92s)]
*  You can't make something for everybody. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5595.92s)]
*  You have to do your best. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5596.92s)]
*  And I think the best way to do your best is to not listen to all the criticism. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5598.639999999999s)]
*  Because I'm, you are also as well, you're very self-critical. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5602.2s)]
*  We're both very self-critical. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5605.9s)]
*  And I think that's, that's important. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5607.16s)]
*  But that's also why criticism hurts, because you take it to heart and then you get upset. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5608.8s)]
*  And you're like, I do so much. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5612.08s)]
*  You can't make everybody happy. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5614.92s)]
*  You're like, guys, I'm trying my best. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5615.92s)]
*  I'm trying my best, guys. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5616.92s)]
*  I really am trying my best. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5618.6s)]
*  And I know you are too. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5619.6s)]
*  I try my best at everything I do. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5621.08s)]
*  And I'm not, I fuck up all the time at everything. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5622.5s)]
*  And that is just something you get from sticking your neck out. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5625.52s)]
*  I mean, I started bow hunting in my 40s, you know, and I'm obsessed with it. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5628.2s)]
*  I mean, also as a famous person, you know, like it's fucking, you know, if you're going [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5632.72s)]
*  to fuck something up. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5636.360000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5637.56s)]
*  I mean, it's so impressive because most people don't like that had success in their whole [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5638.92s)]
*  life. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5643.4400000000005s)]
*  You know, you earned, of course, but you've been at the highest level to start all the [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5644.4400000000005s)]
*  way over at something with no experience. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5647.320000000001s)]
*  But it's so exciting. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5650.240000000001s)]
*  That's the best thing to do. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5651.360000000001s)]
*  Most people wouldn't do that. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5652.52s)]
*  Yeah, but they should. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5653.84s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5655.0s)]
*  I know that most people don't like to do that because they like to be, they like to be impressive [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5656.0s)]
*  at things because it makes them feel good. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5659.1s)]
*  But what makes me feel good is getting better at things I suck at and learning new things [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5660.56s)]
*  that I suck at is very exciting. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5664.8s)]
*  I don't have any room for anymore. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5666.04s)]
*  Like right now I'm full. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5668.08s)]
*  I'm all full, you know, and I'm I'm decent at bow hunting now. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5669.4800000000005s)]
*  I've gotten to the point where I'm a very, I'm very accurate. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5673.120000000001s)]
*  I practice constantly. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5676.120000000001s)]
*  I put in a ton of work. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5677.4400000000005s)]
*  I put in thousands and thousands and thousands of arrows every year. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5679.280000000001s)]
*  But because of that, I'm confident and I'm good at it. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5682.96s)]
*  I'm pretty good at it now, but I'm still not an expert. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5686.04s)]
*  Yeah, I'm like a purple belt. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5688.200000000001s)]
*  If I would say like if bow hunting had belts, I'd be like a purple belt now. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5689.6s)]
*  Yeah, you know, years away from a black belt. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5693.120000000001s)]
*  It's a long fucking road, you know. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5695.160000000001s)]
*  But I did all that in jujitsu. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5697.24s)]
*  The reason why I started jujitsu is, look, when I started jujitsu, I was a good kickboxer. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5698.679999999999s)]
*  I was a, you know, a very high level taekwondo fighter. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5703.36s)]
*  And then I got into kickboxing. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5707.28s)]
*  I was good at kickboxing. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5708.639999999999s)]
*  I was good at stand up striking. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5709.84s)]
*  You know, there's plenty of videos you can see of me kicking things. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5711.76s)]
*  I'm good at it. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5714.84s)]
*  I was helpless at jujitsu. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5716.639999999999s)]
*  I could have easily said, fuck this. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5718.679999999999s)]
*  I'm just go back to kickboxing where I feed my ego and I feel good. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5720.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5724.0s)]
*  But I was like, oh my God, I'm helpless. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5724.44s)]
*  Like I remember I was training with this guy. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5727.839999999999s)]
*  I had just started out. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5732.16s)]
*  I was a white belt. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5733.28s)]
*  And I think he was a purple belt. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5734.0s)]
*  And this dude mauled me. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5736.2s)]
*  I mean, mauled me, this Brazilian kid. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5738.759999999999s)]
*  And he wasn't being mean. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5741.24s)]
*  It wasn't like he was like, he was destroying me. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5743.12s)]
*  I mean, it was so humiliating. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5748.5599999999995s)]
*  It was like one night or one. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5750.639999999999s)]
*  It was one specific training session. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5752.96s)]
*  Because what happens when you first start training is initially, [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5754.679999999999s)]
*  you will spar with other white belts. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5758.32s)]
*  And you're both kind of clunky. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5760.0s)]
*  You don't really know what you're doing. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5761.32s)]
*  And you're trying to choke people. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5762.44s)]
*  You don't exactly know how to do it. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5763.5199999999995s)]
*  And you get tapped. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5765.16s)]
*  You tap them. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5766.04s)]
*  And it's like you're learning. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5766.8s)]
*  But then as you start to progress, you're in a couple weeks or a couple months, [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5769.639999999999s)]
*  they'll start putting you in with blue belts. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5774.8s)]
*  Occasionally, they'll even put you in the brown belt. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5777.08s)]
*  Generally, the brown belts and the black belts [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5779.72s)]
*  are pretty gentle with the beginners. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5781.44s)]
*  They'll tap you. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5783.6s)]
*  And they'll give you pointers like you can't put your arm here. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5784.8s)]
*  It's vulnerable. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5787.5599999999995s)]
*  You've got to keep yourself like this. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5788.16s)]
*  Don't extend because that doesn't get you in trouble. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5789.44s)]
*  And they'll give you tips. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5791.6s)]
*  And it's very valuable because you can learn from, oh, that's why he did this. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5792.24s)]
*  But this fucking dude just ran through me. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5796.28s)]
*  And it was like one of the first times I had trained with someone [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5799.48s)]
*  who was really pretty good. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5802.12s)]
*  And my initial feeling was I'm so shocked at how helpless I am. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5803.6s)]
*  I was really delusional. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5809.92s)]
*  I had this idea because I thought I knew how to fight. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5812.0s)]
*  So that would kind of apply to jiu jitsu. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5814.68s)]
*  It didn't apply at all. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5816.400000000001s)]
*  And so I realized at some point in time, during this training session, OK, [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5819.200000000001s)]
*  this is a long road. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5825.64s)]
*  And I'm on it now. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5826.96s)]
*  And this is what I'm going to do now. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5827.96s)]
*  And even though I was on a television show, [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5829.360000000001s)]
*  and I was doing stand-up comedy, and I had things that I was good at [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5832.04s)]
*  that I could just stuck with those. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5835.32s)]
*  I was like, I've got to get good at this. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5836.84s)]
*  I can't live knowing that guys can do this to me. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5838.32s)]
*  It turns out they could always do it to me, even at the highest level. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5842.2s)]
*  But also, as time went on, even when I became a black belt, [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5846.2s)]
*  I'll still get mauled by the elite black belts. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5848.72s)]
*  Like if I went and rolled with Marcelo Garcia, [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5851.6s)]
*  or whenever I'd roll with John Jock Machado, you just feel kind of helpless. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5854.48s)]
*  Because their level is so much higher than your level [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5858.08s)]
*  that even at black belts, there's... [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5860.72s)]
*  Look at what Gordon Ryan does to everybody. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5862.240000000001s)]
*  He takes the best black belts and make them look like they don't belong there [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5864.12s)]
*  with him. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5867.4400000000005s)]
*  And he talks shit about it before he does it. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5867.84s)]
*  Even writes down on a piece of paper how he's going to tap them. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5870.360000000001s)]
*  And then he seals the envelope and hands it to the... [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5873.88s)]
*  So he has in his mind, I'm going to get him in a triangle. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5876.64s)]
*  And this is the only way I'm going to tap him. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5880.4400000000005s)]
*  So all these other things he has to pass up on, [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5882.2s)]
*  all these other opportunities he passes up on, just to set up a triangle. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5884.320000000001s)]
*  So he's setting it up two, three, four, five steps ahead of them. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5887.68s)]
*  So they think they're doing good, and all of a sudden, suss out! [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5891.160000000001s)]
*  Did you ever see him roll with Bo Nicol? [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5894.56s)]
*  Yeah, I did. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5896.64s)]
*  It's a great match. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5897.160000000001s)]
*  Bo Nicol's a bad man. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5898.4800000000005s)]
*  But he caught him too. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5899.88s)]
*  He caught Bo Nicol, and strangled him. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5901.200000000001s)]
*  That's how good Gordon is. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5902.92s)]
*  But that's the levels, and levels, and levels, and levels, and levels. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5903.84s)]
*  But the only way you get that good is time. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5907.56s)]
*  Time and effort. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5911.88s)]
*  And it's got to be so rewarding to be Gordon Ryan. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5913.0s)]
*  I bet. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5916.679999999999s)]
*  It fucking must be amazing. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5917.28s)]
*  I bet. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5918.84s)]
*  It must be amazing to be that guy who stands head and shoulders above all the others. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5919.36s)]
*  He gave us the Abu Dhabi belt, by the way. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5923.16s)]
*  Oh, that's sick. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5925.24s)]
*  That's his Abu Dhabi belt. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5925.76s)]
*  It's up in our studio. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5926.5599999999995s)]
*  Pretty badass. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5927.5599999999995s)]
*  I love how his confidence in his... [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5928.48s)]
*  He's awesome. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5930.5199999999995s)]
*  He's... [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5931.16s)]
*  I mean, he drives people crazy. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5932.0s)]
*  But I just love that part. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5934.16s)]
*  Well, that's also psychological warfare too, because you're so upset. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5935.5599999999995s)]
*  You think, I can't lose to this guy. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5939.0s)]
*  But guess what? [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5941.36s)]
*  You don't have a choice. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5942.08s)]
*  Because he trains 365 days a year. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5944.12s)]
*  Yeah, his coach is... [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5948.12s)]
*  I love... [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5949.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't even know him. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5950.04s)]
*  John Donoher. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5951.04s)]
*  Yeah, I've listened to you talk about him and listened to him on here. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5951.64s)]
*  And it's like, that is an unbreakable mindset, basically. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5955.04s)]
*  Well, Donoher is like a character from a movie. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5959.16s)]
*  He doesn't exist in the real world. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5961.72s)]
*  Because John Donoher was a philosophy professor at Columbia, who became obsessed with Jiu-Jitsu. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5963.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5970.16s)]
*  Incredible. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5971.36s)]
*  And then was like literally sleeping on the mats and teaching people. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5972.04s)]
*  And so he's operating mentally from... [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5975.0s)]
*  He's probably got 150 IQ. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5977.72s)]
*  And he's operating at this insane level mentally, also just completely obsessed with what is [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5979.72s)]
*  the best way to progress in Jiu-Jitsu? [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5986.84s)]
*  What is the best way? [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5989.88s)]
*  What are the roadblocks? [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5991.44s)]
*  What's holding people up? [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5994.08s)]
*  What's holding people back? [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5995.08s)]
*  And it's... [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5996.44s)]
*  What they decided at some point in time is that it's not just about training. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=5998.28s)]
*  It's about analyzing things. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6002.879999999999s)]
*  It's about breaking down technical aspects of things, watching video, discussing techniques. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6005.36s)]
*  Not just training hard, but thinking. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6011.08s)]
*  So the amount of hours they put in a day, even though they're training 365 days a year, [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6013.5599999999995s)]
*  they're going at Jiu-Jitsu five, six hours a day. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6018.879999999999s)]
*  Well, and he watches tape too. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6022.44s)]
*  That's what he does. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6024.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6025.08s)]
*  He's got flash guards everywhere. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6026.72s)]
*  John Donahue, I don't even know if he has regular clothes. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6027.72s)]
*  He's a freak. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6030.88s)]
*  I love that. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6032.12s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6033.12s)]
*  I mean, that's an outlier. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6034.12s)]
*  I mean, one of one. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6036.76s)]
*  That's what makes this world so interesting is people like that, characters like that. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6039.4s)]
*  One of ones. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6043.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6044.76s)]
*  What he calls it, there's a Japanese term, it's called kaizen. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6045.76s)]
*  Can you look that up, what the actual term means? [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6049.0s)]
*  But it's about the pursuit of excellence in one specific place, one specific avenue, one [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6052.24s)]
*  specific discipline. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6058.92s)]
*  The constant pursuit of excellence. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6060.32s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6063.12s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6066.84s)]
*  Kaizen is a Japanese term meaning change for the better or continuous improvement. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6067.84s)]
*  Is a Japanese business philosophy that concerns the process that continuously improve operations [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6073.04s)]
*  and involve all employees. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6079.36s)]
*  And sees improvement in productivity as a gradual and methodical process. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6081.719999999999s)]
*  I think there's other names for it that don't just apply to jujitsu. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6087.04s)]
*  I think it's old or rather, well, let's hear him say it. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6092.36s)]
*  Well, it's just hear what he says. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6096.96s)]
*  Just hear what he says. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6099.24s)]
*  Your Instagram description said living in the spirit of kaizen. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6100.48s)]
*  And I was wondering why. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6104.799999999999s)]
*  Look, he's got a rash guard on. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6105.799999999999s)]
*  You always thought about it. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6106.799999999999s)]
*  You never know. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6108.44s)]
*  Freak. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6109.44s)]
*  I'm a huge believer in the idea of small progressive movements towards goals. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6110.44s)]
*  If you look at the course of an average day that we all go through, every so often, maybe [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6117.32s)]
*  two or three times in your life, there's one day which changes the direction of your life. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6122.879999999999s)]
*  But the vast majority of our days are unexceptional. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6127.9s)]
*  They're just a boring mundane day. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6131.719999999999s)]
*  You come home at the end of the day and if someone asked you what happened today, you [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6135.08s)]
*  would literally have to think back and be like, I'm not sure. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6138.44s)]
*  That's probably a description of 95% of our days. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6146.04s)]
*  So there's a chance in which you could drift through your life where only about 1% to 5% [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6150.36s)]
*  of your days have any real meaning and that 95% of your life was a waste of time. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6156.12s)]
*  And that's a tragedy. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6162.36s)]
*  So we have to be very, very set on this idea that we have to maximize the use of all of [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6164.68s)]
*  our days if we're going to amount to anything in life. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6173.88s)]
*  And that means at the end of every day, there has to be a concerted look on your part. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6177.740000000001s)]
*  What was the most significant thing that happened to me today and how will it influence my life [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6185.8s)]
*  tomorrow? [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6191.360000000001s)]
*  And if we can do this, your days become progressive. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6193.0s)]
*  Most people live day to day where the events of yesterday have no bearing on the events [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6199.28s)]
*  of today and the events of today have no bearing on the events of tomorrow. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6206.58s)]
*  And this means your life will simply run in a flat line until the day you die. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6211.28s)]
*  But if we make a concerted effort to build one day upon another, even if it's just a [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6217.24s)]
*  very small thing, and in most cases it will be a small thing, it's rare that we have a [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6223.679999999999s)]
*  day where something monumental happens. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6227.639999999999s)]
*  Most days are not monumental, they're mundane. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6229.5199999999995s)]
*  So on every one of these mundane days, we have to take one small little gem that happened [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6232.04s)]
*  and may not be very big, something small, and add that to your performance tomorrow. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6236.639999999999s)]
*  And if we can do this over 10 years, something truly remarkable can happen. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6244.12s)]
*  It's so easy just to let a day go and say, I'll try again tomorrow. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6249.0s)]
*  But until we get a sense of one day building upon another towards a goal, you'll never [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6256.34s)]
*  achieve anything. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6261.94s)]
*  You'll just melt on and 10 years will go by and you'll look back and say, what do I do [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6262.94s)]
*  and what did I do? [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6267.72s)]
*  And it may not be anything significant behind you. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6270.0s)]
*  So be intentional about doing something that's going to make your life better. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6273.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6277.12s)]
*  The whole notion of chyzen is this crystallizes, this idea that if I can improve my performance [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6278.12s)]
*  in any given area of my life by even a very small percentage point and then add day by [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6283.959999999999s)]
*  day you get this compounding interest effect where at the end of five years something quite [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6289.78s)]
*  remarkable may have happened. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6295.719999999999s)]
*  You may have literally reinvented yourself in five years. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6296.759999999999s)]
*  You may have an entirely new skill set which you didn't have previously. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6300.1s)]
*  And so it's up to us to do this because the natural tendency is for days just to run into [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6306.02s)]
*  each other until by the end of the week you're looking back and say, what happened this week? [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6312.54s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6315.820000000001s)]
*  It's just gone. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6316.820000000001s)]
*  It's so easy to let that happen. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6317.820000000001s)]
*  There's so many distractions in life. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6319.620000000001s)]
*  There's so many things looking to grab your attention that you can lose a day, a week, [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6321.42s)]
*  a month, and even a year, even a decade. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6327.18s)]
*  And it's up to us to ask, okay, well, what was significant and how is it going to be [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6331.900000000001s)]
*  built into my life tomorrow? [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6336.02s)]
*  And how does this relate to the goals that I have? [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6338.02s)]
*  And if you can do this, this is the basic idea behind chyzen. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6341.14s)]
*  And you can do remarkable things and you can reinvent yourself many times over the period [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6344.9400000000005s)]
*  of your life. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6352.5s)]
*  It's my belief that it takes around five years of full-time training to develop world-class [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6353.94s)]
*  skills and most athletic endeavors. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6360.0199999999995s)]
*  There are many, many examples of people beginning training and somewhere between five to seven [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6362.86s)]
*  years after the onset of their training competing at the highest levels of their given sport [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6370.46s)]
*  and getting within the top five athletes in the world. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6376.379999999999s)]
*  There are many, many examples of this. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6381.18s)]
*  That's a clear signal that it takes around five to seven years of full-time training [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6384.900000000001s)]
*  to get to world-class level in sports. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6389.46s)]
*  You could extend that into other areas of life. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6396.9800000000005s)]
*  You can become, in the same time it takes you to win an Olympic bronze medal, you could [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6398.9800000000005s)]
*  become an outstanding day trader. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6404.06s)]
*  So think about it, five years is not a long time. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6407.26s)]
*  That means we all have within us this ability to reinvent ourselves many times in the course [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6410.54s)]
*  of our life. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6415.5s)]
*  If you start off at 20 years old, there's a lot of opportunities for you to change and [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6416.5s)]
*  adapt. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6420.66s)]
*  That's it. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6421.66s)]
*  That guy's a treasure. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6422.66s)]
*  Yeah, somebody that introspective and with that perspective and then coupled with somebody [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6424.38s)]
*  like Gordon Ryan, this incredible driven athlete, no wonder. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6430.02s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6435.3s)]
*  I mean, that combination, that's going to be tough to beat. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6436.3s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6438.900000000001s)]
*  And the crazy thing is they put it out there for the whole world. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6440.5s)]
*  Like this is what we're doing. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6443.58s)]
*  You could do it too. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6445.54s)]
*  And the thing is it's so difficult. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6446.86s)]
*  The dedication. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6448.66s)]
*  It's also the focus. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6449.66s)]
*  To maintain that focus constantly and to have this idea that I need to review all the things [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6452.7s)]
*  I'm doing to make sure I'm doing them better. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6457.74s)]
*  Yeah, that mindset. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6459.58s)]
*  Very difficult. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6460.58s)]
*  I mean, he's like, yeah, on such a higher level than most people. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6461.58s)]
*  That's what I keep thinking about with Huberman talking about hunting. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6467.86s)]
*  Because I want, I always think about what I'm passionate about is hunting. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6471.54s)]
*  How can I understand my place in the mounds as a predator and a bow hunter? [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6476.099999999999s)]
*  How can I get better? [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6483.96s)]
*  How can I get more in tune? [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6485.139999999999s)]
*  And I'm always like, because it's so easy to be out there and I mean, you are immersed [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6486.46s)]
*  and you're in it and you're trying to feel the wind, the ground under your feet. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6492.62s)]
*  You're trying to be so in tune. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6501.780000000001s)]
*  But I'm like, God, is there another level of consciousness that maybe I just don't understand [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6503.62s)]
*  and I want to. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6508.740000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6509.740000000001s)]
*  Because I want to be, I want to continue. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6510.740000000001s)]
*  I learn something every time and I'm sure you do too out there. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6513.26s)]
*  But it's like, I mean, I don't know. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6516.26s)]
*  I want to be the best I can be. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6520.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6523.219999999999s)]
*  And I think that also comes with many, many days hunting. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6524.219999999999s)]
*  And this is a thing that becomes controversial. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6528.78s)]
*  But people say, oh, you should only hunt what you eat. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6532.42s)]
*  But I think you should hunt as much as you can. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6535.34s)]
*  And there's plenty of people that you could give that meat to. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6538.719999999999s)]
*  As long as it's legal. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6542.0599999999995s)]
*  That's what I do. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6543.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6544.0599999999995s)]
*  And I agree with what you do. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6545.0599999999995s)]
*  And I know it's controversial, but I don't think they're right. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6546.5599999999995s)]
*  I think you're right because your success in the field is unparalleled. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6548.7s)]
*  And I think there's a reason for that. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6552.34s)]
*  And it's because of this intense dedication and drive that you've been doing it for so [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6554.0s)]
*  long but you're still so focused on it. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6557.12s)]
*  You're not relaxed about it at all. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6559.74s)]
*  Like you and I have had so many conversations about hunting. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6562.66s)]
*  And you've been hunting for what, 35, 40 years, whatever it is. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6565.38s)]
*  When you and I talk, it's like you're fucking locked in all the time about this. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6568.46s)]
*  I'm going to try this. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6573.38s)]
*  I'm doing this now. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6574.58s)]
*  I've decided that this is a new thing. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6575.9s)]
*  I've found this improvement. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6578.34s)]
*  I made this small adjustment in this and that. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6579.9800000000005s)]
*  And then I learned this in this last hunt. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6582.580000000001s)]
*  And this was a thing that came up. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6585.38s)]
*  The elk that you shot in Utah, perfect example. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6588.1s)]
*  What people need to understand is even if you're right up close with an elk and say [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6592.780000000001s)]
*  if you have a 20 yard pin. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6600.42s)]
*  So a 20 yard pin, really the arrow's not dropping very far in 20 yards. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6603.1s)]
*  Because these arrows are going very fast. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6608.06s)]
*  It's only a couple of seconds to get to 20 yards, not dropping very far. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6609.54s)]
*  So you would think that you can shoot an elk that's six feet away. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6612.580000000001s)]
*  But it comes up. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6616.9800000000005s)]
*  That's the thing. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6618.620000000001s)]
*  It goes off the bow and reaches a peak. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6619.620000000001s)]
*  What happens when it's that close is your eye is here and the arrow's here. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6624.06s)]
*  You're looking at where you want to hit with that 20, but the arrow's still down here. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6629.62s)]
*  Right, it hasn't lifted up yet. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6633.62s)]
*  Right, so to hit where you want at where that bull was, which was from here to the door, [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6635.259999999999s)]
*  I'd aim up high with the 50 yard pin and then the arrow's going to hit where you want it to. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6640.82s)]
*  Right. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6646.7s)]
*  If you hold 20, it's still low. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6647.219999999999s)]
*  It's going to go off the brisket off the bottom of the chest. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6649.58s)]
*  Right. I wouldn't have known that. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6651.7s)]
*  I don't know that. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6653.139999999999s)]
*  You needed to learn that. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6654.099999999999s)]
*  And that's just years and years in the field. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6655.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6659.74s)]
*  And the hardest thing was it happened like that. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6660.26s)]
*  Because I thought that bull, he was coming in. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6663.139999999999s)]
*  So I had my sights set on 20 because I knew, oh, he's coming hot and heavy. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6665.82s)]
*  He was bugling, crashing down through. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6670.0199999999995s)]
*  So I set it on 20 real quick. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6671.78s)]
*  And I'm seeing that I made a mistake of sitting in the trail. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6673.46s)]
*  But I thought he was coming straight down the ridge. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6678.099999999999s)]
*  And so I was going to draw back when he was like at 10 yards, stop him, whack. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6681.66s)]
*  But he hit that trail, came right to me. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6688.099999999999s)]
*  And I'm sitting there on my knees in the trail. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6690.94s)]
*  I was a full draw luckily because I never wait for them to get close. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6693.099999999999s)]
*  I always draw early. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6696.5s)]
*  He was where I am. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6697.38s)]
*  Right. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6698.66s)]

*  An artist. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6797.1s)]
*  He wrote the song for me. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6798.38s)]
*  Do you know him? [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6799.54s)]
*  I don't. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6801.3s)]
*  I think I did meet him at the I think at Utah Hunting Expo. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6802.42s)]
*  But he wrote this song and I said, I go, I said something about it. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6807.22s)]
*  And I'm like, well, man, if it's good, I could just have it on to start my [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6812.14s)]

*  That's what it was. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6821.78s)]
*  Example of how your passion can change your life, [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6822.38s)]
*  even if that passion is something as obscure as bow hunting. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6824.9800000000005s)]
*  Bow hunting changed my life. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6829.22s)]
*  Your passion, whatever that may be, can change yours. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6831.14s)]
*  So I am my fault. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6861.14s)]
*  They want someone to blame. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6863.700000000001s)]

*  I am Roy tough. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6869.700000000001s)]
*  I am the change. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6871.46s)]
*  The few in dirt feel like Cam Haynes. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6873.22s)]
*  That's pretty bad. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6877.06s)]
*  That's your own song, son. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6880.1s)]

*  any day of the year and they actually need you to do it. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=6896.3s)]

*  That one in seconds, 30 yards. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7116.14s)]
*  He didn't know he didn't know anything. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7118.14s)]
*  Yeah. You know, he's just lost blood pressure done. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7120.5s)]
*  Yeah. That's as merciful a shot as you could ever get. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7123.42s)]
*  Yeah. And as you mentioned earlier about the meat. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7126.58s)]
*  So, you know, yeah, I killed four bulls this year. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7129.1s)]
*  And don't I don't want anybody to ever think that any of that meat is going to waste. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7132.26s)]
*  I mean, there's so many people who love wild game meat, especially now. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7137.900000000001s)]
*  When you're people are more conscious about where their meat's coming from. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7142.94s)]
*  And to get something that I killed, I took care of myself. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7146.62s)]
*  You know, it's we know exactly where it came from. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7150.219999999999s)]
*  That's like that's valuable. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7153.7s)]
*  That means something. And it's also it means something. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7155.5s)]
*  You know, when people, you know, as we say, people go [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7158.0199999999995s)]
*  order a burger or steak or whatever, they get full and they say, [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7161.94s)]
*  I'm stuffed, had too much bread. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7166.5s)]
*  I'm done with this. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7168.62s)]
*  So half that steak goes back to the kitchen. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7169.74s)]
*  That was a fucking life. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7171.98s)]
*  I was like, that life doesn't mean shit to you. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7173.74s)]
*  But that bull right there, that means a lot to me. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7176.58s)]
*  And when I give that meat to somebody, that means something. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7179.66s)]
*  This is like, oh, yeah, this is a bull I killed in Utah. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7182.34s)]
*  I hope you like it. That fucking means something. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7184.74s)]
*  You're not going to send that. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7187.26s)]
*  You're not going to throw that shit in the garbage because you're full. Right. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7188.179999999999s)]
*  It means too much. Yeah. There's reverence to it. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7191.22s)]
*  That's what so. Yeah. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7194.179999999999s)]
*  I kill multiple bulls, but that that is the [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7196.38s)]
*  greatest part of being a hunter and a provider is sharing that with your community. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7201.02s)]
*  I love giving it to people. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7205.34s)]
*  I give meat to a lot of people and I love seeing the images. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7206.58s)]
*  They send me pictures of like, hey, look, I cooked this. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7211.06s)]
*  It's awesome. It's the best. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7213.860000000001s)]
*  And then, you know, the it's so delicious, too. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7215.22s)]
*  I mean, wild game. I've said it so many times. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7218.58s)]
*  But if you can try some of the elk that I cook, [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7220.9400000000005s)]
*  you'd be like, oh, my God, where can I get this? [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7225.219999999999s)]
*  Well, you got to go hiking. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7227.58s)]
*  What I learned how to shoot a bow or a rifle. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7229.9s)]
*  You have to find someone who's willing to teach you. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7231.86s)]
*  You have to, you know, you have to put in work. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7234.219999999999s)]
*  What I love about. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7236.219999999999s)]
*  I mean, there's so much I love about sharing our lifestyle. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7237.78s)]
*  But when I have people come in for the lift run shoot is they train with me. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7240.58s)]
*  They learn how to shoot a bow and everything. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7245.34s)]
*  But then we always have elk chili. Oh, and like Huberman came in. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7247.38s)]
*  I think he had three bowls of it. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7251.82s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, this shit is fucking fuel. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7253.9s)]
*  This is real fuel. Yeah. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7256.66s)]
*  You know, and this is a bull I killed. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7258.0199999999995s)]
*  You know, I think that was from the Arizona bull that this is actually. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7260.54s)]
*  Oh, the last time I had my bling on Tanner made this. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7264.099999999999s)]
*  Oh, that's from the Ivory's. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7267.219999999999s)]
*  So he filmed that bull I killed. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7268.98s)]
*  And it was the biggest bull he's ever seen, you know, is, you know, giant bull. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7272.099999999999s)]
*  And so he made a necklace for himself and made me one. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7276.099999999999s)]
*  Last time I had the C.H. Gold bling. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7279.139999999999s)]
*  And now I'm like, well, we'll offset that with an ivory. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7281.5s)]
*  But would you know, Elks used to have this stuff tusks. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7284.74s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I think they did. Yeah, that's where it comes from. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7289.1s)]
*  That ivory at one point in time was a massive tusk [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7291.66s)]
*  that Elks used to have, and then they evolved. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7295.1s)]
*  It's so it's so cool. It's so cool. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7297.94s)]
*  Just like. I mean, you know, bow hunting, especially. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7300.14s)]
*  Well, not just elk anything, but it means so much. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7304.9s)]
*  And it's just like it's it's who I am. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7308.74s)]
*  You know, so when it's something that that is that meaningful and you can share that. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7311.74s)]
*  Another example of that was I took Kat Bradley. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7317.06s)]
*  She's a elite ultra runner and she killed her first buck. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7320.7s)]
*  And it's like the the most special part. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7324.54s)]
*  I haven't made a film on that yet, but is she we had to run. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7327.18s)]
*  We had to do the stock in the rain hustle. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7332.58s)]
*  She made a perfect shot. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7335.46s)]
*  We had to pack that she she had some weight on her back, [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7338.3s)]
*  packed out of this steep hole, worked her ass off. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7341.9400000000005s)]
*  It was just like the perfect time. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7345.860000000001s)]
*  Then we took care of the meat, did everything, got up the next morning. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7347.42s)]
*  We're in this little cabin and made [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7351.22s)]
*  tenderloins, cut that up, cooked the tenderloins, eggs, hash browns and bacon. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7355.54s)]
*  And it's just like, can you I mean, after working your ass off on a hunt, [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7361.22s)]
*  killing a buck, having a meal like that, listening to old country music radio, [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7365.74s)]
*  just like crackling on this AM radio that was in that cabin. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7370.219999999999s)]
*  It's like. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7374.42s)]
*  I I don't know if there's anything I'd rather do in life. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7377.0599999999995s)]
*  I swear to God, people could offer me anything and I'd say, [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7382.139999999999s)]
*  I'd just rather have this morning right here, this this experience. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7385.94s)]
*  It's because it's earned. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7388.74s)]
*  It's it's so it's real. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7390.219999999999s)]
*  And when we were out there in the mountain and standing in [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7392.9s)]
*  and we were fucking soaked, it was pouring. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7395.78s)]
*  She killed this buck. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7398.58s)]
*  And I had, you know, me and my buddy, Kevin, broke it all down, gutted it. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7400.379999999999s)]
*  We had to actually skinned it and quartered it up right there to pack it out [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7404.339999999999s)]
*  because it's such a hole. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7408.219999999999s)]
*  But I'm like looking and we're just soaked and freezing. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7409.58s)]
*  And I'm just like. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7412.0599999999995s)]
*  This is life. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7413.78s)]
*  This is this is how life is supposed to be. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7415.74s)]
*  All this other bullshit, all this around here, that's not fucking real. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7418.58s)]
*  This is real. Right. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7422.78s)]
*  Out hunting, primal, killing what you're going to eat [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7424.5s)]
*  and packing it out of the mountains. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7427.860000000001s)]
*  That's fucking real and earning it. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7429.1s)]
*  You earn that. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7431.3s)]
*  And it's everything else is like a distraction over real life. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7432.26s)]
*  That's why that buck is on the table. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7436.9400000000005s)]
*  That's the first animal I killed with Stephen Montana. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7438.42s)]
*  I remember that just from hearing you talk about it and how meaningful it is. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7441.58s)]
*  Your first buck in Montana and you. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7445.78s)]
*  I don't you didn't make a great shot, did you? [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7448.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it was a good shot, but I had to do a follow. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7451.22s)]
*  He went down, right. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7454.02s)]
*  But he was spined. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7454.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh, that's what it was. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7456.42s)]
*  Yeah, I made a follow up shot. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7457.34s)]
*  And you could see the follow up shot on the video where it's like the intensity. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7459.22s)]
*  But I remember I remember seeing that that I haven't seen that show. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7462.22s)]
*  But I remember that's now that's stories you remember, [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7466.5s)]
*  because that's real. Yeah, it's real. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7470.54s)]
*  And you you ate that. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7472.46s)]
*  Did you guys cook it? Oh, yeah, we did that night. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7473.900000000001s)]
*  We ate the liver with liver with onions that night. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7476.3s)]
*  Why Brian Cowan pulled thorns out of my thigh? [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7478.74s)]
*  Because I when I got down prone to make the shot, [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7482.3s)]
*  I laid down right on a cactus and I just cactus thorns all over my leg. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7487.0199999999995s)]
*  Like I had like fucking 40 thorns in my leg. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7491.66s)]
*  And it was hilarious because like we're by the campfire and I'm going like this. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7495.0599999999995s)]
*  I got my pants down and Cowan's got fucking pliers [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7498.54s)]
*  and he's pulling thorns out of my legs. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7501.179999999999s)]
*  We cooked the liver. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7504.139999999999s)]
*  We ate the liver that night. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7505.62s)]
*  And then we went back because we shot it late in the afternoon. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7507.0199999999995s)]
*  So we gutted it, hung it, got the organs out [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7511.099999999999s)]
*  and then brought the organs back to the campfire and cooked the liver that night. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7515.42s)]
*  And then we went back the next day, cut the buck down in the morning [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7519.14s)]
*  and then ate it for dinner that night. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7523.58s)]
*  And then when I when we're eating it, I was like, this is what I'm doing now. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7525.78s)]
*  That changed your life. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7530.0599999999995s)]
*  Didn't 100 percent, 100 percent. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7531.7s)]
*  But it's so hard to get someone to get you to do that. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7533.26s)]
*  It's so hard, first of all, so hard to find someone who has the knowledge, [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7536.740000000001s)]
*  who's willing to take you and teach you like in forever in debt to Steve [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7540.34s)]
*  and to you for doing that. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7543.780000000001s)]
*  But to also to want to do that and to to have. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7545.58s)]
*  I mean, we're camping those nine degrees outside. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7550.18s)]
*  It's fucking freezing in Montana. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7552.5s)]
*  You know, we're on the Missouri breaks. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7554.22s)]
*  You're just walking through these intense canyons. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7555.820000000001s)]
*  But it was it was so difficult that when we did have success, [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7559.22s)]
*  the feeling of elation and joy, it's very difficult to describe. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7563.18s)]
*  A lot of people, they see these videos of a hunter [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7567.820000000001s)]
*  making a shot and going like, yeah. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7572.06s)]
*  And they go, where is the spirituality? [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7575.02s)]
*  Where is it like you don't understand how hard it is to do that? [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7577.5s)]
*  And the joy is in the fact that you made an ethical shot [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7581.26s)]
*  and the animal is down like I had a hard hunt in California. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7584.700000000001s)]
*  We went like five, six days, put in tons of miles every day. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7588.700000000001s)]
*  You know, 10, 10 miles, eight miles, 11 miles going through the mountains. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7593.22s)]
*  And then when I finally shot that bull and he dropped, [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7597.62s)]
*  he was dead in 10 seconds, it was like a perfect shot. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7601.54s)]
*  I fucking cheered so loud that Evan and Cody, the guys like Evan, [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7604.54s)]
*  Evan Hafer from Black Riffle Coffee, who's with me, [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7610.5s)]
*  they were on the other side of the mountain and they heard it. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7613.02s)]
*  Because I just went, wow. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7616.1s)]
*  Yeah. And you know, me and my friend Biscuit, we hugged and it was like, [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7618.22s)]
*  holy shit, man. Yeah, we did it. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7622.98s)]
*  We did it. And it wasn't like I'm happy that this animal is dead now. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7624.86s)]
*  It was like, no, we were successful. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7630.0199999999995s)]
*  I know how hard it is to do, difficult to do. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7632.38s)]
*  There was so much adrenaline and tension involved [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7635.98s)]
*  and I had to make a great shot and I did it. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7638.42s)]
*  And so all that hard work all paid off at the end. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7641.0199999999995s)]
*  All the reps all year. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7644.58s)]
*  It wasn't just that hunt. Yeah. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7646.3s)]
*  It was like all the the reps that thinking about it, [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7648.06s)]
*  envisioning that moment. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7650.98s)]
*  I think about it all the time, dude. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7652.379999999999s)]
*  I think about it when I'm at the UFC. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7653.66s)]
*  I'm at the UFC, I'm about to call a fight and I'm thinking about like perfect shots [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7655.5s)]
*  and thinking about shooting in between branches of trees. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7658.42s)]
*  I'm thinking about like wind and fucking angles. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7660.82s)]
*  And it's well. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7664.9s)]
*  I mean, it means so much to me, like so on that deer hunt that I took cat on, [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7668.0199999999995s)]
*  I there's access to this timber company land. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7672.139999999999s)]
*  I pay for that. Right. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7676.299999999999s)]
*  So I'm paying forty five hundred dollars each. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7677.62s)]
*  And I take two people. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7680.62s)]
*  And it's just like, I don't even care. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7682.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't even tell them it costs money. Right. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7684.3s)]
*  I just want to do it because I just want to be out there with somebody, [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7686.74s)]
*  a new hunter and share my world with them. Yeah. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7689.78s)]
*  And I paid just so I'm like, no, I can I can take them. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7692.7s)]
*  We can, you know, I can expose them to the hunting lifestyle [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7696.3s)]
*  the way I want to on this. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7700.98s)]
*  It's a warehouse land, this timber company land. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7703.22s)]
*  And it's maybe it'll change our life. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7706.74s)]
*  Maybe it won't. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7709.54s)]
*  But I know I'm going to gain from sharing that with somebody. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7710.42s)]
*  And that that means everything to me. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7713.42s)]
*  I just you know, filmed it too, which is awesome. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7715.1s)]
*  It's great. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7718.42s)]
*  So people can watch it and see like the real moments that you guys had together. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7719.06s)]
*  And even if she never does that again, that experience, she will keep with her [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7723.58s)]
*  forever. If that hunt that I had with Renell was the last hunt I ever had, [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7727.34s)]
*  I would still be telling people about that today. Yeah, it was awesome. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7730.86s)]
*  We're in the campfire. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7734.34s)]
*  We're freezing our asses off, like eating this this animal [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7735.54s)]
*  that we had just shot and eating it, cooking it over a fire, a campfire. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7739.66s)]
*  And it was so satisfying. Yeah. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7744.14s)]
*  It it ignites a part of your DNA that you didn't know existed. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7745.94s)]
*  There's a hunter gatherer aspect to whatever it means to be a human [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7750.82s)]
*  that kept us alive for thousands and thousands of years. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7755.7s)]
*  And that's inside you. Yeah. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7759.54s)]
*  And you don't know it's inside you until you put an animal on the ground. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7761.18s)]
*  You eat it and you're like, oh, my God. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7763.82s)]
*  It's like the way I describe it to people. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7766.219999999999s)]
*  Most people have been fishing. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7767.86s)]
*  There's a feeling you get when you catch a fish. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7769.98s)]
*  We look the line. Yeah. Oh, you feel it fighting. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7772.0199999999995s)]
*  It is inside of you. Yeah. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7774.54s)]
*  That like this is going to feed me and my family now. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7776.54s)]
*  This is going to feed my loved ones. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7779.9s)]
*  We're going to survive. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7782.219999999999s)]
*  And that's why it's so exciting, because it ignites this thing [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7783.74s)]
*  that was imperative for human beings to make it to 2023. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7787.7s)]
*  You might be able to go to fucking H.E.B. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7791.099999999999s)]
*  and just buy a ribeye. That's great. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7792.7s)]
*  Nothing wrong with that. Yeah. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7794.42s)]
*  But the reality is that was not always the case. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7795.58s)]
*  And for us to get to 2023, it had to be people that were doing that shit [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7798.62s)]
*  with bows and arrows that they made themselves. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7802.94s)]
*  They had to knock rocks to make this. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7805.5s)]
*  Where's that right there? Right here. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7808.42s)]
*  This is a real fucking arrowhead that the Comanche used from right here. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7809.98s)]
*  This is from right here. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7814.54s)]
*  I love this. I love the history of someone probably sent that arrow [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7815.98s)]
*  into a whitetail and then it probably passed through and dug into the dirt. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7820.3s)]
*  And then someone dug it out of the dirt hundreds of years later. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7826.1s)]
*  Yeah, that's incredible. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7829.46s)]
*  And it's in pristine condition. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7830.34s)]
*  And this was made by some person who painstakingly crafted this [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7832.1s)]
*  so that they could eat. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7836.5s)]
*  That is a perfect head to fucking amazing. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7837.820000000001s)]
*  This thing's amazing. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7840.06s)]
*  Well, but it's like when you I don't know, people who might not think [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7841.06s)]
*  hunting is for them, maybe it's not. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7845.42s)]
*  But when that happens and you do kill, [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7846.62s)]
*  there is almost like the curtains pulled back. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7850.0599999999995s)]
*  And you're just like, holy shit. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7853.94s)]
*  Yeah, this is this is this is how this is survival. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7856.54s)]
*  Yeah. And you didn't know it because that curtain's been closed. Right. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7861.46s)]
*  Until you were that's why it's so meaningful to me. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7864.58s)]
*  I buy those two hunts every year. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7867.66s)]
*  And my goal is always take somebody new, you know, just because it's like [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7870.14s)]
*  I it's it's for me, it's not for them, but I can like twist it into like, [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7874.780000000001s)]
*  it'll help both of us. But I just it's. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7879.18s)]
*  Join the process of seeing someone experience it for the first time. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7882.3s)]
*  I love it because you only experience it for the first time once. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7884.9400000000005s)]
*  I love it once. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7887.820000000001s)]
*  And as a cat was perfect for that because she got it, [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7888.860000000001s)]
*  you know, she admits so much and like that's what you want. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7893.22s)]
*  Because obviously she's someone who understands sacrifice and hard work. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7896.700000000001s)]
*  Yes, definitely. More than anybody. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7899.5s)]
*  Yeah. And it was it was I'll never forget it. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7901.62s)]
*  It was I seriously think it was the best time of my fall. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7905.5s)]
*  That's awesome. I mean, I had some I had some great hunts, [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7908.58s)]
*  but that's just that's just what hunting that's the power of hunting. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7911.54s)]
*  Yeah. And being part of a I don't want to say tribe [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7915.3s)]
*  because like people throw it around. But it's a good word. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7919.42s)]
*  I think bow hunters, the ones who aren't country, they are part of a tribe. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7923.14s)]
*  Even the ones who are country, they're in the tribe. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7926.9400000000005s)]
*  They just have ego problems. Yeah. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7928.66s)]
*  It's just wasted energy. Yeah. It's wasted energy. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7931.06s)]
*  Like if you want to be upset at someone, be upset at the people that litter. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7934.02s)]
*  Yeah. Be upset at the people that leave garbage at their camp. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7938.42s)]
*  Be upset at those people because that's not cool. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7941.38s)]
*  Don't be upset at fellow hunters. Right. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7943.46s)]
*  Don't be upset at someone who's trying to spread this message. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7945.1s)]
*  And then there's the dumbest fucking people that don't like the fact [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7948.660000000001s)]
*  that the trailheads are getting crowded now because so many people are getting [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7951.740000000001s)]
*  into this. Well, find another trailhead, stupid. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7954.700000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of trailheads. You can go all over the place. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7957.42s)]
*  You can just with a little bit of research. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7959.74s)]
*  There's all these maps as onyx hunt and go hunt and fucking hunting. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7961.34s)]
*  Fool. There's all those places you can get resources to find different places [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7966.139999999999s)]
*  to hunt at. The reason why people like that get a little traction is because [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7969.34s)]
*  there's a lot of people who don't kill every year. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7973.9s)]
*  Success is, you know, it's most people fail. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7976.0599999999995s)]
*  So when people fail, they're looking for an excuse. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7979.62s)]
*  So if this guy or whoever it is gives them an excuse like, oh, yeah, [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7983.26s)]
*  it's too overcrowded because of Joe and Cam talking about it. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7987.26s)]
*  All of a sudden, they're the victim and like they got other victims [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7990.9400000000005s)]
*  who didn't weren't successful. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7993.66s)]
*  So like, yeah, we're all the losers. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7995.06s)]
*  We can gang up together and talk shit about these guys. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7996.900000000001s)]
*  We get that here in Austin. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=7999.22s)]
*  This local Austin comics that hate on the mothership [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8000.820000000001s)]
*  because the mothership has brought in 15 world class comedians to town. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8004.54s)]
*  It's harder for them to get spots now. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8008.1s)]
*  Guess what? Stupid. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8010.02s)]
*  This is the greatest opportunity you've ever had in your fucking life. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8010.900000000001s)]
*  If you rise to the occasion, we'll put you up and make you famous, bitch. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8013.46s)]
*  Like, come on, man, we want you to be good. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8017.46s)]
*  We don't want you to be floundering in this fucking this [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8019.3s)]
*  area of mediocrity that you've been existing in for so long. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8023.900000000001s)]
*  Like, yeah, the big boys are in town. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8027.18s)]
*  It's good. It's good for everybody. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8029.9400000000005s)]
*  And people with hunting, they like to talk about that everybody [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8031.54s)]
*  should have the same opportunities. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8035.14s)]
*  It's like almost like making it hunting socialism. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8037.38s)]
*  Yeah. You know what I mean? Right. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8040.9400000000005s)]
*  And so, well, if you if you work your ass off, [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8042.5s)]
*  shouldn't you get better opportunities than somebody who doesn't do anything? [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8046.66s)]
*  Of course. I mean, but but if and also the guy who kind of coins [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8050.02s)]
*  this thing about whatever, everybody should have the same opportunities. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8054.82s)]
*  It's like he has a great job, gets tons of vacation. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8059.42s)]
*  Doesn't he have an advantage over a guy who works in a mill [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8062.900000000001s)]
*  who gets fucking two days off a year? [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8065.38s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of people that complain. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8067.900000000001s)]
*  But yeah, I know what you're talking about. Yeah. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8069.22s)]
*  This is just complaining is a normal part of human life. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8070.5s)]
*  When you're looking at other people's success and trying to find flaws in it. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8074.18s)]
*  But it's very bad for you. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8077.18s)]
*  And that's what people don't understand. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8078.9800000000005s)]
*  It's not productive. It doesn't help you. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8080.18s)]
*  And you could disagree or agree with people's approaches. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8082.700000000001s)]
*  You could think that everyone should only hunt on public land. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8085.780000000001s)]
*  You could you could have all these ideas and you could debate those opinions. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8088.42s)]
*  And you're more than welcome to. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8091.3s)]
*  The problem is, when you look to criticize, [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8093.3s)]
*  instead of look at the good side of things, there's a lot of good to this. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8096.58s)]
*  There's a lot of good to what you do. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8100.46s)]
*  It's more good than anything. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8101.860000000001s)]
*  There's I see no negatives. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8103.9s)]
*  The educating people about the value of this is very good. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8106.099999999999s)]
*  And during Covid, that's one of the real times where people realize like, hey, [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8110.7s)]
*  this food chain is kind of fragile. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8115.379999999999s)]
*  Like I went to the supermarket. There's no fucking food. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8117.259999999999s)]
*  Like Duncan texted me. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8119.299999999999s)]
*  He was at a supermarket in North Carolina where he's living. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8121.7s)]
*  And he's like, dude, there's no meat. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8123.98s)]
*  There's no fucking meat. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8125.78s)]
*  He goes, I got to learn how to hunt. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8126.86s)]
*  I was like, wow, that is a moment when you have children and you have a family. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8128.7s)]
*  And you start realizing like we might not have nutrition. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8133.1s)]
*  And they're looking at you and you're the leader of the family. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8135.46s)]
*  And you're like, going, what the fuck am I going to do? [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8137.700000000001s)]
*  Right. And now you realize like, oh, my God, I need another skill. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8139.620000000001s)]
*  I'm susceptible. Yeah. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8142.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we're all vulnerable. Yeah. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8144.02s)]
*  And, you know, obviously, for the most part, we're not. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8145.42s)]
*  Obviously, for the most part, we do have supermarkets. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8148.700000000001s)]
*  We do have food. That's all great and everything. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8151.02s)]
*  But we're trying to tell you that there is another way that's vastly more rewarding. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8152.900000000001s)]
*  It might not be available to you because you might not have the time. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8157.900000000001s)]
*  You might have a job that requires you to work 51 weeks a year. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8160.62s)]
*  Then you have a family and a lot of obligations. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8163.58s)]
*  And I understand. But don't hate on people that can. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8166.42s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. It's stupid. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8168.62s)]
*  It's just a waste of your time. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8170.5s)]
*  It's a waste of everybody's time. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8171.98s)]
*  And you're just going to get a bunch of losers that like you. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8173.26s)]
*  Yeah, because they're going to be like, yeah, socialism's awesome. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8175.5s)]
*  I know. It's it's crazy. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8179.3s)]
*  It's a yeah, I don't know. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8181.26s)]
*  I feel I feel I mean, it's one reason why [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8183.5s)]
*  if we can educate people like when Andrew comes or like the other [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8187.900000000001s)]
*  outliers I've had on who might not be hunters, but can go and take these [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8191.5s)]
*  the lessons archery teaches you and maybe we talk about hunting. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8195.58s)]
*  And then they go back to their peer groups or whatever it is, their constituents. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8198.94s)]
*  And they're saying, well, actually, I did learn this about hunting. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8202.86s)]
*  And yeah. And so we're in your podcast has done that, obviously, you know, [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8206.62s)]
*  educated so many people who don't know anything about hunting on the benefits to it. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8211.3s)]
*  But it's I don't know. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8215.02s)]
*  It's so important. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8217.5s)]
*  And we're not saying everybody needs to hunt, but just have just have a [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8219.5s)]
*  honest take on it. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8224.86s)]
*  Yeah. And I think that there's real value in doing something that's very difficult, [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8226.18s)]
*  whether it's hunting or ultramarathon running or jujitsu [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8231.94s)]
*  or whatever it is that you choose to approach. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8235.82s)]
*  There's real value in doing difficult things. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8238.7s)]
*  And the thing about bow hunting that makes it so special to me [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8241.699999999999s)]
*  is that it requires so much of you and so that when you are successful, [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8245.699999999999s)]
*  it's so rewarding. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8250.179999999998s)]
*  It's it's insanely rewarding. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8251.779999999999s)]
*  It's rewarding on a different level that most people don't understand. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8253.619999999999s)]
*  And many people never get to experience in life. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8256.66s)]
*  They never get to experience that moment where you have to make [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8260.22s)]
*  this split second decision and you're drawing on an animal. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8263.619999999999s)]
*  And you have one arrow to make this happen. Yeah. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8267.46s)]
*  You have one arrow and it might be 65 yards away. [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8270.820000000002s)]
*  And you and you that fucking pins moving around. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8274.380000000001s)]
*  You got to settle that pin and settle your heart rate. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8276.78s)]
*  And you have to be confident in your training and then release that perfect arrow. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8278.980000000001s)]
*  And when you watch it to this day, when the happiest moments of my life was you and I [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8284.58s)]
*  I know is the picture that we have right out here. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8289.54s)]
*  That photo with that that elk was 67 yards. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8292.86s)]
*  And you're like, drop back, drop back, take a buddy. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8296.740000000002s)]
*  And it's just you see that arrow with that lighted knock to sail and swap and hit perfectly. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8299.42s)]
*  Oh, God. And, you know, if you didn't know how much that meant [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8305.18s)]
*  and how much pressure that was and how how much was riding on it, [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8309.54s)]
*  we were like smiling and hugging and I love you. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8314.02s)]
*  And like if you didn't understand, you look that and go, [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8317.78s)]
*  what is wrong with these guys? Right. Right. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8321.02s)]
*  But it's there's so much riding on it. Yeah. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8323.26s)]
*  And so it's just that, you know, you achieve this monumental goal [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8326.14s)]
*  with somebody sharing it with people you care about because Colton was there, too. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8330.66s)]
*  Yeah. And it's I mean, until you've been there, [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8334.539999999999s)]
*  it's probably shouldn't criticize because if you were there, you'd understand. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8338.939999999999s)]
*  It's hard for people to understand also because a lot of people's exposure [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8342.46s)]
*  to hunting has been hunting television shows. Right. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8346.699999999999s)]
*  So if you watch a television show, basically they're preaching to the converted already [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8349.3s)]
*  and they're doing these shows for other hunters and who are going to understand this. [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8354.300000000001s)]
*  And they're condensing a seven, eight, nine day trip into 22 minutes. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8358.82s)]
*  And out of those 22 minutes, like there's 35 seconds, [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8365.460000000001s)]
*  45 seconds of the shot and the animal running away and then dropping [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8369.140000000001s)]
*  and then everybody cheering. Yeah. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8373.140000000001s)]
*  And it's just a disproportionate experience for people that are watching it. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8374.58s)]
*  You're not getting how hard it is. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8378.66s)]
*  You're not getting the eight, ten miles in the mountains with elevated heart rate [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8380.580000000002s)]
*  and how exhausted you are at the end of the day when your legs feel like rubber [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8384.580000000002s)]
*  and you're pounding electrolytes and you fucking eating like a starving person. [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8388.1s)]
*  And then you look at your watch like, I'm going to go to bed right now. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8391.78s)]
*  I've got to get up for hours to sleep. Yeah. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8394.740000000002s)]
*  I got to go to bed right now. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8396.580000000002s)]
*  And then you get up and you do it all over again. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8397.900000000001s)]
*  You drink some coffee and you get out there and you, you know, you check your site, [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8399.86s)]
*  you check your bow. Let's go. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8403.18s)]
*  You know, and people that have never experienced that, [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8404.900000000001s)]
*  they're not going to understand it. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8407.9s)]
*  But I think you do an amazing job [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8410.42s)]
*  of relaying it to people where they kind of get a glimpse [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8413.859999999999s)]
*  without actually experiencing it, they kind of understand it from your passion, [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8418.179999999998s)]
*  from your ability to explain it, your ability to like [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8421.939999999999s)]
*  be like totally honest about the emotions and the feeling, the dedication, [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8425.46s)]
*  the hard work and what's required of it. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8430.38s)]
*  It's not a fucking easy thing to do. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8432.099999999999s)]
*  And even rifle hunting, rifle hunting is not easy. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8435.099999999999s)]
*  It's easier than bow hunting, but it is not fucking easy. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8438.779999999999s)]
*  It's hard. Yeah, it's a, you know, that presentation, [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8442.939999999999s)]
*  especially nowadays is important. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8447.74s)]
*  And I, I, I was reminded of this, you know, went and trained with Rich [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8449.82s)]
*  Froning in Nashville and he's bow hunting too now, right? [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8453.859999999999s)]
*  He's bow hunting. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8457.539999999999s)]
*  But he killed a bear with a rifle in Colorado and he put up, [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8458.259999999998s)]
*  he's getting death threats and everything because he's a crossfit, you know, [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8462.5s)]
*  world's fittest man four times. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8466.3s)]
*  He's a complete freak, but he's like been enamored with hunting now. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8468.3s)]
*  And so he killed this bear this year, a big bear in Colorado, a big boar. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8473.1s)]
*  And he had a picture because he worked his ass off. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8476.74s)]
*  He got, you know, didn't kill a bull, I think the last two years [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8480.54s)]
*  killed a cow with a rifle, but just, you know, a hard hunting is. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8485.460000000001s)]
*  And he's just trying to learn on his own out there. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8489.18s)]
*  And so he gets this bear killed. He's happy. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8492.26s)]
*  He's got a picture of this big bear and a big smile. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8494.58s)]
*  And I just told him, I said, that is hard. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8498.54s)]
*  That's hard for people. And I learned the hard way. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8501.26s)]
*  It's like I made the same mistake too. So now I build the story. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8504.02s)]
*  I share, you know, the experience, the animals out there, the country out there. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8507.74s)]
*  I don't share the kill shot till after I've shared breaking it down and the meat [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8513.460000000001s)]
*  and what it means. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8518.619999999999s)]
*  And then at the end of all that, you'll see the kill shot. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8519.779999999999s)]
*  But because he's a new hunter and he's just was fired up, [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8523.3s)]
*  he's a big smile with that bear. And that's the post. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8528.74s)]
*  And no fault of his. Anybody would do that. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8532.38s)]
*  But with social media, it's like they'll crucify you if that's all. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8536.38s)]
*  And especially with the bear. And I told him, you know, obviously he knows now. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8541.539999999999s)]
*  I didn't have to tell him anything. But bear and lions, [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8545.14s)]
*  it's a rough one. You know, you better be explaining that whole journey [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8548.539999999999s)]
*  before you get to that kill shot. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8553.98s)]
*  And, you know, I feel bad because nobody wants to read that, you know, [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8555.74s)]
*  they want to kill you or kill your family because you killed some animal. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8560.22s)]
*  But it's it's just I've learned over the years that it's. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8564.06s)]
*  I mean, you just there's so many people go like my page will get to 30 [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8569.5s)]
*  million people in a week. There's 14 million hunters. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8573.339999999998s)]
*  That means most of those people aren't hunters. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8576.98s)]
*  I better be explaining part of it to them, too. Yeah. You know. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8581.34s)]
*  And so that's that's the odds are that all 14 million hunters are looking at it. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8585.18s)]
*  That's small, too. Yeah. Yeah. Probably only a couple million hunters. Right. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8589.26s)]
*  Right. Most of it's probably non-hunter. Right. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8592.86s)]
*  So it's like we have to think about that. Yeah. Like his group, a cross fit group. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8594.98s)]
*  Of course, they all eat meat. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8599.94s)]
*  You know, you can't have that muscle, but they still don't hunt. Right. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8601.5s)]
*  So it's like that dance of explaining. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8605.02s)]
*  And now he's so enamored with it, like most his podcast now are hunting. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8607.66s)]
*  So people are like, wait, is this are you the crossfit guy or the hunter? [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8611.98s)]
*  You know, he just loves hunting now. It's all he thinks about. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8615.58s)]
*  Well, he's a strong man. He's got a strong mind. He can navigate this. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8618.300000000001s)]
*  But that is a he's fine with it. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8623.62s)]
*  He's fine. A great message. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8625.42s)]
*  The way you describe the way you have a process for it. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8627.02s)]
*  And I've seen your process evolve over the years. Yeah. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8630.74s)]
*  We realize, OK, let me lay this out in the best way possible, [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8633.34s)]
*  where it's going to people are going to really understand as much as they can [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8637.380000000001s)]
*  from social media press, because without a podcast and people talking, [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8641.34s)]
*  without videos of you actually being and the video literally should be eight days [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8645.54s)]
*  long, you know, the video literally should be an accurate portrayal. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8649.3s)]
*  Yeah. Or at least a day. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8653.66s)]
*  Like you should see like what's involved in the stock and all that stuff. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8655.3s)]
*  Like nobody would want to watch it because it fucking takes forever. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8658.62s)]
*  Yeah. We everybody wants to cut to the chase. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8661.22s)]
*  Like when does the elk come into the canyon? [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8663.58s)]
*  When did he see it? When do you when you make the stock? [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8665.7s)]
*  But like even that most people wouldn't show like on that bull [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8668.02s)]
*  I killed in Arizona. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8672.94s)]
*  I hit a little back and I caught the lung and the liver. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8674.66s)]
*  And he went up and I thought he was going to go die right there. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8679.5s)]
*  I thought at first it was perfect. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8683.06s)]
*  I looked at reviewed the footage, but I had to shoot him again. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8684.5s)]
*  Most people making hunting TV wouldn't have showed all that. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8688.06s)]
*  They would have showed the one shot went up to the animal dead. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8692.34s)]
*  Yeah. I wanted to show that, you know, there's it weighed. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8695.94s)]
*  It was like killing me, seeing that animal not not dying like that, [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8700.7s)]
*  because and then a bear went walked right below him, got him up. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8705.220000000001s)]
*  He was on the verge of death. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8709.62s)]
*  A bear got his adrenaline jacked up again. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8711.26s)]
*  And then he moved off like 30 yards and I'm just like, [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8713.98s)]
*  it was just killing me. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8717.060000000001s)]
*  So I took my boots off, snuck up there to 72 and shot him. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8718.220000000001s)]
*  But that was real. Yeah. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8723.06s)]
*  And most people don't see real because we've we've watered down [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8725.7s)]
*  what we show on TV to make it fit this. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8730.14s)]
*  Oh, you know, made a good shot. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8733.1s)]
*  Animal died after 50 yards in seconds. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8735.14s)]
*  That doesn't always happen, unfortunately. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8738.02s)]
*  Well, and also like just the consumption of meat in general. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8739.86s)]
*  Most people have never been to a slaughterhouse. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8743.7s)]
*  Most people have never seen it, including me. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8745.9s)]
*  I've never seen a cow get a bolt in the head. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8747.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's terrible. And I've eaten so many cows. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8749.26s)]
*  It's terrible. It's the process used to be absolutely normal. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8751.26s)]
*  If someone saw that you had venison [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8757.14s)]
*  and you describe the kill, they're like, yeah, that's what you do. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8760.3s)]
*  That is how you get venison. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8763.5s)]
*  That is the only way to get our meat. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8764.86s)]
*  And everyone did it forever until the last hundred years, [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8766.42s)]
*  which is so crazy that it's become controversial over the last hundred years. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8771.1s)]
*  Only now and we have other options and life so comfortable [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8775.34s)]
*  and places where it's not normal to hunt. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8778.86s)]
*  But yet the average consumption of meat is very high, like the UK or Brazil. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8781.78s)]
*  And Brazil, I have friends that have posted photos, you know, that are [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8787.18s)]
*  from all around the world. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8791.58s)]
*  And they get hate from these people from Brazil, [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8792.9s)]
*  which they're famous for steak houses. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8795.9s)]
*  I know Brazilian steak house. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8798.460000000001s)]
*  And all the meat you want. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8799.58s)]
*  Yeah. You literally all you can eat. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8801.42s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8803.26s)]
*  And but they don't have a history of hunting. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8803.94s)]
*  So because they don't have a history of hunting, they don't understand it. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8806.140000000001s)]
*  And they don't. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8808.380000000001s)]
*  Why would you do that when you could just go to the supermarket? [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8809.26s)]
*  And I say that it's terrible with the cow with the bolt through the head. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8811.66s)]
*  I just feel bad. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8815.140000000001s)]
*  I don't like watching even animals I kill. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8816.02s)]
*  I don't like watching them die. Yeah, I don't. [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8818.82s)]
*  I love animals. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8822.18s)]
*  So when I say it's it's it's awful for the cow, it's just I feel bad for it. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8823.86s)]
*  That's it. That's it. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8828.66s)]
*  I understand it has to happen. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8829.980000000001s)]
*  I mean, I kill myself, but it's like, doesn't mean that I enjoy the act of killing. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8831.220000000001s)]
*  No, no one enjoys the act of killing. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8835.26s)]
*  You enjoy the success and the meat and the fact that it's done quickly and cleanly. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8837.1s)]
*  And, you know, we've been guilty of this before, like kind of kind of [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8840.54s)]
*  mentioning factory farms and not giving credit to ranchers that do it right. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8845.98s)]
*  So it's not like every cattle operation is terrible. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8851.78s)]
*  Right. I've had a bunch of ranchers on to try to correct that. [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8854.9s)]
*  So explain to people. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8858.14s)]
*  So it's not that when I said it's terrible. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8858.94s)]
*  I don't want I don't want any negative because there's some great ranchers out there. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8861.06s)]
*  Beef is like the staple of of the meat that we eat here in this country. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8865.46s)]
*  So it's we've got to do it right. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8870.14s)]
*  Yeah. But it's just a symptom of the culture that we live in that most of the time [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8871.539999999999s)]
*  it's not done right. That's what's so crazy. [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8874.939999999999s)]
*  What's so crazy is people like my friend Will Harris, who runs White Oak Pastures. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8877.14s)]
*  Yeah, I saw that book right there. Yeah, he's amazing. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8881.74s)]
*  And he's I mean, that guy really, really put in effort. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8883.98s)]
*  It took him 20 years to convert his family farm [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8889.26s)]
*  from an industrial farm to a regenerative farm. [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8892.66s)]
*  It took immense resources and time and they knew it was going to make them less money. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8895.3s)]
*  And he still did it. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8900.539999999999s)]
*  And he did it. And he's out there preaching the gospel and telling people [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8901.699999999999s)]
*  that this is the way nature is supposed to be handled and that what he does at his farm, [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8905.34s)]
*  which is an amazing place, is he recreates nature in a contained environment. [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8910.38s)]
*  And these animals all live naturally. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8915.86s)]
*  The pigs live naturally. The chickens live naturally. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8917.5s)]
*  I mean, he was explaining the entire process of it. [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8919.98s)]
*  It's incredible. It's incredible. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8922.86s)]
*  And it's very difficult to do. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8924.42s)]
*  And what he's done is pretty amazing. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8927.34s)]
*  And he has friends that are running these industrial farms that are right next to him. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8929.5s)]
*  And the difference in the impact, when you see like the impact that it has [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8933.78s)]
*  on the river system that he has near him, like the difference between his river [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8937.78s)]
*  with a runoff from his farm, which is nothing to the one next to it, [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8941.78s)]
*  just like completely pollutes the river. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8945.54s)]
*  And there's no there's no regulations on that. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8947.26s)]
*  There's no regulations on how much herbicides and pesticides and fucking [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8950.660000000002s)]
*  industrial fertilizer just gets washed into the streams and chokes the fish to death. [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8954.900000000001s)]
*  No, no one's paying attention to that. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8959.34s)]
*  And he's doing it right. That guy's doing it right. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8962.140000000001s)]
*  And kudos to him. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8963.820000000002s)]
*  And they and I try to highlight those people as much as possible. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8964.78s)]
*  It's him or Joel Salatin, who runs Polyface Farms. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8967.26s)]
*  And there's a bunch of great regenerative ranchers in here in Texas. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8970.580000000002s)]
*  And, you know, we get Rome Ranch and we, you know, we get a lot of our meat. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8974.66s)]
*  If we buy steaks, we try to get it from those places. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8978.380000000001s)]
*  It's just getting fucking hungry. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8980.54s)]
*  I'm getting hungry, too. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8982.58s)]
*  I do. Before we wrap up, I got to say one more thing. OK. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8984.34s)]
*  We got it. We got to give credit to Jelly Roll. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8988.82s)]
*  I love that. I love Jelly Roll. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8992.380000000001s)]
*  No, we talked about him last time, and I think we even listened to his songs. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8993.78s)]
*  But I finally saw him live. Oh, he's amazing. At the Opry. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=8996.54s)]
*  He was like the fucking I mean, I could. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=9000.26s)]
*  If I think about how nice he is. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=9003.66s)]
*  I would I could almost I don't want to say I'm going to cry, [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=9006.9s)]
*  but it's like he is so nice, do you? [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=9009.98s)]
*  It's like he he treated me like family. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=9013.3s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he was we went out to dinner. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=9015.66s)]
*  And then even after the show, he's just like he goes, [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=9019.3s)]
*  what do you think of my family? [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=9022.3s)]
*  I mean, he cares. Yeah, he is such a big hearted person. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=9023.86s)]
*  And I'm it was amazing how welcoming and kind [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=9027.82s)]

*  when he's talking to him in between songs because he's so heartfelt. [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=9040.54s)]
*  Yeah, he's been through so much, but he's like, I don't. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=9044.140000000001s)]
*  There's you and him and Nellie. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=9047.820000000002s)]

*  I don't know how he was back in the day, you know, [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=9051.18s)]
*  but all I know is I know he made mistakes. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=9054.02s)]
*  I know he's been in jail. I know he's whatever. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=9057.02s)]
*  But now I don't know a nicer word. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=9059.62s)]
*  I don't know a better person. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=9063.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he's been through a lot. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=9064.58s)]
*  He's he's incredible on the other end. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=9065.78s)]
*  And he's he's fucking nominated for two Grammys. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=9067.7s)]
*  I know what a journey. What a journey. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=9071.18s)]
*  I mean, I just look at him like you would never imagine. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=9074.02s)]
*  Look at that guy. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=9077.140000000001s)]

*  No. And what you know, Tanner mentioned this to his [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=9079.900000000001s)]
*  when people first see him, they're like, oh, you know, he's got tattoos on his face. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=9082.54s)]
*  Tanner says, after you get to talk, he goes, [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=9087.02s)]
*  you don't even see the tattoos. Right. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=9089.02s)]

*  So like you get distracted by that at first. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=9098.42s)]
*  But when you talk to him and realize, you know, what a loving person he is, [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=9101.1s)]
*  you're like, I don't see anything. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBupGBFBvE&t=9105.02s)]
