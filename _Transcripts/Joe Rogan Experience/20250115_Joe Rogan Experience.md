# Joe Rogan Experience #2257 - Bryan Callen
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=0.0s)]
*  Showing by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=6.0s)]
*  My wife, I smoked my knees and I didn't brush my teeth. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=10.0s)]
*  I woke up the next morning and my wife said, your breath is four dimensional. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=16.0s)]
*  He didn't brush your teeth before you went to bed and he smoked a cigar? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=19.0s)]
*  Of course I didn't brush my teeth before I went to bed. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=24.0s)]
*  Give a fuck. You know what I mean? You're married, you're married. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=26.0s)]
*  She was like, I love you so much. Your breath is four dimensional. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=28.0s)]
*  You know these fires. I have two small children now. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=31.0s)]
*  Because what I want to do is, what you want to do is you want to get divorced and then you want to have, get married again to a woman who's 23 years younger and then have two more kids because that's good. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=35.0s)]
*  Definitely takes a lot of financial stress off your back. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=44.0s)]
*  Oh dude, there's no financial stress at all. It's great. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=48.0s)]
*  You know what, if I hustle until I'm 80 I'll be fine. Anyway. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=50.0s)]
*  It's going to be really awkward when I call you at 75. I just need help this month. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=53.0s)]
*  But anyway, so I fucking, I look at her and I go, she's like a girl from Jersey, like Irish Italian chick, no nonsense, you know, been working since she was 16. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=60.0s)]
*  And I go, you know, we had an evacuation order that they sent out by accident to people even down where I'm at. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=70.0s)]
*  Yeah, what was that? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=77.0s)]
*  It was some guy who fucked up because I don't know if you know this is going to be shocking. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=78.0s)]
*  Grab the table. LA's not run very well. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=83.0s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=86.0s)]
*  I know. Hold on. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=87.0s)]
*  What the fuck are you saying? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=88.0s)]
*  See, here's the thing. We have to worry about, I know. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=89.0s)]
*  Isn't the chief of fire department a lesbian? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=91.0s)]
*  Now hold on. Let's not turn this into, listen, here's the bottom line. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=93.0s)]
*  It's run amazingly. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=96.0s)]
*  It's not about infrastructure. Infrastructure's got to take- [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=97.0s)]
*  I won't sit here while you disparage the great people that are running Los Angeles. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=99.0s)]
*  Sir, infrastructure's got to take a backseat to climate change and social justice and homeless abatement, which hasn't worked. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=104.0s)]
*  See the lady who's responsible for filling the fire hydrants gets paid $750,000 a year. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=110.0s)]
*  Hey, your tax dollars going to good work there everybody. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=115.0s)]
*  That's a lot of money. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=118.0s)]
*  You think? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=119.0s)]
*  That's sitcom money. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=120.0s)]
*  You think? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=121.0s)]
*  That's like, I'm the star of a sitcom. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=122.0s)]
*  Oh dude. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=123.0s)]
*  It's star. But like you're the third person on a sitcom. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=124.0s)]
*  No, that's a high wage, sir. $750,000 for a city employer who's- [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=126.0s)]
*  For someone just like, fill that one. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=131.0s)]
*  How the aquifers today? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=134.0s)]
*  Get the water in that one. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=136.0s)]
*  You know what? We got to protect the Delta smelt. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=137.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=139.0s)]
*  Which, whatever the fuck that is. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=140.0s)]
*  So we got to- [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=141.0s)]
*  Well, Trump was talking about that on the podcast. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=142.0s)]
*  On the podcast I did with him, Trump was going on this long rampage about Los Angeles and the fires and how it all can be prevented and they could have plenty of water. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=145.0s)]
*  He explained the whole thing and he's right. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=156.0s)]
*  Here's my whole philosophy. You guys know, you know that we have a Tinder box. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=158.0s)]
*  And you can say that there are a lot of people that live there. The fires are always a potential. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=163.0s)]
*  If that's the case, then please make sure the fire hydrants- we've got to be able to figure that out. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=168.0s)]
*  You guys in LA, California came up with AI. I mean, the Silicon Valley was pretty innovative people. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=174.0s)]
*  Let's figure out a way to keep the fucking- [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=180.0s)]
*  Very different people. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=182.0s)]
*  They are very different people, sir. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=183.0s)]
*  That's like saying people in America are homeless and also Elon Musk. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=184.0s)]
*  Well, get some people down in government who are innovative like that. What the fuck are we doing? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=191.0s)]
*  They don't want to do that job. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=196.0s)]
*  Do you know the City Council of Los Angeles? Four of the members of the City Council are far left social democrats. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=197.0s)]
*  How about that? There's zero pushback on ideas. It's just all- [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=204.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's all an echo chamber. Well, I'm hoping now that this is a giant wake up call for these people. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=209.0s)]
*  I mean, there's no positivity that's going to come out of a horrific fire like that. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=214.0s)]
*  But at least it'll wake- because look, that area, you know, Adam Carolla was on someone's show talking about this. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=220.0s)]
*  And he said something that's like very- I think he was actually doing it himself. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=227.0s)]
*  Yeah, about permits? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=231.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, he was just saying that there's 80% of the people that live there are far left. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=232.0s)]
*  80% of the people that got their houses burned down from complete total incompetence and a lack of management. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=238.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=243.0s)]
*  Total incompetence. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=244.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=245.0s)]
*  And that's a giant wake up call when you realize, like, no, these fucking people, this is not the way to do it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=247.0s)]
*  Did you see that lady, the fire lady who's a part of this whole diversity thing? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=253.0s)]
*  They said, you're a woman firefighter. Can you carry my husband out of a burning building? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=258.0s)]
*  She was like, well, if your husband's in a burning building, he already made a mistake. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=263.0s)]
*  She's a big, old, sassy, fat, black lady. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=267.0s)]
*  Yeah, my favorite was that one of the women said, you want people to look like you? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=270.0s)]
*  Same lady. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=275.0s)]
*  And I'm like, hey, listen, hey, lady, when my house is on fire and I'm trying to get my kids out, I'm not going to be like, hey, can I get some people that look like me? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=276.0s)]
*  Because this doesn't make me feel safe. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=284.0s)]
*  I want them to look like Brian Shaw. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=286.0s)]
*  So what? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=288.0s)]
*  I want them to be covered through the fucking wall looking like juggernaut. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=289.0s)]
*  They give me white as a driven snow. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=291.0s)]
*  If they look like a white walker and they can get me out of that fucking fire, I'm in. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=293.0s)]
*  I want Brian Shaw. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=296.0s)]
*  I want him to be a giant dude who can carry people. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=297.0s)]
*  With a mustache that goes like this. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=299.0s)]
*  Yeah, fucking handlebar. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=301.0s)]
*  I love firemen. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=303.0s)]
*  I'm so gay that when I saw they came by, I saw some firemen and I didn't know what to do. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=304.0s)]
*  I wanted to say something like, go get them guys or something like that. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=309.0s)]
*  And I literally went like this. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=313.0s)]
*  I went, I saluted them. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=315.0s)]
*  I went, that's good. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=317.0s)]
*  It's a little embarrassing. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=319.0s)]
*  It's an acknowledgement. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=320.0s)]
*  Yeah, but my wife, my wife is so funny because my wife is very handy. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=321.0s)]
*  And I said, and we had an evacuation where I looked at her and I go, I got to go do Joe's podcast and then shoot my special at the mothership. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=324.0s)]
*  But I feel guilty about leaving you here. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=331.0s)]
*  And she goes, what are you going to do? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=334.0s)]
*  You can't change a tire. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=336.0s)]
*  I got this. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=338.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=339.0s)]
*  See you later. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=340.0s)]
*  So yeah, I don't know. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=341.0s)]
*  I would have felt weird about leaving them too. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=343.0s)]
*  Even though you're in a safe space. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=346.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're good for now. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=348.0s)]
*  This is the thing about L.A. that, you know, there's a viral clip that's going around now of a conversation that I had with Sam or L a while back. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=350.0s)]
*  And we were talking about when I was on Fear Factor, how this fireman told me that this was going to happen one day. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=359.0s)]
*  He said, it's just a matter of time. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=366.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=367.0s)]
*  With the right wind. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=368.0s)]
*  He's like, we won't be able to stop it. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=369.0s)]
*  Now that's gone viral. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=370.0s)]
*  And then the Trump thing went viral, too, because Trump was saying that they need to do something to change this. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=372.0s)]
*  They need to clean up the forest, get rid of all the dead wood. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=380.0s)]
*  Yeah. All these things can be done. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=383.0s)]
*  Get rid of all the brush, get rid of all the dead wood, open up that fucking water from the north to come down. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=385.0s)]
*  This idea that do you know that the whole center of California used to be a lake? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=391.0s)]
*  No. A giant lake? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=397.0s)]
*  No. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=398.0s)]
*  Bro, I found out about it about a year ago. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=399.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=401.0s)]
*  It's crazy. Young Jamie, wait till you see how big this fucking lake was. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=402.0s)]
*  And all of it, all of the is all meddling and fucking around by humans. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=407.0s)]
*  Did I ever tell you the conversation I had with Arnold Schwarzenegger? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=414.0s)]
*  I was with John Leggo's album. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=418.0s)]
*  Did he say screw your freedom? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=419.0s)]
*  No, he didn't say. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=421.0s)]

*  And everyone's driving and no one. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=699.0s)]
*  Everyone's got this like somber, like 50 mile an hour driving the entire right side of the highway for an hour. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=702.0s)]
*  Like what we were. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=709.0s)]

*  Yeah, we were filming off the five. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=712.0s)]
*  So we were like way up by, you know, like as you see me, you know, Bakersfield, Bakersfield, like that. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=714.0s)]
*  That's not the five or the ten, whatever the fuck it is. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=721.0s)]
*  We were we were pretty far away and it was a whole hour driving back where the whole right side of the highway was in flames. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=724.0s)]
*  I mean, completely engulfed like a Lord of the Rings movie where you're waiting for Sauron to come riding on an evil horse over the top of it. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=732.0s)]

*  And you see fire tornadoes, man. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=744.0s)]
*  The fire was fucking insane. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=747.0s)]
*  There's nothing you can do. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=749.0s)]
*  And it's flying through the air. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=750.0s)]
*  So you were your car's going to catch fire. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=751.0s)]
*  One of the things that happens is people get stuck on highways, cars catch fire and the fire and the winds just roll through the whole highway and everybody burns alive inside their cars. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=753.0s)]
*  Yeah, that happened. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=764.0s)]
*  What is it? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=765.0s)]

*  That's right. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=768.0s)]

*  Fine. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=772.0s)]
*  Oh, you know, I got to tell you the crazy thing about the Pacific Palisades was that eight years ago, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=773.0s)]
*  probably eight, maybe almost nine years ago, I looked at houses there with my my ex wife. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=780.0s)]
*  And we came so close to my house because it was it's such a beautiful place. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=785.0s)]
*  We didn't buy it because it was a little too expensive. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=791.0s)]
*  To be honest with you, it was like it was like, you know, just a little out of our price, you know, point. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=793.0s)]
*  But even like for a smaller house, that was expensive. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=797.0s)]
*  Right. But yeah, it's beautiful. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=800.0s)]
*  The last thing it's gorgeous. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=802.0s)]
*  The last thing you would ever think. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=804.0s)]
*  The last thing is that that house would burn down. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=805.0s)]
*  There was a fire has especially down like where Gelson's was or the whole town that do what I'm saying. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=810.0s)]
*  The town is gone. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=814.0s)]
*  You know, the only structure of the standing is that guy Caruso, that mayor, the guy who ran for mayor, narrowly lost to Karen Bass. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=815.0s)]
*  He built that mall out of fire retardant material. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=821.0s)]
*  And that's the only structures that pretty much downtown that are in the town of Calip Pacific Palisades. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=824.0s)]
*  Frank Grillo, our buddy. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=831.0s)]
*  His old house burned right to the ground. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=833.0s)]
*  Just done. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=835.0s)]
*  Just yeah. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=836.0s)]
*  Segura's house burnt to the ground. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=837.0s)]
*  Everybody's. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=838.0s)]
*  Didn't Mel Gibson's? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=839.0s)]
*  Yeah, Mel Gibson's. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=840.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=841.0s)]
*  Look at that, dude. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=842.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=843.0s)]
*  In a million years. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=844.0s)]
*  I'm telling you. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=845.0s)]
*  When you bought a house, nobody said anything about fire. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=846.0s)]
*  No one. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=849.0s)]
*  That's so. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=850.0s)]
*  And by the way, fire insurance in L.A. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=851.0s)]
*  Look at that one house. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=853.0s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=854.0s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=855.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=856.0s)]
*  What's that made out of? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=857.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=858.0s)]
*  The wind blew different directions. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=859.0s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=860.0s)]
*  It's got to be what the house is made of because that wind's blowing everywhere. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=862.0s)]
*  I don't think any house withstands that kind of fire. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=865.0s)]
*  I think. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=867.0s)]
*  Are you sure? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=868.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=869.0s)]
*  How do you know? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=870.0s)]
*  You a builder? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=871.0s)]
*  I am. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=872.0s)]
*  You're not a builder. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=873.0s)]
*  That's Brian Callahan. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=874.0s)]
*  Nah, I don't believe anything. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=875.0s)]
*  Can you make a house out of all concrete? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=876.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=877.0s)]
*  How's that one house? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=878.0s)]
*  Look at that one house. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=879.0s)]
*  That guy. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=880.0s)]
*  That's a question. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=881.0s)]
*  Fucking lotto, son. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=882.0s)]
*  No, it's wind. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=883.0s)]
*  Look at that, though. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=884.0s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=885.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=886.0s)]
*  You don't want to live there now. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=887.0s)]
*  If you're that house on the corner of the street, you're going to be living in a house [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=888.0s)]
*  that's going to be there now. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=889.0s)]
*  If you're that house on the corner and everything you look at as devastation. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=890.0s)]
*  The schools are gone. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=893.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=895.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=896.0s)]
*  The schools are gone. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=897.0s)]
*  Here's my other thing. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=898.0s)]
*  Here's the question I have. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=899.0s)]
*  OK, so you see that, right? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=900.0s)]
*  Now, who is going to rebuild there and who's going to finance it? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=901.0s)]
*  Are you going to get? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=905.0s)]
*  And then what kind of insurance are you going to be able to get? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=906.0s)]
*  So are you going to get insurance? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=908.0s)]
*  Is a bank going to finance that? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=910.0s)]
*  Would you want to rebuild there when you have to wait for a gas station for a grocery store? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=912.0s)]
*  There's nothing there. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=916.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=917.0s)]
*  So to me, I don't understand what I don't know what happens to that very valuable property. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=918.0s)]
*  I don't know what happens to the entire city now because people are looting like fucking [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=923.0s)]
*  crazy. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=928.0s)]
*  Gigantic groups of 100 men organized are pulling into neighborhoods that are being evacuated, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=929.0s)]
*  smashing through doors and pulling out TVs. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=935.0s)]
*  There's film footage of them. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=938.0s)]
*  There's also a bunch of people that have been caught setting fires. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=940.0s)]
*  I would. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=943.0s)]
*  I would. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=944.0s)]
*  I think they should be put to death. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=945.0s)]
*  One guy got caught setting fires and he had a U.N. debit card. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=946.0s)]
*  What? [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=950.0s)]
*  And he had a bunch. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=951.0s)]
*  I'll send it to Jamie. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=952.0s)]
*  The guy that got arrested for, I'll tell you which fire it was, but he got arrested. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=953.0s)]
*  He had a U.N. card. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=961.0s)]
*  I'll tell you exactly. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=964.0s)]
*  This kind of tragedy brings out the best in people and the worst in people. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=965.0s)]
*  The one thing it does in these communities, it brings all these people together. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=970.0s)]
*  My buddy started to cry because I was on the phone with him. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=974.0s)]
*  He lost everything. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=976.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=977.0s)]
*  And they're going to come stay with us. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=978.0s)]
*  And he said, when I was on the phone, these people dropped by and dropped off clothes [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=979.0s)]
*  for them. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=984.0s)]
*  And he's got a lot of money. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=985.0s)]
*  And he started to cry, man. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=986.0s)]
*  He was like, I can't tell you how many people have reached out. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=987.0s)]
*  He had five cell phones and a United Nations prepaid debit card. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=990.0s)]
*  I'm skeptical. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=995.0s)]
*  Is this conspiracy? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=997.0s)]
*  Of course you are. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=998.0s)]
*  You're always skeptical. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=999.0s)]
*  You son of a bitch. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1000.0s)]
*  I just don't want to be played. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1001.0s)]
*  Now, I think the New York Post did a thing about it. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1002.0s)]
*  You know what I mean, though? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1005.0s)]
*  I don't want to be played. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1006.0s)]
*  I don't know what's true anymore. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1007.0s)]
*  Maybe the New York Post didn't post that he had the debit card. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1008.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1011.0s)]
*  I don't know what's true anymore. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1012.0s)]
*  I'm getting this from the Texas Patriot Twitter account. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1013.0s)]
*  You see? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1015.0s)]
*  I told you. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1016.0s)]
*  I'm already like, I don't know. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1018.0s)]
*  They said that the New York Post has edited the info out of their article. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1020.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1024.0s)]
*  Why? Because it's not true. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1025.0s)]
*  Spreading rumors, Joe Rogan. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1026.0s)]
*  The Patriot account said that. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1027.0s)]
*  Oh, so then. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1028.0s)]
*  Look at the content below. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1029.0s)]
*  You got played. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1031.0s)]
*  Maybe not. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1032.0s)]
*  Maybe the New York Post are a bunch of pussies and a bunch of libtards. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1033.0s)]
*  The New York Post is very conservative. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1036.0s)]
*  They are kind of. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1041.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1042.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1043.0s)]
*  But I got to tell you, I do think this is how there's a sea change here. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1044.0s)]
*  You got to have people with opposing points of view that are pro-business, et cetera. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1050.0s)]
*  You have just all progressives in Sacramento and if you've got on the city council. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1054.0s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1059.0s)]
*  Until Angelina's wake up and start voting for intelligent people who are not, forget right or left. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1060.0s)]
*  How about practical people who understand infrastructure? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1065.0s)]
*  Like Rick Caruso. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1068.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1070.0s)]
*  Because the roads, I lived there, man. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1071.0s)]
*  The roads, the fucking power line, it's all from 1950s. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1073.0s)]
*  So it's all above ground, by the way, which is a real problem when the winds start blowing like that. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1077.0s)]
*  Correct. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1081.0s)]
*  Which is what happened in Maui as well. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1082.0s)]
*  If you don't believe in direct energy weapons. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1084.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1087.0s)]
*  I forgot about those from space. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1088.0s)]
*  I wonder who's controlling those. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1090.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1091.0s)]
*  The Rothschilds. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1092.0s)]
*  In Artica. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1093.0s)]
*  Yeah, the Rothschilds. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1094.0s)]
*  It's a cabal of Jews. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1095.0s)]
*  Yes, the invisible circle of Jews. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1097.0s)]
*  Every conspiracy theory always goes right back to that. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1099.0s)]
*  I'm just saying. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1102.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1103.0s)]
*  But the Mossad and the IDF and the influence on politics is pretty well established. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1104.0s)]
*  There's both things. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1112.0s)]
*  It's like, no, it's not that the Jews aren't the problem in the whole world. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1114.0s)]
*  No. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1118.0s)]
*  And when everything goes sideways, people always do start blaming the Jews. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1119.0s)]
*  Always. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1122.0s)]
*  Did we ever figure out who said that to us? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1123.0s)]
*  Was it Jordan? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1124.0s)]
*  What? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1125.0s)]
*  Was it Jordan who started talking? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1126.0s)]
*  Where's the Gads at? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1127.0s)]
*  Who started talking about it's one of the marks of a collapsing society when they start blaming everything on the Jews. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1128.0s)]
*  They blame the Black Plague on them. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1132.0s)]
*  They're like, you guys cover your wells. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1134.0s)]
*  My thing about that is whenever people go bad with the Jews, I'm always like, yeah. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1135.0s)]
*  Do you like Hollywood? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1138.0s)]
*  They invented that. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1140.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1141.0s)]
*  And improv. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1142.0s)]
*  And atheism. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1143.0s)]
*  Maybe that's not good. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1144.0s)]
*  But then also. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1145.0s)]
*  And stainless steel. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1146.0s)]
*  Did they invent stainless steel? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1147.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1148.0s)]
*  And virtual reality. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1149.0s)]
*  Well, listen, they have more. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1150.0s)]
*  Eastern European Jews have more Nobel prizes than I think any other ethnic group. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1151.0s)]
*  They're incredible. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1154.0s)]
*  Nobody wants to. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1155.0s)]
*  Incredible group of humans. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1156.0s)]
*  Let's just talk about art and everything else. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1157.0s)]
*  Einstein, Freud, it just goes on and on. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1159.0s)]
*  How many comics? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1161.0s)]
*  How many comics are Jews? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1162.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1163.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1164.0s)]
*  Some of the funniest people of all time. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1165.0s)]
*  One of the greatest of all time. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1166.0s)]
*  Lenny Bruce. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1167.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1168.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1169.0s)]
*  Groundbreakers. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1170.0s)]
*  The literal starter of this whole thing. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1171.0s)]
*  Groundbreakers. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1172.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1173.0s)]
*  So I always say that. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1174.0s)]
*  You're going to have very innovative. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1175.0s)]
*  Also, probably funding Epstein, but also probably running a gigantic blackmail ring where they [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1176.0s)]
*  have control over all the politicians in the country. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1181.0s)]
*  I might be doing that too if my survival depended on it. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1183.8s)]
*  Especially if you're smart and you're really good at chess. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1187.6s)]
*  I know what to do. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1190.52s)]
*  These guys like to fuck. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1191.52s)]
*  Let's set them up. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1192.52s)]
*  Let's set them up. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1193.52s)]
*  Have we ever, has there been any, what is it with the list? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1194.52s)]
*  What is my theory on the Jeffrey Epstein team? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1201.28s)]
*  See what you think. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1202.84s)]
*  Oh, I'd love to hear this. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1203.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1204.84s)]
*  I think that the people are so powerful that I know in certain cases the lawyers go to [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1205.84s)]
*  the lawyers of these powerful people. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1213.68s)]
*  And they go, how are you doing? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1215.96s)]
*  Now we got some evidence that your client, who's a family man and everything else, was [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1217.28s)]
*  banging girls on Jeffrey's Island. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1222.7s)]
*  Getting pissed on. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1225.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1226.8s)]
*  Whatever it is, bro. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1227.8s)]
*  Getting his nuts put in a sin. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1228.8s)]
*  Sure. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1230.28s)]
*  We got little kids of shit in his mouth. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1231.28s)]
*  Sure. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1233.0s)]
*  Hey, dude. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1234.0s)]
*  Hey, hold on. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1235.0s)]
*  What kind of podcast is this? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1236.0s)]
*  Why do you have to bring it back? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1237.0s)]
*  They're doing drugs. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1238.0s)]
*  They're doing drugs. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1239.0s)]
*  They're taking wild chances. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1240.0s)]
*  As I put this shit cigar in my mouth. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1241.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1242.0s)]
*  These are good cigars. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1243.0s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1244.0s)]
*  Delicious. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1245.0s)]
*  Shout out to Foundation Cigars. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1246.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's great. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1247.48s)]
*  But I think what happened was there was a lot of money and every one of those fucking people [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1249.6399999999999s)]
*  got paid off. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1255.76s)]
*  I think it just went away because there's money. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1256.92s)]
*  They came to these really rich people and they were like, what's your privacy worth? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1260.9599999999998s)]
*  What's your reputation worth? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1264.7199999999998s)]
*  How about 10 million? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1265.7199999999998s)]
*  How about 20? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1266.7199999999998s)]
*  Well, this is the whole suspicion as to why the guy who was the CEO of Victoria Secrets [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1267.7199999999998s)]
*  gave Jeffrey Epstein a fucking $60 million mansion in Manhattan. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1274.08s)]
*  And controlled this whole estate. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1278.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1279.8s)]
*  And then there was the other guy who was some big CEO who gave him $150 million and had [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1280.8s)]
*  to resign. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1286.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1287.3799999999999s)]
*  So a bunch of these guys resigned. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1288.38s)]
*  Money got passed around and unbelievably the client list has not been released. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1291.0600000000002s)]
*  I know. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1296.6200000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's been years. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1297.6200000000001s)]
*  He was very good at laundering money, I guess. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1298.6200000000001s)]
*  And he was also- [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1300.9s)]
*  Was he even though? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1301.9s)]
*  I don't know what he really did. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1302.9s)]
*  The person do I trust about those things is Eric Weinstein. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1304.9s)]
*  Another Jew. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1308.8200000000002s)]
*  Yes, Eric. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1309.8200000000002s)]
*  Another brilliant Jew. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1310.8200000000002s)]
*  I love Eric. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1311.8200000000002s)]
*  One of my favorite people. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1312.8200000000002s)]
*  He's amazing. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1313.8200000000002s)]
*  And I talked to him about it. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1315.26s)]
*  He actually met Jeffrey Epstein and he said, and Eric is just way too smart. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1316.26s)]
*  He's not a guy that you could fool. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1321.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1322.6s)]
*  He was like, this is a construct. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1323.6s)]
*  Right away. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1324.84s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1325.84s)]
*  He said this guy's a construct. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1326.84s)]
*  He said that he had a woman, like a 21 year old girl that was sitting on his lap and he [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1327.84s)]
*  kept kind of like nudging his knee up and down to make her tits bounce a little bit. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1333.84s)]
*  He kept doing that while he was talking to him. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1339.0s)]
*  He's like, what is this? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1340.48s)]
*  And he's like, also this guy does not know what he's talking about when it comes to finances. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1341.9s)]
*  Wow. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1345.3s)]
*  Eric's a legitimate genius. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1346.3s)]
*  Correct. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1348.54s)]
*  A mathematician. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1349.54s)]
*  You can't lie to him about stuff like that. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1350.54s)]
*  I will tell you his theory on what he thinks this whole thing is, this whole, it's a simulation [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1353.14s)]
*  or whatever. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1360.14s)]
*  You hear he's, cause you know, so Newton, there's Newtonian physics, right? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1361.14s)]
*  Which is this matter here and then there's quantum physics study of the electron that [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1365.5s)]
*  Einstein was the pioneer of and blah, blah, blah. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1369.04s)]
*  So Einstein was working on what's called a theory of everything, which was the bridge. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1371.6s)]
*  How do you, how do you, cause a lot of times the rules in this ether in Newtonian, in the [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1374.96s)]
*  world that we live in are different when it comes to gravity and light than they are on [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1380.16s)]
*  a quantum level. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1384.76s)]
*  So what is the bridge? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1386.0s)]
*  How do we bring them together? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1387.0s)]
*  How do we reconcile both realities? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1388.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1390.6s)]
*  So that's the theory of everything. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1391.6s)]
*  So Eric is obsessed with that and kind of worked on that. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1392.72s)]
*  Well, he made his own theory of everything. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1395.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1396.6999999999998s)]
*  So his idea is that maybe the singularity is already here and maybe we're already machines [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1397.6999999999998s)]
*  and we are, so watch this. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1403.82s)]
*  So we're already machines replicating better machines, better versions of ourselves. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1405.4599999999998s)]
*  And it's kind of an interesting cause it kind of full dovetails with Buddhism, right? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1410.58s)]
*  So watch this. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1414.5s)]
*  I'm going to do an experiment on you that a Buddhist Rinpoche will ask somebody. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1415.5s)]
*  Boom. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1418.58s)]
*  Should I get prepared? [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1419.58s)]
*  Get into a lotus position. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1420.58s)]
*  There it is. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1421.58s)]
*  There it is. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1422.58s)]
*  Dude, good breathing. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1423.58s)]
*  I'm ready. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1427.0s)]
*  Good breathing. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1428.0s)]
*  I'm watching this guy. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1429.0s)]
*  Too much Yang energy. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1430.0s)]
*  Bring your yin in. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1431.0s)]
*  I was watching this guy doing DMT breathing today on Instagram. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1432.0s)]
*  He was explaining how to spike your DMT and communicate with entities. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1434.4399999999998s)]
*  And he was saying how you compress your balls and your asshole and all your sex organs and [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1438.8799999999999s)]
*  then through your abdominals and you exhale all your breath. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1445.76s)]
*  And then you breathe like this. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1450.76s)]
*  And then you come and you get that DMT flow. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1458.98s)]
*  Oh, is that what you get? [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1461.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1462.62s)]
*  It doesn't work for me. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1463.62s)]
*  It's not working with one. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1464.62s)]
*  Did you have a boner when he was telling you this? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1465.62s)]
*  The thing is like most of these things take a long fucking time and I'm busy. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1466.62s)]
*  I'm busy, dude. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1471.02s)]
*  I'm busy and I'm easily distracted. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1472.02s)]
*  I have a lot of ADD. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1473.02s)]
*  I'll just lick a toad. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1474.5s)]
*  All right. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1475.86s)]
*  Well that's like my buddy. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1477.1s)]
*  My buddy did that shit. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1478.1s)]
*  He did the toad thing. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1479.52s)]
*  Oh, the toad thing is odd. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1480.52s)]
*  He called me up and he goes, everything's different now. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1481.52s)]
*  I'm like, all right, calm down. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1483.52s)]
*  But that's five methoxy. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1484.52s)]
*  That's five methoxy. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1485.52s)]
*  Have you done it? [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1486.52s)]
*  Methyltryptamine. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1487.52s)]
*  Yeah, allegedly. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1488.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1489.52s)]
*  The thing about Kundalini yoga and all these different ways where you can achieve those [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1490.52s)]
*  states like Terrence McKenna had a great line about that. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1495.56s)]
*  He's like one time the Buddha came to visit this town and this monk came to the Buddha [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1499.24s)]
*  and they said, I have practiced a city of levitation for 10 years and now I can walk [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1504.7800000000002s)]
*  on water. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1510.18s)]
*  And the Buddha says, yeah, but the fairies only a nickel. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1511.42s)]
*  And that was McKenna's conversation. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1516.92s)]
*  That was McKenna's take on why would you do this when you could just take psychedelics? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1518.8200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's so good. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1524.7s)]
*  You don't really have to fucking meditate for 10 years, homie. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1526.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1528.8600000000001s)]
*  You missed out on a lot of enlightenment while you're staring at a corner of the wall. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1529.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1532.5400000000002s)]
*  You hear those guys a lot. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1533.5400000000002s)]
*  I don't know why Zen masters will say I have nothing to teach you. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1535.44s)]
*  Because once you, the part of you, so the idea would be you can't improve yourself. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1539.52s)]
*  What? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1545.52s)]
*  Because the part of you that wants to improve yourself is the part that needs improving. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1546.52s)]
*  So until you get out of your own way and you realize that you, this construct called yourself [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1550.3999999999999s)]
*  is an imagined construct, you've invented this. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1558.28s)]
*  Sam Harrison, he studies the Vedanta, right? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1561.6999999999998s)]
*  So in his book, Spirituality Without Religion, he does this experiment, which the Buddhist [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1564.86s)]
*  will have you do. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1569.4199999999998s)]
*  They'll say, so you're watching me right now. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1571.02s)]
*  I'm talking. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1574.06s)]
*  Now, there's this guy named Joe Rogan. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1575.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1576.9399999999998s)]
*  And we know Joe Rogan's got this. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1577.9399999999998s)]
*  But for a second, try to locate where you really are. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1578.9399999999998s)]
*  In other words, where are you actually listening to me from? [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1583.4199999999998s)]
*  Where are you? [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1587.1399999999999s)]
*  Where is the seat of your attention? [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1588.34s)]
*  Are you behind your face? [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1590.26s)]
*  Are you here? [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1591.82s)]
*  And if you try to do that, it's kind of impossible to locate where you're hearing me from. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1592.86s)]
*  There's this sort of echo, this idea that you're not here. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1600.78s)]
*  This is a lot of mental jerking off. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1602.78s)]
*  I'm right here. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1604.5s)]
*  Sir. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1605.5s)]
*  I'm looking at you right here. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1606.5s)]
*  Sir. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1607.5s)]
*  I hear you. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1608.5s)]
*  You know how I know I hear you through my ears? [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1609.5s)]
*  Because if I plug this one up, it sounds different. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1610.5s)]
*  And if I plug both of them up, I don't hear you at all. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1611.5s)]
*  You're still attached. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1613.3s)]
*  I'm assuming the sound's coming in here. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1614.3s)]
*  I'm right here. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1616.18s)]
*  I'm talking to you. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1617.18s)]
*  You're still attached to your physical self, sir. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1618.18s)]
*  This is all like the children of rich kids who sit around pondering the universe. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1619.18s)]
*  Dude, this is Buddhism, man. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1624.72s)]
*  Come on. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1625.72s)]
*  You're not even a good student. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1626.72s)]
*  They take a backpack and they go on a trek and they stay in hostels because they're amazing. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1627.72s)]
*  I turned to the other member. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1632.8s)]
*  He's not ready yet. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1634.76s)]
*  He's not ready. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1636.76s)]
*  We have to break him down further. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1638.48s)]
*  No, there's something to that, all bullshit aside. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1639.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1642.8s)]
*  There's something to where are you. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1643.8s)]
*  It's a weird exercise. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1644.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1645.8s)]
*  The idea would be you can observe your brain so you can observe your thoughts. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1647.4199999999998s)]
*  You can observe your body and you can observe your emotions. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1650.74s)]
*  You can actually step outside and watch that stuff. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1653.74s)]
*  And they get really good at that. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1656.46s)]
*  They get really good at realizing that you're none of those things. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1657.78s)]
*  You might be the observer, whoever that is or whatever that is. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1661.4199999999998s)]
*  And that's kind of where they, it's kind of an interesting exercise. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1664.6s)]
*  That's why you see these dudes, that guy, that monk who set himself on fire in 1963. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1667.82s)]
*  Oh, the Vietnam photo. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1673.3799999999999s)]
*  Now, David Halboshtan from the New York Times said he didn't make a sound. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1675.48s)]
*  They watched him and he literally, they heard the air leave his lungs and he just fell over. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1680.16s)]
*  So did the lady on the subway. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1685.24s)]
*  She didn't make a sound either. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1686.24s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1687.24s)]
*  Well, she was also probably asleep or something. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1688.24s)]
*  She was until she was lit on fire. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1690.1200000000001s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1691.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1692.6000000000001s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1693.6000000000001s)]
*  But the idea would be- [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1694.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I've never seen anybody- [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1695.6000000000001s)]
*  He never moved. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1696.6000000000001s)]
*  Burning, covered, engulfed in flames. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1697.6000000000001s)]
*  He might not be able to talk. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1698.6000000000001s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1699.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but he also didn't move so he stayed there. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1700.6000000000001s)]
*  Oh no, it was an incredible display of will. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1702.0800000000002s)]
*  He left his body. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1704.22s)]
*  He was watching himself. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1705.22s)]
*  That would be the idea behind, that's what they would say. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1706.22s)]

*  It's not their fault. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1948.74s)]
*  They had a child in 1967. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1950.06s)]
*  That's right. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1952.1s)]
*  And everybody was retarded back then. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1953.1599999999999s)]
*  And their parents went through the fucking depression. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1955.1s)]
*  So everybody was just, it was a vile time with so many different aspects of our society [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1957.8999999999999s)]
*  with violence and crime. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1965.96s)]
*  And it was, you know, no one knew what the fuck was going on. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1970.0s)]
*  They had just killed Kennedy. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1973.96s)]
*  It was like, it wasn't a time for rash. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1975.96s)]
*  World War II was fresh, true destruction. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1978.48s)]
*  Vietnam was ongoing. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1981.28s)]
*  So it was a time of great confusion. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1983.48s)]
*  And I don't think you could ever compare. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1987.12s)]
*  It's like, we go back and we think about things that happened in the year 1200. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1989.12s)]
*  Like, oh, the barbaric conquests of cities and sacking of countries by the Mongols and [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=1995.78s)]
*  all this crazy stuff. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2004.22s)]
*  It's a different time. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2006.06s)]
*  It's a different time. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2007.06s)]
*  There's different people in a different time. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2008.06s)]
*  Our parents grew up in a different time. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2010.18s)]
*  We are growing up in the most strange time because this is like coming out of this barbaric [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2012.22s)]
*  sort of primal history and recognizing in some strange way that we're more connected [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2019.32s)]
*  than ever before. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2026.2s)]
*  And the electronics are bringing us connected, but also disconnecting us at the same time. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2027.8s)]
*  So this is bizarre struggle for like inter-human communication and personal communication and [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2033.6s)]
*  like learning how to like exchange ideas with people and talk to people in a civil way while [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2038.6399999999999s)]

*  of some of the key tenants of the left and the right, where the left is all for a war. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2059.3s)]
*  The left is for censorship. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2065.14s)]

*  Well listen man, and it's also a nice lesson to all those nerds out there that think they [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2292.2s)]
*  can never be a beast. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2294.96s)]
*  It's not true. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2296.82s)]
*  It's not true. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2298.36s)]
*  You don't have to hate people that are like physically competent and formidable. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2299.36s)]
*  Come join the party. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2304.16s)]
*  You can be one of them. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2305.32s)]
*  I always bring up Mikey Musumichi just because he's awesome and he's a brilliant guy who [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2307.0s)]
*  wears his thick glasses, always smiling, and he can fucking kill everybody in the room. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2311.5600000000004s)]
*  Like Zuckerberg's on his way to becoming that. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2316.28s)]
*  He was, if you go back just a few years ago, he was a nerdy guy. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2319.1200000000003s)]
*  He was really smart but not really physical. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2323.6400000000003s)]
*  He spent his whole life up here, now he's down here. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2326.1200000000003s)]
*  He's talking about it. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2328.92s)]
*  He was talking about it on the podcast yesterday. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2329.92s)]
*  He loves training because it gives him a chance to express this side that has been demonized [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2331.86s)]
*  in our culture. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2337.6400000000003s)]
*  His voice sounds different even. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2338.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, he's becoming a man. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2340.6400000000003s)]
*  Well fucking bro. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2342.84s)]
*  Men are raised by women in our schools and stuff. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2344.6s)]
*  Because of this, probably in the past 30 years, masculinity was always considered, they were [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2349.36s)]
*  taught it's a liability. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2354.6s)]
*  It's also the corporate environments. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2355.6s)]
*  Your aggression, your competitiveness, all that stuff. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2356.6s)]
*  Corporate environments, which have really put the brakes on masculine behavior. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2358.6s)]
*  We talked about that yesterday too. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2363.06s)]
*  That's actually in some ways a good thing because it gives women this opportunity to [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2364.94s)]
*  excel as well. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2367.94s)]
*  They shouldn't have to become a man. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2369.2799999999997s)]
*  They shouldn't have that sexist perspective imposed upon them. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2372.7799999999997s)]
*  But it's like everything else. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2378.1s)]
*  It's like an overcorrection. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2379.1s)]
*  You have things go completely this way and then they come back. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2381.46s)]
*  Like woke. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2384.5s)]
*  Like the woke ideology. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2385.5s)]
*  It went so far right or so far left, now it's kind of swinging back. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2387.4s)]
*  The woke ideology had a major problem, which was it was reductive. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2390.92s)]
*  It would reduce a complicated world to a binary world, which is ironic by the way. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2395.08s)]
*  But it would sort of say, I can solve all this. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2402.44s)]
*  There are oppressors and oppressed. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2406.12s)]
*  There's power and powerless. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2407.8s)]
*  Black and white. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2410.26s)]
*  Also there's no forgiveness. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2411.26s)]
*  Zero forgiveness. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2412.26s)]
*  Zero forgiveness. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2413.26s)]
*  Don't apologize. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2414.26s)]
*  It will really crucify you. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2415.4s)]
*  And you can't, there's no retribution. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2416.4s)]
*  There's no way to come back. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2419.4s)]
*  But my 13 year old son, you can see these kids now at 13. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2420.4s)]
*  Don't start talking to him about this shit because these kids are like, they've already [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2425.0s)]
*  been, they figured it out at 13. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2428.96s)]
*  I'm telling you, my son was like, I don't feel, I don't like this shit. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2430.6800000000003s)]
*  I want to do Jiu Jitsu and wrestle all the time. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2433.1200000000003s)]
*  Fuck off. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2434.92s)]
*  Also podcasts. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2435.92s)]
*  Correct. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2436.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2437.92s)]
*  Correct. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2438.92s)]
*  They get to hear actual men who've made it through the maze and aren't a bitch. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2439.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2443.5600000000004s)]
*  Hey, wait a minute. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2444.58s)]
*  That guy seems really nice and having fun. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2445.58s)]
*  And he's an actual man. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2447.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2448.62s)]
*  Like there's real men out there. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2449.62s)]
*  He does shit that's fun too. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2450.62s)]
*  He's good at stuff. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2451.62s)]
*  Good at stuff. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2452.62s)]
*  Like has a good time. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2453.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2454.62s)]
*  That's the point. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2455.62s)]
*  Stop crying all the time. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2456.62s)]
*  Why are we fucking... [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2457.62s)]
*  Oversharing? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2458.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2459.62s)]
*  Why are we promoting and prompting up people who fucking cry all the time? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2460.62s)]
*  Listen, I cry. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2462.9s)]
*  I cry. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2463.9s)]
*  I cry if I'm happy. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2464.9s)]
*  I cry if I'm sad. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2465.9s)]
*  I cry when I think about my dogs that have died. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2466.9s)]
*  I have a whole joke about that. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2469.06s)]
*  It's like, there are a couple of things. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2470.22s)]
*  My whole joke is this. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2472.18s)]
*  I can't call my friends. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2474.0s)]
*  I had this joke. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2475.2400000000002s)]
*  I was like, if I call my friends and I'm like, I'm sad, my friends gonna call me. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2476.2400000000002s)]
*  You got the wrong number, pussy. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2479.8s)]
*  It's like Joe Rogan, that's a mean way to talk to me. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2481.8s)]
*  But it's true. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2484.2000000000003s)]
*  I remember one time I called you. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2485.2000000000003s)]
*  This is fucking great. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2486.2000000000003s)]
*  I called you and I remember my audition went bad and it was like the third... [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2487.2000000000003s)]
*  I would get right there. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2491.5600000000004s)]
*  Back then, remember, if you got a TV show, your money problems were gone for a while. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2493.6000000000004s)]
*  All I thought about was I get to drink great wine and buy a fucking house and take a minute. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2498.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2502.44s)]
*  I fucking called you and I go like this. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2504.1s)]
*  I go, fuck dude, I don't know. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2506.38s)]
*  I was good. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2507.94s)]
*  He goes, you can't be good. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2508.94s)]
*  You gotta be great. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2509.94s)]
*  I go, I know, I know. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2510.94s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2511.94s)]
*  I just can't. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2512.94s)]
*  I can't figure it out. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2513.94s)]
*  I was bummed. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2514.94s)]
*  I was basically saying I'm sad and you fucking go. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2515.94s)]
*  You go, yeah. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2518.9s)]
*  He goes, what do you want to do tonight? [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2519.9s)]
*  I go, I don't know. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2520.9s)]
*  I just live down. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2521.9s)]
*  He goes, hey, you'll be all right. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2522.9s)]
*  Let's just fucking go out and eat and do something. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2523.9s)]
*  You'll figure it out. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2526.3s)]
*  Fucking relax. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2527.3s)]
*  Don't get all mopey about this shit. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2528.3s)]
*  I was like, okay. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2530.1s)]
*  That was it. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2531.1s)]
*  A lot of people get mopey, man. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2532.1s)]
*  I had a lot of friends that got super mopey when they didn't get things. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2533.7599999999998s)]
*  So think about the audition process. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2536.6s)]
*  I've always talked about this. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2539.04s)]
*  This is a part of the whole problem with the entire psychology of Los Angeles because a [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2540.36s)]
*  giant percentage of people at least had some way in the back of their head some sort of [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2544.6s)]
*  an aspiration to try to get famous. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2549.88s)]
*  So you move there. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2552.1s)]
*  You have already an exorbitant need for attention because there's some hole in your past that [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2553.44s)]
*  you're trying to fill up with, I want to be a star. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2561.04s)]
*  And then you're going somewhere. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2565.02s)]
*  So you have this need for acceptance and then you're going somewhere where people judge [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2566.98s)]
*  you and most of the time judge you poorly. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2570.7799999999997s)]
*  Most of the time they don't like you. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2574.58s)]
*  So most things you audition for you don't get. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2576.1s)]
*  And if you get one, oh my God, now I'm in. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2578.22s)]
*  And so now these manipulative people that are in charge of casting you, they can essentially [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2580.9s)]
*  mold your personality based on what they want. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2588.36s)]
*  If they want a left-wing personality, if they want you to be pro-Kamala and we need a black [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2591.8s)]
*  woman president, they want you to say all this. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2597.08s)]
*  I took my eighth booster this morning. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2599.84s)]
*  Like I believe in science. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2601.84s)]
*  Love is love. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2603.76s)]
*  They'll turn you into that fucking thing. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2604.76s)]
*  They'll turn you into that thing because the entire place is about the golden ticket. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2607.48s)]
*  Everybody wants the golden ticket. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2613.2400000000002s)]
*  I was so lucky because I never had any aspirations about acting. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2615.54s)]
*  I had zero. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2621.54s)]
*  I remember you called me. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2622.54s)]
*  Remember you called me. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2624.1s)]
*  But let me just tell you the whole story behind it. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2625.1s)]
*  When MTV, when I did the half hour comedy hour and then I got a development deal to [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2627.18s)]
*  do a sitcom, I had never taken a single acting class and all of a sudden I have this development [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2631.34s)]
*  deal. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2635.9s)]
*  I'm over there and when the show that I was on got canceled, I was ready to go back to [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2636.66s)]
*  New York to be a comic again. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2641.22s)]
*  I was like fuck this place. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2642.46s)]
*  I had a lease. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2645.04s)]
*  I had a lease on an apartment for a year. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2646.04s)]
*  I'm like fuck. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2648.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2649.04s)]
*  I was stuck in this. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2650.04s)]
*  I couldn't afford to not be in this because now I wasn't getting $20,000 a week anymore. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2651.04s)]
*  Whatever the fuck I was doing. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2656.56s)]
*  I was like holy shit. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2657.56s)]
*  I was ready to leave. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2658.56s)]
*  So then I get another development deal and then I audition for the second show I ever [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2660.12s)]
*  do. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2665.08s)]
*  I only had two auditions ever. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2666.08s)]
*  Hardball and News Radio. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2668.6800000000003s)]
*  And I'm on two TV shows. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2670.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm like this is crazy. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2671.2400000000002s)]
*  And so I never went through that whole thing. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2673.52s)]
*  I never went through that whole this could change my life. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2676.54s)]
*  My life was already changed. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2678.9s)]
*  None of it made any sense to me. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2681.02s)]
*  I was making all this money. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2682.78s)]
*  I had a Toyota Supra Turbo. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2684.46s)]
*  I was like this is crazy. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2686.7s)]
*  I remember you bought that Acura, the new Acura. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2687.7s)]
*  The NSX. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2689.7s)]
*  Yeah dude. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2690.7s)]
*  I loved it. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2691.7s)]
*  Used to pick me up in that shit. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2692.7s)]
*  It was like a little jet fighter car. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2693.7s)]
*  I loved it. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2695.22s)]
*  But it was just like for me it was all gravy. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2696.22s)]
*  So I was watching everybody scramble for this thing and I was examining the psychology of [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2698.62s)]
*  it and how it affects everything because when people didn't get auditions, when they went [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2702.92s)]
*  on auditions and you went out to dinner with them at night, they were so depressed. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2707.28s)]
*  That would be me. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2710.48s)]
*  Oh you all the time. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2711.48s)]
*  Years. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2712.48s)]
*  You all the time. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2713.48s)]
*  You wanted it so bad. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2714.48s)]
*  I remember we were at the comic store one night. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2715.48s)]
*  Because I didn't think there was any other options. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2716.48s)]
*  And I remember telling you like why don't you just do stand up? [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2717.48s)]
*  Why don't you just throw yourself in a stand up? [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2720.56s)]
*  Like you're so funny dude. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2722.56s)]
*  You're so good on stage. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2724.04s)]
*  But when you get up there sometimes you're just like I feel like you're auditioning for [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2725.04s)]
*  a show. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2728.6s)]
*  That's what I felt like you were doing when you were doing stand up. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2729.6s)]
*  You didn't want to be crazy. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2731.74s)]
*  But then off stage you would say silly things. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2732.98s)]
*  You'd be like much more vulnerable and ridiculous. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2736.62s)]
*  And that was the funny Brian count. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2739.8599999999997s)]
*  Like just throw yourself into this thing. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2741.66s)]
*  You remember when I was doing that I finally got my own show. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2743.4199999999996s)]
*  I'm doing those shows. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2746.02s)]
*  I was like I fucking dude I don't like this. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2747.02s)]
*  I want to do stand up now. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2750.4199999999996s)]
*  Now I told you the cool thing about being 57. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2752.3399999999997s)]
*  I'm enjoying stand up more now than I ever have. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2754.7799999999997s)]
*  Well you're smarter now. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2758.18s)]
*  And Dom Ireris said this to me years ago. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2759.74s)]
*  He was like Joe, you know he was like in his 60s at the time. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2761.28s)]
*  He was like Joe I've never been sharper than ever. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2764.0400000000004s)]
*  You just keep doing it and you keep getting better. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2766.0s)]
*  We're so lucky we're comedy. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2768.0800000000004s)]
*  We're so lucky. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2769.6400000000003s)]
*  And he was. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2770.6400000000003s)]
*  He was better in his 60s than he was in his. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2771.6400000000003s)]
*  He was always great. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2774.2000000000003s)]
*  He's always. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2775.2000000000003s)]
*  Hilarious. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2776.2000000000003s)]
*  I paid to see Dom Ireris before I ever did stand up comedy. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2777.2000000000003s)]
*  Dom is the best. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2779.92s)]
*  So did I. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2780.92s)]
*  So did I. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2781.92s)]
*  Did you? [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2782.92s)]
*  I was in college. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2783.92s)]
*  And I was at the improv in New York. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2784.92s)]
*  And my father took me to. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2787.6000000000004s)]
*  We sat there and watched Dom Ireris. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2788.92s)]
*  I remember that's why when I come off stage at the laugh factory. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2790.78s)]
*  And I was still a little in awe of Dom. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2794.46s)]
*  And Dom goes, right. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2796.6200000000003s)]
*  Come over here. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2797.6200000000003s)]
*  And I was like oh maybe he's going to give me some pointers you know. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2798.6200000000003s)]
*  And I go over there. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2801.7400000000002s)]
*  I go. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2802.7400000000002s)]
*  He goes you know what I love about your act. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2803.7400000000002s)]
*  I go what? [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2804.7400000000002s)]
*  And he goes you don't go for the laughs. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2805.7400000000002s)]
*  I was like you motherfucker. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2807.7400000000002s)]
*  Dom is the best at that. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2808.7400000000002s)]
*  The subtle disc. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2809.7400000000002s)]
*  The comedy disc. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2810.7400000000002s)]
*  I became friends with Dom. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2811.7400000000002s)]
*  Well I think I'd actually done an open mic night or two before I ever did stand up comedy. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2812.7400000000002s)]
*  I was like you motherfucker. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2813.7400000000002s)]
*  I was like you motherfucker. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2814.7400000000002s)]
*  I was like you motherfucker. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2815.7400000000002s)]
*  I was like you motherfucker. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2816.7400000000002s)]
*  I was like you motherfucker. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2817.7400000000002s)]
*  I was like you motherfucker. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2818.7400000000002s)]
*  Okay, so I started acting in the year before or two before I met him. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2820.62s)]
*  But then I paid to see him rather. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2821.62s)]
*  But then, not that long afterwards. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2824.7599999999998s)]
*  So this is like four years later like 92. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2827.2s)]
*  I was working with him in Montreal. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2832.12s)]
*  We did the. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2835.52s)]
*  That's intimidating. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2837.4799999999996s)]
*  Yeah it wasn't though. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2838.4799999999996s)]
*  He was super cool. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2839.6s)]
*  Yep. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2840.6s)]
*  Maybe it was a year after. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2841.6s)]
*  He's a real comic man. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2842.6s)]
*  Real comic. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2843.6s)]
*  So maybe it was 93. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2844.6s)]
*  So maybe it was like five years later. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2845.6s)]
*  So I'm real raw in comedy. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2847.04s)]
*  I had my feet under me at that point time where I had some material that could kill like I wasn't a really good comic [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2848.48s)]
*  but I had a few jokes, especially sex jokes that were bangers they were bangers and [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2854.3s)]
*  So we did Montreal together and then I was in Amsterdam billiards [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2860.38s)]
*  This is in my almost became a professional pool player stage [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2864.76s)]
*  Like if if pool was a real career like golf, I would have become a pool player. I just loved it [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2868.4s)]
*  I loved the pool. You're lucky you didn't get into golf dude. I'm so lucky. I'm terrified [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2874.54s)]
*  But I love the the pool players. I love the this the hang they were just so different [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2878.52s)]
*  They were outcasts and they were loose and fun and we said ridiculous shit to each other and everybody was laughing all the time [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2885.52s)]
*  It was always fun [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2892.12s)]
*  and I saw us playing pool every night and so I had a gig and [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2893.68s)]
*  before the gig I think or maybe after the gig I went to Amsterdam and [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2900.12s)]
*  Don Marrera pulls up and he's got his own cue and I was like Dom you play pool [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2905.36s)]
*  He's like, yeah you play pool. I go I fucking love pool. I go let's play some pool and he was good [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2910.12s)]
*  We're playing straight pool [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2915.88s)]
*  Just like the type of pool they played in the movie The Hustler. It's very rarely played in America anymore [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2918.0s)]
*  But it's an amazing game [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2922.72s)]
*  you play with a stack of 15 balls and [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2924.0s)]
*  You knock off one the first break is like a safe break and everybody moves balls around till someone makes a mistake and leaves [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2926.68s)]
*  an opening and that guy smashes into the balls and then you run as many balls you can in order so it's called 14 and [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2932.92s)]
*  So it doesn't matter if it's solid. You leave 14 balls on the table and [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2938.7200000000003s)]
*  the one ball like you leave a break ball and then you wrap the other 14 and so you shoot the break ball in the [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2943.08s)]
*  Idea is to collide your cue ball into the stack and keep running [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2950.36s)]
*  So let me give a shout out to Jason Shaw because Jason Shaw who's one of the best pool players on earth [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2953.88s)]
*  One of the greatest of all time he just broke the world record in straight pool this week [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2959.12s)]
*  And I think I think he ran [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2965.04s)]
*  839 balls [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2968.7200000000003s)]
*  Jason with a wide Jay [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2970.52s)]
*  839 in a row fuck. Yeah, he's trying to get to a thousand [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2974.0s)]
*  That's insane. So he got 832 832. So the record before was set by Willie Moscone in [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2978.88s)]
*  Like the 60s and it was on an 8-foot table with big pockets that was like 500 and something balls [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2985.3199999999997s)]
*  So he beat that he ran [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2991.12s)]
*  714 balls [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2994.8399999999997s)]
*  So that was the previous world record [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2996.08s)]
*  He also owned and then he just ran 832 balls when I tell you like the [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=2998.08s)]
*  Concentration involved in doing that because you're talking about hours of play [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3003.92s)]
*  I mean, I don't know how many racks of 15 balls is 832 [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3008.2s)]
*  Someone do the math I think when you do I think when you get that good at anything you learn about you learn everything about life [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3012.84s)]
*  Well, he's a wizard and about yourself. He is a wizard. Yeah, but you but I'm saying when you master something like that [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3019.1200000000003s)]
*  I'm not saying your marriage is gonna be great. I'm saying when you master something like that [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3024.36s)]
*  It's a it's a very good way to really get to know yourself. Here's how great professional pool is right now [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3027.96s)]
*  He doesn't even win most tournaments [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3033.6000000000004s)]
*  That's yep. Yeah, is there a nationality he can dominate? [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3036.84s)]
*  No [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3041.4s)]
*  Filipinos are among the highest level on earth [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3042.52s)]
*  why do you know well because the GIs went there in the 1950s and they brought pool and [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3046.58s)]
*  Filipinos learned how to play pool in very tough conditions because it's very humid over there [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3052.56s)]
*  so humidity affects the tablecloth and [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3057.88s)]
*  The moisture in the tablecloth slows down the role of the balls and so you could take two approaches to that you could either [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3061.4s)]
*  Hit the balls hard which is like the American way to do it or the Filipinos learn to use the entire weight of the cue [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3070.56s)]
*  And have an elegant almost like artistic way of playing they have the most [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3078.36s)]
*  Hit yes, they have the most beautiful strokes, especially at the time [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3084.2799999999997s)]
*  So there was a guy who came over in the 1970s and his name was Efrain Reyes and he came over under the the nom de [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3088.08s)]
*  Cesar Morales and he was this Filipino kid changed to a different Spanish name [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3096.76s)]
*  Yeah, well he went from Filipino to Mexican [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3101.32s)]
*  Yeah, because everybody would have known him right if they had ever gone to the Philippines because in the Philippines [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3104.32s)]
*  he was already robbing everybody and like a legitimate wizard a chess genius and [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3109.5200000000004s)]
*  unbelievable widely considered if not the greatest of all time one of the [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3114.92s)]
*  You know, it's like MMA like is it Khabib is it Mighty Mouse is it John Jones? [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3120.08s)]
*  It's one of those deals one of the absolute greatest pool players of all time [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3124.28s)]
*  And then from Efrain Reyes came all these other this Filipino invasion where they were just [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3127.7599999999998s)]
*  dominating pool like and big money like giant money games half a million dollar matches [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3135.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah a ton of them when you when you have a match how many games you playing it depends [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3142.24s)]
*  Some of these guys will play like a race to 120 whoever wins 120 games and they'll play it over three days [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3147.4s)]
*  They'll do it for a hundred thousand dollars. Wait a race 120 games 120 games of nine ball. That's a lot [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3153.2400000000002s)]
*  It's a lot, but that's a really gonna find out who's the better player [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3158.92s)]
*  So like how long would that take? If you and I play ten games and maybe I'm a little better than you [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3163.1200000000003s)]
*  You could win those ten games [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3168.2000000000003s)]
*  You could get on a roll [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3169.88s)]
*  You could get a lot of rolls of the balls where I get safe a few times or I scratch on the break a couple of [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3171.6800000000003s)]
*  Times and so that's two more games that you probably maybe wouldn't have won if we were playing [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3176.76s)]
*  You know even and you could win a race to ten like the odds of me winning a race to ten if we were both [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3180.84s)]
*  If I was just slightly better than you it'd be like, you know [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3187.1600000000003s)]
*  Maybe 60 40 or 55 45 something like that [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3191.48s)]
*  Yeah, but when you get to a race to 120 then your odds dwindle [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3195.8s)]
*  Well, that's a better player always that becomes a physical game. Yes. Now you're actually an athlete. Yes [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3200.6000000000004s)]
*  Well sort of it's concentration for sure. Yeah, but your body can't break down [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3206.04s)]
*  Your body can't break down those get the best guys are all fit [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3211.0s)]
*  You never get really big fat so's now that can handle there used to be what I love about the hustler [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3214.04s)]
*  One of the great greatest movies ever with Paul Newman is when Jackie [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3219.92s)]
*  What the fuck's his name? Please and Jackie Gleason said it really came down the character [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3225.16s)]
*  He he washed his hands washed his face and drew a blank and came back [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3230.44s)]
*  Yeah, that was a really interesting lesson for me as a young man guys really do that too. They clear their mind [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3234.7599999999998s)]
*  They go in the bathroom. They throw cold water on their face. They wash their hands. They change their clothes [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3239.56s)]
*  This needs something to break themselves out of it. It's a mental game [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3244.56s)]
*  Like, you know, Jeremy Jones who's another all-time great won the US Open good friend of mine. We were talking about it [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3247.48s)]
*  He's like I think it's the most mental game in the world because it's not just about thinking about what happens [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3254.0s)]
*  It's about execution under pressure [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3259.6s)]
*  And then it's also about you're controlling the rotation of a ball like you if you hit it this hard it goes that [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3261.56s)]
*  This hard it goes that far and that's what you want [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3269.68s)]
*  You want the difference you an inch and an inch and a half [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3272.56s)]
*  It's crazy everything everything at the highest level at the highest is those micro adjustments [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3274.72s)]
*  There's a reason why Magnus Carlson wins all those chess tournaments, right? [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3279.16s)]
*  They say when when Rafa Nadal is one of the greatest tennis players ever when he won Wimbledon [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3282.9199999999996s)]
*  They're all clapping he comes in and the legend goes I don't know if it's true, but I heard it makes sense [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3288.16s)]
*  He he's coming in he's going like this. He goes. I think my grip. I think I want to he's not even paying attention [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3292.48s)]
*  He's talking his coach. I feel like my grip should be just a little bit like that or still making micro adjustments [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3297.56s)]
*  You just want you have to yeah, that's what makes them so good in the first place [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3303.3199999999997s)]
*  I know guys who change their grip all the time in their queue [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3306.64s)]
*  Like sometimes they'll grab it like this with two fingers and then they change it and then they turn their wrist forward and they'll play [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3308.92s)]
*  For a year with their wrist forward. Oh guys [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3315.1s)]
*  Stand-up like I look so I'm gonna shoot the special and I'm gonna throw it away and I got to start again [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3318.24s)]
*  Yeah, and just because I've done five specials doesn't mean it's gonna be easier [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3322.52s)]
*  It's gonna be a motherfucker because I've got to come up with I got to make sure I don't repeat myself [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3326.3199999999997s)]
*  I got to make sure I'm not [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3329.64s)]
*  You got some something say I took a whole month off of stand-up after I did my special because I didn't have anything to [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3332.7599999999998s)]
*  Say you have to I'm like I got drained doing that thing especially doing it live. Yes, this is so draining [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3339.2799999999997s)]
*  And then I was like, let me like think about what I want to talk about afterwards like and then do you have any ideas now? [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3345.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I've got like 25 minutes now. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's good stuff. Like it's fun [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3351.4s)]

*  Even though you have very interesting people. No, I don't know oddly enough at all the things in my life [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3362.6s)]
*  This is the one thing that I I kind of net [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3367.08s)]
*  Well, first of all, I choose who goes on it, right? So I'm always looking forward to talking to those people [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3369.5s)]
*  Yeah, but I love talking to people man. I [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3373.88s)]
*  Like it like that's like the whole like moody loner thing. I don't get it. Like people to me are awesome. They're interesting [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3378.12s)]
*  I like being inspired. I like being intrigued. I like trying to think about problem solvers on this podcast [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3385.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah, you know, oh, yeah. Well, I've definitely gotten a [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3390.96s)]
*  Unexpected education. Yeah, you know if you go back and listen to me in 2009 when I started this thing [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3394.6s)]
*  I was a retard we all were yeah [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3399.1600000000003s)]
*  I think what is interesting is we would I'd have these opinions and I'd state these truths and then like somebody would Google it [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3400.84s)]
*  And be like hey, hey, dude. No, it's like I had this hilarious [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3407.8s)]

*  I mean what you're saying is just not true when it comes to how you raise cows and there was a thousand things [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3431.6s)]
*  Of course, I had no idea. That's the biggest liability [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3436.2799999999997s)]
*  I think in a lot of ways, you know, you should talk to you should have Will Harris on your show [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3438.08s)]
*  Who's that? Well, Will Harris runs [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3442.3999999999996s)]
*  this amazing farm in Georgia where it started out as [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3445.52s)]
*  A industrial farm that his family owned and he converted it to regenerative agriculture over 20 years [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3450.96s)]
*  And it took him forever to do it. What's the name of the farm again? [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3457.2s)]
*  Jamie white oak pastures and then there's Joel Salatin who's a similar guy who [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3460.04s)]
*  I think he was they were talking about him having something to do with farming in the Trump administration [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3466.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't know if that's come to pass [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3472.7599999999998s)]
*  But if it does I really do hope that he'll be involved because he's another brilliant guy who? [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3474.3999999999996s)]
*  Runs a regenerative farm and the farming is no joke [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3480.3199999999997s)]
*  What they do is essentially their type of farming is recreating nature [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3483.2799999999997s)]
*  So they just contain nature instead of like having people [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3488.08s)]
*  You know shuttle all these cows into these stalls and put a fucking trough in front of them and like no these these animals [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3491.3599999999997s)]
*  Graze out in the field [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3497.64s)]
*  They just control where they go and they eat what they normally would eat and they make sure that they get plenty of new ground [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3499.2s)]
*  So they move them to new ground when they've used up all the grass [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3506.24s)]
*  They push them over there and then the chickens do the same thing they they have a chicken coop [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3509.2799999999997s)]
*  That's a mobile chicken coop. They push it out. They open it up [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3513.3999999999996s)]
*  They run around and then he's dealing with like hawks killing his chickens. So he's got to come up with ways to [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3516.8399999999997s)]
*  Hawks. Yeah, this is like Mike Catherine. What you know Mike great guy. You know Mike Catherine what he was on [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3523.12s)]

*  That's adorable. You think you can raise bunnies. So they're just getting decimated. Guess what they did. What's the one change they made? [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3568.0s)]
*  What they do they got two Anatolian shepherds. Oh, yeah, and bro he said even the fucking snakes are on notice [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3573.48s)]

*  Coyotes, excuse me, sir. That's what they were bred for. Oh my god [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3584.8799999999997s)]
*  Indoor pets no those fucking things will just [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3590.8s)]

*  Yeah, they don't fuck around. I'm gonna buy a ranch. Are you? Yeah, really? Yeah. Yeah [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3599.6s)]
*  Been talking about it for a while. You know, they're waiting for the maybe but at the very least we're gonna put the podcast on a ranch [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3605.7200000000003s)]
*  Really? Yeah, cuz I want to have a ranch [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3611.64s)]
*  I also want to have a big piece of land in case things go sideways [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3613.64s)]
*  Where I can have like a whole community on a ranch this is where I start my cult [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3618.2s)]
*  I'm gonna just let people build on the ranch like give them a few acres. I got some kids [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3622.48s)]
*  I want that's what I'm saying [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3627.2400000000002s)]
*  Like imagine if you have like a 2,000 acre property and on that 2,000 acre property [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3628.48s)]
*  There's like a literal community of you and your friends. Yeah, you'll hunt on the land. Yeah, there's water. There's a lake there [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3633.72s)]
*  Come in I'll wear a tweed jacket. I'll smoke cigars. I'm not gonna do any of the work, but I'll [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3639.68s)]
*  Do any of the work boy, there's no need for that go and take care of that [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3644.84s)]
*  Hey, I think it's a crazy dream [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3648.04s)]
*  Like it's a crazy idea to do but isn't everything a crazy like coming here is a crazy idea [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3650.4s)]
*  Yeah building the mothership is a crazy idea. But what if you had out like a big pond with fish? [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3655.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so you can fish you had land you can shoot your own [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3660.08s)]
*  Freshwater fish. Yeah, can't eat a lot of them. Why cuz of poison. Oh, really? Yeah [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3664.72s)]
*  There's a lot of mercury and freshwater fish really yeah, there was a dude who [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3669.92s)]
*  What did he win he won some big fishing derby he was a big-time fisherman [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3676.1600000000003s)]
*  he started getting with some weird neurological condition and [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3680.92s)]
*  It turned out it was because he was just eating freshwater fish all the time and some lakes [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3684.6s)]
*  So you got to think about rainfall like you remember when we were younger acid rain everybody's worried about [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3689.76s)]
*  What happened that I don't know it went away but the thing about it is like [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3695.52s)]
*  Pollutants in the air when the rain comes down [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3701.08s)]
*  It does bring all that shit into the water and then it stays in that water, you know [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3704.08s)]
*  So if you've got a lake in that lake gets drowned on with pollution rain [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3709.7599999999998s)]
*  You're gonna have a certain amount of toxic elements that are gonna be in that water mercury is not good [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3713.8s)]
*  Okay, why don't you Google how much? [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3719.48s)]
*  Oh Jamie's already on it eating one freshwater fish equals a month of drinking forever chemicals water [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3722.7599999999998s)]
*  See that's the problem these forever chemicals [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3731.24s)]
*  PFAS found at high levels and freshwater fish with most concern for vulnerable communities [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3734.0s)]
*  So like this is a good point about the vulnerable communities because I was filming [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3739.8799999999997s)]
*  TV show once in Detroit and [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3745.3999999999996s)]
*  We were on the banks of this river that was fucking clearly polluted and there was all these really poor people [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3748.2s)]
*  Who were on the banks of that river that were fishing for food? [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3754.24s)]
*  Yeah [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3757.24s)]
*  And not just a few like quite a bunch of people that were trying to get their dinner on that river and [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3757.72s)]
*  You know people that really they needed that for food [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3764.16s)]
*  They looked real poor and you know [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3767.4s)]
*  There was a white black all kinds of different nationalities Asians and a lot of people and I was like, whoa [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3769.32s)]
*  Like Detroit is at least was in 2012 when I was filming this thing was fucking scary [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3775.16s)]
*  like yeah, when you realize how a city which was one of the [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3781.56s)]
*  richest cities in the country [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3786.6s)]
*  they're there by one of the richest cities in the world in the 1950s during the the peak of the automotive industry and then to see it just [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3788.12s)]
*  Decimated decimated and these people were just and I was like, oh my god, they're gonna eat these fish and then I thought oh my god [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3795.48s)]
*  They have to eat these fish. Well, that was the great migration, right? [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3801.2s)]
*  So from the south the black the huge number of black people went up to Detroit looking for jobs [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3803.74s)]
*  Mm-hmm [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3808.2999999999997s)]
*  and the problem was when they got to their first of all the auto industry started to get decimated because it started to move toward [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3808.9399999999996s)]
*  Japan and different countries but also in the in in I can't see when the great migration was it was before that [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3814.4599999999996s)]
*  I feel like everything started fucking up in the 70s [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3820.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, they they had jobs and there was a whole thriving community. But we're really what happened also was that the auto workers union [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3823.7s)]
*  I'm sorry, but it kept black people out of it [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3829.8599999999997s)]
*  There's a lot of racism that went on so a lot of people couldn't find jobs [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3831.92s)]
*  the great migration first a large-scale movement of approximately 6 million African Americans from the rural south to urban areas in north and west [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3835.2000000000003s)]
*  between roughly 1916 and 1970 driven primarily by the desire to escape racial violence pursue better economic opportunities and [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3843.44s)]
*  excess improved education in the north [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3850.92s)]
*  Escaping Jim Crow laws. Yeah. Yeah didn't work out [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3854.6800000000003s)]
*  Well it did for a while and maybe in a way it did because they thrived in those areas where they probably wouldn't have [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3857.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, it's like the Puerto Rican exodus from Puerto Rico to New York [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3864.36s)]
*  They went up there looking for manufacturing jobs, then the manufacturing jobs [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3867.7599999999998s)]
*  Coincided with moving south. So you had this massive number of people who didn't have anywhere to go in the early [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3871.44s)]
*  1900s many African Americans migrated north to work in Detroit's booming industries yet [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3878.2799999999997s)]
*  They rarely saw the benefits many white neighbors actively denied African Americans access to decent living conditions and job opportunities [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3882.9s)]
*  Mmm, there it is. Yeah [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3891.54s)]
*  So a lot of darkness and all that stuff there is but the city that's left over now [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3893.82s)]
*  You know you seen Roger and me right? Yeah, Michael Morris film, which is [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3899.14s)]
*  Like I think his best one. He's like when he was pure [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3903.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you know, he wasn't like ideologically captured and editing things for effect. He was pure. That was a bummer [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3906.7400000000002s)]
*  I saw that he started doing that. Yeah [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3912.54s)]
*  It is a problem [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3915.06s)]
*  Because then it makes you question everything else. Well the biggest thing that every [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3917.02s)]
*  Mainstream publication is in crisis and I think they've earned it [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3922.74s)]
*  They've deserved it the New York Times still makes money [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3927.2599999999998s)]
*  But primarily not because of their articles that people read it's primarily because they're crosswords. They're their puzzles [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3929.58s)]
*  but you know, yeah, but when you take things out of context and you have [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3935.94s)]
*  Journalists that are 26 years old and have an ideological bent [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3941.02s)]
*  People just you know, the rest of us are going the news doesn't reflect the world I live in whatever the fuck you're saying [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3946.1800000000003s)]
*  I don't know who this is. I don't even I've never seen this [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3951.82s)]
*  I live in a very different world and it's gonna be interesting to see I I think there's a liability though where [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3953.82s)]
*  podcasts take the place of [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3959.94s)]
*  mainstream media in some ways because then [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3962.1s)]
*  You have somebody who's very good at talking for three hours and [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3964.82s)]
*  They they can really sway a lot of people but that's one side of their story [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3968.92s)]
*  So now you have just that so you have to be careful because sometimes it could just move things over here [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3973.3s)]
*  We're again the truth is somewhere in the middle a lot of times or it's more nuanced or there's just more to know [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3977.9s)]
*  It's definitely more neurons nuanced [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3983.0600000000004s)]
*  I think there's always gonna be a real problem with people that don't really know what's going on say they know what's going on [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3984.9s)]
*  Yes, when they say they know what's going on it confuses everybody and fucks everything up and it's another version of gaslighting so CNN [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3991.34s)]
*  And you know MSNBC they gaslight you they gaslight you and they they they actively promote propaganda [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=3999.34s)]
*  and [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4006.9s)]
*  narratives that are not objectively true and [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4008.2200000000003s)]
*  the problem on the other side is if you are in opposition of that and [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4012.54s)]
*  You say you know this and you know that but you really don't like you got to be real clear with what you say [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4019.18s)]
*  They have people have to really be able to try like if you don't know you have to say oh [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4027.5s)]
*  I didn't know that you have to say that yes [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4031.16s)]
*  If you do not say that no one is going to listen you anymore and they shouldn't right because the difference between [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4033.46s)]
*  Someone who is completely independent and a podcaster and someone who's on CNN should be that no one is telling you what to do [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4039.42s)]
*  So what is your ethical compass? What's the evidence to write? What's the evidence? [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4047.22s)]
*  But also what's your ethical compass? [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4051.8999999999996s)]
*  Are you trying to win and be correct or are you trying to find out what's going on? Well, it's also about ratings [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4053.3399999999997s)]
*  Right, so it is you gotta you gotta yeah, but it's not because I don't think about ratings [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4061.02s)]
*  No, you don't I'm saying but that's why I have them. That's right [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4065.58s)]
*  See I'm saying like it's not about ratings right like ratings come if people believe you [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4068.66s)]
*  Like if you sit around thinking about the ratings, do you think you would be on no [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4074.06s)]
*  No, what do you mean you be on this show right now? [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4080.46s)]
*  You fucker [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4091.9s)]
*  You saying that Mark Zuckerberg and Mel Gibson get better better ratings than me [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4095.14s)]
*  Occasionally occasionally they do fuck I like talking to everybody [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4099.820000000001s)]
*  I don't I genuinely don't give a fuck like how the show's gonna do [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4103.02s)]
*  I don't think you can I think if you do that it'll distort what you do and I think we've all seen [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4107.46s)]
*  People who fall victim to what they call audience capture, you know [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4112.7s)]
*  They start getting a crowd like you see with a lot of guys like online [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4117.22s)]
*  They start saying like a lot of wacky right-wing things and everybody [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4121.22s)]
*  Yeah, finally someone telling the truth and then they become just like a fucking [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4124.16s)]
*  Well that might my compass for that is this whenever I hear somebody say on a podcast or whatever when they say you guys [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4128.42s)]
*  All those people over there are wrong [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4136.66s)]
*  I'm the one whistleblower. I figured out I'm the one now you do have Mavericks [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4139.34s)]
*  But I always am weary of when I hear somebody go all that the entire medical establishment is wrong and I'm right and I go [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4144.34s)]
*  Mmm, I don't think so. I think it's way I just don't think you know enough [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4152.7s)]
*  I don't think you as one person I'm not gonna just put all my bags [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4156.86s)]
*  Um, there is something called a scientific consensus. Sometimes that could be a bullshit consensus [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4160.139999999999s)]
*  We can be told we can be told the clients climate scientists all agree. Right true. It's just how you get funding [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4165.12s)]
*  So sometimes the incentive structures are there and the same with the medical stuff, correct? Let's just be a little bit [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4170.96s)]
*  Yeah, let's be a little bit more [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4175.84s)]
*  Yeah, you can't say you know things because I've heard people who are those kind of people say they know things about me [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4177.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, like oh, you know that you can't use your phone on his show I've heard people say that like confidently [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4183.66s)]
*  Yeah, the CIA is right behind me say that he's handled by the CIA [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4190.42s)]
*  Listen Mike Baker is my friend and I'm pretty sure he's still in the CIA. I like them. I like them [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4194.900000000001s)]

*  Like let me ask this guy how and I really do believe he's a patriot and I really do think he's a great guy [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4204.92s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of them and I don't believe cops are bad and I don't believe any of that bullshit [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4209.78s)]
*  I think there's bad people in every fucking business a lot of comedians that I think are rotten cunts [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4215.58s)]
*  Yeah, I don't like them. Yep, you know, but it doesn't mean I hate comedians [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4220.84s)]

*  Andy had one of the quickest paths of black belts. I think I've ever seen. Oh, is he a black belt now? [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4312.58s)]
*  Well, he lives with a black belt instructor, that's the thing. Okay, your wife is a black belt [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4316.92s)]
*  You better get your fucking peas and cues in order sign. Yeah, I think he's probably a quick study that dude is so fucking smart [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4321.400000000001s)]
*  He's another guy who's very smart genius, but also [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4327.400000000001s)]
*  Obsessive like he got obsessive with bow hunting became very proficient at bow hunting very quickly [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4330.64s)]
*  Yeah, and then you know living with a black belt those what a huge advantage you just drill with your wife [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4335.92s)]
*  Six guys so he's got some physicality hot, you know your wife's triangle strangling [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4342.240000000001s)]

*  Like a true athlete. Oh, yeah, you cannot be lightening super smart, too. Yeah [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4353.52s)]
*  It's like I think most black belts are I think it's just there's too many things you have to consider to get that good [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4358.64s)]
*  There's so there's infinite yeah [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4366.22s)]
*  You could be a brute and just brute strength your way through a lot of it and you know be kind of halfway dumb [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4368.26s)]
*  And get to black belt. Maybe my only regret is not going down that rabbit hole. I [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4373.9800000000005s)]
*  Train now I wake up every morning going [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4379.86s)]
*  You don't train much anymore, right? No, I want you though. This is the thing [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4385.78s)]

*  I did that happen to me the other day [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4396.94s)]
*  I trained at this this in Nono's MMA who I love it down in Hermosa and [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4398.82s)]
*  I love doing it, but I of course I'm rolling with a 26 year old and I'm like, let's go and of course [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4404.86s)]
*  I'm 57. I see his ankle. Don't give me your ankle, bro. I'm an ankle guy [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4410.82s)]
*  I pick his ankle drive him to the ground walking poke that ankle back. I'm back. I'm a rest high school [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4414.14s)]
*  How tired high school do it had trouble looking left for 11 days? [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4419.46s)]
*  Fucking worth it. Yeah [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4424.42s)]
*  Well, you gotta when you're old you got a role in a different way [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4426.42s)]
*  You got a role like roll with John Jock Machado. Okay, John Jock Machado who was you know? [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4429.82s)]
*  My instructor since 1998 John Jock is still rolling and still dominating black belts on the mat [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4436.16s)]
*  Yeah, when John Jock rolls, he never moves fast. There's no fast [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4442.9s)]
*  His knowledge is so wide his understanding of Jiji he's talking to your Joe [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4447.44s)]
*  Okay, Joe, and I'm about to pass your guy [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4453.04s)]
*  But it's smooth and slow and because of that he does not get hurt [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4458.12s)]
*  Yeah, you know me set of a few injuries over the year [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4461.86s)]
*  But when it taught when you you deal with like high level black belts who roll on a consistent basis and John Jock's in his 50s [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4464.4s)]
*  Now he is not hurt. He's still like looks fantastic [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4470.82s)]
*  He's like filled with energy trains all the time [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4474.4400000000005s)]
*  That ape shit that you did when you were 23 like [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4479.64s)]
*  Yeah, you can't be that guy you got a leak, you know, you got to move slow yeah slow and strong [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4488.64s)]
*  I like to talk shit to guys who are way better. That's then you got to be flexible [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4495.24s)]
*  That's the other thing you got to really work on your stretching and your flexibility [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4498.68s)]
*  You have to maintain your mobility [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4502.5s)]
*  I was watching Armand Saryukian who's fighting Islam Makachev for the lightweight title next weekend [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4503.780000000001s)]
*  And he was doing this mobility and flexibility routine. You're like this is insane [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4509.54s)]
*  He's so jacked and so mobile like more than I think anybody I've ever seen [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4515.46s)]
*  Well part of that also I think that one of the people don't talk about this [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4520.900000000001s)]
*  I think the Dagestani is the Russians like Marab. Look at those. Oh, Jesus Christ [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4525.18s)]
*  That's the dude is fighting for the lightweight title and by the way, they fought a few years back and it was god damn [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4529.62s)]
*  I thought I was I thought I was straight this whole time. God damn son [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4535.94s)]
*  That dude is in flexing right? That's a good-looking man. I mean, that's a strong man [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4539.7s)]
*  That's what I meant good-looking and strong. I'm getting correct on both. Jesus. What a monster. Yeah homeboys [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4543.42s)]
*  Well, by the by the way, his coach is a gold medalist. I think his coach is a gold medalist Olympic wrestler [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4549.16s)]
*  Here's the thing about those guys. I [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4554.5s)]
*  Think one of their advantages that nobody talks about is that when you get a guy like Khabib you get these Dagestani's you get [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4557.14s)]
*  These Russians these are these Armenians and stuff. They've been training [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4562.1s)]
*  Probably since they were six. Yeah, and and so what happens is your tendons and everything gets really really strong [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4566.22s)]
*  And also if you ever watch like Alexander Karelin the way they would warm up [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4572.78s)]
*  Those guys that Karelin could do a backflip go splits and all that those guys the way they warm up was it was scientific [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4576.78s)]
*  Yes, and and so because they knew that the micro damage that happens and so they would they would strengthen all the connective tissue first [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4583.94s)]
*  and I think a lot of times like guys like Marab guys like [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4592.7s)]
*  Umar [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4598.339999999999s)]
*  Since they've been training so long their bodies are different. They feel different. They are different. They're more rugged [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4599.5199999999995s)]
*  So they don't get injured. They don't deal with injuries. I think one of the biggest things that is [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4605.0599999999995s)]
*  Hard for a lot of guys. They all get injured. They might get injured. I think they get injured less. They probably train they train [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4608.94s)]
*  Differently, you're definitely right that their bodies are stronger [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4615.62s)]
*  Yeah, because they've been doing it since they were younger and that they get developed in that way [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4618.58s)]
*  Yeah, but they're all the other the opposite is true with striking like not the opposite [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4621.9s)]
*  But it's also true with striking that if you start striking when you in your 30s [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4627.54s)]
*  You're never gonna catch Floyd Mayweather. Never you just you need that radar. Well, you need that your body needs to be sort of like [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4630.94s)]
*  Developed to strike. Yeah, but you also have to be like if you look at the the boxers like if you look Floyd Mayweather [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4639.22s)]
*  His father and his uncle said to him like they knew they were like [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4644.94s)]
*  Boxing is just about as much about not getting hit [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4649.5s)]
*  Like you can be great and everything else if your emphasis isn't on every time you throw you got to be in a position [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4653.14s)]
*  Where you're not gonna get hit every time you step? [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4658.34s)]
*  Kusumoto was that way too every time you you throw your step, right? [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4660.34s)]
*  And and that huge part of that is it was all a foot game and all of that is if you haven't been trained properly [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4663.78s)]
*  As you're learning how to box you're gonna get take a lot of damage and you're fucked [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4669.58s)]
*  You're fucked after a while [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4674.0599999999995s)]
*  And if you look at those really good coaches those old guys Eddie fudge who taught who would teach by the jab [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4675.44s)]
*  Your hand was here because instead of here you were you were taking shots [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4681.7s)]
*  You would be here. So if you watch him fight with Ken Norton when he fought Ali [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4685.54s)]
*  He said when you fight Ali Ali's here when he's when he jabs he's doing this I want your hand here [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4689.42s)]
*  So you can see Norton catching Ali's jab and then boom answering back and catching Ali in the face [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4695.54s)]
*  Those little details make like literally all the difference in whether you box five more years or if you're done five years earlier [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4701.18s)]
*  Well, the best example is Floyd right because he got hit less than anybody ever I can count them on my hand [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4707.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, if you want to say like who's the best boxer of all time? [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4712.14s)]
*  Always say Floyd because he got hit less than anybody and that's the whole thing [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4715.46s)]
*  And by the way didn't have the kind of power that any of these other guys had didn't have that like that Roy Jones [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4719.5s)]
*  Power puncher, but but he broke his hands a bunch of times. That was part of the problem [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4724.82s)]
*  Yeah, and but even then like he wasn't a robust guy, right? You know, so he's just [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4728.7s)]
*  What's his name? [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4734.34s)]
*  Travante Davis or anything right right? Well, that's a great example of a guy which is preposterous power, you know [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4735.34s)]
*  Just preposterous power. Did you see Arthur better beef who is fighting Demetri b vol? [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4741.7s)]
*  Yeah, he did a hammer workout on a tire where he hit a tire for an hour [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4747.98s)]
*  He did for an hour what he hit a tire for an hour with a sledgehammer [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4753.66s)]
*  I'm a different fuck. He's chetchening but same shit mountain Homs [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4758.22s)]
*  I've chameleon savage people and he's the one of the scariest boxers of all time [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4762.62s)]
*  The only fight that he had as a professional that went the distance is b vol [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4767.54s)]
*  I know the only fight did you see when people would have was 19 know at 19 knockouts [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4771.46s)]
*  That's fucking insane your hands up with him. He'll still concuss you. Yeah, he hits that hard [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4775.5s)]
*  Sure, just basic to like ones and twos maybe a hook once in a while [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4779.94s)]
*  There's a great video where this boxer who was you know, world-class boxer who's a professional got brought in to box bitter beef and [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4783.58s)]
*  His coach said to him just do your best. He's like do my best [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4791.14s)]
*  Do my bill what the fuck are you talking do my bomb gonna fuck this dude up and he goes and he hit me [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4795.46s)]
*  The first time he hit me it was like nothing I'd ever experienced [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4800.14s)]
*  I like like it's almost like my body left me and I was like [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4803.820000000001s)]
*  That's your job dude better be of is hitting people to like this. Yeah, it's all short [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4809.3s)]
*  Everything is short and it's just but he'll need your arm power that those arms [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4815.34s)]
*  Oh, yeah [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4819.700000000001s)]
*  He'll break your arms down and then buy around five enjoy that shit Canelo does a lot of that [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4820.22s)]
*  He does a lot of that he smashes guys arms. I think the best up with him [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4825.34s)]
*  Yeah, you don't want that guy punching arms. Well, I've always said that about look at look at his workouts with his wrists and fists [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4829.18s)]
*  Yeah, this is his warm-up better be of is one of the craziest specimens because he's almost 40 years old, too [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4834.860000000001s)]
*  So he had this endurance fight with b vol [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4841.1s)]
*  So it's 12 rounds of super high pace very endurance heavy and he was the one that was dominating at the the last round [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4844.86s)]
*  Correct, correct [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4851.5s)]
*  That's February 22nd. I'm fucking pumped for that fight. You're gonna fight again. Oh, yeah rematch [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4853.5s)]
*  I'm very pumped for that fight because b vol is so goddamn good to what he did to Canelo [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4858.32s)]
*  Like no one's ever done that Canelo. I think the best fighter [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4863.62s)]
*  I think you can make an argument for certainly top three fighters of all time is [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4866.0199999999995s)]
*  Is is usik? [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4870.94s)]
*  Yes, I think he's incredible incredible. I mean I I've watched every one of his fights that dude is on such a different level [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4872.74s)]
*  He's smaller than everybody's fighting giants [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4879.099999999999s)]
*  Fighting giants when you're fighting a guy who's 60 pounds heavier with 10 ounce 12 ounce gloves [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4881.38s)]
*  It makes such a world of difference trying to actually win the guy is fucking Anthony Joshua [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4886.54s)]
*  You know, but please understand usik fought it. I think 75 when he started out. He's not a big guy [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4892.26s)]
*  He's like 225 230 as a heavyweight [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4898.0599999999995s)]
*  20 not big not big and that's a lot of the way that was Tyson's weight when he was in his prime, too [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4901.42s)]
*  Yeah, there's something to be said for that because a 220 pound man [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4906.9400000000005s)]
*  Like Mike Tyson could knock out any human being that's ever lived your job the amount of power he can generate is insane [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4910.22s)]
*  So then you have the speed of being only 220 pounds instead of 290, you know [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4915.900000000001s)]
*  Or like remember when Andy Ruiz fought Joshua the second time and he got real fat. Yeah, so sad [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4921.04s)]
*  Because like you had a real chance of like carving out a legacy the the knockout in the first fight was fucking huge [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4927.38s)]
*  Yeah, he has speed. Oh my god [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4933.88s)]
*  Rise the shit is fucking boxing combinations are so fluid. He punches like a middleweight. Yeah, bronze medalist [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4936.42s)]
*  I don't know. I think he is I think he is I think he did metal great boxer very very great boxers [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4942.9800000000005s)]
*  Super nice guy too when he came on to the podcast after he beat Joshua. He had a fucking diamond across the watch [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4948.9800000000005s)]
*  He came in or a Rolls Royce [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4954.06s)]
*  Let's go I like it we got to get you an accountant though [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4958.54s)]
*  Don't spend too much your money and probably don't get to 280 pounds [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4961.02s)]
*  Yeah, the problem is then all of a sudden you're a superstar and you're partying and you have a survey says and hanging with the boys [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4964.660000000001s)]
*  And I think there's also you've got a you've got to take the responsibility on of being a champion [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4971.26s)]
*  It's hard to hold that it's one thing. It's like starting a business. You can get it [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4978.0s)]
*  You can get people to know about your your business is running a business is very different [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4981.06s)]
*  I'll be like you get in the building a champion staying staying champ maintaining champion [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4984.200000000001s)]
*  I remember Matt Hughes when BJ Penn beat him. He told me he goes honestly Joe. It's a weight off my back [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4988.620000000001s)]
*  And I was like really? [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4995.22s)]
*  And I was like it makes sense though because he was just smashing everybody and he was the person that everyone was chasing [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=4997.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's like got a fucking way on your psyche. That's why John Jones to me is just what is this Jamie? [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5001.660000000001s)]
*  He didn't win in the qualification tournaments for the Olympics. Oh, he didn't go to the Olympics [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5006.860000000001s)]
*  Okay, okay, but he did win a bunch of other stuff [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5011.14s)]
*  He represented Mexico in the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games qualification tournaments losing to Oh, Cuba [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5013.14s)]
*  Cuba man you ever watch how you guys train? [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5019.9400000000005s)]
*  The Cubans are amazing cuz they don't hit mitts like you'll have a guy and they just move and move and moving and once in a [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5022.02s)]
*  While the coach will lift a glove bought one shot, you know move and it's all where it is [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5027.52s)]
*  It's all footwork. You throw one punch, you know, they they like the Russians developed a very technical and [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5032.360000000001s)]
*  Very technique oriented way of combat sports [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5039.660000000001s)]
*  It's why the Russians were so good at Olympics at wrestling rather because they were so technical where the Americans would just try to work [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5042.76s)]
*  Harder than everybody else. Yeah, and the Russians like figured out like no [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5049.46s)]
*  There's a time you work hard and there's a time you recover and you have to have active recovery and they got real [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5053.26s)]
*  scientific about their physical training real like [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5058.18s)]
*  Dan Gable when he did the podcast was explained to me how he learned sauna from the Eastern Bloc people really yeah [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5061.22s)]
*  They started incorporating sauna [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5068.1s)]
*  He's like this is another added element that raises your endurance [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5069.58s)]
*  Why is they would train hard and then after training you sit in that sauna for 20 minutes at 190 degrees man? [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5072.9400000000005s)]
*  Your heart is hammering. So you're getting static cardio [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5079.58s)]
*  Also, it has an EPO like effect where it's like a mild dose of EPO. It raises your red blood cells really [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5083.58s)]
*  Yeah, my endurance is raised [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5090.14s)]
*  Significantly when I started what about cold plunges there's that's controversial still [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5092.66s)]
*  Cold plunges is not controversial in terms of the way it makes you feel [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5096.58s)]
*  Okay, so the psychological benefits of the increase in dopamine levels and norepinephrine that is a hundred percent established [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5101.86s)]
*  I think that is one of the most powerful aspects of the cold plunge [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5109.78s)]
*  Also, what's been established is that when you do the cold plunge before exercise it raises testosterone [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5115.1s)]
*  So there's something about doing the cold plunge and then forcing your body to heat up through a warm-up and then going through your workout [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5121.16s)]
*  That raises testosterone for people and there was a study that was done where it showed this guy went from having an extremely low [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5128.4s)]
*  Testosterone level to having a testosterone level where his doctor thought he was juicing Wow [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5136.36s)]
*  All he changed was he started doing cold plunge put your body under stress. It's not good after workout [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5140.4s)]
*  Really no because you want high hypertrophy and you want muscles to grow and strengthen and part of that growth and strengthening is [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5147.8s)]
*  Inflammation so that inflammation is actually good heat on the other hand is good after workouts [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5156.72s)]
*  So it's good for the effect of it raises your red blood [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5163.08s)]
*  Dan Gable said he would do a sauna after working out. Yes, it raised his endurance [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5167.88s)]

*  Once and in that case they were right to sue them because they did something wrong and it's pretty interesting because there's a literally a difference [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5831.14s)]
*  In culture. There's a difference in the notion of I'm responsible for my actions. Somebody else is responsible for the state [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5839.22s)]

*  but I'm saying there was a lot of Kamala stuff there the very very little cross stuff and [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5871.78s)]
*  It's ironic to me because I do think to an extent without having done enough research [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5876.66s)]
*  But I've done some that you have to lace at least some of the blame for this total [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5881.58s)]
*  inability to respond to [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5887.9400000000005s)]
*  government mismanagement and the fact that this government this progressive government in [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5890.14s)]

*  Okay, guys, so we need to figure out there is a way to solve every problem [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5913.780000000001s)]
*  You got a fit you if you do you need an army of firefighters? They cut they cut [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5918.46s)]
*  percent I know they cut [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5922.740000000001s)]
*  17.6 million dollars from the fire budget in Los Angeles. Wasn't it 17 percent or was it 17 point six million dollars? [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5925.14s)]
*  There you go. That's what I read see if that's true. I thought it was percent but maybe I think it's [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5931.860000000001s)]
*  17.6 maybe that's what it turned out [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5936.22s)]
*  It might be they have a hundred million dollar budget and they cut it down to seven either way [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5943.38s)]
*  Obviously, what's that Jamie eight hundred million dollars or something? Yeah, that's the whole budget [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5948.02s)]
*  Yeah, it's a lot. So they only cut 17 million out of 800 but still why would you cut anything out of one of the most important things? [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5951.86s)]
*  Obviously now, you know now, you know that was a huge mistake. Well, now, you know, you should have increased the budget [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5958.9400000000005s)]
*  Well to your to your point this was a perfect storm to an extent and there's there's a limit to what any fire department can do [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5964.540000000001s)]
*  There's a limit right we live in Los Angeles fires are a reality earthquakes are a reality mudslides are a reality [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5970.46s)]
*  We know this it's a it's a California's a tough place to live that it's great, but there are a lot of liabilities [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5976.1s)]
*  I just think if you know that that's the case [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5980.26s)]
*  Something went wrong and our infrastructure the fact that our fire hydrants and it happened in Colorado three years ago [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5984.620000000001s)]
*  But the fact that the fire hydrants lost pressure you can predict these things, right? [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5990.94s)]
*  Well again, I bring it back to Trump because Trump was saying this all could be solved and he was right [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=5995.419999999999s)]
*  What he was saying is true and that they are doing it to protect a fucking smelt [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=6000.179999999999s)]
*  That exists Delta smelt that exists other places. I love the Delta smelt. I don't what does that thing? [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=6004.259999999999s)]

*  Yeah, 17 million last year [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=6014.099999999999s)]
*  She directed more for 2023 2024 fiscal year Los Angeles allocated 837 million to the Los Angeles Fire Department [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=6015.94s)]
*  accounting for roughly 65 percent of the 1.3 billion dollar budget designated for homelessness initiatives which didn't work what [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=6023.379999999999s)]
*  65% for homelessness initiatives didn't work roughly half the budget for homelessness went unspent these [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=6031.86s)]
*  Motherfuckers something else about that these motherfuckers the homeless thing too. You talked to you talked to progressives about the homeless thing [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=6039.139999999999s)]
*  You know what they'll say? It's a housing shortage. No, it's not it's a drug and mental health problem housing housing housing [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=6045.1s)]
*  Yeah, sorry housing housing and we can't fix it. It's a mental. We need money [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=6051.26s)]
*  So it's been 24 billion dollars last year [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=6055.740000000001s)]
*  24 billion homeless for me. I'm not sure complex. Yeah, that's what it is [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=6059.42s)]
*  It's a bunch of people making money off of profits. Of course. Yeah, and so there's there's a vested interest in keeping homeless a problem [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=6063.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the real problem is that there's homeless at all [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=6071.82s)]
*  Like how is that possible in the greatest society the world's ever known? [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=6074.5s)]
*  But because we've put very little effort into stopping it very little effort into education and fixing people's mental health problems [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=6078.219999999999s)]

*  And it'd be very easy to go. I'm part of this podcast. I'm a huge part of it [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7489.42s)]
*  He doesn't get his ego that's happened to a few friends of mine where they had to get rid of their producer because the producer [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7492.86s)]
*  Was like, you know, we did this and he's like hey [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7498.18s)]
*  He pointed cameras at a comedian that was already famous like cut the shit like this is fucking stupid [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7501.34s)]
*  We all have our role. We all do our thing. Yeah, but it's like what happens with a lot of these people is they develop these [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7506.78s)]
*  Podcasts and then they have I go to my friends podcast and he has ten people working for him [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7512.5s)]
*  And I was like, what are all these people doing? What do they do? What are they doing? [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7517.5s)]
*  This is crazy. Like why you have all these people and then they have interns [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7521.54s)]
*  I will you have people working you're making millions of dollars and they're working for free [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7524.5s)]
*  Like I don't agree with interns. Yeah, like I would never have an intern if I had an in that person [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7529.46s)]
*  Yeah, 100% I don't even know if you're allowed to pay certain interns because they're supposed to get like I would break the law [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7535.139999999999s)]
*  I'd break the law pay them. Just give me a paid intern. It's fine. Can you have a paid intern in a college? [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7541.54s)]
*  Yeah, I think what happens is it builds resentment if you're not 100% you got to be careful [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7546.08s)]
*  Well, that's a problem with rich people when they have assistants to yeah, like Al Madrigal had an assistant once [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7550.5s)]
*  He was like, yeah, I got to get an assistant. I go. No, you don't I go listen to me do less shit [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7555.82s)]
*  Just do less shit. I know you you need an assistant [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7559.9s)]
*  You do less things [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7563.54s)]
*  Yeah [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7564.78s)]
*  You know what? [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7565.18s)]
*  They're like I remember when David spayed an assistant the dude tried to duct tape him and the guy he tasered him [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7565.62s)]
*  He was gonna kill him. Yeah guy went to jail [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7571.38s)]
*  Henry the ace said something like that. Also every time I promote somebody I create [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7574.58s)]
*  Every time I promote somebody I create eight enemies and one in great something like that. I think that was that [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7579.26s)]
*  It's great. Yeah, but didn't he kill a bunch of his wives. It was terrible [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7584.38s)]
*  And [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7587.98s)]
*  That's a great story is just a piece of shit, you know what he did, right? [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7589.98s)]
*  He said the Catholic Church he wanted a son and his wife was barren and he he he wanted an heir and the Catholic Church [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7592.98s)]
*  would not [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7600.419999999999s)]
*  Codify his divorce. So he was like, okay, I'm gonna start the Anglican Church fuck off [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7601.9s)]
*  I'm gonna start my own church and it's gonna okay. It's gonna be okay with divorce [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7607.379999999999s)]
*  So he created the Anglican Church and the great story of a man for all seasons [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7610.82s)]
*  Thomas Sir Thomas Moore was Thomas more would not join the Anglican Church and they killed him for it [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7615.22s)]
*  And he said I am more than my appetites. I am more than you know, my body [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7620.18s)]
*  I am my principles and my principles are higher and I'm gonna stick to the Catholic Church kind of like, you know [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7625.02s)]
*  I wish I was no shit. Right? Yeah, just join that other church. Well, we all would right? [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7629.780000000001s)]
*  Get a lot of shit done. Okay [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7635.820000000001s)]
*  All right. I was an acting class as you remember remember that and one of they kind of a famous actor [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7638.54s)]
*  He did the scene. This is so great [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7644.9s)]
*  he did the man man for all seasons and as he you know, so you do a scene and [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7646.9s)]
*  You know a lot of working actors in the class [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7651.94s)]
*  This is Los Angeles and we all sit back and now the great teacher will now break it apart and he the actor [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7653.86s)]
*  began to weep [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7660.94s)]
*  And this is why you crying Jesus because I I'm not this man [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7662.5s)]
*  I would have joined the Anglican Church and it bothers me that I'm not the kind of principled man [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7665.62s)]
*  That would stick to we see knows that was pretty cool. This is not that guy. I wish I was a Navy SEAL [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7670.78s)]
*  I'd kill everybody. Yeah, he was one of my favorite actors, too [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7675.82s)]
*  And I was like there you go. At least you know your fucking limitations [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7678.14s)]
*  Yeah, never say what you would do in an emergency because you know, so probably why is a great actor [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7681.24s)]
*  Because he was aware of everything like the differences between him and those other people, you know [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7686.58s)]
*  Well, you better know you're vulnerable [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7693.94s)]
*  Like you walk around like a tough guy right that the real tough guys are the guys that have done a lot of shit [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7696.0199999999995s)]
*  Or who've seen a lot of combat or at least been involved and like Evan Hayford [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7700.86s)]
*  For example has probably done a lot more than he never talks about any of it [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7704.5s)]
*  You'll never hear any him say anything but and for that matter Andy stump same way. They don't really tell you anything, but [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7707.339999999999s)]
*  They're very aware that first of all, it's very easy to be killed very easy [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7712.5s)]
*  I don't care how strong you are. We bench a tiny child can kill you with a gun right away [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7717.259999999999s)]
*  So you you you get a real sense part of what's really good about just doing combat sports or doing any kind of [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7721.74s)]
*  Like even a rough sport contact sport is that it comes you come into contact with objective reality [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7728.98s)]
*  It's very hard to start living this fake existence and part of the problem [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7734.54s)]
*  I think with our society is a lot of people controlling the narrative [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7739.62s)]
*  Don't really pay a price for being wrong because they live a life and they live a job where they're working [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7743.3s)]
*  Where they're working with their mouth they're working with only their brain and I think you get a lot from actually [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7748.9s)]
*  Trying to grow your own food or doing whatever it is [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7754.9s)]
*  You know [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7757.3s)]
*  You've got to kind of come in you own a farm and you realize that life eats life and things everything nature [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7757.66s)]
*  Mother nature is a motherfucker and wants to kill everything you try to grow [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7763.0199999999995s)]
*  It gives you a very different perspective on reality and what the world is about. Oh for sure [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7766.82s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's a giant problem with urban environments. That's why urban environments all get to these sort of esoteric [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7771.139999999999s)]
*  Philosophical ideas about what society would be like because they're completely [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7778.26s)]
*  Separated from the circle of life. Yeah, they're buying all their food from either a restaurant or a grocery store [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7784.1s)]
*  They're they're not farming. They're not doing anything. They're enjoying meat without any death, right? [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7789.9400000000005s)]
*  You ever see Steven Pinker's book the blank slate. Yes, you know that the when [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7794.860000000001s)]
*  The anthropologists came by their name [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7800.06s)]
*  They I think they were at Harvard and they came back from studying the Yanomami Indians or whatever in the Amazon [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7801.74s)]
*  Basin they were like hey guys [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7807.22s)]
*  I know you think just white Anglo-saxons are aggressive and we have a culture that rewards male aggression [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7808.7s)]
*  Those people have never been in contact with anybody white or Western and the guys that get laid the most are the guys that killed [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7815.34s)]
*  The most people in combat and have their hair on their daggers [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7821.1s)]
*  So they have their version of a fucking all-star quarterback too and he gets all the pussy [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7824.14s)]
*  And they were like what the fuck and they literally attacked their their reputations and everything they they drove them out of academia [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7829.54s)]
*  It's crazy. It's like that was truth. It should be obvious [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7836.74s)]
*  It should be obvious like that [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7839.54s)]
*  This is there's like been a series of events that human beings have gone through that have developed this [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7841.3s)]
*  Certain people like we understand it's an understanding that certain people are better at survival [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7849.58s)]
*  Certain people are better at being the leader certainly were better at wars [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7855.26s)]
*  Yeah, and life takes a certain amount of aggression and competitive spirit where you're gonna fucking get eaten [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7858.34s)]
*  Yeah, you're gonna get fucked [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7864.38s)]
*  That's right. So don't don't you it's great. I love that. We're all it's all utopian [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7866.66s)]
*  Until your kids don't have enough to eat and then I'm gonna kill that's what happens people are really kumbaya until your kids [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7872.28s)]
*  Have to struggle for resources and then they become [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7879.26s)]
*  Genocidal Jared Diamond who wrote guns germs and steel did the study with the fucking people up in the Guinea Highlands [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7882.7s)]
*  The minute the minute they they started running out of resources [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7890.139999999999s)]
*  They would they would start coming up with stories about the other tribe over there that were basically yeah, they eat their own kids [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7894.18s)]
*  Yeah, they're fucking really evil [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7901.1s)]
*  Just a whip up just to justify what they're about to do that other tribe. Yeah, cuz they got their stuff [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7903.1s)]
*  Yeah human beings. I mean, there's beautiful things in urban environments in society where you don't have to struggle [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7908.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, you don't have to do that. So you can you can get much more involved in art you get more co-op finance [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7915.66s)]
*  There's a lot of things that people can achieve when they have that sort of shelter [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7921.42s)]
*  But there's a balance to be achieved [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7925.62s)]
*  You know ours in our society the influence and the problem is the influence of these people that are detached in urban environments is so [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7927.7s)]
*  Significant because there's so many of them. There's so many more people that are detached than are connected [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7936.06s)]
*  That we have is like very weird [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7941.22s)]
*  like appreciation and understanding of resources and of like just how hard it is to just survive without [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7943.900000000001s)]
*  modern conveniences I I had a I think what changed me a lot was when I was younger I I [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7950.98s)]
*  Was accidentally around some pretty rough people some criminals people that were [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7957.82s)]
*  bad violent, you know, and [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7964.26s)]
*  I think I remember going I remember it's very scary when you're around people that are [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7967.14s)]
*  you know like that and I [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7972.78s)]
*  Never forgot it because I was pretty naive as most of us are coming up because I had been around a good family and stuff [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7976.06s)]
*  Like that and I saw how ugly and dangerous [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7982.02s)]
*  some men can be especially when nobody's looking and [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7987.26s)]
*  It I never forgot the idea especially in the areas that you grew up. That's right [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7992.06s)]
*  I mean, well, I lived in remember also I was in the war in Lebanon, right? [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7995.820000000001s)]
*  So I think you I was I left in I was I left Lebanon when I was I [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=7999.38s)]
*  Went to I was I was 11 years old. Yeah, so just imagine [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8007.1s)]
*  Experiencing that as a 10 year old boy. Yeah, and then I went back remember I went back when I was I think 15 [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8011.46s)]
*  16 and I didn't recognize anything for my childhood [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8018.22s)]
*  So I was in Lebanon for five years [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8020.820000000001s)]
*  And so I had wonderful memories and then the war broke out and we were stuck [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8022.62s)]
*  My father couldn't get back in because he [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8026.74s)]
*  He was and then we got evacuated [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8029.46s)]
*  But I was living in the in the holiday inn for six months and we had to sleep on the floor [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8031.3s)]
*  And then finally we had we had to go down into the fucking underground parking lot [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8036.0599999999995s)]
*  Because they were bombing and you would wake up and you would hear machine guns and stuff [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8039.86s)]
*  So you felt very out of sorts and very very it was very scary, you know, you're a kid [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8044.24s)]
*  You know, and I remember seeing on a balcony. I remember seeing planes bomb a gas station. I never forgot it [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8048.98s)]
*  I never forgot seeing the planes come in and the the missiles dropped and just you know [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8054.44s)]
*  And and the sound dude the sound and I don't know if anybody anybody's been in war knows this [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8059.259999999999s)]
*  But I was on the beach. I was on Coral Beach [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8065.219999999999s)]
*  And it probably was it was in the 80s [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8068.599999999999s)]
*  I was a young young I was 14 15 16 whatever I was they shot a rocket over our head [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8071.08s)]
*  Okay, and I think it was a test fire [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8076.5599999999995s)]
*  Dude when I tell you that the sound was so loud that we all fell on the ground [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8079.36s)]
*  I fell down on the sand the sound was so disoriented that that you everybody went down on their hands and knees [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8084.799999999999s)]
*  That's how loud it was over your head and I think that that that when you are in that kind of proximity to [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8090.719999999999s)]
*  Violence like that and then later on when I was older I was around some some people who were pretty rough [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8098.4s)]
*  You know and for me, I always I knew that if the grid broke down [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8103.16s)]
*  That those people were gonna take over and there was gonna be no fucking mercy and I've never forgot that and so you could see [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8107.92s)]
*  With kovat the minute that you know law enforcement had to restrict their resources. You saw what happened looting [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8114.64s)]
*  You saw crime you saw homelessness and the fabric of a society can break down so fucking quickly [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8121.44s)]
*  People don't realize it until you've been in countries where it's happened and until you've been around [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8127.6s)]
*  Men who negotiate the world in a violent way and maybe in in ways that are a little bit outside the law [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8133.4800000000005s)]
*  You don't know what you're doing man. You you got no idea [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8140.96s)]
*  So all those people and I love when the left starts talking about you know violent revolution and you're in college kid [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8143.84s)]
*  You have no fucking idea. You don't know first of all know you're don't wake up that and don't wake up the conservative [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8151.72s)]
*  Don't do that. Let's not even talk about it because I know a lot of guys that shoot real straight [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8157.360000000001s)]
*  You know and often and yeah and often and they're very comfortable [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8162.96s)]
*  They're really good at it, and they're comfortable in those violence spaces kind of ready there. They're yeah. Yeah. Yeah, let's not [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8165.88s)]
*  Let's not let's not let those dogs slip. Have you seen John McPhee? [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8172.0s)]
*  Yeah, I have the mayor of Baghdad be a good example of a guy like yeah, that is a guy [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8176.88s)]
*  Yeah, just you know his body just comes from enforcement his traps. He just looks like a giant block [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8181.64s)]
*  Yeah, he's a he's a born enforcer. Yeah, he's not gonna win a Nobel Prize for peace [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8187.58s)]
*  No, you ever hear how Tim Kennedy talked about him like yeah, you put him in a glass case and break in case of war [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8192.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, let's keep those guys. Uh-huh. Let's keep that over here on a thank God that guy found jujitsu, too [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8197.66s)]
*  And that's why I'm an outlet yes [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8203.98s)]
*  And please understand the base of our Republic also is that we have civilian control of a military [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8205.94s)]
*  And that was a huge what in the election between I think Madison and Jefferson the idea was was it Madison or was it? [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8213.34s)]
*  Adams I can't remember but in the [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8221.38s)]
*  the election was [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8223.58s)]
*  Should we have a standing army because traditionally in a Republic if you had a standing army a very charismatic general like Napoleon would take [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8224.98s)]
*  Over the army and take over the country [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8232.74s)]
*  So that was a huge thing James Madison was a genius at figuring out how to limit that and he said checks and balances [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8234.06s)]
*  But you have to have civilian government in control of the military because military people arrive at military solutions [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8239.98s)]
*  Yeah, fucking really important man really important [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8244.56s)]
*  You don't want to fuck don't let guys like John McPhee you need him in war right God bless [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8248.02s)]
*  But let's just you know well you've had Eric Prince on your podcast very smart guy. Have you had him on no? [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8252.78s)]
*  I haven't man. I really enjoyed him. He was another guy who's talking about like what to do with Africa and I was like Jesus [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8258.34s)]
*  well [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8264.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, he used the word viceroy, and he did it on purpose. It's like [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8265.54s)]
*  he he [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8270.62s)]
*  But but but Eric comes from a position of how to solve problems [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8271.94s)]
*  When he was talking about the we're talking about Gaza [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8276.8s)]
*  He said we have the ability to frack what that means is we can drill sideways [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8280.039999999999s)]
*  He said you could have filled those tunnels with seawater instead of bombing the shit out of you know [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8283.679999999998s)]
*  70% of it and killing all those people you could have flooded those fuckers out because you you you you drill and I don't know if this [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8288.119999999999s)]
*  Is true. I don't know anything about fracking, but he does and he said you could have drilled fucking this way [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8294.64s)]
*  Fill take the Mediterranean fill all those tunnels with seawater [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8301.640000000001s)]
*  And they would have had to come up and you would have been just fine and just position people [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8305.36s)]
*  You know when they come out of the water why didn't they choose that? [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8309.84s)]
*  a [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8313.480000000001s)]
*  Good question the same reason that in Afghanistan they had an oil they had an oil reserve there in Afghanistan [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8314.560000000001s)]
*  That was well capped by the Soviets well capped [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8320.880000000001s)]
*  We could have taken that cap off and that oil they had enough oil to not only fuel the entire country [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8324.2s)]
*  But the whole war effort right there for about nine cents a gallon [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8330.72s)]
*  But instead we would get our oil from Saudi Arabia, etc and have to ship it through Pakistan [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8333.8s)]
*  With all the roadblocks. It was about 900 bucks a gallon or some crazy shit [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8342.48s)]
*  He was on my thing talking about says he presented a plan to do it blocked by the Pentagon [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8346.22s)]
*  Smart dude [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8352.14s)]
*  Provided that Israelis a fully funded donated [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8355.599999999999s)]
*  Ability to flood Gaza with water with seawater to flood the 300 miles of tunnels [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8359.32s)]
*  Blocked by the Pentagon our stuff isn't working that well in Ukraine [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8365.12s)]
*  The Navy has been ineffective in Yemen [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8369.6s)]
*  US has given very bad advice very mixed advice in Gaza [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8373.08s)]
*  preventing the Israelis from finishing it or even preventing from [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8377.68s)]
*  Ending that war in a clever way [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8381.04s)]
*  Yeah, he's very smart and and and Eric is he's a problem solver you can say whatever you want about him [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8383.52s)]
*  But I really enjoy he's a very smart guy and I know people that work with him and for him and well the shit goes down [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8389.04s)]
*  You need people like that. You need people that know how to solve problems. Yeah. Yeah, but also you know you can't have some [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8396.92s)]
*  Overweight lesbian that says that if you're trapped in the building [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8404.04s)]

*  Just just so you can outrage me. I certainly have it in here. I [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8417.28s)]
*  Know I can find it if you just give me a moment [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8426.960000000001s)]
*  It's just it's so ridiculous. You hear saying like what are you even saying? Here it is. I found it [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8430.560000000001s)]

*  House your emergency whether it's a medical call or a fire call that looks like you it gives that person a little bit more ease [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8462.2s)]
*  Knowing that somebody might understand their situation better if she's strong enough to do this or you couldn't carry my husband out of a fire [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8468.980000000001s)]
*  Which my response is he got himself in the wrong place if I have to carry him out of a fire. Oh [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8475.980000000001s)]
*  Wow, that's how that is such a crazy way to look at things [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8481.54s)]
*  The correct answer is no I cannot but I can do other things [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8486.300000000001s)]
*  Right. Yeah, and we are gonna need people that can carry people out of buildings because that is a part of the job [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8490.34s)]
*  Yeah, it's not he got himself only if you want to save lives. Yeah, but again, this is [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8496.0s)]
*  Social justice ideology over [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8502.199999999999s)]
*  Asian ideology over effectiveness ideology over utility [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8504.92s)]
*  one of things we saw during the 2024 election is massive chunks of California turned red that had never been read before and [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8509.32s)]
*  I suspect that that trend will continue and be even further and flip the top [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8515.96s)]
*  You can do people, you know, they're not stupid Americans they reached a boring point [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8521.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think we're gonna get to a point where they wake up and you're gonna have to have someone come in and clean up the mess [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8525.8s)]
*  I think the greatest so it's gonna have to be like socially liberal [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8531.72s)]
*  but fiscally conservative and pragmatic and realistic, but they're gonna have to like [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8536.48s)]
*  Be a person like you or I who like supports gay rights sports women's rights sports equal rights, like of course, but also [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8542.16s)]
*  The thing is don't hire people that aren't qualified for a job because you don't want to hire white people. That's crazy [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8549.68s)]
*  Hire everybody that's qualified and then make everybody else more qualified go to the make everybody rate [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8556.0s)]
*  Rot rise to the same. Yes, why sports are great, right? [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8562.2s)]
*  Figure out a way to fix all your fucking urban problems [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8564.880000000001s)]
*  If you have 24 billion dollars every year just for homelessness [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8567.880000000001s)]
*  Imagine what that could have been done to clean up communities [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8571.44s)]
*  Exactly, because you haven't done a goddamn thing about homelessness and all those people should be held accountable [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8573.76s)]
*  Well, that's because they again they're framing the problem wrong if you talk to those people [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8578.28s)]
*  You talk to the people in charge of homelessness a lot of time [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8582.960000000001s)]
*  I'm not saying a lot of them are look a lot of them are good people and a lot of them are smart [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8586.24s)]
*  And they know a lot more about it than I do so I don't like being the guy who's talking about like I but I'm just [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8589.76s)]
*  Saying I like to be fair. I want to be fair, but I think when you're framing it just as a housing problem [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8594.08s)]
*  It's a lie problem. It's a fucking lie. It's a bunch of people profiting [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8599.6s)]
*  I mean, Coley on noir when he was on the podcast explained that to me [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8603.2s)]
*  He said when he was in San Francisco, he said what is going on? Do they just need more money? [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8606.720000000001s)]
*  He's like, no, you don't understand. It's the opposite [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8610.56s)]
*  It's like there's a business now in keeping homelessness there because there's people that are making quarter quarter million dollars a year and they're [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8612.4s)]
*  They're just working on the homeless problem and they're failing. We got 31,000 new homeless people this year [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8619.76s)]
*  It's just failure and you know, California was always including under [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8625.48s)]
*  Democratic governors, California was always known as a place that was run by the people [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8629.960000000001s)]
*  That was run very very well with really responsible civic employees for a long time under Reardon and that and stuff and then yeah [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8635.56s)]
*  Well, it's collapsing under the weight of its own bullshit. Oh, that's it. So I had I had [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8642.68s)]
*  I was with Arnold Schwarzenegger and I asked him what was it like to be governor and [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8648.84s)]
*  One of the things I got was that how little power he he was not able to get a lot of things done [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8652.72s)]
*  But I'll give you a classic example [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8657.119999999999s)]
*  He said and I'm sorry if I'm paraphrasing but he said something he said [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8658.039999999999s)]
*  There was a water issue and he said these farmers over here are not using all that water so here's ready [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8661.34s)]
*  Here's what you do. Just take the water. They're not using and give it to this this part of the state over here [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8667.98s)]
*  It's not big deal. Just pipe it over here and his senators said [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8674.82s)]
*  Mr. Governor, I can't do that. He said why he goes because now you're asking me to go and ask my constituents [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8679.26s)]
*  To give up some of their water they're gonna use that against me in my next election [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8686.02s)]
*  So he goes so so Schwarzenegger goes so then what the fuck are we gonna do and he goes here's what you're gonna [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8691.62s)]
*  Do you're gonna make a speech and you're gonna say exactly what you just said to us and we're gonna say yes [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8696.26s)]
*  But then we're not gonna really let it happen [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8702.86s)]
*  And he goes that's how this works. He goes how you're learning baby. That's fucking California state [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8705.3s)]
*  Well, that is where Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy come in [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8711.54s)]
*  Maybe Department of Government Efficiency maybe for sure. Maybe I don't know what they're gonna be able to get done. Let me give an example. So [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8715.279999999999s)]
*  Pete Hegseth seems like a great guy. I'm a fan [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8722.92s)]

*  I'm sure he'll be a very effective [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8737.359999999999s)]
*  Secretary of Defense. However, that job this this DOD I think has [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8739.599999999999s)]
*  a [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8744.92s)]
*  million point one employees and a budget of [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8746.16s)]
*  750 billion dollars maybe eight hundred and fifty billion dollars now just that is a massive [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8750.119999999999s)]
*  Massive company essentially and that requires [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8756.8s)]
*  Management on a different level that skill set is very specific and very very difficult and very strange [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8760.72s)]
*  It doesn't mean that because you are a great soldier you can necessarily do that and I'm saying I'm not I'm just using it [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8767.16s)]
*  So we have to get down to brass tacks and take politics out of this and get real fucking practical with all this stuff [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8773.720000000001s)]
*  I think with Elon Musk and with Vivek Ramaswamy [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8779.160000000002s)]
*  The US government is a very complicated organism and massive and does a lot of shit [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8782.76s)]
*  None of us even know about you know [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8787.980000000001s)]

*  Who keeps who who keeps? [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8796.04s)]
*  Falcons on hand at most airports [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8798.320000000002s)]
*  Peregrine Falcons, you know who does the Department of Agriculture? You know why because they're territorial birds [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8800.720000000001s)]
*  They keep all the other birds out of the airfield [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8806.12s)]
*  You know how to do that because I don't [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8807.720000000001s)]
*  Who gets sheep to graze at a higher altitude because of global warming and they don't want to graze when it's really hot [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8809.36s)]
*  I don't know but we have to do that if you want mutton and fucking wool and there are signs that to figure that out [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8815.580000000002s)]
*  They're not political [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8820.26s)]
*  There's a thousand things who manages all that nuclear waste in the ground and make sure it doesn't get into the Columbia River and the [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8821.0s)]

*  This is all who keeps track, please [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8830.12s)]
*  I'd like to know of all these spent uranium rods sir that are used in all our [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8832.56s)]
*  Diagnostic machines because if you detonate one of those motherfuckers over the Super Bowl you have to clear out that city for 20 years [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8837.960000000001s)]
*  The Department of Energy is the answer. That's a Buddha judge. He's doing a great job [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8844.32s)]
*  That's an Eno transportation transportation it was the guy who stole women's clothes [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8850.92s)]
*  Mmm, yeah, he's the nuclear secretary. Yeah, he was responsible [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8855.519999999999s)]
*  That's a they piece of sorry don't miss gender that's the most important thing that fuck don't miss gender that thief [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8861.199999999999s)]
*  Jesus Christ, you understand what I'm saying? Yes, so it's beyond complicated. Yeah, unbelievably complicated [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8866.439999999999s)]
*  And so Michael Lewis wrote a book called the fifth risk about this a good book short very worth reading very fucking worth reading [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8873.4s)]
*  I walk around talking about being a libertarian as usual [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8879.839999999998s)]
*  I don't really know what government does it I was so kind of humbled by the book because I was like [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8882.560000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of shit I rely on [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8886.92s)]
*  The people who are needy people are very elderly people who are disabled who live in places where they can't get food our food [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8889.36s)]
*  Banks feed those people meals on wheels is a really big thing [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8895.4s)]
*  So there's a lot of shit that the government does and we feed a lot of people that couldn't feed themselves [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8898.4s)]
*  Otherwise, so we have to be careful about not throwing the baby out with the bathwater and once again take politics out of it [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8903.6s)]
*  Let's approach everything like it's a problem and stay agnostic about this shit [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8909.48s)]
*  And sometimes you might have to be a little left [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8913.68s)]
*  Sometimes you might have to be a little right respond to the fucking evidence and and and be humble about the fact that every time you step [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8915.6s)]
*  Into a problem. You may not know anything and that's what I try to do Brian Callan for governor fucking why don't you write? [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8922.96s)]
*  I hope you guys wrote that shit down. Where's my camera? You don't need to write it down, bro [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8928.359999999999s)]
*  You just said it from the heart. Fuck. Yeah, dude. Yeah, bro fucking hilarious [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8931.6s)]
*  Yeah, why don't you be a governor my buddy my buddy last time I did my pockets [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8935.119999999999s)]
*  He goes like this he goes from toehold he goes hey dude loved your Rogan podcast next time you're on the biggest podcast in [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8938.32s)]
*  The world make sure you talk about the fucking Bible some more [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8944.96s)]
*  He goes it's interesting. Yeah, I'm into that. I had that Wesley Huff guy on you know, he is [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8949.24s)]
*  Yeah [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8954.56s)]
*  He was really interesting and one of the most fascinating things that I can't stop thinking about is how the book of Isaiah [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8955.039999999999s)]
*  from the Dead Sea Scrolls was [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8961.72s)]
*  Verbatim the same as the book of Isaiah that they found a thousand years later [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8964.68s)]
*  Wow a thousand years and it was exact word-for-word [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8968.86s)]
*  Yeah, like that's incredible. It's not only incredible, but I always think the fact that the Bible endures [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8974.4s)]
*  Is it yeah, it's very interesting it endures it. I always go back to like what were they trying to do? [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8979.88s)]
*  What was it really all about? Where did it start? Yeah, I have an opinion tell me [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8986.4s)]
*  I think that if you read the Old Testament, which I've done three times [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8990.640000000001s)]
*  The I would argue that so what what's the theme of any anybody any any author writes a book? [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=8996.04s)]
*  The theme is always the audience the authors argument for how one should behave in the world [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9002.960000000001s)]
*  Okay [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9007.36s)]
*  It's a good way of looking at it and I think that the central theme of the Bible of the Old Testament [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9007.880000000001s)]
*  Certainly is don't worship false gods [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9014.56s)]
*  So what's that mean if you try to worship false gods if you if you if you put too much emphasis on money on [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9017.04s)]
*  status on power whatever it is on ideology [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9023.24s)]
*  You you will you will inevitably turn yourself into a circle. You'll be a snake eating its own tail [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9026.92s)]
*  For whatever reason human beings have a very hard time [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9033.2s)]
*  Inventing and creating their own gods and we always do it [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9037.52s)]
*  What what what there is what the value of having a transcendent truth of something that you can't measure [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9040.72s)]
*  It's very interesting that you can't measure it that you even when so so what why are the Muslims? [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9047.84s)]
*  Why are the the Orthodox Jews not have any kind of like picture of God? [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9053.0s)]
*  It's because you're putting a measurement around God [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9056.48s)]
*  You're trying to define God and that's not for you to do and there's something very valuable [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9058.6s)]
*  I'm not about not being able to do that because that transcendent truth is not for you to understand [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9062.0s)]
*  Necessarily it is for you to reach for it is for you to be reverent of it's for you to understand that something is watching [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9067.96s)]
*  You that you will never get away with anything and I'll quote Jordan Peterson [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9073.64s)]
*  I love it because I've always thought this and I think you agree with this [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9077.279999999999s)]
*  You don't get away with anything and you'll pay in full for everything you've done and haven't done [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9079.92s)]
*  It's a great way of looking at things. Maybe it's wrong, but it's a good way to at least it's it's keep that in mind [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9083.92s)]
*  I think you pay psychologically no matter what hundred percent when you're not telling the people right and that the people that don't [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9089.56s)]
*  Those are the people that are the most [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9096.48s)]
*  Delusional and the most disconnected because they put blinders on as to who they are and what they've done [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9099.0s)]
*  I mean see this when people get caught for horrible crimes [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9105.12s)]
*  And they you know they can't like Bernie Madoff type people like they've diluted themselves to a point where they've they've they don't look at [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9107.92s)]
*  They're complete sociopaths [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9115.28s)]
*  Which is a weird path that the mind can go into where you're never wrong and it's always about you [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9117.56s)]
*  Well also like I always people talk about God I kind of like replacing it with truth [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9124.38s)]
*  So just just try to stay close to the truth man, and it's hard sometimes true. There's really fucking inconvenient [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9129.179999999998s)]
*  It's really it's really it'll it might throw your whole life up in the air [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9135.179999999998s)]
*  You might have to burn off [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9139.179999999998s)]
*  You know, but but I don't think I think it's inevitable and and part of like if you see great stories [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9140.22s)]
*  You know, what's the definition of a tragedy? [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9146.099999999999s)]
*  It's the the hero or the protagonist doesn't learn from his mistakes and and and holds on [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9148.300000000001s)]
*  Moby-Dick is a tragedy because a hab will not give up on this fucking white [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9155.06s)]
*  Well that took his leg and if you read the book he just gets sucked in you'd think it'd be some dramatic thing in the book [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9160.06s)]
*  Ahab gets caught by the whale and just he just he just dies this quick [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9165.98s)]
*  Is this soundless? He just gets sucked in like wait, dude. He's been in the book the whole time [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9171.7s)]
*  That's how it happens bro, you got sucked down and the universe doesn't give a fuck you're not important [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9176.52s)]
*  You spend all that time trying to get revenge on a white whale and that thing was like he was just trying to run away [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9181.74s)]
*  It's a great way of looking at life and and I as I get older the one thing I would have told myself when I was [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9190.16s)]

*  As a comic as a human. Yeah, I didn't want to be too [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9239.06s)]
*  I didn't want to be the people I knew got real famous actors. They were so buttoned down [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9241.82s)]
*  They were so fucking afraid of everything and I was like, hey, bro [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9246.3s)]

*  Sparks of ridiculousness that have to pop into your head. So you have to be able to entertain that part of your mind [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9269.18s)]
*  I used to think when I was young that I didn't want to meditate [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9275.78s)]
*  Because I didn't want to become enlightened because it would fuck up my comedy. It's true [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9279.06s)]
*  well, I thought that way because I realized that there was a [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9282.66s)]
*  Completely different mindset between me as a martial arts competitor and me as a comedian [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9286.02s)]
*  Where I didn't need anybody's approval before like I like that. They didn't like me [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9290.740000000002s)]

*  Yeah, I just get a kick out of all because I didn't have anybody in my corner [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9299.220000000001s)]
*  I don't really cheering for me. Nobody came to see me fight [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9302.580000000002s)]
*  So I was like I'll go to your place and fuck you up. I liked it. Yeah, I liked I liked [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9305.1s)]
*  here [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9310.26s)]
*  There was one there was a fight that I had when I was 19 [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9311.740000000002s)]
*  I fought in Anaheim at the the Nationals and there was this guy was the state champion [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9315.18s)]
*  I think he was from Illinois and I hit him with a wheel kick. That was probably the hardest [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9320.48s)]
*  I've ever hit anybody in my life [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9325.74s)]
*  Well, he went unconscious and he never woke up. They took him to the hospital [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9327.74s)]
*  They took him out on a stretcher [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9330.98s)]
*  It scared the shit out of me because I remember thinking that easily could have been me [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9333.06s)]
*  Yeah, that easily could have been me but what I do remember was all these people were cheering them. Let's go Johnny [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9338.26s)]
*  Come on Johnny fuck him up Johnny. All these people trying to work [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9343.36s)]
*  silence [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9347.6s)]
*  Face plant and then snoring Jesus Christ and then I remember the satisfaction of that like shut [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9349.84s)]
*  It feels like nothing on your foot. It's cool. It's her. I was limping really days. Really? Oh, yeah [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9357.32s)]
*  I hit him in the with that with my heel in his cheek Christ on his cheekbone [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9362.84s)]
*  Yeah [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9368.560000000001s)]
*  But back then when I was 19 I was fast so it happened in a breeze a quick moment [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9373.560000000001s)]
*  And then I remember thinking afterwards or he when is he getting up? [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9379.44s)]
*  He's not gonna move he didn't get up and then they carried him away in the stretcher and they took him to the hospital [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9383.2s)]
*  And I never felt the same way about fighting again after that. Yeah, because that could have been you. Yeah [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9387.84s)]
*  I also thought about like if that was me [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9394.08s)]
*  Would I even be the same person again after that because I had a friend who fought in this tournament? [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9397.6s)]
*  He fought this guy Jersey long who was this Canadian national champion and he got axe kicked in the head [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9402.8s)]
*  Hard and he went unconscious and real bad and he was never the same guy again. He's timid after that [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9407.679999999998s)]
*  He never fought well. Yeah, he was he didn't show up for training a lot. He was just well just like seemed depressed [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9414.279999999999s)]
*  that's why I think fighters who can who have longevity are very special because [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9420.0s)]
*  one of the things you know if you like this box or [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9424.16s)]
*  Taekwondo, especially people don't realize that people get would get knocked out all the time in our studio [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9426.96s)]
*  Yeah, but but also boxing like when you get hit hard and you have trouble chewing for like two weeks or you get hit [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9431.52s)]
*  Like like when I was sparring a lot, I I would get hit man [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9438.76s)]

*  Is to get out of your own to get out of the way to get out of the way like that's a lot of life [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9479.0s)]
*  Yeah, you should disappear. Yeah, I heard a sports psychologist say that he teaches baseball players [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9483.68s)]
*  He would teach them he would do this mantra which was one to get out of the way [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9489.02s)]
*  So when you're trying to hit a ball, it's really precise and you can't be overthinking [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9493.38s)]

*  And he said every shaman ever had gone through some kind of a mental breakdown usually in their teens [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9709.3s)]
*  And they came out of it because they had a society a village that helped them through it that sort of like [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw&t=9716.3s)]
