# Joe Rogan Experience #1981 - Pauly Shore
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=6.0s)]
*  So, you're fine, dude. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=10.0s)]
*  It's okay. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=13.0s)]
*  Come on, man. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=14.0s)]
*  Burt crashed his head twice. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=15.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=16.0s)]
*  He wears them. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=17.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=18.0s)]
*  You can adjust it, too. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=19.0s)]
*  I feel like I'm going up to the mothership with these things. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=20.0s)]
*  Dude, you fucking killed it, the mothership. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=22.0s)]
*  That was the funniest I've ever seen. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=26.0s)]
*  You were so loose and so silly. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=27.0s)]
*  It was fun to see, man. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=29.0s)]
*  First of all, you could tell you've been doing stand-up. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=30.0s)]
*  You looked super comfortable. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=33.0s)]
*  But you were so loose. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=35.0s)]
*  It's stand-up, as you know, is a rhythm. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=37.0s)]
*  And you just kind of figure it out when you're on stage, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=42.0s)]
*  and you never know what the fuck's going to happen. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=44.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=46.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=47.0s)]
*  That night was just, you know, David was nice enough to let me on his show. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=48.0s)]
*  And after I put my finger under his boob sweat, I went like this. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=53.0s)]
*  I like to do that a lot. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=58.0s)]
*  And then he's got sweaty brows. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=60.0s)]
*  And I did like that, and it got me excited. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=62.0s)]
*  Firm bones. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=64.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=65.0s)]
*  And then I went and then I saw Montgomery, and he had his flip his hair over. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=66.0s)]
*  And then I punched Hans in the stomach, and then I got on stage. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=71.0s)]
*  It was all happening. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=74.0s)]
*  Perfect sequence of events. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=75.0s)]
*  So, no, it's, you know, what you said up there, it's, you know, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=77.0s)]
*  it's in my veins. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=82.0s)]
*  It's really in my veins. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=83.0s)]
*  Like, just the second I walked in that room, I just felt this focus. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=85.0s)]
*  And that's what I said to you. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=90.0s)]
*  I just really feel like there's a focus there. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=91.0s)]
*  Well, that club was a rock and roll club. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=94.0s)]
*  I mean, you see the picture that's in the tunnel when you walk onto the stage? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=97.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=102.0s)]
*  When you see the big picture of Steve Ray Vaughan? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=103.0s)]
*  That's him performing on that stage in 1983. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=104.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the old Alamo draft house. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=107.0s)]
*  It was only the Alamo draft house from the, I think it was like 2007 on. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=110.0s)]
*  Before that, it had been a bunch of things. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=115.0s)]
*  It was a pool hall at one point in time. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=117.0s)]
*  It was a nudie movie theater at one point in time. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=119.0s)]
*  It was a punk rock club. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=122.0s)]
*  Like all the posters that you see that are in the green room, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=123.0s)]
*  those are all posters of people performing at the Ritz. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=126.0s)]
*  It's all like the Misfits. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=130.0s)]
*  So it was the Ritz before the Alamo. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=132.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=134.0s)]
*  Oh, it's been the Ritz since 1927. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=135.0s)]
*  It has to stay the Ritz. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=137.0s)]
*  No matter what it is, that sign, the Ritz, always exists because it's a historical landmark. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=138.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=143.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=144.0s)]
*  Well, you gutted it out though. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=147.0s)]
*  I mean, you allowed to say how much money you spent on it? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=149.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, I'm allowed to say it. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=152.0s)]
*  Oh, you don't say it? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=154.0s)]
*  Well, no. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=155.0s)]
*  Okay, well, you spent a lot of money on it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=156.0s)]
*  Yeah, you had to spend money. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=158.0s)]
*  And those two stages were- [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=159.0s)]
*  You have to pay construction people. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=160.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, I get it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=161.0s)]
*  Yeah, they did a great job. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=164.0s)]
*  They fucking nailed it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=165.0s)]
*  Were there two stages before? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=166.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=168.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=169.0s)]
*  They had converted it when they converted it to the movie theater. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=170.0s)]
*  I think that's when they turned it into two rooms. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=172.0s)]
*  Huh. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=174.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=175.0s)]
*  I don't know how they did it, but we have the same architect, fortunately. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=176.0s)]
*  So he knew exactly all the bones- [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=179.0s)]
*  The beams and all that stuff. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=181.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, all that stuff. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=182.0s)]
*  Where are the electricals? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=183.0s)]
*  Yeah, so there's this thing that's happening, and obviously I've been in it my whole life, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=184.0s)]
*  since I was four. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=191.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=193.0s)]
*  And first of all, I'm so proud of you. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=194.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=199.0s)]
*  I see you sometimes, and we give each other hugs. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=200.0s)]
*  I say, I love you, but I don't get to say how proud I am of you. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=203.0s)]
*  I've seen you my whole, for years, and on behalf of my mom, too, because I know how [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=207.0s)]
*  much you love her, and I know how much she means to you, and I know how far you've come. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=217.0s)]
*  I know how far you've come, because I remember when you first stepped at the store, and I [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=224.0s)]
*  remember seeing you in Boston, and I remember, because we're the same age, and we came up [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=229.0s)]
*  at the same time. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=233.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=234.0s)]
*  And I'm so proud of you, dude. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=235.0s)]
*  That's very nice, man. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=236.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=237.0s)]
*  And when I saw you on that stage at MGM, when you worked with Chappelle, I was like, this [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=238.0s)]
*  guy's fucking funny. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=242.0s)]
*  Like, really funny, dude. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=244.0s)]
*  And I'm not just saying that because you become this massive business, and you're just this... [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=246.0s)]
*  I'm saying that from comic to comic. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=255.0s)]
*  I'm really proud of you. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=257.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=258.0s)]
*  I appreciate it, man. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=259.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=260.0s)]
*  And you're funny, dude. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=261.0s)]
*  Well, no, for real, because I've seen it all. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=263.0s)]
*  I've seen the best. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=266.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=267.0s)]
*  I see you on stage. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=268.0s)]
*  I see Kennison. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=269.0s)]
*  I've seen Kennison. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=270.0s)]
*  I've seen Prior. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=271.0s)]
*  I've seen Eddie. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=272.0s)]
*  I've seen all these guys at their best. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=273.0s)]
*  And then when I saw you at MGM, I'm like, fuck, dude. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=274.0s)]
*  You're really in the pocket. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=277.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=280.0s)]
*  You're not pushing it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=281.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=282.0s)]
*  And it's great. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=283.0s)]
*  Well, I've been doing a lot of sets, and moving out to here, it kind of changed everything. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=284.0s)]
*  Because first of all, I realized how important the store was. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=288.0s)]
*  I knew I was going to live out here, but having a community and having a place where you get [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=291.0s)]
*  to see people do sets all the time, and you work with killers all the time. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=299.0s)]
*  On the road, the thing is you don't really work with other people that much. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=304.0s)]
*  You work with the two people that you bring with you, or one person that you bring with you. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=307.0s)]
*  And you're not in the mix with all the killers. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=311.0s)]
*  And I think that that's very critical to what we do. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=315.0s)]
*  Well, that's what you've done out here. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=318.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was the thing to do. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=320.0s)]
*  It was the thing to do. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=322.0s)]
*  There were so many comics that had decided to move here. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=323.0s)]
*  And a lot of them knew that I tried to do it at another place and it didn't work out. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=326.0s)]
*  So that was like a big delay. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=332.0s)]
*  That took like an extra year. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=334.0s)]
*  It took a long-ass time. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=336.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Hans, Montgomery, David Lucas, working with Tony, and just seeing these guys grow, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=338.0s)]
*  and now they're fucking headlining shows. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=347.0s)]
*  I mean, it's fucking dope. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=349.0s)]
*  Derek Poston, you've seen Derek and Assangement. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=351.0s)]
*  Those guys are killing it. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=353.0s)]
*  They're so much tighter. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=354.0s)]
*  And they're doing so many sets. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=355.0s)]
*  Because we're doing two shows a night in both rooms. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=357.0s)]
*  So there's two shows in each room. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=360.0s)]
*  So they're getting all this stage time. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=362.0s)]
*  There's open mic nights, two nights a week, just like the store. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=365.0s)]
*  I talked to Lucas at the store who works at the bar, and I'm like, dude, you got to just move out to Austin, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=368.0s)]
*  because this is happening out here. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=374.0s)]
*  Lucas Earl, he's a funny dude. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=376.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's very funny. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=377.0s)]
*  And he's a nice guy and he cares. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=378.0s)]
*  And like you just said, your guys are becoming monsters on stage, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=381.0s)]
*  and a lot of it has to do with the platform that you gave them. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=386.0s)]
*  And I love the fact that you put the phones in the purses. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=390.0s)]
*  They put the phones in the... [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=395.0s)]
*  The underbags. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=397.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's fucking... [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=398.0s)]
*  I think every comedy club should do that. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=399.0s)]
*  That is a definite sense of freedom. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=401.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's that, too. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=403.0s)]
*  And it also keeps people from being distracted. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=405.0s)]
*  People are just so addicted to their fucking phones. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=407.0s)]
*  It makes the show better. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=410.0s)]
*  I wanted to put this in a yonder here, and it's off. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=411.0s)]
*  I still want to fucking throw it. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=415.0s)]
*  One of the things I've learned from doing this podcast is that it's really the only time during the day [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=417.0s)]
*  where I get to sit for a few hours and not look at my phone. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=424.0s)]
*  I'm always just checking my email, checking my text message, responding to text messages I haven't responded to yet, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=428.0s)]
*  trying to keep up with email. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=434.0s)]
*  It's overwhelming. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=436.0s)]
*  Yeah, I just did a five-day pretty intense group therapy that I've been involved with since I was 19 years old [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=438.0s)]
*  and deals with a lot of trauma, different things like that. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=444.0s)]
*  And I'm actually a staff. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=449.0s)]
*  I kind of help people out with the stuff they go through. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=451.0s)]
*  And in return, when you help people out, you get help, too. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=454.0s)]
*  For instance, for me, I've been doing it since I was 19. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=458.0s)]
*  And it's a five-day program, and it just helped me deal with the trauma, my parents' passing, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=464.0s)]
*  and just different things that have happened personally in my life. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=470.0s)]
*  Because I know when I was on here last time, I was talking about the career and this and that [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=475.0s)]
*  and all these different things. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=480.0s)]
*  And a lot of those things that happen to us as people and people listening aren't who we are. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=482.0s)]
*  It's things that have happened to us that we become angry or become sad or we become depressed. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=489.0s)]
*  But it's not who we are, because who we are, we start off as innocent babies. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=495.0s)]
*  We go into the world and all these fucked up things happen to us. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=500.0s)]
*  And the stuff with my family and the store and my mom, I'm not just a whatever guy. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=505.0s)]
*  I'm not Donald Trump. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=511.0s)]
*  Even though probably underneath it, he's probably fucked up. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=513.0s)]
*  You're not a turtle shell. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=517.0s)]
*  Yeah, I have this emotion. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=519.0s)]
*  I got that from my mom and my dad. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=521.0s)]
*  And it's hard. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=523.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? It's hard. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=525.0s)]
*  So I feel pretty good, and it's difficult. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=527.0s)]
*  But I want to look into the future, my next 30 years, and I just want to try to be joyful. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=533.0s)]
*  And my thing is half full. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=540.0s)]
*  A lot of us in life, we always look at other people. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=544.0s)]
*  And we're always going, oh, I can look at Adam Sandler. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=547.0s)]
*  I can look at all these guys that are just, or I can look at the fact of what I have. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=551.0s)]
*  And I'm not the only one. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=556.0s)]
*  I think everyone should think about that, because especially, like you said, with social media, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=559.0s)]
*  everyone compares themselves, how many people are watching, how many people like us, and all that shit. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=565.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's so fucked up for kids. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=572.0s)]
*  Because they're just constantly comparing each other's likes and who's got more followers. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=574.0s)]
*  And they're all competing against each other. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=581.0s)]
*  And then you hear about these kids that are like YouTube stars that are 14, 15 years old. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=583.0s)]
*  And they've got millions of followers. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=588.0s)]
*  Like, what's the youngest YouTube star that has a giant following? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=590.0s)]
*  These kids are essentially getting like, an attitude. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=595.0s)]
*  And then there's the toys. He's probably, wasn't he like seven and he had like... [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=598.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, that guy's insane. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=600.0s)]
*  Maybe he's 10 now. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=602.0s)]
*  Yeah, that guy, that's insane. That little kid probably can't go anywhere. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=603.0s)]
*  Imagine him trying to go to the park. All the little kids probably freak out. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=606.0s)]
*  Where's the toys, bitch? What'd you do with the extra toys? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=609.0s)]
*  But what about you? I mean, you're, you've really, like, I mean, you've, I mean, you know, I've seen it. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=612.0s)]
*  Everyone has seen it. You've just really, I mean, you've, how do people, how do people get to you? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=619.0s)]
*  It's difficult. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=624.0s)]
*  No, but you know what I'm saying? How do you, like, for instance, like, you don't have a booker on this show. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=626.0s)]
*  Well, I do. But I don't, like, I choose. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=631.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're the booker. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=636.0s)]
*  Yeah, but it's not like someone, like, picks the lineup and then I go over it with them. No. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=637.0s)]
*  So, like, for instance, like, Nicolas Cage is my next-door neighbor in Las Vegas. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=643.0s)]
*  Like, he's a friend. I've known him for many years. Like, how would he get to you if he wanted to be on the show? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=647.0s)]
*  Oh, I'd love to have him on. I love that guy. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=651.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=653.0s)]
*  He's awesome. I saw a video they did about his house in Vegas. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=654.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, 60 Minutes, right? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=657.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's awesome. I love that guy. I met him once a long time ago at a boxing gym. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=659.0s)]
*  He was there with his son. His son was taking lessons at this boxing gym that I used to work out in in Hollywood. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=664.0s)]
*  Super nice guy. But it was a weird one, you know. It was like, whoa, that's Nicolas Cage just hanging out in the boxing gym with his kid. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=671.0s)]
*  So how do people like that get to you to get on this show? Just like this? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=678.0s)]
*  Just like this. He texts you, you text me, hey, what's up? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=682.0s)]
*  Okay, right, right. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=685.0s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=686.0s)]
*  He would be great on your show. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=687.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, he'd be awesome. He's a fun dude. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=688.0s)]
*  He's fucking, I mean... [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=690.0s)]
*  That Nicolas Cage movie, what was it? What was the actual, I don't know if I fucked the title, but him and Pedro Pascal. Oh my God, that movie's good. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=691.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's a... [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=699.0s)]
*  He's fantastic. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=700.0s)]
*  The unbearable weight of massive talent. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=701.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=702.0s)]
*  So good. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=703.0s)]
*  I see it, because Marc Maron I see at the store all the time, and he's always like, you know, you're Nicolas Cage, your next door neighbor. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=704.0s)]
*  You know, I wanted to see the podcast, and I'm like, and I text Nick, I'm like, yo, my friend Marc Maron wants to be on the podcast, and he didn't text me back. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=712.0s)]
*  So, I mean, not to diss Marc Maron, I don't know, maybe he was just too busy. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=723.0s)]
*  Maybe he went on a retreat. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=728.0s)]
*  The what? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=729.0s)]
*  A retreat. Maybe he put his phone down for a week. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=730.0s)]
*  Yeah, he put his... [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=732.0s)]
*  He did one of those things. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=733.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=734.0s)]
*  Could be. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=735.0s)]
*  So, I think you'd be great on this. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=736.0s)]
*  I would definitely... [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=738.0s)]
*  If I know any people that I think that you would like, I'll pass it to you. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=739.0s)]
*  Yeah, definitely, please do. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=742.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=743.0s)]
*  So, yeah. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=744.0s)]
*  It's a weird thing to have like this sort of a show. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=745.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=750.0s)]
*  But I gotta keep doing it the way I've always done it. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=751.0s)]
*  This is the way I've always done it. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=753.0s)]
*  This is when you started in the basement with Red Band, right? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=754.0s)]
*  Well, we were in a... [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=757.0s)]
*  You were in your couch, right? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=758.0s)]
*  On my couch, and then we moved to... [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=760.0s)]
*  I had a spare bedroom that I'd converted into an office. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=762.0s)]
*  So, then we converted my office into the podcast studio. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=765.0s)]
*  So, it was half my office, half was the podcast studio. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=769.0s)]
*  It was like so rudimentary. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=772.0s)]
*  Dude, it was so like Wayne and Garth, you know, right? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=774.0s)]
*  Just like in the basement. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=778.0s)]
*  You know what it was? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=779.0s)]
*  It was the response to... [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=780.0s)]
*  I always wanted... [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=782.0s)]
*  I loved the hang of being on those morning talk shows, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=784.0s)]
*  but I knew that nobody would ever give me one. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=787.0s)]
*  And I probably wasn't good at it anyway. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=789.0s)]
*  Like, podcasting was like anything else, I think. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=791.0s)]
*  I think you get better at it the more you do it. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=793.0s)]
*  If you go back and listen to my early ones, I was terrible. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=795.0s)]
*  Just, you get better at it. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=797.0s)]
*  And I think that what we missed was like the Opie and Anthony hang. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=799.0s)]
*  You do the Opie and Anthony show, it was a bunch of comics [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=804.0s)]
*  just sitting around talking shit about things. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=806.0s)]
*  It was so fun. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=808.0s)]
*  So, do you ever prepare for your interviews? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=809.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, for sure. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=812.0s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=813.0s)]
*  Yeah, depending on who they are. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=814.0s)]
*  Right, so did you prepare for this? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=815.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=816.0s)]
*  You're my friend. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=817.0s)]
*  He's like, fuck that guy. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=818.0s)]
*  I don't have to prepare for you. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=819.0s)]
*  This is gonna fuck. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=820.0s)]
*  I have to prepare for things like... [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=821.0s)]
*  Oh, like scientists and things like that. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=822.0s)]
*  Yeah, like if someone's coming on to discuss something really crazy. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=824.0s)]
*  Like, I really have to pay attention to what the questions are that I can ask. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=828.0s)]
*  Like, we had Michio Kaku was on yesterday. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=832.0s)]
*  Michio Kaku! [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=835.0s)]
*  Do you know who he is? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=836.0s)]
*  I heard about him. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=837.0s)]
*  He's a scientist, right? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=838.0s)]
*  Yeah, so he's a quantum physicist. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=839.0s)]
*  And he was on discussing quantum computing. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=841.0s)]
*  And it's so above my... [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=844.0s)]
*  I can't even open my laptop. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=846.0s)]
*  It's so above my head. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=847.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=848.0s)]
*  It's so above my head. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=849.0s)]
*  It's so hard to... [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=850.0s)]
*  He's like... [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=851.0s)]
*  He's so smart. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=853.0s)]
*  It's like he's hanging out with toddlers. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=854.0s)]
*  You know, like when he was 17 years old, he made a particle collider in his garage. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=857.0s)]
*  I don't know what a particle collider is. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=863.0s)]
*  It's miles and miles of copper tubing, and it sends something through it. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=866.0s)]
*  And he photographed antimatter in his garage with this device. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=870.0s)]
*  When he was 17. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=875.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=876.0s)]
*  Like, that's a different kind of human. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=877.0s)]
*  You know, 17, you were hanging out the store. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=879.0s)]
*  17, I was in Newton, Massachusetts, like, being a moron. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=881.0s)]
*  Like, this guy was making a particle collider in his basement or in his garage. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=885.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=890.0s)]
*  There's people that are just... [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=891.0s)]
*  They're so much smarter than you in different ways, right? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=892.0s)]
*  Like, I don't think he probably wouldn't be a great comic, but they're so... [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=896.0s)]
*  So you had to do a little research for... [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=899.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=901.0s)]
*  What's it called? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=902.0s)]
*  Michio Kaku. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=903.0s)]
*  Michio Kaku. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=904.0s)]
*  But some even more than that. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=905.0s)]
*  Like, it depends on, you know, whatever the subject is. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=907.0s)]
*  Like, some people, I want to read their book first and then have them on. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=909.0s)]
*  Just have questions. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=913.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=915.0s)]
*  And then as far as living out here now, being in Austin, Austin is very... [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=916.0s)]
*  I don't want to use the word liberal, but there's a lot of hipsters and people with skinny jeans and that stuff. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=924.0s)]
*  Is it weird being... [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=930.0s)]
*  Is it weird being... [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=931.0s)]
*  Because I don't want to say you're red or you're not red because I don't fucking know. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=932.0s)]
*  Most people think you're red. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=935.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=936.0s)]
*  Is it like you're red living in a blue city in a red state? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=937.0s)]
*  That is... [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=943.0s)]
*  Incorrect. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=944.0s)]
*  This is a blue city, but I'm not really red. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=945.0s)]
*  That's what I don't think either. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=947.0s)]
*  I'm just... [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=948.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=949.0s)]
*  I've never voted Republican in my life. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=950.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=951.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=952.0s)]
*  I think that the both systems suck, and I think that what I'm pushing back against is the crazy ideologies. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=953.0s)]
*  It has nothing to do with universal basic income. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=960.0s)]
*  It has nothing to do with welfare. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=963.0s)]
*  It has nothing to do with funding community programs and cleaning up cities. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=965.0s)]
*  I'm all for all that stuff. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=970.0s)]
*  I'm even for higher taxes if I believe the government was competent with your money. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=971.0s)]
*  It's not... [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=975.0s)]
*  I'm not... [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=976.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=977.0s)]
*  If it's higher taxes and it proves that we have less crime and the world is a safer place, that would be great. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=978.0s)]
*  But that doesn't seem like they know how to do that. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=984.0s)]
*  And it seems like when you give a lot of money to the government, they create a lot of government jobs, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=987.0s)]
*  and those government jobs make those people a lot of money. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=992.0s)]
*  We looked into the homeless situation in LA, and it's... [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=994.0s)]
*  My friend, Colleyann Noir, told me about this because he's a lawyer, and he went to San Francisco. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=999.0s)]
*  He was in San Francisco. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1005.0s)]
*  He was talking to somebody. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1006.0s)]
*  He's like, why haven't they fixed the homeless thing? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1007.0s)]
*  He's like, a funding issue? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1008.0s)]
*  And the guy was like, no, it's the opposite. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1010.0s)]
*  They make so much money. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1012.0s)]
*  The people that are in charge of dealing with the homeless situation, some of them are making more than $200,000 a year, like $240,000 a year. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1013.0s)]
*  And the homeless thing just keeps getting worse. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1021.0s)]
*  So what do you think it is? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1023.0s)]
*  It's a... [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1025.0s)]
*  Your opinion. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1026.0s)]
*  It's mental health. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1027.0s)]
*  It's people that are addicted to drugs. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1028.0s)]
*  People... [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1030.0s)]
*  There's a lot of soldiers. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1031.0s)]
*  Sadness. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1032.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, there's a lot of vets. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1033.0s)]
*  They came back and their experiences were very traumatic for them, and they never recovered. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1034.0s)]
*  And maybe they got on drugs as well. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1038.0s)]
*  There's a lot of people with mental illness. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1041.0s)]
*  They need group therapy. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1042.0s)]
*  You know, it all started during the Reagan administration, I believe. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1043.0s)]
*  Check if this is true. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1046.0s)]
*  I think during the Reagan administration, they changed what they can do in terms of mental health institutes. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1048.0s)]
*  They decided to let people out. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1056.0s)]
*  There's certain people that just... [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1059.0s)]
*  They have to be cared for. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1061.0s)]
*  They're so compromised that in a good, just society, you would care for those people. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1063.0s)]
*  And there would be a dedicated place, just like this dedicated place for people who have bad knees. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1069.0s)]
*  You go in and you get surgery. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1074.0s)]
*  They don't go, fucking walk it off, pussy. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1076.0s)]
*  Hobble around. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1078.0s)]
*  No, they have a place that's dedicated. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1079.0s)]
*  No, it's similar to AA, right? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1081.0s)]
*  I mean, AA is pretty much a place for... [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1084.0s)]
*  We all have friends that are in AA, and they go there and they have... [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1088.0s)]
*  What is it, the 10-step rules? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1092.0s)]
*  12. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1093.0s)]
*  Or 12 steps. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1094.0s)]
*  What not to do when you physically walk in a bar. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1095.0s)]
*  So here it is. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1098.0s)]
*  1981, President Ronald Reagan, who had made major efforts during his governorship, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1099.0s)]
*  to reduce funding and enlistment for California mental institutions, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1105.0s)]
*  pushed a political effort through the U.S. Congress to repeal most of MHSA. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1110.0s)]
*  The MHSA was considered landmark legislation in mental health care policy. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1116.0s)]
*  So I think what happened was when that MHSA Act got passed in 1980, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1121.0s)]
*  what happened was they just started letting people out in the streets. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1127.0s)]
*  When I was a boy, I remember a marked increase in homeless people in Boston when this happened. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1130.0s)]
*  And I remember people talking about it. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1138.0s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, they're just letting them on the street now. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1140.0s)]
*  Like, that's not caring for someone. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1143.0s)]
*  That's not being kind. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1146.0s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1147.0s)]
*  And you would see people just having screaming matches with themselves. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1148.0s)]
*  Like, they're clearly mentally ill and clearly not on medication. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1151.0s)]
*  Just screaming at people that aren't there and fighting demons and shit. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1155.0s)]
*  No, you see it on the streets. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1159.0s)]
*  So if you were president, and then serious, serious, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1160.0s)]
*  because obviously you could probably run and probably win if you wanted to. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1163.0s)]
*  I know you don't want to. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1167.0s)]
*  I'm not running for anything. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1168.0s)]
*  I know, but I'm just saying if you decided, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1170.0s)]
*  and one of your arms was mental health, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1172.0s)]
*  and that was what would you do if you were talking to say, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1178.0s)]
*  Tony Hinchcliffe was in charge of the mental health, what would you tell him to do? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1181.0s)]
*  That's the last person I'd put in charge. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1185.0s)]
*  He'd have them all killed. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1187.0s)]
*  That's true. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1188.0s)]
*  Tony Hinchcliffe would tell him, hey, guys, keep backing up. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1189.0s)]
*  We're going to take a picture. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1192.0s)]
*  On the edge of a fucking cliff. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1193.0s)]
*  So. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1195.0s)]
*  Tony Hinchcliffe's ruthless. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1196.0s)]
*  So what would you say to them? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1198.0s)]
*  It wouldn't be me, but if somebody was president, if they were going to fix this, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1200.0s)]
*  what they would do is reinstitute something like that, change, change what that was, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1203.0s)]
*  and go back not just to the old way, but even better. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1209.0s)]
*  Go back to a way where if you have someone who's mentally compromised, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1213.0s)]
*  you know they could be cared for, and we would be willing to pay for that in taxes. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1217.0s)]
*  I'm sure we would. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1221.0s)]
*  I'm sure we would. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1222.0s)]
*  If they knocked homelessness down to like a tiny, tiny fraction of what it is now, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1223.0s)]
*  and our tax dollars paid for mental health institutes, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1227.0s)]
*  who knows if that wasn't like more profitable for the overall society? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1231.0s)]
*  It probably would be. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1236.0s)]
*  It would probably be more profitable if there was less break-ins, less crime, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1237.0s)]
*  less people having overdoses in the streets, you know, less assaults, less. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1242.0s)]
*  I mean, who knows what horrific things go on in those encampments? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1247.0s)]
*  They basically have this like these chaos shanty towns in the middle of one of the [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1250.0s)]
*  biggest cities in the greatest country in the world, and everyone's just tolerating it. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1255.0s)]
*  But meanwhile, if you jaywalk on Sunset, they'll fucking arrest you. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1261.0s)]
*  Or at least they used to before. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1265.0s)]
*  So back to the AA situation, because my father, Sammy, Sammy Shaw, rest in peace, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1267.0s)]
*  he was an alcoholic, so he had to drink. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1273.0s)]
*  So it wasn't like one drink, but he had to keep going. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1276.0s)]
*  So that's what he did is he had to stop and go to AA. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1280.0s)]
*  So do you think there's something like that for people for mental health besides AA? [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1285.0s)]
*  Because there's some people that are addicted to pills or you know what I mean? [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1290.0s)]
*  Well, I think if anything, we should open up all possible options and make them legal, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1294.0s)]
*  and that would include psychedelic therapies. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1300.0s)]
*  Because I know personally many people who have done Ibogaine. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1302.0s)]
*  Ibogaine is not a fun one, apparently. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1306.0s)]
*  I haven't experienced it myself, but it's a 24-hour experience that just rips you down [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1308.0s)]
*  to the core of your being and explains to you in some strange way all the different moments [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1315.0s)]
*  in your life that have shaped you and all the different things that have become a problem. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1322.0s)]
*  People quit cigarettes like that. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1325.0s)]
*  They quit heroin like that. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1327.0s)]
*  It also does something strange to remap the mind. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1329.0s)]
*  Can you put up, is it Ibocent? [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1333.0s)]
*  Ibogaine. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1335.0s)]
*  Can you light that up so we can just stare at it for a sec? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1336.0s)]
*  Ibogaine? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1338.0s)]
*  Ibogaine, yeah. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1339.0s)]
*  And it comes from the iboga tree. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1340.0s)]
*  I think it's from Africa. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1342.0s)]
*  Is it part of the ayahuasca thing? [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1344.0s)]
*  No, it's different. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1346.0s)]
*  It's a different type of psychedelic. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1347.0s)]
*  And you think if you take that or there's been studies if you take that, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1349.0s)]
*  then you can get rid of these things? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1352.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1354.0s)]
*  Many, many, many people have gone and sought Ibogaine therapy to get rid of pills, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1355.0s)]
*  addiction to pills. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1359.0s)]
*  So then if you were president, which you're not, but you would tell your guy to say, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1360.0s)]
*  go get some Ibogaine and give it to the people in jail or something. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1365.0s)]
*  What I would say to anybody who was going to be president, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1370.0s)]
*  like maybe a Tulsi Gabbard, that would be something to do. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1372.0s)]
*  If we could institute Ibogaine, we had Ibogaine centers in this country [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1375.0s)]
*  where people could go and have these experiences. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1381.0s)]
*  I think we could create better people. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1383.0s)]
*  We'd have less people that are addicted to pills. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1385.0s)]
*  I mean, is it going to be a one size fits all for everybody? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1387.0s)]
*  No, nothing is. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1390.0s)]
*  Therapy isn't, psychedelics aren't, exercises isn't. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1392.0s)]
*  There's not a one size fits all for anybody to fix your life. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1397.0s)]
*  But if there's anything that has been shown to be very effective, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1400.0s)]
*  I think we should explore that. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1403.0s)]
*  And if one of those things is illegal, that doesn't make any fucking sense. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1404.0s)]
*  And one of those things that is illegal is Ibogaine. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1408.0s)]
*  My mom, when she started to get sick with Parkinson's, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1410.0s)]
*  we took her to the Bahamas, and she got fetal cells injected in her. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1414.0s)]
*  And that was something that she was, she believed very strongly that, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1421.0s)]
*  she was like, put some baby cells in me. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1428.0s)]
*  Put some fetal cells in me. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1432.0s)]
*  Dude, it was fucking insane. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1434.0s)]
*  It was like me and Bob Wheeler, the Comedy Store accountant over there, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1436.0s)]
*  we flew down to the Bahamas because you couldn't do it here. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1440.0s)]
*  Where did they get the baby tissue? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1443.0s)]
*  I don't know, dude. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1445.0s)]
*  But I remember it like it was yesterday. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1446.0s)]
*  So we drove in, the doctor, my mom paid like 20 grand or 10 or 15, whatever it was. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1449.0s)]
*  And within that, the package deal is the flight, the hotel, and then the baby fetuses. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1455.0s)]
*  So we went down there and a car picked us up. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1463.0s)]
*  It had a sign, Mitzi Shore. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1468.0s)]
*  And we went in there and then we drove her the next morning, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1470.0s)]
*  and we put her in a room with the doctor, and they injected her with fetal cells. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1474.0s)]
*  But I personally, because she had Parkinson's for a while, I personally think it actually helped her. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1478.0s)]
*  I think it prolonged. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1483.0s)]
*  Because if you put the baby cells in there, they're obviously baby cells. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1485.0s)]
*  Why is it so funny? [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1491.0s)]
*  It's just so fucked up to think of. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1493.0s)]
*  She did it a couple times. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1495.0s)]
*  They've been shown with stem cells, just all kinds of stem cells. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1498.0s)]
*  Put the baby in me. What are you doing? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1502.0s)]
*  Put it in me. What are you doing? Put it, stop fucking around. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1505.0s)]
*  Put it in me. Let's go. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1508.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1510.0s)]
*  That's your mom. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1512.0s)]
*  It's so funny. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1513.0s)]
*  Your mom was the best. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1514.0s)]
*  I tell everybody that your mom was the number one most important person in comedy that wasn't a comedian. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1515.0s)]
*  Your mom, 100%. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1522.0s)]
*  She was number one. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1524.0s)]
*  So fucking... [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1526.0s)]
*  Yeah, everything lined up. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1527.0s)]
*  They don't use baby cells anymore. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1529.0s)]
*  But the baby thing, well, maybe they do. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1532.0s)]
*  What are you talking about? They're great. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1534.0s)]
*  They really prolonged my life. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1536.0s)]
*  That is the reason why it took so long for stem cells to get use and funding in America. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1538.0s)]
*  Because the people, especially people on the right, thought that stem cells had to be like aborted fetuses. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1546.0s)]
*  Everyone connected. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1552.0s)]
*  You mean they're not? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1553.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1554.0s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1555.0s)]
*  So I remember when the really religious right wing people were talking about that, I was like, oh no. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1556.0s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1561.0s)]
*  They're killing babies for stem cells. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1562.0s)]
*  And then when I looked into it, I was like, oh no, no, no. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1565.0s)]
*  So there's a bunch of different... [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1568.0s)]
*  You get stem cells from bone marrow. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1569.0s)]
*  You get stem cells from adipose tissue. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1571.0s)]
*  I need some from my penis. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1573.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1575.0s)]
*  Hey. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1576.0s)]
*  Imagine if they figured out a way to make your dick bigger. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1577.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1579.0s)]
*  They'd be more harder all the time. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1580.0s)]
*  It would just be like girls with giant tits. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1581.0s)]
*  That's what it would be like. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1583.0s)]
*  Guys would just completely overdo it. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1584.0s)]
*  They'd have a useless dick. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1586.0s)]
*  You'd be in a lot of Instagram pictures of guys with useless dicks. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1588.0s)]
*  You'd eat nothing? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1597.0s)]
*  I think there should be something like that. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1601.0s)]
*  They take the fat off your butt and they put it in... [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1605.0s)]
*  Into your dick? [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1610.0s)]
*  Yeah, into your dick. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1611.0s)]
*  I don't think you should let them do that. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1612.0s)]
*  You know what? [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1615.0s)]
*  I did have a bladder surgery. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1616.0s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1619.0s)]
*  Yeah, I did. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1620.0s)]
*  What happened to your bladder? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1621.0s)]
*  I was just peeing a lot. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1622.0s)]
*  Was it leaky or something? [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1623.0s)]
*  No, it wasn't leaky. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1624.0s)]
*  What happened was I would go pee at night and then my bladder wouldn't empty. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1625.0s)]
*  So I'd go pee and then I lied back down. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1630.0s)]
*  I'm like, fuck, I still have more pee. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1632.0s)]
*  And I'd do that four or five times in the middle of the night. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1634.0s)]
*  And then I finally went... [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1637.0s)]
*  I went to my doctor and he sent me up with a urologist at Cedars and he was this gay dude. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1639.0s)]
*  And imagine that a gay urologist... [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1646.0s)]
*  And this isn't a joke, this is real. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1648.0s)]
*  And he's like, let me see your dick. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1650.0s)]
*  I'm like, dude, that's not fucking cool. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1652.0s)]
*  Come on, let me see it. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1654.0s)]
*  The fuck? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1656.0s)]
*  And so I showed him my dick. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1658.0s)]
*  He's like, ooh. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1659.0s)]
*  I'm like, what the fuck? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1660.0s)]
*  No. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1661.0s)]
*  So I did a procedure called resume. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1662.0s)]
*  So if you don't believe me, you can... [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1665.0s)]
*  Why would I not believe you? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1668.0s)]
*  Well, I'm just saying because it doesn't sound real. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1669.0s)]
*  It doesn't sound like you met an alien. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1672.0s)]
*  But it's resume. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1674.0s)]
*  I said, I go, what does this do? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1676.0s)]
*  He goes, well, once you do the procedure, then you resume how you used to pee before you had a pee problem. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1677.0s)]
*  So you wake up and they steam your prostate. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1683.0s)]
*  Steam it. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1686.0s)]
*  They steam it. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1687.0s)]
*  Press it. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1688.0s)]
*  Yeah, they steam it right there. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1689.0s)]
*  Resume procedure uses sterile water vapor, steam, that is injected into the enlarged portions of the prostate. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1690.0s)]
*  The steam causes the prostate cells that are responsible for the enlargement to die, which then leads to shrinkage of the prostate, which in turn creates a more open urinary pathway. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1697.0s)]
*  Oh, that's interesting. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1707.0s)]
*  And it was a pretty easy procedure. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1709.0s)]
*  Science. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1712.0s)]
*  It was amazing. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1713.0s)]
*  Fix Paulie's dick. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1714.0s)]
*  Science. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1715.0s)]
*  I love the pictures, but don't do it. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1716.0s)]
*  I don't want to see someone's dick get steamed. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1718.0s)]
*  So you wake up in the morning or you wake up after the procedure. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1721.0s)]
*  It's only like a 15 minute procedure. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1725.0s)]
*  You wake up and I had a catheter in my dick. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1727.0s)]
*  Yay. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1730.0s)]
*  And then I have a piss bag right here connected to it. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1731.0s)]
*  So I said, how long do I have to wear this? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1734.0s)]
*  He goes, for a week. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1737.0s)]
*  I'm like, dude, that's fucked up. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1738.0s)]
*  So for a week, bro, I'm like saying hi-fi to my friend. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1739.0s)]
*  I might even seen you with a pee bag. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1742.0s)]
*  You had a piss bag? [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1743.0s)]
*  I had a piss bag, yeah. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1744.0s)]
*  So do you like tape it to your body? [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1745.0s)]
*  No, you do a Velcro to your leg right here. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1747.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1750.0s)]
*  And so I had it for a whole weekend. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1751.0s)]
*  It was the best week of my life because I would be going to dinner with friends. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1753.0s)]
*  She's be pissing and fucking talking at the same time. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1758.0s)]
*  And they're like, what's so, what are you doing? [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1761.0s)]
*  I'm like, don't worry, go on. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1762.0s)]
*  This is a great story. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1763.0s)]
*  That's fantastic. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1764.0s)]
*  Oh, that's hilarious. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1765.0s)]
*  And then I drove from, I remember driving from Las, no, driving from LA to Las Vegas. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1766.0s)]
*  And it's a four hour drive. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1772.0s)]
*  I didn't have to stop once. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1773.0s)]
*  But when I got to Vegas, I had a huge like piss tumor connected to my, connected to my [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1775.0s)]
*  leg because you just keep peeing and then, and then. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1780.0s)]
*  At what point in time does it become disgusting? [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1782.0s)]
*  Like you're charting around fucking. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1784.0s)]
*  Yeah, after a week. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1786.0s)]
*  And it's like a wreck. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1787.0s)]
*  A week. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1788.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1789.0s)]
*  After a week. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1790.0s)]
*  What's the longest you gone without changing it? [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1791.0s)]
*  For real. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1793.0s)]
*  Oh, no, you never change it. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1794.0s)]
*  I mean, dump it out. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1796.0s)]
*  Oh, you just, every couple hours you dump it out. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1797.0s)]
*  Every couple hours. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1799.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1800.0s)]
*  But then. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1801.0s)]
*  You never like walked around like four or five hours with a bag of piss. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1802.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1804.0s)]
*  But so that was. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1805.0s)]
*  That's what I thought you were saying. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1807.0s)]
*  That's what he was saying. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1808.0s)]
*  Isn't that what you thought he was saying? [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1809.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1810.0s)]
*  We got confused. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1811.0s)]
*  So you have to change the actual physical bag itself. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1812.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1814.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1815.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1826.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1827.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1828.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1829.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1830.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1831.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1832.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1833.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1834.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1835.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1836.0s)]
*  So I went to dinner. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1837.0s)]
*  I'm like, Paul, you have some asparagus. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1838.0s)]
*  If I knew the piss bag on and then if I just smell asparagus pee, I'm like, you motherfucker. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1839.0s)]
*  No. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1845.0s)]
*  Just sitting there peeing. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1846.0s)]
*  No. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1847.0s)]
*  Would you be upset? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1848.0s)]
*  That's an unavoidable smell. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1849.0s)]
*  You know what that is when you smell it. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1850.0s)]
*  I think I'll probably let everybody know I was peeing if that was going on. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1851.0s)]
*  I'm like, hey guys, I'm about to pee. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1854.0s)]
*  Just to let you know. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1855.0s)]
*  I don't have to go anywhere. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1856.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1858.0s)]
*  It was great. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1859.0s)]
*  It's tough to sell. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1860.0s)]
*  Like, hey, that's actually science has shown that it's actually the best way to pee because [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1861.0s)]
*  you just pee whenever you want and holding your pee is actually very bad for you. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1864.5s)]
*  Really bad for you. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1867.62s)]
*  So we're just going to give this everyone just start walking around with a piss bag. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1868.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1871.5s)]
*  They need one for shit, I think. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1872.5s)]
*  Don't you think? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1873.5s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1874.5s)]
*  No. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1876.5s)]
*  Well, the dumbest thing we do for shit is just smear it with toilet paper. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1877.5s)]
*  Like, once I got one of them toilets that squirts water at your butt. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1881.5s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1885.5s)]
*  You never had one? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1886.5s)]
*  No, I've seen it, but I never had one. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1887.5s)]
*  Paul, you got to get one of those. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1889.5s)]
*  There's a whole bunch of them. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1891.5s)]
*  That's a bidet, right? [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1892.5s)]
*  Well, it's not a bidet because it's like a toilet. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1893.5s)]
*  It's like a toilet seat bidet. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1896.5s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1897.5s)]
*  You have one in the other room. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1898.5s)]
*  We got one here. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1899.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1900.5s)]
*  Go try it out. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1901.5s)]
*  Yeah, your guys show me around your place. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1902.5s)]
*  Go try it out. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1903.5s)]
*  Your guys show me around your place. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1904.5s)]
*  So you got the sauna and you got the cold plunge in the back? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1905.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's dope. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1908.5s)]
*  Have you done that? [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1909.5s)]
*  I've done it. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1910.5s)]
*  Yeah, I've been saunaing. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1911.5s)]
*  I mean, every time I see you talk about the cold plunge in the sauna, I'm like, yeah, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1912.5s)]
*  that's my guy. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1915.5s)]
*  Cold plunge is the best. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1916.5s)]
*  Both of them reset your brain so well. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1917.5s)]
*  Yeah, I usually go to the Russian bath house in New York and LA and then also the Korean [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1920.5s)]
*  spa. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1925.5s)]
*  I love it. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1926.5s)]
*  Ari loves that Russian bath house in New York. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1927.5s)]
*  He's always going to those. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1928.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's the best. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1930.5s)]
*  It's so good for your body. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1931.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1932.5s)]
*  It really is. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1933.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's great. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1934.5s)]
*  Yep. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1935.5s)]
*  Wait, you living in Vegas still? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1936.5s)]
*  No, I kept a place there, but I moved back to LA. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1939.5s)]
*  Oh, how is it? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1943.5s)]
*  Yeah, so I got... [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1944.5s)]
*  It's cool. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1945.5s)]
*  It's all right? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1946.5s)]
*  Everything's good? [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1947.5s)]
*  Yeah, everything's awesome. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1948.5s)]
*  I don't want to tell you where my house is. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1950.5s)]
*  There's people listening. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1951.5s)]
*  But no, I'm very happy there. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1952.5s)]
*  That's where I was born and raised. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1955.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1957.5s)]
*  So it's like, I feel good there, but I like to leave. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1958.5s)]
*  I like it here, dude. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1960.5s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1961.5s)]
*  I fucking love it here. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1962.5s)]
*  This is really cool here. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1963.5s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1964.5s)]
*  And what you're doing is... [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1965.5s)]
*  I mean, it's great. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1966.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1968.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1969.5s)]
*  Well, that was the whole... [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1970.5s)]
*  I mean, it worked out better than I thought it could, but that was kind of the idea. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1971.5s)]
*  And I think it was kind of cool that... [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1975.5s)]
*  I mean, not kind of cool, but I think just... [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1977.5s)]
*  Obviously, everything is up to this guy upstairs, but I think the two-year kind of building up to it got your guys better, got everyone better, working at the Vulcan and working around town. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1979.5s)]
*  For sure. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1990.5s)]
*  It was this pimple that everyone was developing and developing, and then finally, boom, the mothership came, and then boom, everyone's like, boom, and now it's just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=1991.5s)]
*  And it's this thing, yeah. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2000.5s)]
*  Well, and also that everybody had kind of shared my sentiments about getting out. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2001.5s)]
*  Like, Tom Segura was one of the first. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2005.5s)]
*  Tony Hinchcliffe was one of the first. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2007.5s)]
*  I think Tony came out first. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2009.5s)]
*  Ron White was actually already here before the pandemic, and it was also one of the reasons why I loved it, because he was always telling me, like, it's the best fucking city. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2010.5s)]
*  You ain't got to deal with all the bullshit you deal with in Hollywood. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2018.5s)]
*  And he would always talk so great about this town. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2021.5s)]
*  Well, I think what you're doing for comedy is great. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2024.5s)]
*  I mean, you're creating this Emerald City for New York and L.A. and people to come out here, and you got all these stages, and it's great. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2026.5s)]
*  And then also, Red Band started a club, too. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2035.5s)]
*  Yeah, right down the street. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2038.5s)]
*  That's cool. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2039.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2040.5s)]
*  Well, it was a club that already exists, and he bought into it as an investor, and they have a really nice room. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2041.5s)]
*  I think it's like 500 seats right down the street. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2048.5s)]
*  Yeah, and I think it's great because I remember coming back. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2050.5s)]
*  I'm coming to Austin in the 90s when I was touring, and everyone remembers Austin Sixth Street Music. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2053.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2060.5s)]
*  Austin Sixth Street Music. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2061.5s)]
*  And now it's slowly starting to be comedy is the first thing, and then music is the second thing. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2063.5s)]
*  And it's great. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2067.5s)]
*  Well, that one little spot, you have the Creek in the Cave that's on Seventh, and then you have the Vulcan, which is on Sixth, and we're on Sixth. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2068.5s)]
*  And then next to the mothership is the Sunset Strip Club. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2075.5s)]
*  They're all in the same area. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2078.5s)]
*  So guys are walking from club to club and doing sets in town, and guys are doing four or five sets a night sometimes, especially when they're doing two shows in certain places. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2080.5s)]
*  And then there's other rooms outside. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2090.5s)]
*  It's like people are starting their own rooms, which always happens. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2094.5s)]
*  Like open micers, it's one of the things open micers have always done. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2097.5s)]
*  Like they'll get a Wednesday at some place, and they start having people come in. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2100.5s)]
*  They work a deal with the door. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2105.5s)]
*  Like really sort of business minded open micers have done that forever. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2106.5s)]
*  No, it's great. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2113.5s)]
*  No, it's great. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2114.5s)]
*  And you, you know, you're the leader. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2115.5s)]
*  Well, I just did it because I could. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2118.5s)]
*  It was like one of those things was like if someone could, they should. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2120.5s)]
*  And you can. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2124.5s)]
*  So why aren't you? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2125.5s)]
*  OK, well, you should. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2126.5s)]
*  You know, I had like a talk with myself about it, like, God damn, do you really want to take on this? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2127.5s)]
*  Because I would always tell people be nice to comedy club owners because you don't want to be one. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2131.5s)]
*  You don't want to be some person hoping that this guy shows up and he wasn't doing coke last night and he isn't on a two day bender. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2136.5s)]
*  It misses flight or he didn't sleep in or didn't. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2145.5s)]
*  You know, there's so many factors dealing with your livelihood if you're a club owner. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2149.5s)]
*  And then, you know, you have people get too drunk. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2153.5s)]
*  They're crazy. They do this. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2157.5s)]
*  They that they wreck their hotel room. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2158.5s)]
*  And, you know, you're constantly like putting out fires. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2160.5s)]
*  I'm like, if you can make a harmonious relationship with a club owner, do it. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2163.5s)]
*  Try to be as nice to them as possible. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2167.5s)]
*  You work together. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2169.5s)]
*  You don't want to be them. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2170.5s)]
*  You don't want to open a comedy club. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2172.5s)]
*  It's too much work. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2173.5s)]
*  But now I wound up doing it. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2174.5s)]
*  Yeah. So what's it like being an owner? [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2176.5s)]
*  You're 100 percent owner. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2177.5s)]
*  Yeah. So what's it like? [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2179.5s)]
*  Well, it's easy because the people that are running it are great. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2180.5s)]
*  You know, if it wasn't for Curtis and Adam and Eric and Jody and all the people that and Carrie, [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2184.5s)]
*  the people that we knew from the store, it wasn't for them. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2190.5s)]
*  It wouldn't be able to work like this. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2192.5s)]
*  They have such a long experience in running clubs. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2194.5s)]
*  That helps a lot. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2197.5s)]
*  And then for comics that are listening that want to get in in at your club, what's the process? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2199.5s)]
*  Is it? [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2205.5s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not going to like put that out there. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2206.5s)]
*  They could figure it out. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2208.5s)]
*  The best way to go do is go to open mic nights. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2209.5s)]
*  If you're you're just starting out or, you know, Adam Eaget is the talent coordinator. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2212.5s)]
*  If you're an established comedian, reach out to him. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2216.5s)]
*  But he's been reaching out to everybody anyway. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2218.5s)]
*  It's like it's it's nice. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2220.5s)]
*  It's been it's been very smooth from the opening jump. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2221.5s)]
*  And then mostly the small room is the developmental room. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2226.5s)]
*  Not only development. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2229.5s)]
*  No, Chappelle did that room. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2230.5s)]
*  He broke it in the first night. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2231.5s)]
*  It's a fun room to do sets because it's very intimate because it's 120 seats. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2233.5s)]
*  Yeah. No, I love that room. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2237.5s)]
*  That was a great room. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2238.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2239.5s)]
*  Tonight. Tonight I'm doing your other room. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2240.5s)]
*  And I haven't I did kill Tony last night and that was great. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2242.5s)]
*  So tonight's the first night that I'm going to do a spot here. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2246.5s)]
*  You'll love it. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2248.5s)]
*  Your bigger room. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2249.5s)]
*  Yeah, you'll love it. The sounds amazing. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2250.5s)]
*  It's just it's all it just we really spent a lot of time making sure that everything was dialed in. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2251.5s)]
*  And also I brought in Louis CK, who helped a lot. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2256.5s)]
*  Louis CK had me change a couple of things about the small room. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2259.5s)]
*  Had me made this make the stage smaller and lower the ceiling even more. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2263.5s)]
*  The ceiling was already low. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2266.5s)]
*  It's like, can you lower it more? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2268.5s)]
*  I was like, I think we can. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2269.5s)]
*  Can we lower it more? [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2270.5s)]
*  And then there was like all these discussions. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2271.5s)]
*  So it actually delayed the opening by a few weeks from his suggestions, but they were all awesome. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2272.5s)]
*  They were all perfect suggestions. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2278.5s)]
*  And then everybody else suggested things to Tony had some suggestions. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2280.5s)]
*  David Lucas had some suggestions. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2283.5s)]
*  Comics have been coming to visit this for the last year and a half. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2285.5s)]
*  We've been talking. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2289.5s)]
*  Wouldn't do you think we should do this? [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2290.5s)]
*  It's like one of those things. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2292.5s)]
*  So I get everybody together and I'm like, OK, should we have screens where you could watch the comics? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2293.5s)]
*  Screens where you could watch the comics in the green room? [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2297.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2299.5s)]
*  OK, what about like if we have a clock over the screen? [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2300.5s)]
*  Like everybody has like a different idea. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2302.5s)]
*  OK, what about if we had stars? [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2303.5s)]
*  I think it might have been Brian Simpson that had that idea. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2305.5s)]
*  We have, you know, because the star, like the light in the OR, we have a blue light and a green light. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2308.5s)]
*  So we have the blue one for the big room and a green one for the little room. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2314.5s)]
*  And they go off when it goes off in that room. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2318.5s)]
*  They go off also inside the green room. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2320.5s)]
*  So you could be sitting there and go, oh, he's got the light. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2322.5s)]
*  And you see it and you just walk right on stage. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2324.5s)]
*  And then when the customer walks in, explain. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2326.5s)]
*  I know we've seen the video, but they walk in, they go upstairs. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2329.5s)]
*  The the the the the bigger room is on the second floor and then the smaller room is on the third floor. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2333.5s)]
*  Um, is that? [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2341.5s)]
*  Yes. Yeah, yeah, it's exactly what it is. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2343.5s)]
*  Yeah. And then it's horrible. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2346.5s)]
*  I don't even think of it as having that many floors, but I guess it does. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2348.5s)]
*  And then also, I know when I was backstage with you and we were kicking it, you looked at your curtains. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2350.5s)]
*  And you said, oh, we got to change the curtain in the big room. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2355.5s)]
*  So it looks like the smaller curtain. Yeah. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2358.5s)]
*  The smaller room curtains, a better curtain. Yeah. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2360.5s)]
*  It's weird to be just thinking about those things. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2362.5s)]
*  But yeah. So who's so should we tell Curtis to do that? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2364.5s)]
*  Oh, yeah, he did it. Yeah. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2366.5s)]
*  It should be this week. It should be put up. Holy shit. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2368.5s)]
*  Yeah. So it's going to match. Yeah. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2370.5s)]
*  It'll be better. I was going to I was going to ask you. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2372.5s)]
*  I've been doing a for the last couple of years. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2374.5s)]
*  I've been doing a one man show about my childhood. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2377.5s)]
*  Yeah. And it is kind of like my version of Undisputed Truth, which is the Mike Tyson play. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2379.5s)]
*  Oh, nice. So it's called Stick with the Dancing. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2384.5s)]
*  So it's called Stick with the Dancing, because that's what my mom said to me after she saw me perform for the first time. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2387.5s)]
*  That's hilarious. So because I perform. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2392.5s)]
*  Well, why don't you come out and do a weekend? Do you want to do a weekend? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2394.5s)]
*  That's what I wanted to talk to you. Do you have screens on the bigger room? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2396.5s)]
*  Yes. OK, cool. Yeah. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2401.5s)]
*  So if I perform, there's things. Yeah, we have a projector in the ceiling. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2403.5s)]
*  And it comes down. Oh, great. Yeah, I want to do that. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2406.5s)]
*  It'll take a little extra coordination with whoever's doing it so they know what the files are and you can go over them with them. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2409.5s)]
*  But I'm sure you could do it. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2415.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's a pretty cool. It's a pretty cool show. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2417.5s)]
*  And I can't wait to see it. Yeah, it's fun. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2420.5s)]
*  Dude, you you're you got babysitted by Sam Kinnison. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2422.5s)]
*  It's one of the funniest fucking stories of all time. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2425.5s)]
*  Like, what a crazy thing your mom did. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2427.5s)]
*  It was she left you as a little child was one of the most maniacal comedians that's ever existed. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2429.5s)]
*  Well, it wasn't it wasn't exactly like that. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2434.5s)]
*  It was more it was more like Sam was I was 14 years old. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2438.5s)]
*  I was a shorter cook at the communist in Westwood. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2442.5s)]
*  My mom would put Sam on last because all he would do is scream. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2444.5s)]
*  And then he would literally you know, there'd be six people left in the room in Westwood and he'd throw the stools. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2448.5s)]
*  He'd throw the his stool at the audience members. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2454.5s)]
*  They'd scamper off. He'd smoke weed in the parking lot. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2457.5s)]
*  And then he would, you know, feed him hamburgers. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2460.5s)]
*  So I kind of just I was always taking care of comedians. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2463.5s)]
*  What year was this? [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2467.5s)]
*  This was probably 84, 84, 85. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2468.5s)]
*  I was in high school. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2472.5s)]
*  He hit in 86. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2473.5s)]
*  Yes, he really hit. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2475.5s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2476.5s)]
*  So I will tell you my story. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2478.5s)]
*  How I found out about him is probably Boston with parental or something. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2479.5s)]
*  No, a girl that I worked with at the Boston Athletic Club. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2483.5s)]
*  She still does. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2487.5s)]
*  I can't remember fucking name. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2488.5s)]
*  She was really cool, though. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2489.5s)]
*  She was this big volleyball player girl, like big athletic girl. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2490.5s)]
*  And she goes to me, she goes, you seen Sam Kenison? [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2495.5s)]
*  Sam Kenison, whatever his name was. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2498.5s)]
*  I go, no, I have it. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2501.5s)]
*  And so she acts out in the parking lot. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2503.5s)]
*  The whole bit about him. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2505.5s)]
*  Ethiopia or something. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2507.5s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2508.5s)]
*  The homosexual necrophiliacs. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2509.5s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2511.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2512.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2513.5s)]
*  She acted it out in the parking lot. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2514.5s)]
*  She's like, oh, oh, life keeps fucking in the ass even after you're dead. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2515.5s)]
*  It never ends. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2519.5s)]
*  It never ends. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2520.5s)]
*  Me laughing at her acting it out in the parking lot made me go get the VHS tape. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2521.5s)]
*  So I got a VHS tape of his HBO special. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2527.5s)]
*  And I was like, holy shit. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2531.5s)]
*  So I found out about it from a girl acting out the bit. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2533.5s)]
*  She was on her stomach in the parking lot going, oh, oh, feels like something's in my ass. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2537.5s)]
*  I know. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2542.5s)]
*  You can't believe it. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2543.5s)]
*  That angle was genius. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2544.5s)]
*  It's such a fucking genius, genius point of view. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2545.5s)]
*  That night was, that was 1987 and that was at the Roxy on Sunset. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2549.5s)]
*  And my mom had an after party for him at the house. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2554.5s)]
*  Wow. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2557.5s)]
*  At the Doheny house. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2558.5s)]
*  So that night afterwards Sam came to the house with everyone. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2559.5s)]
*  And I was so excited because I wanted to show him my saltwater fish tank. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2563.5s)]
*  Because as a kid I had a saltwater fish tank. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2568.5s)]
*  And I brought him up to my room and I said, Sam, look at my tank. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2571.5s)]
*  And he wasn't impressed at all. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2574.5s)]
*  But he told me to take the top off the saltwater fish tank, it was a big black top. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2576.5s)]
*  And I took it down. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2580.5s)]
*  He dumped all this coke on it. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2581.5s)]
*  And he started chopping up lines and he says, have fun. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2585.5s)]
*  And me and my friend Dave, we snorted Sam's coke that night. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2588.5s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2591.5s)]
*  And I felt like so cool. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2592.5s)]
*  I felt like, no, for real. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2594.5s)]
*  Of course. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2595.5s)]
*  I was like, fuck this guy. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2596.5s)]
*  And then I just followed him around. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2597.5s)]
*  So as far as him babysitting me, it was, it was. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2599.5s)]
*  So that's just the way it was described. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2603.5s)]
*  I mean, Lois Bromfield babysitted me. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2605.5s)]
*  Jackson Perdue babysat me. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2607.5s)]
*  Mike Binder, Argus Hamilton, all those guys. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2609.5s)]
*  So you were essentially just like his young protege. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2611.5s)]
*  Yeah, I would fall. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2614.5s)]
*  It was like the Michael Jordan commercial. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2615.5s)]
*  Like, you know, the kid wanted to be like Mike. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2617.5s)]
*  I wanted to be like Sam. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2619.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2620.5s)]
*  So. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2621.5s)]
*  Look at you. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2622.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2623.5s)]
*  So. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2624.5s)]
*  What year is that? [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2625.5s)]
*  I was probably 11. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2626.5s)]
*  Wow. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2627.5s)]
*  I was probably 11. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2628.5s)]
*  What a fucking crazy place to grow up. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2629.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2631.5s)]
*  Back then. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2632.5s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2633.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2634.5s)]
*  Back then. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2635.5s)]
*  I mean, back then. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2636.5s)]
*  I mean, there's so many stories, dude. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2637.5s)]
*  I mean, I'm there now and it's great. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2638.5s)]
*  Obviously, it's the store. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2640.5s)]
*  But when mom was there, it was just like, you never know what the fuck was going to happen. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2641.5s)]
*  You never knew who was going to pull in the fucking lot. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2645.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2647.5s)]
*  You never knew who was going to come up. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2648.5s)]
*  It was just like, it was like, it was like someone shooting guns. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2649.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2652.5s)]
*  Not literally, but just as far as the energy. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2653.5s)]
*  Boom, boom, boom. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2655.5s)]
*  I mean, Eddie Murphy used to show up with like six Rolls Royces. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2657.5s)]
*  Like for real, dude. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2660.5s)]
*  And then Richard would show up and all these guys would just roll. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2662.5s)]
*  This is around when you got there. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2667.5s)]
*  It was kind of towards, right? [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2669.5s)]
*  You got there in 94. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2671.5s)]
*  94. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2672.5s)]
*  That was probably before when I got there. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2673.5s)]
*  Yeah, I saw the calendar you had for my mom where she put your name. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2675.5s)]
*  I thought that was really cool. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2679.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's very cool. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2680.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2681.5s)]
*  So yeah, so that was that time. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2682.5s)]
*  You know, I'm really proud of this. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2685.5s)]
*  Look at this right here. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2687.5s)]
*  This is August, yeah. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2688.5s)]
*  What year is that? [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2689.5s)]
*  That was last year. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2691.5s)]
*  Yeah, Polly Shore bringing up Eddie Murphy. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2692.5s)]
*  When did Eddie retire? [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2695.5s)]
*  So he retired in what year? [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2697.5s)]
*  He stopped doing stand-up when? [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2699.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2700.5s)]
*  It was a while ago. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2701.5s)]
*  I was at his house probably five years ago and I was just like, dude, what are you doing? [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2702.5s)]
*  Like you're fucking, you're the best, dude. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2706.5s)]
*  Like, let's go. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2709.5s)]
*  He's like literally the best. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2710.5s)]
*  I think he should come out here and do it. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2711.5s)]
*  He'd be great because you put the phones in the pouches. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2713.5s)]
*  He could do that anywhere if you wanted to. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2716.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2717.5s)]
*  I think the hard part would be like doing it, just getting going. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2718.5s)]
*  I think if he did it once, then he'd want to do it all the time. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2721.5s)]
*  You know, but it's like you get locked up in that movie world. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2724.5s)]
*  But he's also in case in his house. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2727.5s)]
*  That's the same thing with Dr. Dre. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2729.5s)]
*  Dr. Dre, he would be great on this show. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2731.5s)]
*  I'd love to have him on. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2734.5s)]
*  Okay, Dre, what's up? [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2735.5s)]
*  I'm going to put you on his show so we could text him right now. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2736.5s)]
*  So I've known Dre. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2739.5s)]
*  When my mom died, he was one of like the two or three people that really reached out to me [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2740.5s)]
*  because he knew how close I was with my mom. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2746.5s)]
*  Yeah, he sent me flowers. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2748.5s)]
*  It was really beautiful. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2750.5s)]
*  Oh, that's cool. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2751.5s)]
*  Yeah, it was great. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2752.5s)]
*  That's very cool. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2753.5s)]
*  But I went to his house. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2754.5s)]
*  You know, these guys are so big and so wealthy. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2755.5s)]
*  They enclose themselves. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2760.5s)]
*  So I saw him at ... I reconnected with him at Dave Chappelle's show at the Hollywood Bowl. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2762.5s)]
*  And he's like, yo, hit me up, da da da da da. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2769.5s)]
*  I hit him up. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2771.5s)]
*  I go to his house. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2772.5s)]
*  And it's like fucking El Chapo, bro. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2773.5s)]
*  It's like, you know what I mean? [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2775.5s)]
*  I don't want to reveal all the shit, but it's like, you know, it's pretty heavy. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2777.5s)]
*  But I go in there, he's the same fucking guy that he was 20, 30 years ago. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2782.5s)]
*  Of course. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2786.5s)]
*  Most people are. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2787.5s)]
*  They do deteriorate psychologically, though, in isolation. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2788.5s)]
*  Yeah, he says, yo, man, you want to see me? [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2791.5s)]
*  You come here. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2793.5s)]
*  So it was pretty cool. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2794.5s)]
*  That's also a nice thing about having this club, that I'm hanging around with comics all the time. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2796.5s)]
*  You know? [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2800.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2801.5s)]
*  It's just ... you're not isolated. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2802.5s)]
*  You're out there. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2804.5s)]
*  And as a comic, one of the things that does happen when you tour, we're talking about, you bring an opening act. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2805.5s)]
*  You maybe hang out with them, and that's it. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2810.5s)]
*  That's the whole weekend. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2813.5s)]
*  It's kind of isolating. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2815.5s)]
*  And if you're not with that person, then you go and you use like local opening acts. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2816.5s)]
*  I mean, maybe it's great, and you meet a great friend. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2821.5s)]
*  That's how I met Segura. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2824.5s)]
*  Or maybe it's terrible. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2825.5s)]
*  You have a shitty weekend with people you don't like. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2826.5s)]
*  So, yeah, so what do you think of these guys? [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2828.5s)]
*  I mean, I'm a fan of you, of Tom, of Bert, and all these guys. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2830.5s)]
*  Do you ever pinch yourself and see what you've really ... I'm not saying you're the holier-than-out person that did this. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2835.5s)]
*  Their talent speaks for themselves. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2843.5s)]
*  But you have a lot to do with these guys' careers. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2845.5s)]
*  Well, they have a lot to do with mine, too, though. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2848.5s)]
*  That's part of the appeal of the show. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2850.5s)]
*  Part of the appeal of the show is like having those guys on is great for me, too. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2852.5s)]
*  It's great for everybody. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2857.5s)]
*  But I'm just saying ... because again, I've seen it. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2858.5s)]
*  I've seen the slow build. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2861.5s)]
*  Yeah, but they're huge because they're great. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2863.5s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2865.5s)]
*  You have to do the work and put it in. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2866.5s)]
*  It's like everybody should have a chance to do it. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2869.5s)]
*  Like giving someone a chance to excel, you shouldn't get any credit for that. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2871.5s)]
*  The people that excel, they get the credit. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2875.5s)]
*  What they're doing is what's exceptional. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2878.5s)]
*  And they put in the work. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2880.5s)]
*  Guys like Bert put in the work. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2882.5s)]
*  He's selling out fucking arenas now. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2883.5s)]

*  No one can deny that man puts the fucking work in. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2889.5s)]
*  He's the fucking machine, bro. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2891.5s)]

*  He's killing it. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2901.5s)]
*  And his new movie is hilarious. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2902.5s)]
*  This machine movie is going to crush it. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2904.5s)]
*  It's going to crush it. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2906.5s)]
*  I watched one of the previews that he showed us. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2907.5s)]

*  Oh, no shit. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2922.5s)]
*  During the pandemic you guys made a movie? [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2923.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2924.5s)]
*  No, right before, but it came out in the pandemic. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2925.5s)]

*  Okay, that's great. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2929.5s)]
*  To have something come out when everybody's definitely watching TV. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2930.5s)]
*  Yeah, it did well. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2932.5s)]
*  It's called Guest House. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2933.5s)]
*  I play a guy that lives in the guest house that won't leave. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2934.5s)]
*  So it's R-rated. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2937.5s)]

*  It's amazing the shows that popped off. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2947.5s)]
*  Do you think Tiger King would have become as big? [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2949.5s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2952.5s)]
*  Right? [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2953.5s)]
*  No way. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2954.5s)]
*  It's like a timing of the universe. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2955.5s)]
*  It's like the perfect door opened where everybody's at home and then everybody's kind of freaking [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2956.5s)]
*  out. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2960.9s)]
*  What better way to stop freaking out than to look at some people that are way more fucked [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2961.9s)]
*  up than you? [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2964.42s)]

*  or girl. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2981.14s)]
*  Did they change genders? [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2982.14s)]
*  When a person got their fucking arm bitten off by a tiger. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2983.14s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2987.18s)]
*  Instead of going through a bunch of operations, they said, no, just cut it off. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2988.18s)]
*  That was his boy. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2991.54s)]
*  I don't want to go through five operations. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=2992.54s)]

*  So what do you think about the whole, I don't want to use the word tranjectory because that's [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3028.02s)]
*  not a real word. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3032.14s)]

*  Thank you. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3035.14s)]
*  Of what? [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3036.14s)]
*  Of just from the last 30 years of the entertainment business, how it started off with movies, [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3037.14s)]
*  TV, and then real world came, and then what was it? [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3042.2999999999997s)]
*  Amazing Race and all these things. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3047.9s)]
*  And then all of a sudden the internet came and now everyone's got their own show. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3049.8599999999997s)]
*  And then when you watch a movie with great actors like Pacino or whoever you think is [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3054.02s)]
*  great, you're staring at your phone, you're looking at your leg. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3058.2599999999998s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3060.86s)]
*  Because growing up, I never thought that this would ever happen. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3062.5s)]
*  I thought everything was always going to be like the 70s, 80s, 90s, early 2000s. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3066.06s)]
*  You talk about when I was your age, this is really a big shift. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3071.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it's a huge shift. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3075.94s)]
*  Everyone's famous now. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3076.94s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3077.94s)]
*  Well it's a big shift, but they're still making movies. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3079.6200000000003s)]
*  They're still making television shows. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3083.2200000000003s)]
*  Matt Damon made a video where he was explaining why people aren't making movies anymore. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3085.46s)]
*  Why they're not making good movies and how hard it is to make a movie now. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3092.26s)]
*  And he explained it as a person on the inside. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3095.7400000000002s)]
*  It's much more daunting than I thought. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3100.26s)]
*  And then there's the television show thing. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3102.78s)]
*  There's a lot of television shows now. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3105.06s)]
*  There's television shows that are on Netflix and television shows that are on regular networks, [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3107.46s)]
*  but reality shows are very cheap, very easy, and very compelling. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3112.38s)]
*  They found that out through Fear Factor and through Survivor and through all those other [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3116.38s)]
*  shows. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3121.58s)]
*  That kind of shifted the landscape away from the sitcom. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3122.58s)]
*  And the sitcom was our holy grail. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3125.3s)]
*  When we first came to Hollywood, not when you did, but when my generation came to Hollywood [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3127.62s)]
*  in like 94, when we came out here, everybody wanted a sitcom. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3133.02s)]
*  I remember when you had your sitcom on Fox. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3137.66s)]
*  I remember I came out to the premiere. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3139.9s)]
*  It was like, holy shit, you got a show. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3142.42s)]
*  That was it. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3145.58s)]
*  That's what everybody wanted. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3146.58s)]
*  Everybody wanted the golden, that was the golden. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3147.58s)]
*  That was her rhythm. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3149.78s)]
*  That was her rhythm. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3150.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3151.78s)]
*  Well, that was the times. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3152.78s)]
*  That's what it was back then. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3153.78s)]
*  Nowadays, if you're trying to get a sitcom, other than Miss Pat, who's pulled it off, [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3155.1400000000003s)]
*  Miss Pat's show is fucking hilarious. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3160.6600000000003s)]
*  It's really good, dude. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3163.2000000000003s)]
*  But it's on BET+. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3164.2000000000003s)]
*  It's not on a network so she can swear. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3165.2000000000003s)]
*  She can say whatever the fuck she wants. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3168.54s)]
*  That show's really good. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3170.34s)]
*  But other than that, how many comics do you know that have a sitcom, a multi-cam sitcom? [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3171.46s)]
*  You know, Whitney had one for a while. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3178.42s)]
*  A lot of people had them. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3180.34s)]
*  Tom Rhodes had a show back when I was on news radio. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3181.66s)]
*  He had a show. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3183.98s)]
*  There was a lot of fucking people at shows. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3184.98s)]
*  But now, now, no. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3188.54s)]
*  Greg Giraldo had a show. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3192.14s)]
*  He was right next to us when we were filming Fear Factors or filming news radio as well. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3194.02s)]
*  It's the same thing with the talk show format as well. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3198.94s)]
*  Everyone's got a talk show. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3202.02s)]
*  I mean, not everyone's got a talk show, but there's the three talk shows. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3203.02s)]
*  But then there's guys like you that trump the talk show. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3205.9s)]
*  Well, they're just playing with an outdated system. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3209.66s)]
*  So they're involved in a system that has to stop every few minutes for commercials. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3214.14s)]
*  Only airs at a specific time, meaning you have to be there to watch it or you have to [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3220.54s)]
*  set your DVR to watch it later. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3224.58s)]
*  It takes a lot of additional steps. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3226.5s)]
*  There's a lot going on that makes those things unappealing. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3228.02s)]
*  The other thing is a person goes on, they only talk for five minutes. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3232.2200000000003s)]
*  If you're a person that wants to explain something very complicated, like the Younger Dryas Impact [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3235.94s)]
*  Theory or like if Bob Lazar wants to go on a show and talk about how he was hired by [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3241.1s)]
*  the government to back engineer flying saucers. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3247.42s)]
*  That's not a five clip on on Jimmy Kimmel, right? [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3250.18s)]
*  You're not going to be able to do it. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3253.14s)]
*  It's literally they're they're completely handicapped by the system that they operate [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3254.3399999999997s)]
*  in. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3259.8199999999997s)]
*  You can't do it. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3260.8199999999997s)]
*  When I saw Tom Green's show, he had this show that he did in his house that he set up like [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3261.8199999999997s)]
*  a talk show set in his house. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3267.14s)]
*  And he had all these cables that ran from the talk show set up to a server room. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3269.66s)]
*  Like he had like his house had been converted into a television studio. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3274.3799999999997s)]
*  So this is amazing. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3277.8999999999996s)]
*  It was in 2007. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3279.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3280.6600000000003s)]
*  And that was when I was like, OK, that's probably the way to do it. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3281.6600000000003s)]
*  This talk show way. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3285.46s)]
*  They're never going to give me one of those things. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3287.2200000000003s)]
*  If they do, I'll fuck it up. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3288.7000000000003s)]
*  I'll say something stupid. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3290.54s)]
*  And so when you saw Tom Tom Green's show, that's when you and Red Band sat on the couch. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3291.54s)]
*  Well, we did it a couple of years later. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3296.34s)]
*  We started doing things like we would do videos that we do after shows or during. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3297.78s)]
*  Hook a brother up, please. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3303.58s)]
*  Coffee, sir. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3304.58s)]
*  Pick a brother up. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3305.58s)]
*  Do we're just hanging out. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3306.58s)]
*  We're having coffee. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3307.58s)]
*  We're chilling, brother. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3308.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3309.62s)]
*  Cheers. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3310.62s)]
*  Cheers. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3311.62s)]
*  So we started doing that in like 2007 or eight. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3312.62s)]
*  We started doing like green room shows with a webcam. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3316.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3319.58s)]
*  Just fucking around. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3320.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3321.58s)]
*  And then in 2009, we started doing the podcast. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3322.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3324.58s)]
*  And just fucking around. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3325.58s)]
*  Yeah, because when I when when you and I talked and we talked about me coming on on your show [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3326.58s)]
*  here, I was so excited. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3331.1s)]
*  It was the same enthusiasm I got when I used to get Letterman because I was on Letterman [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3332.5s)]
*  a lot and his show. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3337.82s)]
*  I felt like it was a big deal. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3339.78s)]
*  It was cool. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3341.9s)]
*  So you're you're a big deal now with this. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3342.9s)]
*  I mean, it's pretty fucking cool. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3345.3s)]
*  So because your show is it trumps Colbert, it trumps Jimmy Fallon and it jumps Jimmy [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3347.1400000000003s)]
*  Kimmels Trump's Jimmy Kimmels show, meaning it's a bigger deal for a guest to book. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3353.82s)]
*  Oh, I'm on fucking Joe Rogan. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3358.2200000000003s)]
*  Why are you laughing? [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3359.7000000000003s)]
*  What the fuck, dude? [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3360.86s)]

*  I got on Letterman because I was so excited to get on Letterman. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3369.98s)]
*  I was excited to come see you. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3372.98s)]
*  Well, I'm excited to have you here. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3374.54s)]

*  You're a very nice guy. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3379.1s)]
*  Remember when we did that show at the MGM and afterwards we hung out and talked. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3380.1s)]
*  You're a good dude, man. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3383.14s)]
*  You know, I've known you a long time. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3385.02s)]
*  It's nice to see. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3386.9s)]
*  Well, it's nice to see you happy. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3387.9s)]
*  And it was really like I said, it was really nice to see you killing on stage because you [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3388.9s)]
*  were having fun. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3392.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3393.34s)]
*  We were all howling. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3394.6600000000003s)]
*  There's a bunch of comics in the back laughing. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3395.6600000000003s)]
*  And that reminded me of the old days. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3397.54s)]
*  It reminded me the O.R. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3399.1800000000003s)]
*  Like when Joey Diaz would go on stage, we'd all sit in the back. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3400.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3403.38s)]

*  Everybody would sit down. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3408.5s)]
*  Well, I threw everyone under the bus that show. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3409.5s)]
*  You threw everyone? [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3411.94s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3412.94s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3425.7s)]
*  That that environment of the back booth, you know, of sitting in the back seat of the company, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3426.7s)]
*  you would walk in, you always look who's here. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3431.94s)]
*  Griffin, what's up? [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3433.74s)]
*  It was always like that's how Holtzman is now when I see him. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3434.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3437.5s)]
*  Yeah, I saw him a couple of weeks ago. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3438.5s)]
*  He was really fucking nuts. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3439.5s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3442.38s)]
*  He's so funny, though. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3443.38s)]
*  He's always got the absolute wrong take on whatever the fuck is happening. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3444.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3447.9s)]
*  In the most brutal way possible. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3448.9s)]
*  Everyone goes left. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3450.9s)]

*  My father was never around when I was around. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3586.5s)]
*  Yeah, but I'm talking about he wasn't, I mean, no one was around when he was around. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3588.9s)]

*  Rudy DeLuca, and they got the room and they developed it and my mom got the store. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3603.3399999999997s)]
*  But my dad, a lot of people don't know who he is and what he's about. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3609.46s)]
*  If it wasn't for my father, no disrespect to my mother, but there wouldn't have been [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3613.8999999999996s)]
*  a comedy store. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3618.74s)]
*  She might have found her way somewhere else, but he's the reason why they moved out to [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3619.86s)]
*  California. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3625.38s)]
*  So, he's the reason because of his career. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3626.38s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3628.7000000000003s)]
*  So, he was, my dad was guest starring on Samford and Son. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3629.7000000000003s)]
*  Samford and Son, he played brother Sam. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3635.98s)]
*  He did a movie. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3637.94s)]
*  How many episodes did he do of that? [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3638.94s)]
*  A couple. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3640.3s)]
*  I mean, if you go on there, you could see Sammy Shores. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3641.3s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3643.3s)]
*  Red Fox. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3644.3s)]
*  I love that show. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3645.3s)]
*  I used to watch that show. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3646.3s)]
*  Oh, it was the best show. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3647.3s)]
*  It was the best show. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3648.3s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3649.34s)]
*  Yeah, there he is. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3650.34s)]
*  That's my father. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3651.34s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3652.34s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3653.34s)]
*  So, I call my dad, I call my father, he took one for the team. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3654.34s)]
*  Meaning, him and my mom never wanted to be together. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3660.5s)]
*  So, my mom got pregnant and had Scott, my oldest brother. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3663.9s)]
*  And this was an accident and they got married and she didn't want to be with him and he [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3669.7000000000003s)]
*  didn't want to be with her, but he just sucked it up. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3673.46s)]
*  And he was in this relationship with this woman, my mother, that he never really wanted [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3676.3s)]
*  to be in. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3680.3s)]
*  So, he started acting and doing all that and then he was opening for Elvis, he was opening [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3681.3s)]
*  for Sammy Davis, he was opening for all these great comedians or all these great entertainers [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3690.94s)]
*  and he started it. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3698.0600000000004s)]
*  He started the beginning of it. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3699.7000000000003s)]
*  Wow. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3701.98s)]
*  And it was in the original room? [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3702.98s)]
*  It was the original room, yeah. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3705.22s)]
*  How many, it only seated less people back then though, right? [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3706.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3709.58s)]
*  It was like 94 people I think. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3710.58s)]
*  I think it was like that and they moved the wall. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3711.58s)]
*  But yeah, my dad, my dad, you know, he took one for the team, you know, for us. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3713.7s)]
*  Isn't it amazing if he didn't do that? [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3719.4599999999996s)]
*  If he didn't do that and didn't give the reins to your mother. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3722.4599999999996s)]
*  Correct. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3725.4199999999996s)]
*  Who knows what the comedy world would look like? [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3726.4199999999996s)]
*  I mean, who knows if a guy like Kinnison ever gets off the ground? [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3728.18s)]
*  Correct. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3730.98s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3731.98s)]
*  Correct. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3732.98s)]
*  I mean, there's a place like that where it's a real artist workshop. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3733.98s)]
*  I mean, that's a highfalutin term, but that's really what it is. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3737.02s)]
*  Well, that's what my mom was. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3740.82s)]
*  That's why my mom had this natural instinct to develop comedians because it was in her [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3742.58s)]
*  veins. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3747.3s)]
*  So what would happen was, is my dad would, that's where my mom met my dad is when he [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3748.46s)]
*  was performing in Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3753.98s)]
*  So my dad was the comedian for a month in Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3756.58s)]
*  It was a touring comic and my mom started dating my father and she got pregnant and [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3760.5s)]
*  then he took off. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3767.58s)]
*  And, you know, that's when that whole, you know, when the whole thing where they're going [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3768.58s)]
*  to have the kid. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3771.4599999999996s)]
*  And what happened is my mom would type up my dad's jokes in the back, would type up [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3772.4599999999996s)]
*  the jokes. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3778.2599999999998s)]
*  This is funny. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3779.2599999999998s)]
*  That's not funny. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3780.2599999999998s)]
*  Try this. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3781.2599999999998s)]
*  That's not good. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3782.2599999999998s)]
*  And then give him pointers. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3783.2599999999998s)]
*  So when my dad was always really nervous performing in front of my mom. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3784.2599999999998s)]
*  So for instance, my dad got a shot on Ed Sullivan's show. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3788.62s)]
*  That was a big deal for him after Barbra Streisand. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3792.74s)]
*  So it was this big shot. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3795.62s)]
*  My mom was like, he fucking blew it. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3796.66s)]
*  You know, he's nervous. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=3799.54s)]

*  What year did she open that place? [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4219.14s)]
*  Argus knows the exact dates, but I think it was I think the late 70s, something like that. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4221.66s)]

*  I mean, when he, when he, I mean, his whole thing was the Letterman spot, the Rodney Dangerfield [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4242.7s)]
*  spot. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4248.54s)]
*  And like he did those six minutes on Rodney or whatever it was, sold out 3000 seats. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4249.54s)]
*  And then he did, you know, and then he did the next Rodney Young Comedian special, sold [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4255.98s)]
*  out, you know, 8000, you know, and I got to go, I got to open for him, which was sick. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4260.5s)]

*  really fucked up. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4275.54s)]
*  So if you, if you look at the special, you're like, fuck, this guy's all coked out and he's [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4277.1s)]
*  like not doing well. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4281.38s)]
*  And this is when he came out with the chains with this girl, Malika and Sabrina. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4283.22s)]
*  He's like, oh, oh, oh, and he's playing the music and Ice T was in the audience. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4286.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4290.46s)]
*  And it was like, and he was like, you know, Sam was doing some racist shit. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4291.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4294.660000000001s)]

*  Well, Sam had, did you ever read his brother Bill, his book? [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4298.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4301.9400000000005s)]
*  Brother Sam, the book's called Brother Sam. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4302.9400000000005s)]
*  He talks about the slide, like that when he started partying all the time, he stopped [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4305.780000000001s)]
*  writing, he wasn't performing as much and he just kind of like lost it. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4310.14s)]
*  You could tell in the work if you go and watch his early stuff, yeah, it drops off a lot. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4315.26s)]
*  Which sucks because, you know, you'd like to see them just keep getting better. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4321.42s)]
*  You know, if he was, if he could somehow or another have stayed alive and kicked his [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4325.54s)]
*  addictions and just got better. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4329.14s)]
*  But sometimes what brings you to the dance also sinks you, you know. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4331.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, he, he, him and I, him and, well, he introduced me to my business manager. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4335.94s)]

*  Shout out to Lester. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4346.1s)]
*  And, and Sam, when he was all fucked up and coked out and all that, he had fired everyone [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4347.1s)]
*  in his life except for Lester. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4353.34s)]
*  So Lester was always, always with him. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4357.06s)]
*  And he said to me, or Sam said to Lester, take care of him. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4359.26s)]
*  He's like my younger brother. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4362.7s)]
*  So ever since then, Lester's been taking care of me. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4364.88s)]
*  Wow, that's nice. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4367.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4368.58s)]

*  the biggest heart in the world. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4375.18s)]

*  I always made it a point, you know, me and my mom's caregiver and Scott, we'd always [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4483.24s)]
*  like put her in the car and drive her and we'd always take her for drives until her [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4487.34s)]
*  back started hurting and she'd be like, get me home, you know, but she'd always drive [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4494.48s)]
*  her by the Laugh Factory. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4500.24s)]

*  You know what I mean? [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4506.24s)]
*  And then we'd drive by the store and then she'd be like, why is that marquee like that? [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4507.44s)]
*  Call Tommy. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4512.92s)]

*  He fucking, he did shit that a normal employee would not do. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4520.04s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4523.48s)]
*  Not do. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4524.5199999999995s)]
*  He would carry her up the stairs. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4525.5199999999995s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4526.5199999999995s)]
*  And she wanted him to, you know, she wanted him to, she felt comfortable with him, you [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4527.88s)]
*  know, whether good, bad, it's not us to say, that's how she felt. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4534.76s)]
*  And yeah, you know, during those, you know, she didn't want to get sick. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4540.72s)]
*  It started, you know, it started her, my friend Bobby was with her in the front of the store [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4547.84s)]
*  back in the early 2000s and she's smoking her Capri cigarettes and she starts seeing [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4555.0s)]
*  her finger go like that. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4559.96s)]
*  And she goes, what's going on? [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4561.24s)]
*  Why is it doing that? [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4563.48s)]
*  That was in the early 2000s? [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4564.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4565.48s)]
*  That's when she started getting sick. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4566.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4567.48s)]
*  What's going on? [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4568.48s)]
*  And that's when she shifted her, her mind away from the store and she didn't want to [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4569.48s)]
*  get sick. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4574.0s)]
*  You know, she just, she didn't want to die at all. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4575.0s)]
*  And she did the best she could with, you know, whatever, you know, she got, I think a lot [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4578.6s)]
*  of it had to do with, you know, the business, you know, because she was an artist running [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4584.84s)]
*  a business. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4589.6s)]
*  Let me say that again. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4590.6s)]
*  She was an artist running a business. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4591.8s)]
*  So she wasn't a real, I don't want to say her, the business sense wasn't really her [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4594.900000000001s)]
*  thing. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4599.400000000001s)]
*  She was about the comics and it's hard to do both, you know, with the numbers and the [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4600.400000000001s)]
*  insurance and the, you know, and the taxes and all that shit that fucked with her. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4604.6s)]
*  Because that's not who she, because that's not who she was. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4609.46s)]
*  Of course. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4611.56s)]
*  If she was that way, she would never run the club the way she did. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4612.56s)]
*  Right. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4615.400000000001s)]
*  That's, that's, she ran it like an artist. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4616.400000000001s)]
*  So that's why I think she got sick. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4618.400000000001s)]
*  That's my feeling. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4620.580000000001s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4621.580000000001s)]
*  You know, that pressure, the business part of it. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4622.580000000001s)]
*  It could be. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4625.72s)]
*  I mean, pressure is fucking terrible for people. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4626.72s)]
*  That kind of stress is terrible for people. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4628.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4630.200000000001s)]
*  I mean, in so many ways, heart attacks, you know, people freak the fuck out, you know, [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4631.200000000001s)]
*  like you're not supposed to be redlined all the time. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4635.4800000000005s)]
*  You got to find some moments where you're chilled out. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4637.96s)]
*  And she did, she did, she did start making a lot of money and she did start buying property. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4641.400000000001s)]
*  She bought a theater on Los Palmas and Sunset and she called it the Richard Pryor Theater. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4646.68s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4653.400000000001s)]
*  Did you know about that? [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4654.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'd heard about it, but I'd never been there. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4655.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4657.24s)]
*  Neither was Richard. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4658.24s)]
*  What year was that? [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4659.24s)]
*  No, but my mom loved him so much. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4660.24s)]
*  My mom loved him so much. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4663.08s)]
*  And she's, she called it, she's, she goes, he could develop this stuff here, Polly. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4665.24s)]
*  This is where he can go to develop all his stuff. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4669.92s)]
*  And that's how much she loved Richard Pryor. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4672.64s)]
*  She loved him so much that she, that's like you're going to buy Tony Hinchcliffe a club, [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4674.68s)]
*  right? [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4679.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4680.76s)]
*  No, I'm just kidding. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4681.76s)]
*  And then she did the Dunes in Vegas. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4682.76s)]
*  That was a big deal. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4684.72s)]
*  That was a big deal. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4685.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4686.72s)]
*  Doing the Comedy Store in Vegas was a huge deal. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4687.72s)]
*  Huge deal. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4688.72s)]
*  I got video of me and Chris Rock back then because she had the show called New Faces. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4689.72s)]
*  You never did that. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4694.6s)]
*  No. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4695.6s)]
*  Because that was the 80s. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4696.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4697.6s)]
*  Late 80s. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4698.6s)]
*  When I came in, I had been doing stand-up for like six years. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4700.280000000001s)]
*  And when I lived in Boston, the Comedy Store was Mecca. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4703.72s)]
*  It was the place that everybody talked about. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4707.84s)]
*  Like you got to get to the Comedy Store. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4709.76s)]
*  Like it was like, Kinnison came from there. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4711.76s)]
*  Pryor came from there. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4714.04s)]
*  And all anyone talked about when they talked about clubs. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4715.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, there was clubs that we were doing in Boston. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4718.320000000001s)]
*  There was clubs to do in New York. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4720.84s)]
*  But really everybody wanted to get to the Comedy Store. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4722.200000000001s)]
*  And then when I first got there, I was on a sitcom already. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4724.240000000001s)]
*  You know, the sitcom was not doing well. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4729.52s)]
*  I was on Fox. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4731.120000000001s)]
*  It was failing. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4732.120000000001s)]
*  And the most important thing that happened to me was getting passed as a paid regular. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4733.120000000001s)]
*  And the Todd helped me out. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4739.280000000001s)]
*  The Todd sat next to your mom and was laughing really hard. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4742.200000000001s)]
*  And then he came up to me afterwards. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4746.64s)]
*  He goes, hey. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4747.84s)]
*  He goes, I laughed really hard at your jokes because you're really funny and also because [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4749.120000000001s)]
*  it means he's sitting next to me. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4752.200000000001s)]
*  And you're going to do that too to somebody else. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4753.76s)]
*  I'm like, okay, you got it. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4755.360000000001s)]
*  I'm like, that's great. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4757.56s)]
*  Like he like there was a community there. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4758.68s)]
*  Like he set it up like what the Todd did. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4761.92s)]
*  He set it up with me where I was going to do that for everybody. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4765.360000000001s)]
*  Like anytime anybody was really funny, I would go and I would one time. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4768.6s)]
*  What time your mom. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4772.8s)]
*  I don't want to say his name, but your mom booked this comedian that was fucking terrible [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4773.84s)]
*  to host the open mic night. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4777.76s)]
*  And Chris McGuire was supposed to do his first audition in front of your mom. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4778.84s)]
*  And I was like, there's no fucking way. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4784.400000000001s)]
*  I'm like, I'll do it. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4785.68s)]
*  So I hosted the open mic night just so that I could like set a stage for Chris. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4786.88s)]
*  I just wanted it to be a good show. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4792.68s)]
*  I don't know who Chris McGuire is. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4794.8s)]
*  He's a good friend of mine from Boston. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4796.08s)]

*  Very funny guy. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4801.8s)]

*  We started out together. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4803.76s)]
*  So he went on stage in front of her. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4804.68s)]
*  He didn't do good. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4806.2s)]
*  No, he did well. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4806.88s)]
*  He did really well. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4807.56s)]
*  No, he got passed. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4808.4400000000005s)]
*  But it was like I did the open mic hosting because I wanted to make sure it was set up [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4809.28s)]
*  good for your mom. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4815.16s)]
*  You had to tee it up. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4815.76s)]
*  Tee it up for your homie, right? [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4816.88s)]
*  Yeah, I wanted to tee it up. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4818.0s)]
*  Because if you couldn't sit next to her and laugh, you should tell her someone's funny. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4819.320000000001s)]
*  But if you fucked up though, if you told her, you fucking think he's funny, she would get [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4826.200000000001s)]
*  so mad. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4832.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4832.88s)]
*  Your mother had amazing taste though. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4834.360000000001s)]
*  The funniest was is I'd sit next to her as well and I would see people go on stage. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4836.04s)]
*  And if she called you over, you did good. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4842.52s)]
*  And if she didn't call you over, she wasn't interested. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4844.360000000001s)]
*  And I would just see if they'd do their set and they'd just walk by her and they're like [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4846.76s)]
*  looking at her and she's just like just going through her papers and shit. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4850.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4856.240000000001s)]
*  But yeah. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4857.04s)]
*  But if she liked you, you know, she brought you in. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4858.0s)]
*  You know. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4860.8s)]
*  But having someone like that, like some gold standard bear keeper at the top was very valuable [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4861.280000000001s)]
*  for comedians. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4867.52s)]
*  It was very valuable. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4868.84s)]
*  And she also would do when she thought you were funny, she'd put you on after killers. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4870.08s)]
*  You always had to follow like whoever was famous that was going to go down there. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4874.5199999999995s)]
*  She wanted to make sure that you were tested, throw you into the fire and that's how you [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4878.28s)]
*  get better. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4883.0s)]
*  She just fucking knew, man. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4884.0s)]
*  She knew. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4885.48s)]
*  And it's all things that people talk about now. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4886.32s)]
*  But I think in her own way, she sort of devised like a modern strategy for getting better at [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4888.8s)]
*  standup. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4897.32s)]
*  Having the environment, which she created, having one person is like ruthlessly critical [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4898.8s)]
*  that watches over everybody's material and everybody sets and then everybody aspires [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4903.76s)]
*  for the approval of your mom. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4909.360000000001s)]
*  And she had had it set up so perfectly. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4912.08s)]
*  And because she wasn't a comic either and because she was, you know, she's royalty in [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4914.4400000000005s)]
*  the standup comedy world, she had everyone's respect. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4918.96s)]
*  So there and she was right. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4921.92s)]
*  She was right. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4923.68s)]
*  She knew. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4924.2s)]
*  She knew what the fuck to tell you. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4925.52s)]
*  She didn't like Seinfeld. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4927.08s)]
*  Which was hilarious. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4929.400000000001s)]
*  Which is hilarious. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4930.400000000001s)]
*  He lived up the street from me and my mom. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4931.839999999999s)]
*  So me and my mom would walk the dog, Kelly, her dog, and we would walk by his house. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4935.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4941.679999999999s)]
*  Oh, there he is. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4942.44s)]
*  Not happening. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4944.08s)]
*  You know, rat tat tat New York. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4946.92s)]
*  That's so weird. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4949.4s)]
*  Keep it going. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4950.16s)]
*  Let's keep moving. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4951.639999999999s)]
*  I'm like, mom, be nice to him. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4952.5199999999995s)]
*  He's like, no, let's go. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4953.679999999999s)]
*  And she just didn't buy into it. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4955.799999999999s)]
*  That's so funny. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4957.599999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4958.679999999999s)]
*  She didn't buy into it. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4959.16s)]
*  I wonder why. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4960.799999999999s)]
*  Maybe because he didn't need her. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4962.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4964.759999999999s)]
*  Cause he had already made it and he had a sitcom. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4965.839999999999s)]
*  He was Seinfeld. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4967.92s)]
*  Oh, so he was already on Seinfeld when he was a, I mean, he'd been on that show for [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4969.0s)]
*  a while. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4973.5199999999995s)]
*  It was around that time and was the early nineties, right? [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4973.879999999999s)]
*  I don't know what the exact date was or Seinfeld. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4977.2s)]
*  She didn't like it when you were too developed. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4980.12s)]
*  Correct. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4982.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4983.599999999999s)]
*  She liked getting people that had talent that were on the up. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4984.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4987.24s)]
*  She didn't really like a lot of New York comics. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4987.48s)]
*  For some reason. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4990.56s)]
*  She, you know what I mean? [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4991.400000000001s)]
*  There was also a rift between obviously her and Bud Friedman and her and Lauren [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4992.76s)]
*  Michaels. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4997.360000000001s)]
*  People ask me like, Hey, when you're doing all your movies, did you ever do [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=4997.96s)]
*  Saturday Night Live? [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5001.6s)]
*  Do you ever host Saturday Night Live? [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5002.360000000001s)]
*  And I never did. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5004.160000000001s)]
*  And I think a lot of it has to do with Lauren Michaels and my mom. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5005.200000000001s)]
*  I'm sure it can't help. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5008.68s)]
*  No, can't help because she was harsh. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5010.120000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5012.56s)]
*  My mom had Jim Carrey and Damon Waynes and all these guys and they were from the [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5013.160000000001s)]
*  store. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5017.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5018.120000000001s)]
*  And, you know, so. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5018.84s)]
*  I wonder if your mom was concerned that if someone like Seinfeld got on, that [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5022.320000000001s)]
*  people who would want to see sitcom style stand up, like very sterile stand up, [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5028.160000000001s)]
*  would start coming to the clubs. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5034.56s)]
*  Like, and then you would start getting people going to see people just because [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5036.64s)]
*  they're famous and not really because they're good. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5041.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, she probably had a method to her approach. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5045.36s)]
*  I wonder what she was thinking. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5050.32s)]
*  Or I wonder if she just didn't want it because he was already developed and she [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5052.599999999999s)]
*  couldn't work with him. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5055.84s)]
*  I don't think she just liked him. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5057.32s)]
*  I just don't think that. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5058.76s)]
*  I just don't think she liked that style. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5059.96s)]
*  But then she's driving by his house. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5061.84s)]
*  She's still talking shit. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5063.04s)]
*  No, we're walking. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5063.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, walking by the house. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5064.24s)]
*  And then he said, he said, and that's another thing he never asked me on his [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5065.92s)]
*  fucking car show. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5070.16s)]
*  I got all my friends on his car show. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5071.44s)]
*  I'm like, dude. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5073.08s)]
*  And it's again, I think like it's always awkward. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5073.96s)]
*  And Leno too. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5076.4s)]
*  Whenever I see Leno, it's fucking weird. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5077.28s)]
*  Letterman's cool. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5080.5199999999995s)]
*  I love Letterman. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5081.4s)]
*  But Leno has always been weird because these guys like Leno striked against my [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5082.32s)]
*  mom and there was this weird thing. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5085.68s)]
*  And, and, you know, and, and, and my relationship with Leno is very different. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5087.88s)]
*  He's always been very nice to me and we both love cars. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5091.92s)]
*  So I have great conversations with him about cars. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5094.96s)]
*  I don't know the history of that. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5097.92s)]
*  I mean, I do know it, but I wasn't aware of it. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5099.04s)]
*  But, but my point is, is that he never did anything to me. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5101.08s)]
*  I'm just talking about my mom's relationship with Jay. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5105.24s)]
*  And I think it has to do with the strike. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5108.16s)]
*  But when I did see Jay at the Palm restaurant in Beverly Hills years ago, when [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5110.2s)]
*  my mom was there, he came up and gave her a kiss. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5115.08s)]
*  But then of course she mumbled, the fuck is going on with him? [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5117.76s)]
*  Tell me, get the fuck out of. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5121.24s)]
*  That's just the way she was so funny. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5124.64s)]
*  She was so funny. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5127.64s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5128.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5129.08s)]
*  And when your mom told you you're funny, it was like the greatest gift [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5129.839999999999s)]
*  that you could ever give a comic. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5134.48s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5140.2s)]
*  She never said that to me. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5140.639999999999s)]
*  I had to become famous, bro, before she put me on her stage. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5143.44s)]
*  For real, dude. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5146.639999999999s)]

*  Hey bro. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5157.08s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5158.04s)]
*  That. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5159.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5160.68s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5160.96s)]
*  And but she's I mean, I've been told by comedians that she was very proud, [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5161.56s)]
*  but she never said to me that's another thing is she never told me she loved me. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5165.88s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5170.0s)]
*  I can't say I love you because then you wouldn't be a comic. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5171.88s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5175.04s)]
*  You're a science project. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5177.72s)]
*  She used to lock me in the back. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5180.4800000000005s)]
*  I can't say I love you because then you wouldn't be a comic. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5181.64s)]
*  Wow. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5184.64s)]
*  She figured out a way to make you a comic. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5185.88s)]
*  I programmed him. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5188.4800000000005s)]
*  I used to put him in the back bedroom. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5190.08s)]
*  He would pound his head against the crib. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5191.8s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5194.04s)]
*  It's true. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5195.4800000000005s)]
*  So imagine that was like how like a dictatorship created comedians [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5197.04s)]
*  like Soviet block. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5202.04s)]
*  They decided to take over the comedy world and they're just going to torture kids. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5203.400000000001s)]
*  To start open mics, torture kids at a very young age. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5209.56s)]
*  I think we have a good thing here. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5212.96s)]
*  We can do it. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5214.360000000001s)]
*  The mothership. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5214.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5215.92s)]
*  Fuck them up. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5216.88s)]
*  Now, you'd have to do it in a country that doesn't have the Constitution. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5217.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5220.48s)]
*  If you're going to do it right, it's going to be some communist dictatorship. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5220.96s)]
*  Maybe China could do this. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5224.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5225.44s)]
*  They're probably already Russia. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5226.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5227.679999999999s)]
*  Russia could do that. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5228.04s)]
*  And then introduce them slowly to the idea of stand up comedy. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5229.679999999999s)]
*  But beat them first and torture them. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5233.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5235.0s)]
*  Definitely don't make them comfortable. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5235.639999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5237.32s)]
*  Don't beat them. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5237.84s)]
*  Did you get beaten? [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5238.8s)]
*  No. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5239.84s)]
*  See, that would be too much. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5240.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5241.759999999999s)]
*  Then you wouldn't be able to get on stage. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5242.12s)]
*  You'd be fucked up. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5243.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5244.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5245.84s)]
*  I mean, if you really think about it, like what are the odds that someone becomes a stand [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5246.96s)]
*  up comedian? [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5254.2s)]
*  If you look at the 300, whatever the hell million people it is, just in this country [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5256.12s)]
*  alone, forget about all the other countries that do stand up. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5260.36s)]
*  What are the odds that someone becomes a comic? [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5263.24s)]
*  Like they're not fucking good. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5265.36s)]
*  They're pretty small. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5267.28s)]
*  I tell people, I say, because people come up to me, I'm sure they come up to you. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5268.24s)]
*  I'm like, don't do it unless it gets you out of bed. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5272.0s)]
*  Don't do it as a hobby. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5275.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5276.8s)]
*  You know, like I get, I mean, I'm 55. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5277.24s)]
*  I've been doing it for 35 years. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5279.8s)]
*  I love it now even more than I loved it back then. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5281.64s)]
*  I just love it. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5285.12s)]
*  I think when you get older, one of the things that happens is you can appreciate it more. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5286.32s)]
*  You can appreciate what this thing is. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5290.72s)]
*  You know, you appreciate how lucky you are to be able to do it. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5292.64s)]
*  There's so much fun. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5297.2s)]
*  It makes people feel good. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5298.28s)]
*  It really does. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5299.76s)]
*  Like the whole audience has a great time. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5300.36s)]
*  Everybody feels better. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5302.4400000000005s)]
*  It's like a drug we all take together. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5303.32s)]
*  We're all laughing about things together. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5305.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5306.92s)]
*  You know, it's just my job to put it together. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5307.6s)]
*  It's your job to, you know, piece together your ideas in the most palatable way possible. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5309.76s)]
*  That's what we're all just doing. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5315.04s)]
*  And it's the most fun thing to do. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5316.56s)]
*  And the fact that you do that for a living, of course you'd want to do it all the time. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5318.400000000001s)]
*  And as you get older and you realize that, you know, most people don't really get to do what they truly love to do. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5321.92s)]
*  There's most people out there in some weird thing where they kind of like what they do, but they maybe wish they were doing something else. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5328.8s)]
*  When you're doing stand up, when you're on stage killing, you never think, I wish I was doing something else. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5334.84s)]
*  You're just like, this is so much fun. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5339.52s)]
*  So much fun. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5342.120000000001s)]
*  It's the less, for me, it's the less, and I'm sure for you, it's the place that I feel the less stressed. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5343.52s)]
*  Yes. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5349.52s)]
*  The least stressed. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5350.4400000000005s)]
*  Least stressed. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5351.04s)]
*  You know, after you get off stage, you're like, you know, there's this, I don't know if it's dopamine or I don't know what the fuck it is, but it's a release. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5352.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5359.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5360.4400000000005s)]
*  Like when my mom was dying, like those 15 years, I was touring a lot. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5361.0s)]
*  I wasn't around the store a lot when you were there. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5364.68s)]
*  I was on the road and it fucking saved my life. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5367.360000000001s)]
*  Big time. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5370.360000000001s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5370.84s)]

*  It's, it is. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5373.96s)]
*  It's a, it's a stress reliever that we have. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5375.160000000001s)]
*  We're lucky. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5379.76s)]

*  We're very lucky. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5381.52s)]
*  It's just, you know, it's, it's amazing how much it takes, like how many pieces have to be put into place to make [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5383.68s)]
*  a club work. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5394.56s)]
*  That's why it's amazing that your mom was able to do it and sustain it for so long. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5395.88s)]
*  There's so many moving pieces. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5400.080000000001s)]
*  There's so much going on, you know, and you're dealing with so many different personalities, you know, so many different crazy people that are performers. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5402.160000000001s)]

*  It was, it was fun to see. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5470.32s)]
*  It was fun to see you loose and relaxed because I think when I've seen you at the store, I think because you grew up at the store, the connection you have to the store. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5472.24s)]
*  I think there's a lot of pressure on you, you know, and not a positive way when you go on stage there. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5482.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5487.4400000000005s)]
*  Is that true? [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5488.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5488.52s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5491.4400000000005s)]
*  Because when I walk in the store, even to, even if I'm not performing there, it's uncomfortable because I'm walking into my mother. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5491.68s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5498.24s)]
*  I'm walking into my father. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5498.88s)]
*  I'm walking in all that history, you know, and when I'm away, when I'm away from there, it's, it's Polly Shore. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5500.0s)]

*  It's, you know, they don't care about that. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5509.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5511.92s)]
*  You were silly and loose. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5512.4400000000005s)]
*  And I was like, I think that's the first time I've ever seen him like that, which is crazy. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5513.6s)]
*  Is it all the years I've known you to see you that loose, like the first time ever. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5518.28s)]

*  And that was the first time I was ever on your stage. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5524.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5526.84s)]
*  So that was cool. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5527.4s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5528.16s)]

*  There's something cool about it. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5536.4400000000005s)]
*  It's very unusual. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5537.88s)]
*  And so what's it like touring with Chappelle? [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5539.04s)]
*  I mean, that must be, you must be pinching yourself on that. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5540.92s)]
*  I see you on stage with him. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5543.6s)]
*  You must be, I mean, because you know, and I know he's got to be the best out there. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5545.24s)]
*  He's the best right now. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5549.28s)]
*  He might be the best ever. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5550.4400000000005s)]
*  I agree. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5551.84s)]

*  I mean, Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy, those guys, George Carlin, they never sold out eight [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5557.24s)]
*  nights at the bowl. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5561.64s)]
*  No, no, he could have done 20 more nights. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5562.8s)]
*  He could do whatever he wants. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5565.36s)]
*  What's it like working with him? [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5566.76s)]
*  It's a privilege. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5568.96s)]
*  You know, you're very, very, very fortunate to have an artist of that caliber as a great [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5570.04s)]
*  friend. You know, he came to the club the first week it was opened, maybe second week. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5574.84s)]
*  Maybe second week. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5580.2s)]
*  Yeah, he was second week somewhere around there. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5581.6s)]
*  It was like right when we were like really open and he actually opened the little room. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5584.12s)]
*  He was the first person on stage in that little room with Shane Gillis. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5588.52s)]
*  Shane did 15 minutes and he brought up Chappelle and then Chappelle did like, man, he did [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5592.56s)]
*  over an hour. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5597.52s)]
*  I think he did like an hour and a half and he was just fucking around and being loose [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5598.719999999999s)]
*  and just working on new material. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5603.44s)]
*  He goes, I'm going to practice on y'all. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5605.12s)]
*  He just practices on people and he and he comes up with material that way. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5608.5599999999995s)]
*  He puts himself in these very vulnerable positions and he works through ideas and has [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5612.719999999999s)]
*  someone film it. And then that's how he pieces together his material. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5617.36s)]
*  Yeah. You know, when I watch his Netflix specials, you know, he's got so many of them. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5620.639999999999s)]
*  They're still fresh. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5625.76s)]
*  Yeah. You know, and I watch other people's Netflix specials because I'm open to other [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5626.88s)]
*  comics and it's just like, I can't connect. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5631.64s)]
*  Yeah. You know what I mean? [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5635.080000000001s)]
*  And with him, like I always say, people always ask me who your favorite comedian is now. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5636.200000000001s)]
*  I say there's Dave Chappelle and there's everyone else. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5641.360000000001s)]
*  That's just how I feel. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5644.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And I don't know if it's because I grew up around it. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5645.400000000001s)]
*  I'm not saying there's not great comics now, but when I look at that OR stage now and I [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5647.92s)]
*  see the comedians on there, my mind goes to Kenison. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5653.48s)]
*  My mind goes to Robin. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5656.96s)]
*  My mind goes to it because those are the people that I saw on that stage. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5658.5599999999995s)]
*  And with Chappelle, I'm just like, it's just I've never seen anything like it. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5662.44s)]
*  You know, we're so blessed to have him in our lives. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5667.759999999999s)]
*  It's not just it's really funny. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5670.16s)]
*  It's like the things he's talking about and the way he's breaking things down, his [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5671.799999999999s)]
*  perspective on things. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5676.5199999999995s)]

*  And he's so he's so relaxed and he's so like fucking. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=5682.32s)]

*  Yeah, he wasn't happy about it. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=6279.0s)]
*  Imagine Scott taking my act. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=6280.72s)]
*  But just the idea that you could have a guy who kind of looks like you [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=6282.56s)]
*  because he's your brother, but everybody knows is not really him. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=6288.04s)]

*  Heroin culture is a strange culture. The heroin musician culture is very very strange [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=6942.88s)]
*  Because it's it's very prevalent about amongst elite musicians [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=6948.46s)]
*  You know in terms of like you look at the guys that we we all worship like Hendrix did heroin [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=6953.86s)]

*  So I think there's probably a feel to it. I think I think it's a place they want to go [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=6984.98s)]
*  So I think they're writing but they feel like yo if I do this I can go even to another level [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=6990.78s)]
*  Like I I don't know. I mean I can ask Jerry the guitar player [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=6996.219999999999s)]

*  I think there's something to heroin and its effects on people that we we're looking at it only in a negative way. Hmm [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7011.54s)]
*  I've never done heroin, but I did do a morphine drip once when I had my knee surgery and it was amazing [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7018.66s)]
*  So I would imagine heroin feels fucking great, but there was a guy that I knew that was a pool hustler [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7024.9s)]

*  He would sit on the bar stool like this who stood at one of those billiards chairs. He would sit there like this [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7044.259999999999s)]

*  I'm interested in things that make me less secure [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7173.94s)]

*  Mm-hmm, you know and see the faults in your own stuff because you're kind of looking at things almost when you semi paranoid when you write [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7180.4s)]
*  Do you do you smoke a doobie? Yeah, you know right before yeah and what's your writing process? [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7187.7s)]

*  And I'll just sit in front of the computer and just I just start writing just start writing [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7201.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah, just try to find anything and all I'm looking for is like paragraphs that I can extract [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7206.799999999999s)]
*  I'm looking for a premise and some of my best bits have come out of that just like forcing it and then once I force [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7212.12s)]
*  An idea like get get something down then I start dissecting it and chopping it up [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7219.679999999999s)]
*  And then get it to a place where I feel like this is funny enough [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7224.84s)]
*  I know where it's going enough that I can talk about it on and when and when you [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7227.5599999999995s)]
*  When you write you don't write for the joke you write for the angle and the story [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7231.5199999999995s)]
*  I just write on a subject so just like so if I'm gonna write [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7235.84s)]
*  This is just one way I do it another way [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7239.2s)]
*  I do it is I'll come up with something funny and then I write it down on my phone [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7241.48s)]
*  I do that a lot, too [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7244.4s)]
*  But when I write it's like say if I'm gonna do something about caffeine [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7245.68s)]
*  I'll just sit and write about caffeine like if there's it's not really good subject [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7249.72s)]
*  But you know whatever the subject is they think it's funny [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7255.740000000001s)]
*  I just start writing about it is look at it from all the different angles [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7258.64s)]
*  Looking at from a silly angle looking at it from a haters angle look at it from a lover [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7263.64s)]
*  Look at it twist it up make it so like even though it's a ridiculous thing to say [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7267.6s)]
*  Maybe this is good for society this happens [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7271.72s)]
*  You know and like have funny ways to look at it [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7274.6s)]
*  And then I try it on stage and then when I try it on stage I listen to it [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7277.8s)]
*  And I fuck listen to it back. Yeah, I'll listen to it back [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7282.0s)]

*  You know or I know what I said [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7287.76s)]
*  So I'll just go and work on it in the next set and try to find like another way to go in it [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7289.84s)]
*  Maybe maybe I'm missing something like sometimes the best version of a bit came from [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7294.400000000001s)]
*  Just a chance way of saying it a different way one night [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7299.639999999999s)]

*  disconnect between the people in this country and [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7344.22s)]

*  tend to join groups and [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7348.7s)]
*  And decide that the people in the other group are the bad people and we're the good people and we're gonna stop that [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7350.86s)]

*  Whatever the fuck is going on and with Russia and Ukraine spilling over into the United States and causing chaos for everyone on the planet [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7373.46s)]

*  how NATO started violating [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7417.94s)]
*  some sort of an agreement and they're moving their arms closer to where Russia's and [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7422.0199999999995s)]
*  They'd specific people had specifically said that they were trying to get Ukraine to join NATO [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7427.54s)]
*  If Ukraine joined NATO that would be at the border of Russia an armed force of the whole world and [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7433.1s)]
*  It's just tactically it's if you're a general if you're a person who is a president or a [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7440.18s)]
*  King of a country you're not gonna let somebody like pull right up on your fucking border like that with a new army attached to it [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7447.9400000000005s)]
*  Like why why do you guys need a new army? What do you plan on doing with that new army? [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7454.62s)]
*  Why are your fucking cannons pointing at us? You know, it's all bad [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7458.06s)]
*  It's all bad, dude [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7462.34s)]
*  And it's all bad because the military-industrial complex is a gigantic force of nature and power and money [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7463.5s)]
*  There's so much going on and it's a natural thing that happens when people get into power when people get into power [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7470.02s)]
*  If they have that kind of money, they're making that kind of money [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7477.82s)]
*  one of the things that they absolutely are gonna do is they're gonna try to make as [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7481.14s)]
*  Much money as they can with any situation that comes up now if you're in the business of telling jokes, that's great [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7485.98s)]
*  You're just gonna tour and do bigger arenas. Yeah, you're at this big place [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7492.74s)]
*  Yeah, you're at this place more more seats more tickets, but if you're in the war business [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7496.219999999999s)]
*  You you're just getting to the edge of no more civilization [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7502.0599999999995s)]
*  like you're pushing things to the edge of what could happen today if someone's fucking crazy and someone is dying already and [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7506.5s)]
*  Someone is a dictator that literally has the ability to launch nukes on your last breath you could fucking do each and then it's [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7514.62s)]
*  Chaos and the question doesn't become whether or not he shouldn't should have done that. Of course. He shouldn't have done that [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7522.78s)]
*  The question could there have been steps that were made to prevent that from happening in the future [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7529.58s)]
*  And if those steps could be made they should probably be made because this is where we are [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7534.639999999999s)]
*  This is this scares the shit out of me in a way that nothing in my life has ever scared the shit out of me [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7540.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's been it's [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7545.42s)]
*  It's the real deal. It's the real deal. Yeah, it's a real deal and it doesn't we did why are we involved in this? [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7547.62s)]
*  Why is anyone involved in this? Why are groups of people? [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7552.54s)]
*  Involved in this kind of conflict when the groups of people don't benefit. That's what's weird. Well, I think that you know, you know, he [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7555.82s)]
*  You know we as Americans from my feeling is that we see these poor people get killed and [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7564.46s)]
*  We don't want to like have our guys [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7570.98s)]
*  You know like like Afghanistan go in there [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7573.58s)]
*  But what here's some weapons because we feel bad for all your innocent people that are dying [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7576.28s)]
*  So you guys figure it out? That's a great way to look at it, right? [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7581.34s)]
*  Yeah, that's a positive way to look at it. Like if you wanted to positively support [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7584.1s)]
*  the [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7589.3s)]
*  Well, that's a man money and weapons America. That's what I would say. I think that he I think that Putin [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7590.42s)]
*  Knew that going into it [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7597.18s)]
*  He goes we're gonna we're gonna do this and I know America is gonna give these guys money and it's gonna fuck up their economy [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7598.66s)]
*  Could be I mean because our economy is pretty fucked up right now. Yeah, but I think it would be fucked up anyway [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7605.14s)]
*  I think these people are goofy. I [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7611.34s)]
*  Think you know, it's it's really hard to run a country and most people aren't very good at it [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7614.58s)]
*  Just just how it goes [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7619.9400000000005s)]
*  There's very few people that are actually good at it [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7621.82s)]
*  And it's very clear that this country is being run by a bunch of people other than just the president [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7623.9400000000005s)]
*  I mean, but I don't know how much say he has but it's a lot of other people are involved and they're not doing such [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7629.64s)]
*  A great job and they haven't made course corrections very good [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7635.14s)]
*  There's a lot of mistakes that have been made that didn't have to be made and that's just how it is [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7637.98s)]
*  It's just like it's not being run [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7643.94s)]
*  Well, and so you have to go well who could do it better could it be a Republican or it could be a better Democrat? [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7645.74s)]
*  And if it's not a better Democrat like how are we gonna get a better Democrat if you don't let the president debate? [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7650.82s)]
*  So they won't let them debate because Robert Kennedy jr. And what is that other woman's name? [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7656.18s)]
*  Marion Williamson Marion Williamson apparently they're they're both promising candidates [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7661.7s)]
*  For the Democratic Party, but they won't let him debate before the primaries [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7667.08s)]
*  So it's like that's not that democratic like that's not how it's supposed to do. Yeah [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7671.72s)]
*  I agree with you. I think both sides are fucked up. Yeah, I mean, I think both sides are it's all run by money, man [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7676.68s)]
*  It's like that's they let money into politics and people can profit off of decisions [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7682.68s)]
*  And it's a mess that you can't pull out of it's one of those things like once you've got that in there [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7688.2s)]
*  It's like you're not taking the pee out of the ocean kid [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7693.0s)]
*  It's like that's it's in there. You know, you're not fixing that. Yeah, and then the news organizations [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7695.96s)]
*  I mean I flip back and forth and when I was growing up [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7701.68s)]
*  It was just a news anchor just reading the teleprompter and basically just reading the news [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7704.84s)]
*  Mm-hmm, and now both sides have something to say and I never had a realize [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7710.88s)]
*  Yeah, I never remembered that and it's it's you know, I watch it because I'm a comedian and I look at the comedy in it [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7715.44s)]
*  And I don't take it serious [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7722.36s)]
*  That's good [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7724.92s)]
*  Yeah, and and you know these news anchors they roll their eyes they say shit and they're both way too far [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7727.16s)]
*  Left and way too far, right? [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7733.36s)]
*  Well, you're taking a real chance if you're running a corporate network and you have on people that are gonna give opinions [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7735.0s)]
*  because you're gonna have people that just give the hot take of the day and [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7742.2s)]
*  repeat things that everybody says and [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7746.4s)]
*  You know use phrases that they've heard on TV and the news and know that they have to hit certain beats in order to [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7748.639999999999s)]
*  Be accepted and then you're gonna get people that are very arrogant about enforcing their own personal [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7754.599999999999s)]
*  Ideologies in their sets and views of things and they'll argue with people in a very uncomfortable way [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7759.5599999999995s)]
*  Where you you see people with differing opinions now on the internet in particular having? [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7764.48s)]
*  Thoughtful conversations with each other even though they have different opinions doesn't have to it doesn't have to [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7770.4s)]
*  Devolve to this like stupid like name-calling yelling game like why why you calling to the names? [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7776.0s)]
*  Why insulting each other like is this getting anything done? Like can you keep it together as a human being? [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7781.32s)]
*  Do you have the character to keep it together? [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7786.719999999999s)]
*  And so this like the way people communicate in these like short clips in these CNN things when you're watching people argue about stuff [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7788.48s)]
*  It's like my god [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7796.28s)]
*  Is this a bad format for this and my god are you guys bad at doing it in this format? [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7797.599999999999s)]
*  Because it's like you're just [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7804.32s)]
*  Virtue signaling and complaining. It's like the the way you're interfacing with people. Yeah, I think it's all fake. I think the second [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7806.2s)]
*  The cameras are off. I think Tucker Carlson is super liberal [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7813.96s)]
*  Yeah, I think that Don Lemon is super Republican. I do I do really think that I don't I think that but I do think that Tucker [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7817.14s)]
*  Carlson used to be a deadhead [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7824.68s)]
*  Yes, I which is amazing. Yeah, he's from California. He's from Los or he's from Santa Monica, but but [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7826.52s)]
*  I think it's all entertainment [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7833.76s)]
*  I think these guys are as narcissistic as the most actors that are in Hollywood [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7835.8s)]
*  Yeah, I think these news anchors the second that the cameras off they're looking at their there, you know, like anyone else [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7840.8s)]
*  I think they're it's entertainment dude. They're just human beings. Yeah, at the end of the day, they're just human beings and [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7846.8s)]
*  Everybody is subject to the same weirdness all of them no matter what the profession is, you know, it's like [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7852.72s)]

*  Yeah, well, there's a way to talk Polly a way that settles people and calms their fears [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7895.4800000000005s)]
*  Mmm, that's the way we prefer to talk here on k106 [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7900.8s)]
*  Yeah, you know who I loved was Brian Brian Williams. Remember him? Yes, and loved him [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7904.84s)]
*  Yeah, he was good. I thought he was great [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7911.72s)]

*  But then that kind of went away a little bit [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7922.2s)]
*  Not the people that got shot at oh, okay [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7925.88s)]
*  Yeah, they're not really interested in hearing from you anymore [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7928.76s)]
*  If you can just like make up a story, but Hillary Clinton did that too, right? [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7931.12s)]
*  Didn't you like make up some or there was a dispute in her story? [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7935.28s)]
*  I just wish I just wish there wasn't a Fox in the CNN [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7939.72s)]
*  I wish there was just a said news and just read what was on the news and it was the people to [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7942.92s)]
*  Decide what what they think? Yeah as opposed to giving opinions [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7948.36s)]
*  That's my thought that's how it was when I was a kid. The thing is it's like you don't really know these people very well [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7952.36s)]
*  So even when they're giving their opinions, you don't know them very well. You don't really know them [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7959.4s)]
*  You don't really hear them, but they should probably have a disclaimer and say like yo, I don't know shit [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7963.4400000000005s)]

*  You would go fucking crazy [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7988.7s)]
*  Imagine if that's how you communicate for the rest of your life or if you only talk to people that talk to you like a news anchor [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=7992.14s)]

*  You know [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8245.14s)]

*  because it used to be that you had to do that if you wanted to do comedy because if [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8250.26s)]
*  You didn't get a sitcom people wouldn't come to see you in the clubs because they wouldn't know who you are right you know [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8253.779999999999s)]

*  Or you'd have to do the Tonight Show with Johnny back in the day [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8262.099999999999s)]

*  Yeah, big Jay Okerson did it right a lot of people have done that well [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8290.02s)]
*  Shane Gillis did it before him and a lot of a lot of his success came out of that as well [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8294.060000000001s)]
*  And I think I think you know the internet is a great thing for guys like me especially [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8298.5s)]
*  Because you know if I'm not getting a movie offer if I'm not getting a TV offer, and I'm going on stage [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8304.5s)]
*  I'm touring I still want to do other shit [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8309.62s)]
*  Yeah, and so for instance I can do a YouTube I could do Instagram do all my stupid videos, so I think it's a good thing [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8311.62s)]
*  Oh for sure yeah, no it's definitely you know it's definitely and it's a good thing for several reasons [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8318.14s)]
*  It's a good thing to get your stuff out there [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8322.94s)]
*  But it's also a good thing to to be stay creative [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8325.38s)]
*  Because in the old days if you come up with an idea you'd get it develop it [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8328.46s)]
*  And it takes a long time yes now you come up with an idea you could put it out the next day [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8332.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and I love that that's what's great about YouTube [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8336.859999999999s)]
*  You know so I could put my stuff right out on YouTube I could do videos on there [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8339.32s)]
*  No, and I think it's cool. Yeah, I think it's cute. It's huge and it's also. It's great that comics can just be free [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8342.9s)]
*  And they're not attached to this thing that can't accept them if they have jokes about this or that or anything or they're controversial [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8350.18s)]
*  They swear too much [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8357.539999999999s)]
*  It doesn't matter anymore like now with podcasts are a completely new industry that is as big as television [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8359.1s)]
*  Is if not better so a bad thing is a good thing yeah? [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8365.619999999999s)]
*  It's not even a bad thing. It's just a changing thing and you give people access like this to something [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8369.06s)]
*  That's you know [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8373.74s)]
*  Where you could pause it anytime you want watch it whenever you want like a regular talk show it's clunky [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8375.54s)]
*  It's clunky doesn't work that good [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8381.14s)]
*  Whereas if you were you know? [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8383.94s)]
*  You're imagining where it's going to go. It's probably going to go to some completely unexpected place next like nobody saw a podcast coming [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8386.94s)]
*  Right nobody thought this was ever gonna be a big thing so there's probably something like that [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8394.54s)]
*  That's gonna be coming next and you'd have to like predict it based on it have to be like [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8398.66s)]
*  You'd have to analyze like lifestyle things and like you know you have to figure out what what what new kind of technology? [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8404.46s)]
*  Would interface with people like how would people? [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8412.099999999999s)]
*  How would people enjoy something in a new way? [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8415.66s)]
*  I don't know what the answer to that is but whether it's virtual reality augmented reality, but when that comes along [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8417.98s)]
*  it's also when when you go to a nightclub and you see a [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8424.619999999999s)]
*  You know back in the day when you go to a nightclub [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8428.74s)]
*  Like people would be up dancing and now you go to a nightclub people are staring at their phones [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8431.3s)]
*  You know so if you want to talk to a girl you can't really because they're staring at their phone [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8435.619999999999s)]
*  That's why I think it'd be cool to have some sort of [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8439.9s)]
*  You know where you kind of can can can? [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8442.22s)]

*  I thought you meant a ring no like an actual inside [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8549.44s)]
*  They make you wear a chip ring [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8552.92s)]
*  Like with the like the logo of the company on it keep your ring on 24 7 even when you shower [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8554.92s)]
*  Yeah, your ring breaks will get you a new one, but you are a proud employee of Walmart. You will keep that walk [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8559.8s)]
*  Fuck a Walmart ring what you don't do it dogs [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8566.88s)]
*  Don't you do that with the dog people dogs that work at Walmart you son of a bitch [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8570.56s)]
*  No, you hear what he said your dog. I have a dog. I have a chip in my dog [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8575.12s)]
*  So my dog gets lost or if your dog is actually free dog gets picked up at the pound [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8579.2s)]
*  So the pound can scan it and they get your your kind of like a head of lettuce [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8583.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, and they've if you have a chip in there, and then they go okay. We've probably we found your dog [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8588.2s)]
*  Which yes, that's nice. That's very cool. Yeah, it's a wild-ass time [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8593.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's gonna get wilder this meets you kaku interview that I did yesterday [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8598.439999999999s)]
*  We were talking about quantum computing and what that means and what they're gonna be able to do as they get better and better and better [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8602.64s)]
*  It's like holy shit [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8608.96s)]
*  He's like there's a giant revolution. It's gonna change the world and it's about to happen. What did he say? [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8612.439999999999s)]
*  well, there's a there's a competition right now between Microsoft and IBM and Google and [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8617.039999999999s)]
*  China and they're all trying to be the first to develop a real quantum computer [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8622.76s)]
*  They already have a couple that they've devised, but they are they're only [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8629.16s)]
*  Designed to do very specific tasks. They don't have like an artificial general intelligence quantum computer yet, but when they do [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8633.960000000001s)]
*  So what's that gonna be it's that whoever figures it out first? [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8641.18s)]
*  There's a mad race right now between these giant corporations and between the country of China [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8645.08s)]
*  And they're in the middle of this battle to see who wins this and whoever wins this likely has technological [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8652.28s)]
*  Superiority over the entire world because these things will be able to crack any kind of code that anybody has any encryption [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8659.480000000001s)]
*  It'll be able to crack everything. So what's it? What's it look like or what's it gonna? [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8666.7s)]
*  What what is this guy's vision of what he thinks? That's gonna look like well what it looks like now is like some super fucking [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8670.52s)]
*  Science-fiction a space shit. It looks like all these crazy golden coils that are wrapped around this one [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8676.6s)]
*  Smaller device and the smaller device is this computer is this quantum computer all that other stuff is just the cooling mechanism [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8684.800000000001s)]
*  For the computer. It's see can you pull up an image of it would whatever? [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8693.0s)]
*  Michio Kaku put on yesterday. It's the craziest shit because you look at it and you go [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8698.720000000001s)]
*  Oh my god, that looks like a science fiction movie. Look at that thing or a brewery in Iowa [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8703.64s)]
*  Welcome to the golden tap [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8713.84s)]
*  Yeah, wow, look at that thing though [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8716.24s)]
*  All that stuff on the top is all cooling and that small box at the bottom with that blue light on. Yeah, that's the computer [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8718.279999999999s)]
*  so all that other stuff is [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8725.76s)]
*  And that's your friend. No, no, that's not my friend. That's the CEO of Google [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8728.199999999999s)]
*  So he's Michio Kaku is the [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8732.599999999999s)]
*  The guy who was the guest yesterday. Yeah, but that guy is one of the people that's involved. That's the CEO of Google [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8736.439999999999s)]
*  They're they're doing their own quantum computer and IBM is I think as well [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8742.439999999999s)]
*  So this is so this is to to basically hack into everything [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8746.72s)]
*  What that is is going to develop a computer what they're eventually going to be whatever version of it [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8750.48s)]
*  What and whatever it looks like when they get it done there? [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8755.759999999998s)]
*  It's going to be a computer that can operate [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8758.36s)]
*  Like a million times or more powerful than any computer that's ever existed Wow. I [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8761.36s)]
*  Think that's a correct statement. Is that right? [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8768.76s)]
*  But I just I do want to correct you on one tiny thing this little pic on the picture here [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8772.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that what you're seeing there. That's like a router behind the machine [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8776.32s)]
*  Oh, so that's not the computer at the bottom a little boxes that he was sort of trying to explains like it's like oh [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8779.64s)]
*  It's right above like this and it's just covered up by everything. Okay [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8784.8s)]
*  I see I see I see okay, so that little so it's even smaller. Yeah [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8788.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's more like a microchip a little bit bigger than a microchip really. Yes, the computer itself is a little bit [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8792.16s)]
*  Yeah, the microchip. I'm trying to it's bigger than a microchip, you know, but like a CPU compared to it a PC tower, right? [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8798.56s)]
*  It's kind of like that. Like this is like the tower cooling device right for more of like a CPU [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8805.48s)]
*  That's probably like so how big is the I don't know like ship. I'll try to find [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8809.82s)]
*  hmm [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8814.24s)]
*  Wild so this is a little chip like this Joe [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8815.28s)]
*  Bro what the fuck that's alien [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8822.119999999999s)]
*  It's into like it's gonna fit into your computer. No, that is going to be the computer Wow [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8826.039999999999s)]
*  that's what's where you stick it all the other stuff it's they instead of [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8832.72s)]
*  So instead of doing things with ones and zeros, I'm gonna fuck this up. I'm sure they're they're computing with atoms [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8837.56s)]
*  and they're they're doing their computation in atoms and [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8845.56s)]
*  These computations are happening in multiple you universes simultaneously. Hmm [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8850.28s)]
*  I'm gone. Right you say that I'm like, I don't know what you're saying [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8856.72s)]
*  I'm just I'm repeating his words like it's too confusing. He's saying that they're happy [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8859.68s)]
*  So that's the size of it [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8864.6s)]
*  Look at that [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8865.6s)]
*  Tell me if they found that and you said we develop we found a computer that is [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8865.96s)]
*  One million times stronger than anything that exists here on earth [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8872.32s)]
*  This must be from another planet like look at that guy holding that up in his hand [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8875.32s)]
*  Go back to that image of him holding it if he said that was recovered from a crashed UFO in Roswell, New Mexico in [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8879.4s)]
*  1947 this is the answer to all of our worries if we can get this attached to the proper cooling [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8885.84s)]
*  It will be one million times more powerful than any PC that's ever existed [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8891.98s)]
*  That's like that's a scene in The Watchmen or something, right? [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8896.4s)]
*  Them doing the same thing but finding an iPhone that doesn't have power you're like if we could just write this on we don't even know [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8900.18s)]
*  What that means? Yeah, then the cell phone towers are out and there's no [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8906.660000000002s)]
*  Device like that [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8910.42s)]
*  Right imagine if they get past this whole cell phone thing [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8912.460000000001s)]
*  Mm-hmm and develop something that uses the earth as a method of transmitting messages back and forth the energy of the solar [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8916.220000000001s)]
*  Something I don't know extending something through the air [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8924.220000000001s)]
*  That is powered by that very air like like instead of using a 5g signal use the signal of the earth itself [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8928.62s)]
*  Hmm imagine if that becomes a thing imagine if there's a way that you can [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8936.220000000001s)]
*  Like instead of like sending things from tower to tower, which is insanely impressive [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8941.58s)]
*  What if you were literally able to connect [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8948.42s)]
*  Just human beings device device with no network [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8952.78s)]
*  They were so powerful that just like you can airdrop someone something on a plane, you know [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8956.66s)]
*  Even if there's no Wi-Fi or nothing [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8961.560000000001s)]
*  Imagine if your phone just connects to other phones. Mmm. It just does it some other way doesn't need a 5g signal [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8964.060000000001s)]
*  That doesn't seem it's so crazy that they could do it already [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8971.74s)]
*  It's so crazy they can send a video through the air and you can get it a second later. That's nuts [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8974.58s)]
*  Well, you remember when we 20 years ago and you try to download videos. Oh, yeah, it took a long time. Oh, yeah [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8979.78s)]
*  Yeah, yeah took forever even pictures. It was a picture. Yeah [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8985.18s)]
*  Yeah [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8989.34s)]
*  It was interesting cuz when Napster hit, you know [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8990.58s)]
*  You're like you're trading music people are sharing music and and all that and then you're like [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8993.74s)]
*  Well people people in the movie and TV business are like hey, well at least we're not gonna get that's not gonna happen to us [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=8998.58s)]
*  And then shortly after that [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=9005.060000000001s)]
*  Yeah, people are sending you know copies of movies remember when like Spider-Man came out or something and they're like, oh we got you know a [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=9007.1s)]
*  Copy and we're sending it all over the internet. Yeah, or what? I don't go spider-man, but I'm you know me [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=9015.619999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that happens all the time in movies. They get leaked. Yeah, but when it first started to happen [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=9020.88s)]
*  Mm-hmm. Well when it first really started fucking people up with with Napster that freaked people out [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=9025.46s)]
*  Yeah, you can download entire albums for free. Yeah, everybody's like wait. Yeah, what's going on? [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=9030.1s)]
*  You know and that that boy you want to talk about a disruptive force in an industry [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=9036.3s)]
*  That changed everything. Yeah, that was a big deal [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=9043.38s)]
*  You can't sell records anymore. I had Paul Stanley on the podcast and he's [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=9046.419999999998s)]
*  Saying it's stealing [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=9054.22s)]
*  Yeah, I mean stealing is I steal a record but there were the digital recording [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=9059.619999999999s)]
*  That's like we used to always record off the radio. You remember that when you were a kid [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=9065.619999999999s)]
*  You were to record on cassettes off of the radio. Yeah, but that's okay because it doesn't sound that good [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=9070.14s)]
*  Well, yeah, what he tried to stop that and there was no distribution method [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=9075.82s)]
*  Would you stop an AI Sam Kinnison album from being made? I would not I would not you know [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=9079.619999999999s)]
*  What it's like that biggie Tupac thing that we played yesterday, which is hilarious. We played Michio Kaku. We played [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=9085.16s)]
*  Notorious big doing Nas lyrics. Okay [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=9091.98s)]
*  And like he was you could tell he his eyes glazed over just like me talking about to him about quantum physics [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=9095.619999999999s)]
*  I feel like though if a Sam Kinnison one you guys know what that was like [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=9101.259999999998s)]
*  You knew you'd have to yeah, you would have to write material that's worthy [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=9105.74s)]
*  I thought that's my point. You guys would listen to it like this kind of sucks [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=9110.119999999999s)]
*  But you could play it for a kid me like that's actually I love this. This is awesome [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=9112.919999999998s)]

*  They interviewed him. He said I'm gonna leave it up, and then they contacted him again. He's like okay [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrLxKgyK4M&t=9325.2s)]
