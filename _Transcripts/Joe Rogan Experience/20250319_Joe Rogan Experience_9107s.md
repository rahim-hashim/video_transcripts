# Joe Rogan Experience #2292 - Josh Waitzkin
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [March 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6.0s)]
*  Whenever someone is like an interesting person and then I find out they do jiu-jitsu too, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=12.68s)]
*  I'm like, oh, I can talk to that guy for sure. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=17.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=21.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=22.0s)]
*  You know, like I get excited when interesting people do jiu-jitsu because I think for the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=23.0s)]
*  outsider to a lot of people that are, you know, they haven't been exposed to what it's [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=28.88s)]
*  like to train and what it's like to be around high level jiu-jitsu people. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=34.16s)]
*  They don't know that vibe. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=39.0s)]
*  They don't know what it's like. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=42.12s)]
*  They don't know the beauty of jiu-jitsu. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=43.4s)]
*  I feel like jiu-jitsu is beautiful for people who practice it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=47.08s)]
*  You know, like you see like Marcelo is a great example, your coach. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  Marcelo is probably one of the most beautiful guys to watch because he just takes advantage [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=55.04s)]
*  of these scrambles in this like really beautiful way, like fast and slippery. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=61.44s)]
*  And when the opponents react, he reacts in the other way. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=67.8s)]
*  It's all just technique and flow. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=70.52s)]
*  It's like, ah, like the first time I ever saw him, I saw him live in 2003 in Abu Dhabi [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=72.76s)]
*  and that was when he fought Shaolin. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=80.44s)]
*  That was the first time I'd ever seen him in the flesh. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=82.88s)]
*  Shoked him out in like eight seconds. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=85.04s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=86.52s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=87.52s)]
*  But no one even knew him. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=88.52s)]
*  No one knew of him other than, you know, he was obviously, I think he was a brown belt [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=89.52s)]
*  at the time. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=93.28s)]
*  I don't even think he was a black belt. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=94.28s)]
*  I think Marcelo might have been a brown belt. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=96.76s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=99.76s)]
*  I didn't in 2003. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=100.76s)]
*  Find that out. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=101.76s)]
*  Was Marcelo a brown belt when he won Abu Dhabi in 2003? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=102.76s)]
*  He may have. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  Eddie Bravo was a brown belt. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  He told me recently that right before that fight, his, like his grips had locked up. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=108.52s)]
*  So he came, went into that fight. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=112.8s)]
*  It looks incredible. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=114.08s)]
*  Just that arm drag, take the back, choked him out in seconds. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=115.08s)]
*  His like hands? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=117.92s)]
*  Yeah, his like grips from the fight before were like. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=118.92s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=120.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=121.88s)]
*  When Eddie beat Hoyler, he was a brown belt. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=122.88s)]
*  Yep. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=125.84s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=126.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=127.84s)]
*  John Jock took his black belt off of his own waist and put it on Eddie. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=128.84s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=132.44s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=133.44s)]
*  Dude. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=134.44s)]
*  That's epic. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=135.44s)]
*  So it's funny. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=136.44s)]
*  We have a lot of overlap in our early Jiu Jitsu education because my first teacher was [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=137.44s)]
*  John Machado. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  And I spent years training with John in LA long before. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  And then I'm, yeah. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=149.28s)]
*  And then when did you move to New York? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=150.28s)]
*  So I moved to New York. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=153.02s)]
*  I think I started training with John. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=154.02s)]
*  So I was doing Chinese martial arts for a bunch of years before that competing everywhere. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=156.2s)]
*  Then I started training, cross training with John in I think 2001, 2002. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=160.0s)]
*  And then early 2005, moved back to New York, started training with Marco Santos in his [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=164.34s)]
*  school in New York. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  And I was training with Jucao and Alcid Britis. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=171.86s)]
*  Jucao is an amazing old school Bracy Baja. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=174.54s)]
*  Like you know, amazing fighter. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=178.38s)]
*  And I was also cross training with Lucas Lettbury at the time. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=181.7s)]
*  And I was, I needed, I was just ready to, and then I met Marcelo and I was, and he had [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=184.98000000000002s)]
*  moved from New York to Florida. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=191.46s)]
*  And I was traveling to Florida to train with Marcelo a bunch and I wanted to be pushed [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=192.58s)]
*  all in. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=196.66s)]
*  And Marcelo and I had gotten really close. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=197.66s)]
*  And then I said to him, hey man, you know, you want to come back to New York and open [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=199.82000000000002s)]
*  a school together. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=204.98000000000002s)]
*  And he really loved New York. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=206.34s)]
*  And we'd gotten very close at this point. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=208.10000000000002s)]
*  Where was he at the time? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=209.42000000000002s)]
*  He was in Florida. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=210.42000000000002s)]
*  He was in New York before, he loved New York, but then he had to move to Florida. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=211.42000000000002s)]
*  He'd been, there was just a lot of Jiu Jitsu politics flowing everywhere as it does. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=215.70000000000002s)]
*  Jiu Jitsu politics. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=220.38s)]
*  And yeah, anyway, long story short, we opened a school together and after that, and it was [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=222.29999999999998s)]
*  amazing. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=228.57999999999998s)]
*  Then I spent so many years all in training with him. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=229.57999999999998s)]
*  Most, such a beautiful, beautiful martial artist. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=232.98s)]
*  So in 2002, he's promoted to black belt. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=235.85999999999999s)]
*  So he was already a black belt because this is 2003. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=237.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=240.85999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=241.85999999999999s)]
*  So he had only been a black belt for a year and won Abu Dhabi, which is pretty crazy. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=242.85999999999999s)]
*  Pretty crazy. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=248.1s)]
*  Just that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=249.38s)]
*  And it didn't just be Chao Lin, won the entire division and just looked like no one anybody [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=250.38s)]
*  had ever seen. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=257.1s)]
*  Just the scrambles and his ability to arm drag and take the back. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=258.1s)]
*  And then once he gets to your side, the ability to transition to the back is just phenomenal. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=261.9s)]
*  And he spends his, like his whole Jiu Jitsu life, he spent in the scramble, in transition. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=268.1s)]
*  And that was really a philosophy of his. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=273.5s)]
*  Have you seen that old, old school, Arte Suave clip? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=275.94s)]
*  Remember the old documentaries, Arte Suave, from back then, around him as a young teenager [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=279.5s)]
*  training, at Faber-Guzelle school in Sao Paulo. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=283.98s)]
*  And it was so interesting because even then you could see him, he never held position. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=286.78000000000003s)]
*  He always let opponents move. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=290.5s)]
*  Be fun to pull that up maybe at one point. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=292.26s)]
*  Like he never, a core principle of his was to allow the opponent to move and spend as [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=294.62s)]
*  much training time as possible in transition. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=300.34000000000003s)]
*  And while most Jiu Jitsu guys, as you know, is their, they're controlling, they're holding [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=304.1s)]
*  guys. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=308.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=309.04s)]
*  Is this him? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=310.04s)]
*  He's already a black belt here. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=311.04s)]
*  Yeah, this is after he moved to start training with Fabio in Sao Paulo. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=316.04s)]
*  And it's such a beautiful thing because if you watch his style, he's not in this moment [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  actually. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=329.12s)]
*  Now he's fully controlling. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=330.12s)]
*  Now he's fully controlling. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=331.12s)]
*  But most of the time he's scrambling. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=332.12s)]
*  Yeah, he's scrambling. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=333.6s)]
*  Did he explain why? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=334.8s)]
*  You're maximizing time spent in the in-between. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=337.40000000000003s)]
*  I think in the martial arts people are so focused on position when they're learning. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=339.52000000000004s)]
*  Position, position, position. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=343.48s)]
*  But the in-between is where the real virtuosity happens. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=344.48s)]
*  And so he spent, he maximized his time in the in-between. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=349.12s)]
*  So in stand-up fighting that would be like footwork and angles. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=352.72s)]
*  It'd be similar to that. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=357.48s)]
*  Because the most important thing about any kind of combat sport in terms of striking [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=359.16s)]
*  sports is to be in a better position to land a shot and be in a better position to defend. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=365.36s)]
*  So if you're fighting southpaw to orthodox, you always want to make sure that if you're [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=371.56s)]
*  southpaw, your foot is on the outside of your opponent's leg. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=375.36s)]
*  That way your opponent has to kind of cross over, try to hit you, but you're in a position [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=378.52000000000004s)]
*  to hit them on the blind side. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=382.52000000000004s)]
*  And the best ever at that is Vasily Lomachenko. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=384.6s)]
*  Because Lomachenko, when he was young, his father made him stop boxing for two years [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=388.32s)]
*  and just study Ukrainian dance. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=394.06s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=396.06s)]
*  So for two years he just did Ukrainian dance. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=397.06s)]
*  And his foot, have you ever seen him box? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=399.90000000000003s)]
*  No. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=401.66s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=402.66s)]
*  Pull up Lomachenko highlight. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=403.66s)]
*  It's all about movement and position with this guy. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=406.14000000000004s)]
*  It's all about when you punch, he's going to make you react this way, and then he's [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=410.16s)]
*  going to go that way, and then he's going to spin sideways and he'll be behind you. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=415.78000000000003s)]
*  So this is Lomachenko. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=419.66s)]
*  The way he moves is so different. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=421.42s)]
*  It's almost like he's got just a radar for where their punches are coming from and knows [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=425.7s)]
*  exactly where to put his feet at all times. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=433.68s)]
*  No matter what they do, he knows what they're going to do. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=436.42s)]
*  But when you watch his footwork, it's the most extraordinary thing because his ability [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=439.58s)]
*  to give you all sorts of different reads, incredible. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=445.02s)]
*  I mean, you want a world title, I think it is fourth pro fight. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=449.85999999999996s)]
*  Unbelievable amateur record. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=454.21999999999997s)]
*  But it's just the movement, like he's never right in front of you. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=457.46s)]
*  He's always off to the side, he's always moving around, he jumps in and out, and it's with [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=461.71999999999997s)]
*  perfect precision. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=467.82s)]
*  Like a lot of times when guys do a lot of footwork and movement, there's points in that [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=469.35999999999996s)]
*  transition where they're off balance, where they can't really throw a punch, or their [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=475.68s)]
*  footwork is out of position, or they're leaning too far over on this side. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=479.68s)]
*  He's never off balance. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=484.28000000000003s)]
*  He's never out of position. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=486.2s)]
*  He's always slide to side, pop out, slide to side, pop out, and you never know where [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=487.8s)]
*  the fuck he is. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=491.92s)]
*  He's a magician. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=493.04s)]
*  It's fascinating to watch him fight. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=494.28000000000003s)]
*  And very few people have tried to incorporate that. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=497.0s)]
*  You see some of his movement. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=500.04s)]
*  It's just the way he's able to fool the best fighters in the world and just have a level [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=506.36s)]
*  of movement that they just don't really understand what to do with. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=513.6800000000001s)]
*  They get baffled by it. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=519.28s)]
*  Because everything is coming from different angles. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=521.48s)]
*  It's never, I'm charging straight forward at you trying to destroy you. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=524.64s)]
*  Everything is angles and movement. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=529.3s)]
*  Virtuosity is so beautiful to watch. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=532.74s)]
*  Oh, it's incredible in anything. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=534.62s)]
*  In anything. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=536.6999999999999s)]
*  When you watch someone who's just unbelievably extraordinary and unique in their, whatever [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=537.6999999999999s)]
*  their discipline is, it's always fascinating to watch. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=541.92s)]
*  This episode is brought to you by Intuit Turbo Tax. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=546.04s)]
*  We're all just trying to level up, right? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=548.74s)]
*  I'm always trying to push myself, whether it's training, learning something new, or [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=551.3s)]
*  just trying to be a better human. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=554.9799999999999s)]

*  One way I relate to the transitional training is through frames. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=606.4000000000001s)]
*  It's like a process of building more frames. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=610.24s)]
*  We have position, we have position, and for some people there'll be no space in between. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=612.2s)]
*  If you spend your time playing in the transitional space between, you build up frames like an [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=615.08s)]
*  illusionist. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=620.84s)]
*  I know you, remember you spoke to Darren Brown back in the day. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=621.84s)]
*  Great illusionist magicians, mind control guys, they have the ability to see in frames [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=626.5200000000001s)]
*  that we don't have the ability to see. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=630.98s)]
*  It seems like magic. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=632.6800000000001s)]
*  It seems like illusion. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=633.6800000000001s)]
*  When martial artists are called mystical, it's because people don't understand what [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=634.6800000000001s)]
*  they're doing for the most part, technically. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=639.44s)]
*  They have frames where others don't have frames. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=642.44s)]
*  They have more options. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=646.6s)]
*  It's like having a language and you have access to a larger vocabulary. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=648.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=652.2s)]
*  I think that that's right. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=653.2s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=654.6800000000001s)]
*  If you think about you're engaging with an illusionist who has done something, has spent [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=656.36s)]
*  hundreds of hours in a certain specific routine, and you're seeing it for the first time. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=661.96s)]
*  They just have immense knowledge where you have none. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=667.32s)]
*  They have more frames and they can play in frames that you don't have. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=670.36s)]
*  It seems like something's coming from the sky. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=673.04s)]
*  That's where Eddie Bravo had a pretty significant contribution to Jiu Jitsu because he was so [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=676.92s)]
*  creative in some of his attacks and some of the things that he developed, particularly [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=681.98s)]
*  off his back. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=687.84s)]
*  The rubber guard variations, they were so systematic. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=689.44s)]
*  If you got good at it, it was surprising to anybody who didn't understand what you were [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=695.54s)]
*  doing because they didn't know these positions well. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=699.52s)]
*  There's this kid named Jeremiah Vance who's one of Eddie's best guard players and there's [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=703.76s)]
*  a highlight reel of his submissions off of his back, his rubber guard submissions. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=708.0s)]
*  If you don't have a person that you train with, if you train at a traditional school [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=713.68s)]
*  and you don't understand these positions, you don't know how good someone can be at [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=717.88s)]
*  it, there's times where you don't think you're vulnerable, where you're incredibly vulnerable. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=721.76s)]
*  The difference between a really good guard player in MMA, like Paul Craig for example, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=727.5999999999999s)]
*  he submitted some of the best two world champions off of his back in the light heavyweight division, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=732.68s)]
*  Jamal Hill and the current champion, Ankalayev. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=738.8s)]
*  Ankalayev's only defeat is to Paul Craig because he's just wicked off of his back. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=741.5999999999999s)]
*  Everybody feels comfortable. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=747.3199999999999s)]
*  In MMA, there's only a couple guys like Olivera, you've got to really watch your P's and Q's. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=748.76s)]
*  There's a few guys that are just wicked off of their back, but no one's like Paul Craig. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=753.3599999999999s)]
*  So if you're just used to fighting regular guys off of their back and you get in guard [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=757.48s)]
*  and you get a little cocky, you extend an arm to try to land a punch and then all of [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=762.04s)]
*  a sudden his legs are wrapped around your fucking neck and you're like, oh Jesus, how [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=765.84s)]
*  did this happen so quick? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=769.44s)]
*  Because he's just got that technique, it's just so tightened up, it just locks it up [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=771.12s)]
*  so fast. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=776.36s)]
*  It's fascinating to watch the difference between a really good guard player and someone who's [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=777.36s)]
*  just a regular MMA fighter who knows how to do a triangle but really doesn't have the [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=782.12s)]
*  elaborate setups. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=785.72s)]
*  Anyways, that's on a large scale what Hoist was doing back in the day. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=787.4000000000001s)]
*  Sure. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=790.72s)]
*  No one had any idea what was going on. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=791.72s)]
*  When they were grabbing his gi, they had a huge advantage, but they were entering his [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=792.72s)]
*  terrain. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=796.8000000000001s)]
*  Then when we were training in the early days, there was so much closed-mindedness about [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=797.8000000000001s)]
*  leg locks. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=801.96s)]
*  So the leg lock game was outside of the conceptual scheme to so many Jiu Jitsu guys. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=803.4000000000001s)]
*  Was forbidden. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=807.0s)]
*  It was forbidden. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=808.0s)]
*  So they'd get caught. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=809.0s)]
*  It's like that dogma. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=810.0s)]
*  It's so interesting competitively finding where someone's dogma is, where their constructs [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=811.0s)]
*  are, their false constructs. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=815.12s)]
*  But there's a good argument for it with the gi with young guys. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=816.88s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=821.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=822.6s)]
*  Not shredding each other's ankles all the time. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=823.6s)]
*  Yeah, ripping knees apart where they're not going to be able to be repaired. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=825.36s)]
*  How many people have ruined their knees forever from a heel hook? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=829.92s)]
*  A large number. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=832.6s)]
*  I would imagine if there's any technique that sort of ruined an athlete's career, the heel [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=833.76s)]
*  hook would probably be number one. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=838.12s)]
*  Heel hook is why I started training Jiu Jitsu. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=839.64s)]
*  Really? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=841.44s)]
*  Yeah, because I was doing stand-up stuff and I was competing everywhere. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=842.44s)]
*  I was doing Chinese martial arts and my teacher's son, Max Chen, who was a he was a Sanshao [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=845.88s)]
*  fighter and on the Olympic on the US national team, really good stand-up fighter. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=850.52s)]
*  And he was studying UFC before I had even looked at it. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=855.08s)]
*  And then he was studying, I think it was Frank Shamrock's double heel hook shit from way [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=858.8s)]
*  early days. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=862.6s)]
*  And he was just like, let's let's just continue to the ground. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=863.8s)]
*  And I had never ground fought before. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=866.6s)]
*  And I ended up in the ground. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=868.28s)]
*  Then he just put me in the heel hooks and double heel hooks. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=869.28s)]
*  My knees were exploding. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=870.92s)]
*  He had no idea what the fuck he was doing. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=872.04s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=873.44s)]
*  Terrible idea. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=874.44s)]
*  My knees were just screaming and I would throw him on the floor and then I'd be tapped. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=876.0s)]
*  I didn't even know what tapping out was. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=879.12s)]
*  I had never grabbed before. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=880.8000000000001s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=881.8000000000001s)]
*  You didn't even know how to grab anything. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=882.8000000000001s)]
*  I didn't know how to put you in a heel hook. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=883.8000000000001s)]
*  That's so awful. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=885.24s)]
*  The first submission I felt in my life was like the heel hook 20 times. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=886.24s)]
*  Somehow my ACL didn't shred. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=889.2800000000001s)]
*  And I was like, I have to fucking train this Jiu Jitsu because Max is kicking my ass and [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=891.9200000000001s)]
*  I didn't like it. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=896.08s)]
*  So then that's how it all began. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=897.08s)]
*  Well, hoist was brilliant in wearing the gi because it made people grab it. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=898.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=903.6800000000001s)]
*  He got an advantage that he had something to grab. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=904.92s)]
*  And next thing you know, he's like clenched around you and dragged you to the ground. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=906.7199999999999s)]
*  It's an amazing idea, right? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=910.12s)]
*  Like they had no idea that they were entering his game. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=911.12s)]
*  They thought they were controlling him. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=913.2399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=914.4399999999999s)]
*  And they didn't understand that all that friction from the gi was going to make it very difficult [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=915.4399999999999s)]
*  for you to get out of anything. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=918.9599999999999s)]
*  And he was so used to people grabbing him. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=919.9599999999999s)]
*  He spent his life people grabbing him. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=921.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=922.9599999999999s)]
*  They entered his river. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=923.9599999999999s)]
*  That changed the whole world, didn't it? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=924.9599999999999s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=925.9599999999999s)]
*  Changed the whole world. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=926.9599999999999s)]
*  It's awesome. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=927.9599999999999s)]
*  Changed what street fights look like. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=928.9599999999999s)]
*  Changed everything. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=930.5999999999999s)]
*  Those first UFCs were just wild. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=932.52s)]
*  Nuts. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=935.52s)]
*  Wild. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=936.52s)]
*  Just the bizarre. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=937.52s)]
*  The first UFC I worked was UFC 12 in Dothan, Alabama. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=938.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=942.72s)]
*  I had to take a propeller plane. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=943.72s)]
*  I had to fly into I think we flew into Birmingham or somewhere. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=946.72s)]
*  And then we had to take a propeller plane to Dothan. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=950.76s)]
*  I was like, what am I doing? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=952.5600000000001s)]
*  This is so ridiculous. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=954.5600000000001s)]
*  But I wanted to just see it live because I'd only seen it on television. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=956.5600000000001s)]
*  I'd only seen it. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=959.28s)]
*  I'd never seen a live cage fight before. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=960.88s)]
*  I'm like, this has got to be crazy. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=963.16s)]
*  So UFC 12, how long after the first was that? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=965.16s)]
*  Well, it was 97. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=968.64s)]
*  So it was four years later. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=969.64s)]
*  Four years later. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=970.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=971.64s)]
*  Wow. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=972.64s)]
*  You've been on that journey from the beginning. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=973.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=974.64s)]
*  The Pacific. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=975.64s)]
*  Everybody was like, what are you doing? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=976.64s)]
*  Don't be associated with this. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=978.28s)]
*  So many people were telling me not to be associated with it. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=980.28s)]
*  It was it was like I was doing snuff films or something. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=982.72s)]
*  You know, it's like, why are you doing this? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=986.16s)]
*  You're an actor. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=987.88s)]
*  I was like, OK, I don't know what to tell you. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=988.92s)]
*  I like it. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=991.72s)]
*  I want to go watch. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=992.48s)]
*  I needed to see it. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=994.48s)]
*  And you were you're training at that point? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=995.48s)]
*  Yeah, I'd already started doing jujitsu. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=997.64s)]
*  I started jujitsu in 96. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=999.24s)]
*  You were training at Hickson's then, right? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1001.12s)]
*  Started at Hickson's. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1002.48s)]
*  And then I went from Hickson's to Carlson Gracie's. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1003.48s)]
*  I didn't know. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1006.4s)]
*  I thought all Gracie's were the same. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1007.24s)]
*  Like this Gracie's closer. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1009.08s)]
*  I'll go to this Gracie. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1010.92s)]
*  They all love each other. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1011.52s)]
*  And I'd also say I didn't understand. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1012.24s)]
*  They were fighting. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1014.28s)]
*  They were all tooth and claw at each other back then. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1014.84s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1018.24s)]
*  I knew Carlson's from, I think the show was Extreme Fighting, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1020.4s)]
*  the John Paredi show. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1024.56s)]
*  So John Paredi, who worked for the UFC, then branched off [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1026.16s)]
*  and had another thing called Extreme Fighting. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1029.28s)]
*  And that's where Conan Silvera came from. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1031.84s)]
*  And a bunch of elite UFC fighters. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1034.16s)]
*  Mario Sperry fought his first fights over there. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1039.64s)]
*  So it was like a really good competitive organization [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1043.72s)]
*  that was right up there with the UFC back in the day. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1048.72s)]
*  And so Carlson Gracie's name was on that all the time. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1052.16s)]
*  And they showed some training footage of them training. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1055.92s)]
*  So I found out about that place. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1058.16s)]
*  And that was right when Vitor Belfort was emerging. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1059.96s)]
*  So Vitor was 19. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1062.88s)]
*  So I was training at the same gym as Vitor. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1064.2s)]
*  It was incredible just watching him train. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1066.96s)]
*  He was a freak. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1070.24s)]
*  Just an athletic freak at 19. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1072.32s)]
*  He was so fast. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1074.8799999999999s)]
*  Just so fast. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1077.0s)]
*  And with his hands. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1078.24s)]
*  And everybody knew he was a black belt under Carlson Gracie. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1080.48s)]
*  So everybody expected just jiu-jitsu. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1083.6799999999998s)]
*  And this guy comes out with little MMA gloves on [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1085.8s)]
*  and just starts tuning people up on the feet. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1089.0s)]
*  And you're like, whoa. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1091.36s)]
*  A black belt, who can do that? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1093.2s)]
*  Where's this coming from? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1095.24s)]
*  This is a totally new thing. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1096.52s)]
*  So that was the first fight that I attended. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1098.9199999999998s)]
*  And that was the first fight I worked. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1102.0s)]
*  EOC 12. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1103.72s)]
*  Wow. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1104.68s)]
*  It was nuts. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1105.3600000000001s)]
*  This theme of transitions and developing frames [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1106.16s)]
*  where other people don't have them. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1109.76s)]
*  It's so interesting how it's manifested in every art. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1111.28s)]
*  In everything. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1113.72s)]
*  I remember when I was playing chess, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1114.72s)]
*  because I was a chess player from age 6 to 23. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1116.76s)]
*  That was my first art. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1118.96s)]
*  You weren't just a chess player. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1122.64s)]
*  You were a chess player they made a movie about, dude. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1123.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1127.04s)]
*  I gotta say that, too. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1128.04s)]
*  That didn't have much to do with me, man. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1129.04s)]
*  They did that. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1130.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm teaching for Bobby Fischer's about you, bro. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1130.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1133.2800000000002s)]
*  Which has got to be weird. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1134.2800000000002s)]
*  Many moons ago. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1135.2800000000002s)]
*  That was fucking weird. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1136.2800000000002s)]
*  Was it weird, the dramatic representation of your life [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1137.2800000000002s)]
*  versus the real life? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1140.16s)]
*  What is that juxtaposition like? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1143.3200000000002s)]
*  Is it bizarre watching a fake version of you on television [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1145.2s)]
*  or on a screen, rather? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1149.8000000000002s)]
*  And did you have a feeling like, am I that person? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1151.64s)]
*  I'm not that person. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1154.24s)]
*  I am me. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1155.2800000000002s)]
*  This is not really me, but it's about me. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1156.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1159.0400000000002s)]
*  When the book came out when I was 11 years old, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1160.04s)]
*  my dad actually wrote the book. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1161.76s)]
*  He was a writer, and he ended up just writing about the journey [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1164.36s)]
*  from me starting to play chess to winning [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1168.24s)]
*  my first national championship. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1169.72s)]
*  And when the book came out, it felt like I read it. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1171.44s)]
*  And it felt true. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1173.8s)]
*  I was a little pissed off because they didn't want people [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1174.8s)]
*  to know when I cried. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1175.8s)]
*  I was an 11-year-old. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1176.8s)]
*  I didn't want to be vulnerable. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1177.8s)]
*  Right? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1178.8s)]
*  But that felt like, and that was my first real thrust [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1179.8s)]
*  into some degree of spotlight. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1181.84s)]
*  And then I was the national champion at that point, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1186.12s)]
*  and I was each year for those years. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1188.0s)]
*  So I was at the top of the chess world, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1190.88s)]
*  the youth chess world, and then I had the movie come out. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1191.88s)]
*  The book came out. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1194.0s)]
*  And then when the movie came out, it was a shit show. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1195.0s)]
*  I hated the movie when it first came out. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1196.68s)]
*  Why did you hate it? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1198.4s)]
*  Because I thought it had nothing to do with my life. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1200.0s)]
*  Years later, I was able to see it as a work of art [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1202.92s)]
*  separate from my life and see it that way. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1206.16s)]
*  And I was able to see how it was thematically true in many ways, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1209.68s)]
*  to themes in my life. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1215.16s)]
*  My first teacher, Bruce Pendelfini, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1219.68s)]
*  who's still a very dear friend of mine, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1221.16s)]
*  Ben Kingsley played him as this mean guy. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1222.68s)]
*  And I've had terrible coaches in my life. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1225.2s)]
*  I've had coaches who are super destructive. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1227.32s)]
*  But Bruce wasn't. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1229.2s)]
*  He was beautiful and loving and helped me [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1230.44s)]
*  discover my love for chess. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1234.16s)]
*  My first coaches were the hustlers in Washington Square [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1236.08s)]
*  Park and Bruce Pendelfini together. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1238.3600000000001s)]
*  And the way that was represented, I didn't like it. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1240.2s)]
*  They also combined a bunch of characters [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1241.68s)]
*  in Washington Square Park, the hustlers that [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1243.84s)]
*  combined them into one in a way that was thematically true. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1246.32s)]
*  So when you're a kid, you're a teenager, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1250.84s)]
*  you see all the difference. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1252.52s)]
*  The movie comes out about your life. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1253.56s)]
*  You see all the differences as opposed to the similarities. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1254.88s)]
*  And it was, yeah, I felt really guilty about it relative to Bruce. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1257.76s)]
*  That was a big part of it, because I loved Bruce. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1262.64s)]
*  Did you talk to him about it? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1264.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1265.36s)]
*  What was his take on it? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1266.32s)]
*  Was he named Bruce in the movie? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1268.24s)]
*  Yeah, he was named Bruce in the movie. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1269.52s)]
*  Honestly, he loved it. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1272.08s)]
*  It put him in the spotlight as the chess teacher [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1273.1599999999999s)]
*  in the country and the world. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1277.1999999999998s)]
*  So he rolled with it really well. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1279.28s)]
*  I was just sensitive to all of these mean-spirited things [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1280.8s)]
*  that happened between us in the film that never happened in life. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1285.56s)]
*  And years later, those things did happen to me. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1288.56s)]
*  And actually, during those years when it came out, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1290.6799999999998s)]
*  they were happening to me then. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1292.76s)]
*  What was interesting is I had some really destructive coaches [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1293.8799999999999s)]
*  during that time. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1296.4399999999998s)]
*  And I didn't put that on Bruce. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1298.24s)]
*  But also what happened with the movie [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1299.6s)]
*  I loved chess so deeply. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1301.5s)]
*  It was my first form of self-expression. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1303.3799999999999s)]
*  And up until the film came out, it [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1306.4199999999998s)]
*  was just sort of this pre-conscious, innocent form [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1307.9399999999998s)]
*  of play, of battle. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1310.58s)]
*  It was my jujitsu mats. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1314.3799999999999s)]
*  I fucking loved it. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1316.78s)]
*  And then the movie is what pulled me [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1318.3s)]
*  into self-consciousness for the first time. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1321.3s)]
*  I started thinking about, instead of losing myself in thought, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1323.58s)]
*  I started thinking about how I looked to groupies, to cameras, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1326.3799999999999s)]
*  to the rest. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1329.06s)]
*  And so I moved from self-expression [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1330.06s)]
*  to self-consciousness to being locked up. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1332.94s)]
*  And then I didn't ask for it. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1336.54s)]
*  I didn't decide I want to have a movie. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1338.74s)]
*  This thing was done. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1340.24s)]
*  And it was ultimately, I'm grateful for it. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1341.18s)]
*  From my perspective now, the existential crisis that [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1344.02s)]
*  happened was awesome for me. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1346.42s)]
*  It forced me to become more complicated as a human [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1348.14s)]
*  and integrate a sense of consciousness [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1350.74s)]
*  into my relationship to something. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1352.5s)]
*  So my perspective on it now is that it was a beautiful journey. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1355.82s)]
*  It made me grapple with a lot of shit. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1358.94s)]
*  I didn't become reliant on a flower garden [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1360.5800000000002s)]
*  in order to have a deep relationship to an art. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1363.3s)]
*  But at the time, I was very conflicted about it. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1366.54s)]
*  And then when I graduated high school, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1369.74s)]
*  I took off and left the US for a couple of years, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1371.3400000000001s)]
*  lived in Slovenia with my girlfriend at the time [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1374.06s)]
*  to get away from the spotlight, to get away from the media, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1376.1000000000001s)]
*  get away from all the shit that was connected to the movie. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1378.42s)]
*  And that was when I started studying East Asian philosophy [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1381.26s)]
*  and meditating. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1384.06s)]
*  And I started reading Jack Kerouac and existentialist [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1384.74s)]
*  literature and trying to figure myself out, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1387.16s)]
*  figure the world out, figure out how I related to these things [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1390.68s)]
*  in some empty space. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1393.3000000000002s)]
*  What's a tremendous burden to place upon a young person [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1394.6000000000001s)]
*  to take their life, which is essentially anonymous, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1398.5600000000002s)]
*  to the general public, known in the chess world, obviously, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1403.66s)]
*  but in the general public, anonymous, and then [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1406.72s)]
*  all of a sudden, a movie star. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1410.8400000000001s)]
*  And not a movie star in the sense that you're on the screen, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1413.5600000000002s)]
*  but it's about you, which is probably even weirder. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1416.96s)]
*  So you have these false expectations or false narratives [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1419.6000000000001s)]
*  of how your life played out and who the people and who [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1424.1200000000001s)]
*  the piece is. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1427.2s)]
*  So everywhere you run into people, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1427.96s)]
*  they have a version of you that they've seen that's not real. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1430.04s)]
*  And they think they know you very intimately. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1433.0s)]
*  Which is weird. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1435.1200000000001s)]
*  But they don't. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1435.8400000000001s)]
*  Same with you. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1436.52s)]
*  You're so public, right? [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1437.44s)]
*  Most people think they know who you are and what you think. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1439.08s)]
*  But at least they know me from me talking. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1441.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's a really good point. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1444.0s)]
*  Imagine if Mario Lopez played me in a movie. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1445.6s)]
*  There's someone less handsome than Mario Lopez. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1449.8799999999999s)]
*  And then you would have this thing where, oh, you're [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1453.96s)]
*  the guy that that guy played in the movie. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1457.32s)]
*  And I'd be like, yeah, but that's not really me. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1459.84s)]
*  I didn't have that problem. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1464.9199999999998s)]
*  This is not real. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1466.04s)]
*  That's fake. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1466.8799999999999s)]
*  And also, when you're a teenager, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1467.48s)]
*  you're susceptible to all of the temptations. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1468.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1471.48s)]
*  I mean, suddenly you've got groupies everywhere. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1472.2s)]
*  And that's awesome. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1474.2s)]
*  It's a lot of fun. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1475.56s)]
*  But it's not necessarily consistent with sitting [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1476.72s)]
*  for six hours at a time in competition playing chess. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1479.92s)]
*  No, it's probably destructive to it, right? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1482.48s)]
*  Quite destructive. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1484.44s)]
*  Yeah, which is interesting. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1485.28s)]
*  And you have to integrate all of that. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1486.3999999999999s)]
*  How old were you when the film came out? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1487.68s)]
*  15. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1489.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that is a crazy time to get any kind of attention. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1489.96s)]
*  Because you're just getting testosterone for the first time. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1494.36s)]
*  You're like, what is all this? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1497.08s)]
*  And your body's growing. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1498.72s)]
*  And it was flowing hard. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1500.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1500.96s)]
*  And you're becoming a man. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1501.32s)]
*  Now, all of a sudden, girls like you. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1502.44s)]
*  Like, what? [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1503.96s)]
*  What is this about? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1504.96s)]
*  This is craziness. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1506.16s)]
*  I already had a very strange life. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1507.6000000000001s)]
*  Because I think a foundational part of my psychology [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1509.16s)]
*  came from, so I started playing chess when I was six years old. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1512.52s)]
*  By the time I was seven, I was the top-rated player [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1516.6000000000001s)]
*  for my age in the country. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1518.76s)]
*  My first national championship, I got my ass kicked, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1520.28s)]
*  which was tremendous. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1522.3600000000001s)]
*  It was great. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1523.32s)]
*  Last round of my first nationals, I lost. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1523.88s)]
*  To the guy who later became my best friend for many, many years, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1528.64s)]
*  David Arnett. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1531.64s)]
*  Can you say tremendous? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1532.32s)]
*  Because was that a jumping point for improvement for you? [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1533.48s)]
*  Because I didn't learn that I could win without getting [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1537.96s)]
*  my ass kicked first. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1541.2s)]
*  I had to grapple with my demons. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1542.6399999999999s)]
*  And the year from then to winning my nationals, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1545.04s)]
*  my first nationals the next year, was when I really [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1550.3999999999999s)]
*  developed a love for chess. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1553.0s)]
*  And I had to work very hard. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1554.1599999999999s)]
*  And I didn't associate winning the nationals with talent [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1555.36s)]
*  or a smooth trip or all the bullshit [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1559.4s)]
*  that people can connect when they call the prodigy [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1562.72s)]
*  from the outside. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1567.6000000000001s)]
*  It's not a term I ever related to myself at all. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1568.96s)]
*  But these labels are put on from the outside. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1571.2s)]
*  And if you win too fast, too young, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1573.96s)]
*  you can just develop this brittle relationship to success [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1576.1200000000001s)]
*  and to training and to everything. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1582.0s)]
*  You don't realize that getting your ass kicked [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1583.96s)]
*  is a huge part of the journey. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1585.76s)]
*  That's a problem with very talented fighters as well. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1587.44s)]
*  A lot of very talented martial artists, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1590.24s)]
*  they never develop the discipline [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1592.04s)]
*  to truly become great. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1593.6000000000001s)]
*  Because from the very beginning, they had, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1595.1200000000001s)]
*  and whatever the advantage was, whether it's a speed advantage, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1598.44s)]
*  a strength advantage, genetics plays such a large part [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1602.4s)]
*  in martial arts success. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1605.92s)]
*  If you have someone who's an elite mind, who [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1609.8400000000001s)]
*  is incredibly disciplined and also has great genetics, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1614.28s)]
*  you get a Mike Tyson. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1619.0s)]
*  Well, that's amazing. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1619.8s)]
*  If you can have that combination, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1620.52s)]
*  that's what you're looking for. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1621.6s)]
*  That's what you're looking for. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1622.32s)]
*  But if you don't have that, and Mike Tyson is competing [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1623.76s)]
*  in your division, you're fucked. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1626.96s)]
*  Like, you can be really disciplined. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1628.96s)]
*  So genetics do play a factor. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1631.16s)]
*  Circumstances, coaching, there's a lot of different factors. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1634.68s)]
*  But if you're a real prodigy, and there are people out there [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1638.92s)]
*  that are just extraordinary from the beginning, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1641.6399999999999s)]
*  I find that if success comes too quickly, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1643.76s)]
*  you don't develop the mettle to really push through boundaries [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1646.24s)]
*  and reach new levels. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1651.1200000000001s)]
*  Because the only way you get there is through, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1652.88s)]
*  you have to, I think oftentimes training becomes, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1655.68s)]
*  it becomes regimented, it becomes something you do. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1660.84s)]
*  You see incremental growth and improvement. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1662.8s)]
*  You get confidence. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1664.84s)]
*  But then when you compete, if you get your ass kicked, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1666.68s)]
*  then you have to kind of reassess everything. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1670.04s)]
*  Like, okay, was I working at 10, or was I working at 8? [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1671.96s)]
*  Was I studying tape, or was I fucking off and calling girls? [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1675.24s)]
*  Was I paying attention to my training routine and my recovery, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1680.28s)]
*  or was I just training and partying? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1684.2s)]
*  Like, what was I doing wrong? [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1685.8400000000001s)]
*  Like, what led this person to land those shots? [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1687.16s)]
*  What led this person to beat me? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1689.72s)]
*  And if you don't have those moments where you lose, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1692.0s)]
*  I don't think you ever really achieve your true potential, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1695.04s)]
*  because you have to be challenged. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1697.68s)]
*  And the best expression of challenge [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1699.44s)]
*  is total humiliating defeat. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1701.3200000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1703.8000000000002s)]
*  And so consistently, the biggest losses, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1704.76s)]
*  the most crushing losses, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1707.72s)]
*  are what lead to the biggest wins later. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1708.64s)]
*  Sometimes many years later. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1710.5600000000002s)]
*  But like that, and people often, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1711.72s)]
*  I remember I was giving a simultaneous chess exhibition [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1715.2s)]
*  for a charity in my 20s somewhere, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1719.1200000000001s)]
*  and this guy introduced his son, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1722.88s)]
*  and he said his son hadn't lost a chess game in two years. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1725.2s)]
*  And he was so proud. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1728.3200000000002s)]
*  And it's just like, I knew it was a fucking train wreck. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1730.08s)]
*  I mean, the kid, obviously just was only choosing people [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1732.2s)]
*  to play who he could beat. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1736.84s)]
*  Wouldn't compete up in tournaments, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1738.48s)]
*  would only play down. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1739.76s)]
*  And he was the only kid who didn't want to play against me [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1740.92s)]
*  in the simul. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1743.4s)]
*  And so his life was protecting this perfect thing, right? [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1744.24s)]
*  People who don't lose. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1747.96s)]
*  So in my chess life, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1749.96s)]
*  the interesting thing that happened in my psychology [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1751.44s)]
*  is that I was the top rated player for my age in the country [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1753.0s)]
*  from a young age, but I always played up. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1757.16s)]
*  I always played against adults, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1759.5600000000002s)]
*  except for nationals and worlds I played up. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1760.96s)]
*  And so, and all of my rivals were targeting me [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1763.0800000000002s)]
*  because I was the top seed in youth events, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1767.3200000000002s)]
*  but their coaches were much stronger players than me. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1770.16s)]
*  They were adult, international masters, grandmasters, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1773.48s)]
*  and they could see all my weaknesses. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1775.8000000000002s)]
*  Psychological, technical, everything. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1777.52s)]
*  And so if I ever made a mistake, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1779.6000000000001s)]
*  the weakness was exploited until I took it on. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1781.16s)]
*  And so I developed from really young age [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1783.8000000000002s)]
*  this relationship to training, which was, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1786.24s)]
*  if I didn't take on my weakness, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1790.36s)]
*  I got my ass kicked and I felt pain. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1792.4s)]
*  And so not taking on my weakness [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1793.88s)]
*  became outside of my conceptual scheme. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1795.28s)]
*  So from age eight, I just, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1797.8s)]
*  and it can be a blind spot, like today in life, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1802.04s)]
*  like a criticism of me that something loved ones would have [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1804.32s)]
*  is that I'm just, I'm always, I love training. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1806.68s)]
*  I love pushing my limits as a way of life [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1809.2s)]
*  in whatever I'm doing. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1810.88s)]
*  If it was chess, if it was fighting, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1811.72s)]
*  now it's foiling, surfing, and then foiling [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1813.2s)]
*  in the biggest waves I can find. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1815.9599999999998s)]
*  And like just, if I'm playing at my edge, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1817.1999999999998s)]
*  I feel, it feels beautiful. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1819.8s)]
*  It feels like where I wanna be. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1822.76s)]
*  But the comfort zone doesn't feel beautiful. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1824.32s)]
*  And to me, that works really well, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1826.36s)]
*  but it's a big part of like my foundation in that [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1828.24s)]
*  was when being eight years old and being targeted, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1830.9199999999998s)]
*  eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, my whole life. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1833.28s)]
*  And it wasn't until recently that I realized [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1838.0s)]
*  that it was actually outside of my conceptual scheme [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1840.12s)]
*  not to take on the weakness, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1842.7199999999998s)]
*  because it was just connected to pain [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1844.2s)]
*  from such a young age as a competitor. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1845.32s)]
*  There's no luck in chess. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1847.32s)]
*  There's no fucking luck in chess. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1848.72s)]
*  If you have, like if you're playing chess, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1850.1200000000001s)]
*  if you have an opening repertoire that's massive [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1851.8s)]
*  and you go into a game and there's one little place [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1854.96s)]
*  that there's a weakness [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1857.0s)]
*  and you don't want your opponent to go, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1857.8400000000001s)]
*  he always fucking finds it. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1859.1200000000001s)]
*  You don't know why. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1861.32s)]
*  You can, you never like make a move [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1862.48s)]
*  and hope he doesn't see it. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1864.28s)]
*  Or I'll play, let's hit this trap [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1865.28s)]
*  and it's not the best move, but maybe he'll fall into, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1867.0s)]
*  no, that never works at a high level. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1869.2s)]
*  So you just, you have to take your shit on. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1871.48s)]
*  So you associate not taking it on with pain. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1875.04s)]
*  Yeah, I don't anymore. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1879.52s)]
*  I did young and now I don't associate it with anything. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1880.4799999999998s)]
*  I just don't do it. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1882.4799999999998s)]
*  Right, yeah. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1883.32s)]
*  Unless I try. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1884.56s)]
*  That's a better way to handle it, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1885.3999999999999s)]
*  to recognize there's a real process. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1887.12s)]
*  There's the right way to do this. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1890.04s)]
*  It's the only way to do this. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1892.0s)]
*  So don't even think about the other way. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1893.3999999999999s)]
*  Right, but if it's kind of driving you, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1895.1999999999998s)]
*  for me, I think it's healthier for me to recognize [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1897.8799999999999s)]
*  that pattern in myself and then roll with it [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1899.6799999999998s)]
*  as opposed to just not even see, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1901.32s)]
*  that it's there. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1904.1200000000001s)]
*  That it's there. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1904.96s)]
*  Right, yeah. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1905.8s)]
*  Well, yeah, you have to have acknowledgement of it [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1906.76s)]
*  because you have memories. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1909.72s)]
*  Like if I'm cooking a turkey, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1910.56s)]
*  I have to cook a world-class turkey. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1911.48s)]
*  I have a friend, Jim Detmer, who says to me, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1914.28s)]
*  Josh, what you have to do is cook a terrible turkey. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1915.72s)]
*  Just cook an average turkey. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1917.72s)]
*  Don't crush it. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1919.56s)]
*  In other words, it's an interesting thing [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1921.0s)]
*  when you become present to the fact that [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1923.3600000000001s)]
*  you have this youthful story running through [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1925.1200000000001s)]
*  everything you do. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1929.3200000000002s)]
*  And you can choose to live that way. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1930.56s)]
*  But it's good for it to be a choice [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1933.56s)]
*  as opposed to just driving you. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1934.44s)]
*  It's definitely good for it to be a choice. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1936.48s)]
*  It's always good for it to be a choice [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1938.48s)]
*  because sometimes life will, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1939.76s)]
*  there's a curve that you have to take [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1942.2s)]
*  and you have to put something aside for a bit [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1944.28s)]
*  or maybe forever. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1946.4s)]
*  And you have to be able to transition to something else. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1947.6399999999999s)]
*  And if you can't do that, then you'll be stuck. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1949.56s)]
*  And you see a lot of that with martial arts people. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1952.6s)]
*  Most of us, at a certain point in time, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1956.04s)]
*  realize that injuries are not just inevitable, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1958.48s)]
*  but at a certain point in time, you go, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1962.16s)]
*  maybe I should stop doing this. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1963.8400000000001s)]
*  Because training, no matter what you do, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1965.68s)]
*  training is all about you using your body as a weapon [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1968.52s)]
*  and someone using their body as a weapon. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1973.48s)]
*  Whether it's martial arts like stand up fighting [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1975.48s)]
*  or whether it's jujitsu, it's the same thing. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1977.76s)]
*  You're trying to isolate joints. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1980.72s)]
*  You're trying to cut off blood [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1985.88s)]
*  and you're resisting all these things. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1988.72s)]
*  And all the weak points get exposed. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1989.84s)]
*  Shoulders, knees, ankles, back, neck, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1992.32s)]
*  all those things get exposed. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1996.6399999999999s)]
*  And if you're a meathead, like I have been in the past, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=1997.8s)]
*  you train through injuries and they get chronic. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2001.8s)]
*  And then you get to a certain point where you're like, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2004.3999999999999s)]
*  what am I doing? [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2006.12s)]
*  And if you can't transition to something else, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2007.4399999999998s)]
*  if you can't find something else to do with your time, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2009.6799999999998s)]
*  then you're a cripple. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2011.96s)]
*  Then you're getting your 10th surgery on your back [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2013.6799999999998s)]
*  and you're still trying to train. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2017.52s)]
*  And everybody's like, look at Bob, he's crazy. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2018.92s)]
*  He's got all his discs fused, but he's still training. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2020.52s)]
*  Maybe Bob shouldn't be training. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2023.24s)]
*  Maybe Bob's gonna break something else now. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2024.76s)]
*  Maybe it's time to move on to something else. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2027.8s)]
*  And if you don't have this ability [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2030.44s)]
*  to constantly take on new projects [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2032.88s)]
*  and be excited by different things, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2034.96s)]
*  you're gonna have a shallow life. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2037.16s)]
*  Life has so many challenges [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2038.8s)]
*  and so many fascinating things to dive into. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2040.44s)]
*  For you now, it's foiling. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2042.8s)]
*  For a while, jujitsu, chess, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2044.6000000000001s)]
*  anything like that, you'll find something else like that. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2046.76s)]

*  Trained on it like a crazy person for a couple years. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2142.04s)]
*  And then the doctors looked at that [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2145.76s)]
*  and they just like, if you keep on doing this, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2147.32s)]
*  you're not gonna be able to walk. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2148.5s)]
*  You're not gonna be able to play ball with your son. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2149.72s)]
*  What's it like now? [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2150.8s)]
*  It's great now. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2151.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's great. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2152.8s)]
*  I mean, I think it's a little foiling [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2153.64s)]
*  probably makes your core incredibly strong. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2155.72s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I've done a lot of stuff. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2158.2s)]
*  I mean, I spent, I never had surgery. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2160.32s)]
*  They all told me to, but I didn't have surgery. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2163.52s)]
*  And I did tons of, I mean, I've been doing [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2165.2400000000002s)]
*  total immersion swimming and foundation training [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2167.86s)]
*  and everything I could do for the back. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2169.6800000000003s)]
*  And the foiling feels, I mean, I'm training, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2172.0800000000004s)]
*  like I'm all in on this art. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2175.96s)]
*  And I'm doing it in a way that feels healthy in the back. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2178.0s)]
*  I train Jiu-Jitsu now, but light. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2180.6000000000004s)]
*  I mean, I can't train all out like I'd love to. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2182.6800000000003s)]
*  It was heartbreaking to give it up. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2185.44s)]
*  It was hard. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2187.52s)]
*  And I was so madly in love and all in with Marcelo [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2188.6000000000004s)]
*  and having that, like I was at that part [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2192.52s)]
*  of the learning process, which is where I get good [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2195.08s)]
*  at the learning process, which is like toward [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2197.24s)]
*  the higher levels of something. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2199.0s)]
*  That's where I'm best at learning. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2201.4s)]
*  Did you have a small injury that got worse over time [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2203.84s)]
*  or did you have a significant moment [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2207.0s)]
*  where you realized you heard it? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2208.8s)]
*  I was so stupid. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2209.88s)]
*  No, it was a significant moment. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2210.72s)]
*  I was position sparring. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2212.04s)]
*  Marcelo was at our school in New York. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2214.32s)]
*  It was a week before my eldest son, Jack, was born. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2216.56s)]
*  So it was a bit over 13 years ago. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2220.72s)]
*  Marcelo was gone. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2222.7999999999997s)]
*  I was at the school. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2225.8799999999997s)]
*  Paul Schreiner was running class that day, I think. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2227.6s)]
*  And there was this 240 pound blue belt visiting. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2230.8799999999997s)]
*  Just this like ripped dude. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2233.68s)]
*  And Paul had everyone doing position sparring, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2235.3599999999997s)]
*  half guard position sparring. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2238.6s)]
*  And this guy was matched up against one of our guys. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2239.68s)]
*  I had that hubristic, invincible feeling about me [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2242.0s)]
*  in that moment. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2244.7999999999997s)]
*  I was just, when you're feeling at your very best [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2245.64s)]
*  in martial flow. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2246.8399999999997s)]
*  And I was like, and it ended up where we were doing [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2247.84s)]
*  half guard position sparring where I was holding half guard [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2251.56s)]
*  and he was doing this pass, twisting the spine. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2254.1600000000003s)]
*  And it was so fucking stupid to do it. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2257.8s)]
*  I mean, I was just holding half guard in position sparring [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2260.0s)]
*  and I just felt it go. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2264.8s)]
*  And then, you know, it was, I couldn't move. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2267.96s)]
*  It was fucking terrible. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2274.4s)]
*  And it was. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2276.48s)]
*  Did it herniate? [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2277.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2278.6s)]
*  And all the fluid gone. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2279.6s)]
*  Oh. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2281.16s)]
*  And yeah, it was brutal. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2282.0s)]
*  You know, it was, and I remember. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2284.2799999999997s)]
*  So how was the disc now? [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2286.16s)]
*  Couldn't lift, I couldn't lift up my child [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2287.7599999999998s)]
*  for the first three, four months of his life. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2290.04s)]
*  Then I had this strange period where I couldn't, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2291.8399999999997s)]
*  I could standing and walking was the toughest. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2294.24s)]
*  But then I had this period, like if I would go into [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2296.64s)]
*  the corner store to get milk, like three, four months later, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2298.68s)]
*  I have to bike to the corner store and come back. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2301.16s)]
*  And I can't explain this, but I had a period [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2303.12s)]
*  where I couldn't walk, but I could ski. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2305.7599999999998s)]
*  Because of the angle. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2309.6s)]
*  So Marcel and I were going to the mountains [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2310.44s)]
*  out around New York, just bombing down. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2312.52s)]
*  I just was trying to get my fix in. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2314.12s)]
*  Just skiing without turning was my goal. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2317.04s)]
*  He was snowboarding, I was skiing. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2320.88s)]
*  You couldn't walk, but you could ski. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2322.24s)]
*  Yeah, it was a very strange period. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2323.7599999999998s)]
*  Dude, don't ski. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2325.12s)]
*  Don't fucking ski. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2325.96s)]
*  That would have been a smart thing to tell me. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2326.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I was a dumbass for the first two years [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2328.6s)]
*  after the injury. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2330.24s)]
*  And then I realized I had to. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2332.36s)]
*  What does the disc look like now? [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2334.1600000000003s)]
*  I haven't looked at it in a long time. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2335.96s)]
*  Doesn't trouble you anymore? [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2338.92s)]
*  It does trouble me. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2339.76s)]
*  I take care of it all the time. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2340.6s)]
*  They replace them now. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2344.4s)]
*  Eddie Bravo got a fake disc in his lower back, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2346.0s)]
*  a titanium disc. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2348.76s)]
*  And he's able to train again. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2351.28s)]
*  I know quite a few guys who've got them. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2353.7200000000003s)]
*  Al Jermain Sterling got one in his neck [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2355.2400000000002s)]
*  and then went on to defend the UFC Bantamweight Championship [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2357.88s)]
*  several times. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2361.52s)]
*  They replaced them all together. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2362.6s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2364.2s)]
*  Yeah, they put artificial discs now. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2365.04s)]
*  Your point about, I remember I was back in the early 2000s [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2368.84s)]
*  studying Eddie's game, studying the rubber guards, [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2372.44s)]
*  studying all the twister stuff, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2374.12s)]
*  just trying to wrap my head around it. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2376.08s)]
*  Yeah, he's got some wild stuff. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2377.64s)]
*  And if you're not used to it, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2379.32s)]
*  it's really interesting to watch people [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2380.68s)]
*  that just have never encountered it before. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2382.6s)]
*  When I would go to train in other places, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2384.4s)]
*  like I lived in Colorado for a bit [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2385.84s)]
*  and I trained at Amal Easton's. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2387.2s)]
*  When I'd go up there, there's so many positions [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2389.6s)]
*  that guys just didn't understand. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2392.12s)]
*  They didn't know what was going on. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2393.68s)]
*  They figured it out after a while. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2394.88s)]
*  Oh, if he goes this way, [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2396.24s)]
*  he's gonna try to get me in a twister. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2397.08s)]
*  If he goes this way, he's gonna try to set this up. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2398.8399999999997s)]
*  But there's certain things that people do all the time, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2400.96s)]
*  especially put your hands on the mat. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2404.48s)]
*  If you put your hands, pull up Jeremiah Vance highlights. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2406.48s)]
*  This is one of Eddie's best black belts with rubber guard. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2411.72s)]
*  And the way he does it is phenomenal. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2416.2s)]
*  He has incredible leg dexterity [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2418.6s)]
*  and his technique is so sharp. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2420.88s)]
*  And he catches people and stuff where they're like, [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2422.88s)]
*  how am I even stuck here? [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2424.72s)]
*  Do you find that flex? [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2428.8s)]
*  Yeah, here it is. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2430.2s)]
*  So watch how quick he sets things up. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2431.2s)]
*  It's like right away, you're in your Foxville. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2434.68s)]
*  Like who does this? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2438.4s)]
*  Who sets up a go-go plot right off the bat [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2440.68s)]
*  and then triangles it. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2443.88s)]
*  Look how he sets this up. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2445.12s)]
*  I mean, this is insane. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2446.12s)]
*  And just massive crank on your fucking neck. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2447.68s)]
*  And he switches it to Omoplata, re-rolls. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2453.44s)]
*  Omoplata crucifix finish. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2460.56s)]
*  And everything he does involves this incredible dexterity [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2464.8399999999997s)]
*  and flexibility. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2468.2799999999997s)]
*  There's like a whole series of highlights. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2469.3999999999996s)]
*  That's not even some of his best stuff, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2470.72s)]
*  but he's able to do this to people [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2472.52s)]
*  that just don't know what he's doing. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2475.0s)]
*  They don't understand some of these transitions. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2477.48s)]
*  And this is just like one of the best expressions [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2483.6s)]
*  of the techniques that Eddie's developed. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2486.44s)]
*  So Jeremiah's fantastic at that. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2489.0s)]
*  This particular technique of being able [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2491.72s)]
*  to isolate the Omoplata and then secure a choke [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2493.88s)]
*  in the transition. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2497.28s)]
*  He does this to everybody. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2498.6s)]
*  Look at how he, this transition right here. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2499.56s)]
*  It's so nasty. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2501.92s)]
*  It's so nasty and you just, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2503.8s)]
*  you don't know what the fuck you're doing. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2505.48s)]
*  How am I getting out of this? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2507.76s)]
*  I mean, he just hits this over and over and over on people. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2510.2400000000002s)]
*  And so many times when people go for an Omoplata, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2512.6400000000003s)]
*  people say, okay, worst case scenario, [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2515.32s)]
*  I might roll out of this and wind up on my back [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2517.44s)]
*  and side control. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2519.88s)]
*  But not with him. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2520.96s)]
*  But with, you're like, this is like, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2521.8s)]
*  you're really close to checkmate from the moment [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2523.7200000000003s)]
*  the Omoplata is set up from a position [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2526.44s)]
*  where you're defending. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2528.88s)]
*  So you're defending correctly from the Omoplata [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2530.56s)]
*  and that winds up setting up this choke. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2533.12s)]
*  What was your, how do you feel about Ryan Hall's game [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2536.4s)]
*  in MMA? [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2540.16s)]
*  Like, cause he also, he's entering the MMA game. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2541.0s)]
*  Oh, he's been in the MMA game for quite a while. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2543.28s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2544.96s)]
*  Yeah, no, but I mean, when he entered the game, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2545.8s)]
*  he came into it with a repertoire that was so unusual for him. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2547.28s)]
*  Very unusual. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2549.92s)]
*  Well, he's really, really smart, obviously. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2550.88s)]
*  And when you see his style, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2553.64s)]
*  the problem with his style, in my opinion, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2557.08s)]
*  is it's so jiu-jitsu heavy that he's vulnerable [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2559.92s)]
*  when he's fighting world-class strikers. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2564.84s)]
*  Like, Ilya Toporya smashed him. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2566.76s)]
*  And it was a horrible, horrible knockout. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2569.1200000000003s)]
*  It's because Ilya's a legit Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2571.0s)]
*  but also like way more technical on the feet. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2574.2000000000003s)]
*  And when you're fighting a guy who's just, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2577.08s)]
*  any one mistake you make in striking is a concussion. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2579.28s)]
*  Any one mistake, boom, a big hand's coming, [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2584.4s)]
*  a knee's coming, a kick's coming. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2586.84s)]
*  It's like something's coming if you make mistakes. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2588.08s)]
*  It's just like being a blue belt [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2590.56s)]
*  rolling with a high-level black belt. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2592.84s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2595.2000000000003s)]
*  It's like you're just way too vulnerable. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2596.04s)]
*  So his jiu-jitsu's off the charts, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2598.1600000000003s)]
*  but his stand-up is not at the level of his jiu-jitsu. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2601.36s)]
*  And that's just a real problem today. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2604.04s)]
*  It's very, you can kind of be a specialist [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2606.1200000000003s)]
*  if you're a striker. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2609.1600000000003s)]
*  A striker, like there's a few guys that can pull it off [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2610.88s)]
*  if they're really strong and they have good takedown defense. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2613.8s)]
*  Like Pereira is the best example, right? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2616.0s)]
*  Two-division world champion kickboxer comes over, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2617.8s)]
*  dominates, becomes a two-division UFC champion as a striker [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2620.68s)]
*  because every fight starts standing up. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2624.68s)]
*  But if you don't know how to strike, [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2626.8399999999997s)]
*  every fight starts standing up. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2629.48s)]
*  So the beginning of the fight [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2631.12s)]
*  is always something you're not good at. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2632.3999999999996s)]
*  And if you're getting tagged [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2633.96s)]
*  at the very beginning of the fight [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2635.48s)]
*  and now you're in desperation mode, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2636.9199999999996s)]
*  and all this person has to do, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2638.8799999999997s)]
*  it's an enormous space they're fighting in, the octagon. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2639.94s)]
*  And the cage of the octagon actually makes it easier [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2643.12s)]
*  to get up if someone takes you down. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2646.04s)]
*  So there's a lot of elements that wouldn't even exist [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2647.7599999999998s)]
*  if you had a flat surface with no walls. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2650.08s)]
*  So it's easier to defend. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2652.12s)]
*  It's easier to move around [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2654.34s)]
*  because it's an enormous surface. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2656.0s)]
*  So you're now chasing this person [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2657.12s)]
*  and you might've already gotten in concussion. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2659.08s)]
*  You might've already been rocked. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2661.3199999999997s)]
*  So you're already like a little out of it. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2662.72s)]
*  And now you're like desperado mode. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2664.4s)]
*  It's just a bad place to be. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2666.36s)]
*  But you have to have world-class striking [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2668.24s)]
*  to compete at a world-class level in MMA at this point. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2670.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2673.72s)]
*  You have to have something, at the very least, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2674.56s)]
*  you have to be really good defensively, really good, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2677.96s)]
*  but then you're just gonna get picked apart on the feet. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2680.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2684.2400000000002s)]
*  Your legs are gonna get kicked. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2685.08s)]
*  You're gonna get brutalized. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2686.08s)]
*  Yeah, you have to be a really good striker. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2688.12s)]
*  And Ryan is one of those guys that's a specialist, [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2690.08s)]
*  and he tapped a lot. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2692.96s)]
*  I mean, tapped BJ Penn in like 10 seconds. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2694.3s)]
*  He's tapped a lot of guys. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2696.68s)]
*  When he gets ahold of you, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2698.42s)]
*  you're in this complex web of transitions and techniques [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2699.6s)]
*  that if you're just a regular MMA fighter [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2703.12s)]
*  who trains jiu-jitsu three times a week, [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2705.96s)]
*  you're not gonna know what he's doing. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2707.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2708.92s)]
*  He's a brilliant guy. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2710.04s)]
*  He trained at our school in New York, [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2711.04s)]
*  I think from 2010, 2012, that range. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2713.6s)]
*  And it was so interesting watching him and Marcelo, [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2716.76s)]
*  because Ryan had a huge amount of humility [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2720.1800000000003s)]
*  relative to Marcelo, and he wanted to train with him. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2721.6400000000003s)]
*  And Marcelo was so curious about Ryan's game, [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2724.56s)]
*  but Marcelo never studied anyone's game. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2726.76s)]
*  A core principle of Marcelo is if you study my game, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2729.36s)]
*  you enter my game, and no one will be better [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2732.04s)]
*  at my game than me. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2733.88s)]
*  And so in competition, [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2735.16s)]
*  the guys would be studying tape of everybody. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2737.64s)]
*  He would never study anyone's tape, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2739.08s)]
*  never study anyone's fights, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2740.44s)]
*  but he'd watch them, the fight before they went against him, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2741.28s)]
*  and he'd pick up on some kind of elemental read. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2744.56s)]
*  He has this, he's what I call a low rep learner. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2746.88s)]
*  His ability to learn from a single repetition [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2750.08s)]
*  is just unbelievable. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2752.0s)]
*  And it was really interesting watching him and Ryan, [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2755.12s)]
*  because Ryan just came and visited me [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2756.64s)]
*  in my home a month ago, [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2760.08s)]
*  and we were talking about how formative [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2763.0s)]
*  those training experiences with Marcelo were. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2764.92s)]
*  And it was like, one way that Ryan described it [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2767.76s)]
*  is that he had this like layers of traps, seven steps in. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2771.44s)]
*  But Marcelo had this deep understanding upstream of that. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2775.28s)]
*  And it was like watching Marcelo put himself [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2778.2000000000003s)]
*  like right next to the fire, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2780.56s)]
*  like right next to Ryan's game. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2782.16s)]
*  He wanted to learn Ryan, the edges of Ryan's game, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2783.32s)]
*  but never enter it. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2785.8s)]
*  And his ability to play right at the threshold [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2786.88s)]
*  of all of Ryan's traps, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2788.96s)]
*  which he could pull almost everyone else into, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2790.56s)]
*  just pure grappling. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2793.7200000000003s)]
*  But not just, his ability to learn, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2795.6800000000003s)]
*  it felt like a cat putting its paw [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2798.6800000000003s)]
*  right up against the edge of a fire. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2801.08s)]
*  And just like learning about what heat was [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2803.0s)]
*  and deconstructing it, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2805.44s)]
*  but then not ever getting into the heat. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2806.6400000000003s)]
*  And you'd watch Ryan roll anyone else, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2809.84s)]
*  he could just pull them into the fire, into the spider web. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2811.4s)]
*  That's fascinating. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2815.0s)]
*  Marcelo has a really incredibly deep, [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2816.1200000000003s)]
*  almost simian physical intelligence. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2820.44s)]
*  And his ability to learn from a single rep [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2823.68s)]
*  is unique in my observation. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2825.88s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2827.56s)]
*  Ryan has had a ton of surgeries, hasn't he? [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2829.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, man, that dude has had such bad luck. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2831.08s)]
*  What is wrong with him? [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2833.08s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2834.52s)]
*  Shit, I mean tons of stuff with his knee, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2835.36s)]
*  with his hip, with, I think he's starting to come, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2837.24s)]
*  I think his shoulder's something now. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2839.2799999999997s)]
*  He's still, you know, he's- [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2841.2799999999997s)]
*  He's had like nine surgeries? [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2842.8399999999997s)]
*  I think 23, sir. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2843.68s)]
*  I think it was 23. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2844.52s)]
*  I think he's had 23 surgeries. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2845.56s)]
*  Dude has got, and the bad one happened [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2847.48s)]
*  was someone just falling on him in training. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2850.0s)]
*  What was that? [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2851.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2852.8s)]
*  That was the hip. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2853.6400000000003s)]
*  Oh God. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2854.84s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know exactly. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2855.84s)]
*  I haven't seen the video. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2856.6800000000003s)]
*  What did he get done to his hip? [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2857.52s)]
*  Ask him, I'm not sure. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2859.76s)]
*  Yeah, he's had a lot of surgeries. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2861.2400000000002s)]
*  Someone just fell on him. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2863.2400000000002s)]
*  So was he training with someone else [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2864.6400000000003s)]
*  and someone else fell on him? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2866.4s)]
*  No, he was training with somebody [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2867.2400000000002s)]
*  and he was taking it easy on them in a transition, [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2868.6s)]
*  trying to not hurt them, and then they just collapsed [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2870.36s)]
*  on him, on his hip in a certain way, as he described it. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2872.28s)]
*  Yeah, brutal. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2876.0s)]
*  When you were training, did you do any weightlifting [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2877.52s)]
*  just to sort of supplement it, [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2880.04s)]
*  to keep your joints strong and your- [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2881.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2884.28s)]
*  I did a lot of, I tended to do weightlifting [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2886.04s)]
*  that was consistent with the movement patterns [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2889.32s)]
*  of the arts that I was training in. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2891.84s)]
*  So I would do a lot of biking, lower body strength, [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2893.56s)]
*  and then I would do, I wasn't, didn't have, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2896.52s)]
*  I think if I did it now, I would do much more weightlifting. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2898.6s)]
*  But when I was rolling, usually twice a week, [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2903.44s)]
*  six days a week, and I was, I would do cardio work [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2906.6s)]
*  in addition, and then some resistance work. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2912.16s)]
*  But I didn't, I wasn't, I'm doing a lot of work [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2915.24s)]
*  with the Boston Celtics now, and I'm seeing how they're, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2918.48s)]
*  for the last few years, and I see how brilliant [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2920.7599999999998s)]
*  their sports science team and their physical trainers are. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2922.4s)]
*  And I don't think that I was, when I was training Jiu Jitsu, [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2924.4s)]
*  I was at the level of, for example, the Boston Celtics [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2927.44s)]
*  in the resistance training that I was doing, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2931.32s)]
*  supplemented. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2935.56s)]
*  And Marcelo didn't do weight training, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2936.92s)]
*  that was part of it. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2938.16s)]
*  When I was training with him, we were, [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2939.0s)]
*  like I was just saying. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2940.28s)]
*  He didn't weight train at all? [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2941.12s)]
*  No. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2941.96s)]
*  How did he get those legs? [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2942.8s)]
*  He just rolls, man. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2944.0s)]
*  He was biking, he was into those bikes without brakes. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2945.24s)]
*  We were biking all over New York. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2949.92s)]
*  Bikes without brakes? [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2951.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2952.36s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2953.2s)]
*  What are they called? [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2954.02s)]
*  Fixies? [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2954.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2955.7s)]
*  What is that? [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2956.52s)]
*  Fixed wheel? [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2957.36s)]
*  Yeah, fixed wheel. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2958.2s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2959.04s)]
*  Just, no brakes. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2959.86s)]
*  How do you slow down? [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2961.12s)]
*  You go slow. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2962.36s)]
*  You gotta slow, you put your foot on the, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2963.36s)]
*  on the edge of the wheel. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2966.48s)]
*  What? [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2967.32s)]
*  Yeah, fixed wheel biking. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2968.14s)]
*  I mean, he loved fixed wheel around New York [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2968.98s)]
*  and I was biking. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2970.12s)]
*  Then I switched over. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2971.12s)]
*  Why would you ever get on a bike with no brakes? [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2972.06s)]
*  It's a- [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2974.56s)]
*  You control it. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2975.4s)]
*  You're braking. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2976.2400000000002s)]
*  I'll show you videos. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2977.08s)]
*  Show me. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2978.48s)]
*  People love it, but man, in New York, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2979.3s)]
*  it's quite something. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2980.48s)]
*  What is this? [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2981.32s)]
*  I mean, in New York, when you're going down a hill [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2982.14s)]
*  in New York City in traffic, there's some adventures. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2982.98s)]
*  You're going down a hill. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2985.36s)]
*  How are you fucking slowing down? [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2986.28s)]
*  You don't go fast. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2988.12s)]
*  Oh, what? [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2989.32s)]
*  We were going fast. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2990.16s)]
*  No, I mean, that's the, you just gotta, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2990.98s)]
*  you gotta see a high, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2993.64s)]
*  this isn't gonna be a good video. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2995.6s)]
*  This is the dumbest thing I've ever heard of in my life. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2996.44s)]
*  This is something only white people would figure out. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=2998.6s)]
*  Let's have a bike with no brakes. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3000.88s)]
*  The dumbest thing was what I did after this, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3002.4s)]
*  which is that I, when I fell in love with surfing, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3003.88s)]
*  I was one-wheeling all over New York. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3005.68s)]
*  Oh, five ways to stop on a fixie. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3007.84s)]
*  How about don't get a fixie, get brakes, you fucking idiot. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3010.48s)]
*  This is the dumbest shit I've ever seen in my life. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3013.88s)]
*  Why wouldn't you have brakes? [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3016.36s)]
*  Why wouldn't you have an option to control the bike better? [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3017.64s)]
*  So I, the people that ride these, [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3021.64s)]
*  they'd argue they control it probably better. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3025.52s)]
*  Yeah, look at all the white people. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3026.8399999999997s)]
*  All white people. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3028.24s)]
*  Ridiculous white people that'd be doing [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3029.3599999999997s)]
*  back flips with skateboards. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3031.0s)]
*  This is a big New York thing though. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3033.2799999999997s)]
*  Of course it is. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3034.68s)]
*  They like suffering over there. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3036.2799999999997s)]
*  That's why they all look jammed on top of each other. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3037.7999999999997s)]
*  You can't find a good video. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3039.68s)]
*  That's so stupid. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3041.3599999999997s)]
*  There's no good videos on that. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3042.64s)]
*  That's a stupid thing. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3044.04s)]
*  There's a movie I've seen. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3044.8799999999997s)]
*  That's why I don't love it. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3045.96s)]
*  Brakes, you fucking freaks. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3046.7999999999997s)]
*  My last two years living in New York, [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3048.0s)]
*  I had fallen so in love with surfing [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3049.68s)]
*  and I knew Ocean Art Tour my next chapter [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3051.24s)]
*  and I was so heartbroken not to be able to do it every day [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3054.16s)]
*  so I got a one wheel. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3056.0s)]
*  It was like the first generation, [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3057.08s)]
*  you know the one wheel electronic skateboard [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3058.24s)]
*  was the one that you were in. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3059.36s)]
*  Yeah, we had one of those. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3060.2s)]
*  It just came out, first generation. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3061.12s)]
*  And I was just like thousands of miles biking [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3062.96s)]
*  one wheeling all over New York. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3066.24s)]
*  And then, but it was at the early one, [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3068.04s)]
*  if you push past the pushback, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3070.12s)]
*  it had this pushback thing which would slow you down [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3071.84s)]
*  but you could push past it and go faster. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3073.88s)]
*  But if you pushed past the final pushback, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3075.2s)]
*  it just bottomed out, wham. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3076.96s)]
*  And then these went 23, 24 miles, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3078.68s)]
*  it was a whack, right? [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3080.4s)]
*  Over taxi cabs, under taxi cabs, [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3082.16s)]
*  through taxi cabs, everything. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3084.12s)]
*  The one wheel is like when you're a kid, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3085.8399999999997s)]
*  or sorry, the fixie, it's like you just skid. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3087.0s)]
*  Oh, so there is brakes. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3089.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you slam on. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3091.4s)]
*  Like a kid. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3092.24s)]
*  Yeah, I guess that's a better way to describe it. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3093.08s)]
*  I wasn't thinking of it that way. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3094.04s)]
*  Okay, so you can brake. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3095.12s)]
*  You can also reverse which you can't do on most bikes. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3096.8799999999997s)]
*  You can ride backwards if you needed to. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3099.4s)]
*  It's really beautiful. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3102.08s)]
*  I mean, this wasn't, I never did it [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3103.04s)]
*  but it's really beautiful to watch when it's done well. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3105.92s)]
*  Okay, that makes me feel better that you could just skid. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3108.0s)]
*  Yeah, you could skid. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3111.56s)]
*  You could fuck up your tire but you can stop. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3112.4s)]
*  There's lots of things that can go wrong. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3114.68s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like you. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3116.08s)]
*  There are lots of things that can go wrong. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3116.92s)]
*  Foiling, there's a lot of fucking things [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3118.64s)]
*  that can go wrong. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3120.04s)]
*  You're 35, 40 miles an hour on top of a guillotine, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3120.88s)]
*  big waves, I mean, shit can go wrong fast. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3124.0s)]
*  Dude, I learned how to foil two years ago [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3125.84s)]
*  and it took me like three hours to get on that fucking thing [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3128.2s)]
*  for the first time because I've never surfed. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3131.56s)]
*  You were on an E-foil or? [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3132.96s)]
*  Yeah, E-foil. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3133.8s)]
*  Yeah, took me forever. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3134.64s)]
*  Just kept falling down, getting back up, falling down. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3136.68s)]
*  Meanwhile, my kids, my youngest at the time, [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3139.24s)]
*  she was 12, humiliated me. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3142.04s)]
*  She just hopped on it instantly, [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3144.2799999999997s)]
*  was scooting around and she knew how to do it immediately [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3145.56s)]
*  but she wakeboards, she does a lot of that shit, [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3148.8799999999997s)]
*  she's really athletic but she was just humiliating me [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3153.3199999999997s)]
*  and I was just like, I'm gonna figure this out. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3156.96s)]
*  For hours, I kept falling down and getting back up, [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3159.0s)]
*  falling down and eventually I got it [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3162.72s)]
*  and then once I got it, it was like easy. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3164.3199999999997s)]
*  Once I got it, I was like, oh, I see. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3166.8799999999997s)]
*  E-foiling is the best way to learn how to foil [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3168.16s)]
*  because they weigh 90 pounds, the E-foils do. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3171.72s)]
*  Like a high performance foil, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3174.3999999999996s)]
*  the whole setup will weigh four or five pounds. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3177.3999999999996s)]
*  Really? [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3179.24s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, E-foil, you have a battery, it's heavy [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3180.08s)]
*  and you've got electricity to learn foil dynamics. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3182.68s)]
*  Foiling, when you're high performance foiling in big surf, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3186.0s)]
*  you're just on a, if you're towing in, [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3188.9599999999996s)]
*  you're on a three and a half foot board, no batter. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3191.3599999999997s)]
*  It's not powered, you're just riding hydrodynamics. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3194.88s)]
*  Are you getting towed in to these waves? [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3198.6000000000004s)]
*  You can paddle in but if you're towing in to bigger waves, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3200.6800000000003s)]
*  you're on a small board, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3204.8s)]
*  you're getting towed in behind a jet ski, whipped in [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3208.7200000000003s)]
*  and then you're just riding, it's epic, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3210.32s)]
*  it's frictionless, so beautiful. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3211.6800000000003s)]
*  And what's the benefit of that above surfing? [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3213.6000000000004s)]
*  Is that you're above the water? [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3215.84s)]
*  You're above the water, you're not feeling, [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3216.96s)]
*  like the ultimate, if you think about [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3218.08s)]
*  the glassiest surf day possible, the frictionless feeling, [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3219.32s)]
*  it's more frictionless than that [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3224.32s)]
*  because you're above the water. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3225.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I get that on the e-foil. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3226.6800000000003s)]
*  When you get cooking on the e-foil, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3228.1200000000003s)]
*  you're above the water and it's wild. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3229.52s)]
*  I always feel like I'm gonna fall, I'm gonna fall. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3231.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3234.48s)]
*  As soon as I get above the water, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3235.8s)]
*  I'm like, okay, we're going too fast, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3236.88s)]
*  you're gonna wipe out. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3238.36s)]
*  The foiling is interesting [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3239.8s)]
*  because it's like the ultimate receptivity [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3240.6400000000003s)]
*  because the foil picks up on underwater wave circulation [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3244.36s)]
*  so it's picking up on lift when you're going very fast [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3247.48s)]
*  and also when you're in a wave, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3249.92s)]
*  the waves have upward circulation [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3251.2799999999997s)]
*  at the face of the wave, [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3254.4799999999996s)]
*  when you get to the top of the wave, it accelerates. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3255.3199999999997s)]
*  And so your foil is riding the underwater currents [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3257.64s)]
*  and you're receiving, it's so amplified, [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3261.52s)]
*  so tiny little movements have big effect on things. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3262.7999999999997s)]
*  So the surf movement will be very big [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3265.72s)]
*  and the foil movement is very subtle, the body mechanic. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3267.3999999999996s)]
*  And then you learn to really crank into it [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3270.9599999999996s)]
*  and it's limitless. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3273.3999999999996s)]
*  You can do open water foiling, [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3274.24s)]
*  crossing oceans on long high aspect wings, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3275.6s)]
*  riding open ocean swells and you can, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3278.4399999999996s)]
*  like high performance foiling [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3281.6s)]
*  is just like high performance surfing, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3282.72s)]
*  the lines you can draw. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3284.52s)]
*  The turns are epic, the Gs are crazy. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3285.7599999999998s)]
*  So you're just all in on this, huh? [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3288.3199999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah, I'm all in on this. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3290.0s)]
*  Is this an everyday thing for you? [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3290.8399999999997s)]
*  Yes, everyday. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3292.52s)]
*  Same as Jiu Jitsu, six days a week, [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3294.3199999999997s)]
*  twice a day if possible. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3296.16s)]
*  Really? [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3297.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Wow. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3298.6s)]
*  Wow. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3300.4s)]
*  Do you have goals? [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3301.3199999999997s)]
*  Virtuosity. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3303.04s)]
*  Yeah, I competed my whole life. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3304.96s)]
*  And so now I live, [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3306.56s)]
*  I train the way I would [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3309.48s)]
*  if I was in a world championship training camp. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3311.48s)]
*  That's hilarious with foiling. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3314.7599999999998s)]
*  Who else is doing that? [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3316.64s)]
*  Just a couple lunatics. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3318.3199999999997s)]
*  How many other people are foiling [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3319.56s)]
*  like they're training for a world championship activity? [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3321.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3323.3999999999996s)]
*  But the interesting thing is like I, [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3324.8799999999997s)]
*  yeah, I love it. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3327.3999999999996s)]
*  But all these arts to me are connected. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3329.56s)]
*  That's the strange thing about my art. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3331.2799999999997s)]
*  Like chess, Chinese martial arts, [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3332.64s)]
*  Jiu Jitsu, surfing, foiling. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3334.48s)]
*  To me, the fascinating thing [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3336.64s)]
*  when you get toward the pinnacle of an art [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3339.3199999999997s)]
*  is that you start to experience, [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3341.6s)]
*  at least from my perspective, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3343.24s)]
*  that the apexes of these arts are much closer [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3347.4s)]
*  to one another than lower down [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3350.2s)]
*  in the mountain of the same art. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3352.04s)]
*  So people who are virtuosos in various fields [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3354.24s)]
*  are often speaking a much more similar language [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3356.6s)]
*  than people who are at lower levels of the same art [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3358.52s)]
*  than they're training. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3361.3199999999997s)]
*  And like when I think about chess, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3362.48s)]
*  I related to chess through core principles [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3368.48s)]
*  and those principles manifest in the martial arts. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3371.88s)]
*  I remember that I had this, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3373.8s)]
*  when I wrote my first book, [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3376.72s)]
*  my second book, The Art of Learning, [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3378.44s)]
*  it was about my experience of crossing over my level [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3380.16s)]
*  from chess into the Chinese martial arts. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3382.52s)]
*  And I had this really interesting experience [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3386.4s)]
*  where I was giving a simultaneous chess exhibition [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3389.92s)]
*  playing 40 games at once in a charity [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3391.6s)]
*  for Duchenne Muscle Dystrophy. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3393.2s)]
*  But at that point I'd been training martial arts [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3394.88s)]
*  for two years and I had not been, [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3397.24s)]
*  I'd kind of moved to, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3399.44s)]
*  I was in the transition away from chess during that period. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3400.2799999999997s)]
*  And I had this realization that I was winning [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3402.68s)]
*  these chess games, playing 40 games at once, [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3404.96s)]
*  but I was not playing chess. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3407.04s)]
*  I was feeling flow, riding space left behind. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3408.12s)]
*  I was riding the energetic wave of the game like I would [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3411.68s)]
*  if we were flowing on the mats. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3414.6s)]
*  But I was making chess moves. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3416.16s)]
*  And I realized that these arts had become [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3417.7999999999997s)]
*  fundamentally connected. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3420.4s)]
*  And then that became an area of interest and of exploration. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3422.48s)]
*  I started making what I was doing unconsciously [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3427.0s)]
*  more and more conscious. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3428.68s)]
*  And now when I relate to chess, [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3430.44s)]
*  I don't move chess pieces anymore, [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3433.16s)]
*  but chess is manifest in everything that I do, [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3434.48s)]
*  as is jiu-jitsu. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3436.56s)]
*  And as is, in the ocean arts, [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3440.2s)]
*  I'm manifesting these other arts, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3442.44s)]
*  the core principles I've experienced through them [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3443.68s)]
*  all the time. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3445.96s)]
*  And that's one of the things that I've been puzzled by [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3446.8s)]
*  for many years is why chess is so fucking hard. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3452.1600000000003s)]
*  Like chess has no luck. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3454.56s)]
*  The best chess players in the world [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3455.7200000000003s)]
*  are so brilliant at what they do. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3457.1200000000003s)]
*  I listened to your episode with Magnus Carlsen. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3459.56s)]
*  Enjoyed that. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3461.84s)]
*  Yeah, it was great. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3462.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it was cool. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3463.52s)]
*  Someone like Magnus, he's so fucking good at what he does. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3464.36s)]
*  Such a virtuoso. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3467.1200000000003s)]
*  But if you look at the top 100 or top 1,000 chess players, [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3469.4s)]
*  they're tremendously strong. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3471.88s)]
*  But when they try to translate their ability [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3473.6800000000003s)]
*  to other fields, they often can't. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3476.0800000000004s)]
*  And it's surprising. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3479.28s)]
*  And I've tried to figure out why for a lot of years, [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3481.0s)]
*  because you'd think if you're able to just be so excellent [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3482.84s)]
*  at something that's super hard, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3484.8s)]
*  you could take on something that's relatively easier [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3486.48s)]
*  and become very good at it. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3488.48s)]
*  And I think that the reason that people often can't [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3489.8s)]
*  cross level over from one thing to the other [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3492.48s)]
*  is that they learn it in a localized language. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3494.36s)]
*  So you can learn chess in a way [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3497.08s)]
*  which is very specific to chess, [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3498.76s)]
*  like principles that are just chess principles. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3501.6s)]
*  Or you can learn chess in a language [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3503.4s)]
*  which connects to all of life. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3506.0s)]
*  And that won't slow down. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3509.76s)]
*  It might accelerate your chess learning. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3511.1200000000003s)]
*  But you can, and if children are taught games [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3513.1200000000003s)]
*  like chess or gymnastics or music or whatever else, [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3516.88s)]
*  so they're learning about that art very deeply. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3520.0s)]
*  They're touching quality, they're pushing their limits, [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3522.28s)]
*  they're living a life of training, [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3523.6800000000003s)]
*  as I know you value very much. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3524.6400000000003s)]
*  But they're doing so in a language [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3526.48s)]
*  which connects to the rest of life. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3528.48s)]
*  Then they're studying thematic interconnectedness [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3530.1200000000003s)]
*  while they're studying chess or jujitsu or anything else. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3534.36s)]
*  And then they're just learning the language of excellence. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3538.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3542.04s)]
*  And it's interesting because if you watch chess players, [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3542.8799999999997s)]
*  chess teachers teaching students, [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3545.7999999999997s)]
*  many of them don't do this. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3547.64s)]
*  They teach it within the confines of the chessboard, [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3549.04s)]
*  like a prison. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3551.96s)]
*  And if you learn chess that way, [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3553.16s)]
*  then it's like you're living on an island [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3554.2799999999997s)]
*  and the ocean around you is like prison walls. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3555.6s)]
*  But if you study chess in a way that [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3560.16s)]
*  you're learning how each chess principle [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3563.3999999999996s)]
*  connects to every other art you could ever study, [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3566.12s)]
*  then this web of interconnectedness is forming in your mind [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3569.4s)]
*  and then when you take on something else, [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3572.72s)]
*  you're able to cross the level over really naturally. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3573.6s)]
*  In many ways, that's a big part of my life's work [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3576.96s)]
*  is the study of that interconnectedness. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3580.4s)]
*  Do you think that, well, it had to be a huge factor for you [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3582.52s)]
*  that you were sort of forced to reevaluate [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3587.2s)]
*  the way you interface with life when you became famous [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3590.48s)]
*  because of the film at 15. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3594.6s)]
*  So childhood chess player become very well recognized [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3597.08s)]
*  and then all of a sudden this movie [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3601.3199999999997s)]
*  and now you have to kind of like grapple with things [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3602.48s)]
*  and as you said, these challenges [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3605.12s)]
*  make you a more complex person. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3607.0s)]
*  And then your ability to sort of push chess aside [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3609.08s)]
*  and try other things, do you think that's because of, [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3614.12s)]
*  it has to be a factor in your desire to explore other things [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3618.3199999999997s)]
*  because you're kind of thrust into this thing [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3625.16s)]
*  where your thing is now changed. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3627.08s)]
*  Your thing is now not just flowing and learning [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3628.64s)]
*  and getting better and doing battle with chess. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3631.68s)]
*  Now it's image and groupies and this bizarre thing [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3634.12s)]
*  that you're living up to and you don't like it [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3637.7599999999998s)]
*  and you wanna escape it and so you have to reevaluate. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3640.12s)]
*  And so this forced reevaluation from a young age [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3643.2s)]
*  at 15 years old, this key developmental period [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3646.4s)]
*  as a young man, it sort of opens you up to the possibilities [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3649.2s)]
*  of all sorts of different ways of living life [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3653.68s)]
*  and all sorts of different things to do with life. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3657.44s)]
*  Yeah, a language I use for this is the passage [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3659.56s)]
*  from the pre-conscious to the post-conscious competitor [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3661.7599999999998s)]
*  or artist and like when I, up until 15, [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3664.28s)]
*  I would relate to myself as the pre-conscious competitor. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3667.52s)]
*  I loved chess, it was free flowing, I loved the battle, [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3670.24s)]
*  I loved the competition, I loved the ass kicking [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3672.24s)]
*  and the kicking ass, I just loved the fucking battle [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3674.56s)]
*  of the thing and then I fell in love for the first time [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3677.08s)]
*  when I was 15, the movie came out after that [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3682.36s)]
*  and I started studying existentialist literature, [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3686.56s)]
*  I started reflecting on the absurdity of it all, [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3689.68s)]
*  I started to become present to the fact [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3691.56s)]
*  that these were just 64 squares and 32 pieces [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3692.88s)]
*  like I was spending my life studying this fucking box, [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3695.64s)]
*  wooden box, like the construct, the absurdity [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3698.72s)]
*  of being stuck in that construct became clear to me [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3700.92s)]
*  and then I was becoming more and more self-conscious [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3703.3199999999997s)]
*  about how what I was doing was perceived by others [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3706.38s)]
*  and I got lost in all of that and in many ways, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3710.04s)]
*  the journey, some people don't run into that [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3714.6s)]
*  for a long time, there are some chess players [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3717.68s)]
*  that just become insanely strong without ever reflecting [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3719.76s)]
*  on the absurdity of the fact that they're just playing chess [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3722.64s)]
*  and that's a great liberation, the moment you become aware [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3725.0s)]
*  of the fact that you're immortal, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3728.32s)]
*  that you can get your ass kicked, [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3729.44s)]
*  that your arm can break, that you can die, [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3730.28s)]
*  that what you're doing is absurd, [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3732.12s)]
*  you get locked up by that knowledge [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3733.2s)]
*  and there's so many different forms that can take [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3735.08s)]
*  or the moment you, for example, Boston Celtics, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3736.52s)]
*  you're hungering to win a world championship [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3740.0s)]
*  and then you win the NBA finals. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3741.68s)]
*  Suddenly everything changes, your relationship, [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3743.24s)]
*  your motivation changes, all the reasons you're doing it [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3745.24s)]
*  are no longer valid in some ways because now [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3748.2599999999998s)]
*  you've accomplished the thing you always dreamed of [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3750.72s)]
*  and you have to discover. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3752.2s)]
*  It's true in any form of competition or art, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3753.08s)]
*  in my experience, is that there comes a moment [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3755.8399999999997s)]
*  where someone's consciousness becomes more complicated [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3758.16s)]
*  and they can't just return to the innocence they had before [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3760.6s)]
*  because now you can't do that, [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3763.2799999999997s)]
*  you can't put it back in the box, it's out. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3764.3199999999997s)]
*  So then you have to work through that journey, [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3766.14s)]
*  which is a lot of what I did from my late teenage years [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3769.14s)]
*  leaving and studying philosophy [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3771.9s)]
*  and then moving into other fields [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3773.8199999999997s)]
*  and started relating to art in a way [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3775.98s)]
*  that was integrating that self-awareness, [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3778.7s)]
*  integrating that sense of mortality. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3781.3799999999997s)]
*  It's like when I, a very powerful example of this was [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3785.22s)]
*  I drowned in a pool, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3788.54s)]
*  I guess like nine, 10 years ago, [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3792.32s)]
*  I was doing hypoxic breath work, Wim Hof training [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3796.36s)]
*  in a pool. Jesus Christ. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3800.2400000000002s)]
*  And never do Wim Hof training, [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3801.44s)]
*  everybody please, in a pool [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3804.12s)]
*  because you're flushing the CO2 from your body, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3806.48s)]
*  but CO2 is what gives you the urge to breathe [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3809.52s)]
*  and so without carbon dioxide in your being, [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3811.32s)]
*  you don't feel the urge to breathe. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3813.92s)]
*  And I'd been a lifetime free diver, spearfishing [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3815.2000000000003s)]
*  from when I was five, six years old, [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3817.56s)]
*  but I was never doing hypoxic breath work before, [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3819.58s)]
*  free diving. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3821.94s)]
*  So if you're diving 80, 90, 100 feet, [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3822.7799999999997s)]
*  you're not flushing the CO2 from your body before you do so [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3824.1s)]
*  so you still have that sense for when you need to breathe [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3826.94s)]
*  but I was in a NYU pool, [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3829.74s)]
*  I was just swimming 50 meters, [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3831.74s)]
*  50 meters back and forth underwater [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3834.2999999999997s)]
*  and then doing this hypoxic breath work in between [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3835.7799999999997s)]
*  and then my last recollection is being stretched out [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3839.74s)]
*  in bliss that those tingles through your body you get from, [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3842.8999999999996s)]
*  have you done Wim Hof training? [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3845.5s)]
*  Yeah, those tingles, had those fucking tingles [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3847.1s)]
*  and then I woke up 30 minutes later, [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3849.94s)]
*  what happened was that I blacked out, [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3852.86s)]
*  I was in the bottom of the pool for over four minutes [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3855.06s)]
*  after blacking out from shallow water blackout. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3857.08s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3858.7000000000003s)]
*  It should be 45 seconds to a minute [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3860.1s)]
*  and you should be brain dead or dead [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3861.76s)]
*  because you're post shallow water blackout. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3863.2200000000003s)]
*  I know the time it was because there was an old man [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3865.42s)]
*  at the pool who saw me in the bottom of the pool [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3867.2200000000003s)]
*  and swam one lap and his laps were a little bit over a minute [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3869.58s)]
*  so I'm a second lap. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3873.66s)]
*  After his third lap he said, [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3874.7000000000003s)]
*  I'll check on him if he's still down. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3876.02s)]
*  He thought I was holding my breath [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3877.9s)]
*  but I was only holding my breath while swimming [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3878.86s)]
*  so if I was still I was fucking out. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3880.1800000000003s)]
*  His fourth lap, after his fourth lap he pulled me up, [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3881.9s)]
*  I was blue, my whole body was blue, my head was red, [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3884.84s)]
*  my body saved me, my training saved me and almost, [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3889.78s)]
*  and killed me, sent all the blood to my brain, [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3892.3s)]
*  my eyes were blown out red, [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3894.76s)]
*  like bloodshot for three weeks had followed [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3896.3s)]
*  and I remember waking up and having this, [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3899.1400000000003s)]
*  looking at everyone around me and like, [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3902.26s)]
*  what the fuck's everyone, what's going on guys? [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3903.54s)]
*  Like, what's the drama? [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3905.1800000000003s)]
*  I was the fucking drama. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3906.6600000000003s)]
*  And I spent that night in the hospital [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3909.78s)]
*  going through old chest variations, [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3911.5800000000004s)]
*  trying to like test my brain, is my brain ruined? [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3913.3s)]
*  Like, do I remember things? [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3915.9s)]
*  Somehow my brain, maybe it's fucked up [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3917.46s)]
*  but it seems like it'd be working pretty well. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3920.2200000000003s)]
*  And, but like I can't, [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3922.6600000000003s)]
*  and that was also a big part of me realizing [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3925.6600000000003s)]
*  I had to spend my life in the ocean [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3927.78s)]
*  because like I could feel the potential [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3929.3s)]
*  for some PTSD response, [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3930.7400000000002s)]
*  like I could actually feel the potential trauma response [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3933.2200000000003s)]
*  like a cloud that was washing over me. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3936.22s)]
*  Like I could see the cloud coming [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3939.3799999999997s)]
*  and I just fucking decided not to let it in. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3940.7799999999997s)]
*  And I got back in the water the next day. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3943.4599999999996s)]
*  And I just fucking, [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3946.3399999999997s)]
*  and I think that's a big part of my relationship [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3948.22s)]
*  with the ocean is having died in water. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3949.8999999999996s)]
*  I need to spend my life in the water. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3953.7s)]
*  Did you have any sort of out of body experience [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3955.22s)]
*  or anything where you were gone? [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3957.5s)]
*  What's really fucked up about it is no. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3959.3799999999997s)]
*  That's what's really wild. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3961.74s)]
*  It went just black. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3964.18s)]
*  That's what's crazy is that I went, [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3965.46s)]
*  my last memory is of just tingles and bliss [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3967.18s)]
*  and then waking up. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3972.22s)]
*  And so if I hadn't been pulled out, [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3973.8599999999997s)]
*  there would have been no flash, [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3976.2999999999997s)]
*  no seeing my life pass before my eyes, [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3978.54s)]
*  no tunnel on the other side, nothing. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3981.74s)]
*  You know what's really fucking wild though [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3984.3399999999997s)]
*  is that many years later, I was doing this, [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3985.7799999999997s)]
*  this guy Brandon Powell is a brilliant guy [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3989.6600000000003s)]
*  who's a top Wim Hof trainer [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3993.5800000000004s)]
*  and a trainer of trainers of his guys. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3997.46s)]
*  And I was doing some retreats with teams of mine [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=3999.26s)]
*  and we were doing some Wim Hof work. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4001.78s)]
*  And he had this methodology of kind of accelerated [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4003.98s)]
*  hypoxic work where that he said, [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4008.78s)]
*  I'm not sure if it's true, [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4011.3s)]
*  but he said release DMT in your body [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4012.1400000000003s)]
*  inhibited the DMT inhibitors in your body. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4013.7400000000002s)]
*  And I did these journeys with him twice [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4015.78s)]
*  through pure breath work, no psychedelics. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4018.1s)]
*  And I experienced these two times, months apart, [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4020.42s)]
*  I experienced one time, [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4025.22s)]
*  I experienced the center of my consciousness [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4027.46s)]
*  as my busted disc. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4029.22s)]
*  And I experienced the world [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4032.86s)]
*  through like the electrical connections [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4034.46s)]
*  emerging from my L4, L5. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4035.66s)]
*  It's very strange. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4038.06s)]
*  And the other one was the only memory I have of that. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4038.9s)]
*  And I'm not sure if this is accurate [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4042.5s)]
*  or some kind of illusion, [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4044.1s)]
*  but I saw the drowning experience from above, [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4046.66s)]
*  the whole thing. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4049.1s)]
*  I watched the 20 minutes that I was on the, [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4050.7799999999997s)]
*  that I was in the bottom of the pool [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4054.66s)]
*  and then up in 25 minutes and then on the pool deck. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4055.66s)]
*  And I saw the whole thing from above. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4058.3399999999997s)]
*  But that was like years after it happened. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4060.3799999999997s)]
*  That, so I can't explain that. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4062.8199999999997s)]
*  Were all the people there, the same people? [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4065.8199999999997s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4068.5s)]
*  My memory of it consciously from what actually happened [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4069.94s)]
*  is so fuzzy, right? [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4072.66s)]
*  Because I just died and came back. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4074.3799999999997s)]
*  And then I saw it from above. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4077.2200000000003s)]
*  I think I was mostly focused on the memory of myself. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4079.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so I relate to myself now. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4083.82s)]
*  Like I've died and I'm living. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4085.6600000000003s)]
*  And I live with a sense of gratitude and commitment. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4088.1800000000003s)]
*  That's a big part of why we moved to the jungle [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4093.42s)]
*  with my family. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4095.38s)]
*  It's like I emerged from that [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4096.22s)]
*  with a commitment to living life as beautifully [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4097.74s)]
*  and deeply and truly as I possibly could [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4099.54s)]
*  and to not let anything slip. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4102.54s)]
*  Just all in. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4107.22s)]
*  Isn't it fascinating that sometimes it takes, [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4108.06s)]
*  again, it's the same thing as loss propels you [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4109.66s)]
*  to a next level. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4112.22s)]
*  Even the moment in life where you realize [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4113.900000000001s)]
*  it all could just go away like that. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4117.58s)]
*  So fucking fast, instantly. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4120.34s)]
*  No warning, just gone. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4121.9400000000005s)]
*  No warning. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4123.38s)]
*  I've done so many stupid fucking things [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4125.06s)]
*  like in these extreme sports I've done. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4126.66s)]
*  So many times I almost died free diving. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4129.38s)]
*  But that one was different, man. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4133.18s)]
*  Because there was, like I didn't, [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4134.94s)]
*  it was just a, and the crazy thing was [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4136.099999999999s)]
*  it was a technical blind spot. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4137.74s)]
*  I just didn't know this thing about carbon dioxide. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4139.299999999999s)]
*  I didn't know I was taking a risk in that moment. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4142.379999999999s)]
*  I thought I was just taking a swim. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4143.98s)]
*  Did you learn from other people who do Wim Hof breathing [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4145.099999999999s)]
*  when they swim? [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4149.259999999999s)]
*  After or before? [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4151.139999999999s)]
*  No, before. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4152.46s)]
*  Oh yeah, no. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4153.299999999999s)]
*  Who taught you to do this? [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4154.139999999999s)]
*  Nobody. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4155.179999999999s)]
*  I did one Wim Hof breathing on land and I was like, [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4156.0199999999995s)]
*  you know, I'll fucking do it. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4157.62s)]
*  Oh boy. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4158.46s)]
*  I'll just do it fucking on the swim right now. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4159.299999999999s)]
*  Sounds like a great idea. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4161.0599999999995s)]
*  I think other people have done that and died. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4162.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they have. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4164.1s)]
*  And most people who die from shallow water blackout [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4164.9400000000005s)]
*  are highly trained Navy SEALs. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4167.22s)]
*  Because they're very good at inhibiting the urge to breathe [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4171.18s)]
*  but you can get too good at it. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4174.22s)]
*  Or you can just not feel it at all. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4176.46s)]
*  The ocean is such a fascinating thing. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4179.34s)]
*  It's so alive. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4182.06s)]
*  It's just a strange thing when you get in the ocean [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4184.58s)]
*  if you haven't been for a while. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4188.26s)]
*  You climb in and you feel it moving around you [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4189.700000000001s)]
*  and pulling and the water just feels different. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4192.5s)]
*  It feels like it's a living thing. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4195.38s)]
*  Like you're in a, you dunk your head under [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4197.62s)]
*  and you look at this world that's three quarters [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4200.1s)]
*  of the surface of the earth. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4202.66s)]
*  And it's so vibrant and you see people that are surfers [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4205.62s)]
*  that just get drawn into its spell [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4209.86s)]
*  and it just becomes a part of their life [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4212.98s)]
*  is to ride that energy and to feel it. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4214.7s)]
*  And the addiction that they get from it, [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4218.18s)]
*  guys like Laird, now guys like you. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4220.42s)]
*  I know so many people that they, like Jaco, [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4222.54s)]
*  he won't leave San Diego. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4225.42s)]
*  He doesn't even want to be in California, yes, [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4227.54s)]
*  but San Diego is the ocean for him. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4229.5s)]
*  He has to be by the ocean. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4232.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4233.54s)]
*  Yeah, and you can't dominate the ocean at all. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4234.78s)]
*  You have to receive her. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4237.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4238.5s)]
*  And if you have any brittleness in your ego [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4240.54s)]
*  she will kick your ass until you just blend. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4242.9400000000005s)]
*  I know you're in favor of optimizing trains [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4245.46s)]
*  and finding ways to learn things quicker. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4251.22s)]
*  Would wave surf pools, those crazy ones [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4254.3s)]
*  like Kelly Slater style wave surf pools, [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4256.820000000001s)]
*  where they have, that would give you way more reps, right? [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4259.54s)]
*  If you're surfing for sure, [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4263.02s)]
*  wave pools have revolutionized surf training [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4264.18s)]
*  because for foiling you have the ocean [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4266.820000000001s)]
*  and foiling is much more abundant. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4269.3s)]
*  Like the surf community is quite scarce in some ways [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4271.34s)]
*  because you have to, you can only surf [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4273.9400000000005s)]
*  in specific kinds of waves. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4275.860000000001s)]
*  And like if you're trying to make one turn [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4278.18s)]
*  you might not see that section again for two years. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4280.780000000001s)]
*  You can't replicate conditions in the ocean. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4282.780000000001s)]
*  Foiling you can because you can pump a foil, [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4284.820000000001s)]
*  you can drive it down, let it float back up [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4287.3s)]
*  and drive it down so you can, [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4288.860000000001s)]
*  or you can whip yourself behind a jet ski [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4290.820000000001s)]
*  into a certain kind of wave. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4292.5s)]
*  So if I want to work on like a certain turn [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4294.38s)]
*  I can get 40, 50 reps in a given day [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4296.780000000001s)]
*  while surfing pre-wave pool you couldn't at all. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4298.46s)]
*  So most great surfers I would, [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4301.46s)]
*  are brilliant low rep learners. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4303.9400000000005s)]
*  Because by necessity in the ocean [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4307.06s)]
*  you don't get tons of reps. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4308.9400000000005s)]
*  So in my observation, [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4310.900000000001s)]
*  the greatest like competitive surfers in the world [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4312.14s)]
*  are excellent at learning from one or two reps [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4314.26s)]
*  like Marcelo Garcia is on the mats. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4315.820000000001s)]
*  I'm not naturally a great low rep learner, [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4319.38s)]
*  I'm a higher rep learner. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4321.7s)]
*  Foiling is, one could say it's more technically complex [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4322.900000000001s)]
*  than surfing because it's everything that surfing is [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4328.14s)]
*  but also you have a foil which has lift dynamics [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4330.34s)]
*  and a tail and you can change the foil shape, [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4332.38s)]
*  the tail shape, [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4335.14s)]
*  if you change the angle of attack on your tail [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4335.9800000000005s)]
*  by a quarter degree it changes the whole feel of everything. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4339.700000000001s)]
*  It's super technical. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4342.26s)]
*  And so many ways one could argue that it's harder, [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4345.18s)]
*  I wouldn't say, not that it's harder, [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4349.1s)]
*  any of these arts are infinitely deep [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4350.38s)]
*  because you can refine anything forever. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4352.740000000001s)]
*  But it's more technical shit to deal with [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4354.9800000000005s)]
*  but it's more trainable [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4356.820000000001s)]
*  because you can replicate conditions. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4358.9800000000005s)]
*  Like you now can in wave pools. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4361.5s)]
*  Wave pools for surfers now, [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4363.5s)]
*  you can hit the same section 30, 40 times. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4364.66s)]
*  So I do think it's incredible. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4367.62s)]
*  But the interesting thing is that most surfers [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4369.5s)]
*  of this generation aren't, [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4372.18s)]
*  they don't train in the same way that chess players do [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4375.26s)]
*  or jujitsu fighters do because it's a low rep art [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4378.7s)]
*  that you can't replicate conditions in. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4381.38s)]
*  So surfers aren't, most surfers aren't constructed [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4382.66s)]
*  psychologically in a way that they will take advantage [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4385.98s)]
*  of wave pools the way a jujitsu guy would. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4388.34s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4391.66s)]
*  Like drilling, like you drill. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4392.5s)]
*  Psychologically, that's interesting [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4393.34s)]
*  because they're accustomed to just taking [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4394.94s)]
*  what the ocean gives you. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4396.58s)]
*  You can't just take a low rep learner [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4397.86s)]
*  and tell them to live like a high rep learner. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4399.14s)]
*  It's a different fucking thing. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4401.66s)]
*  Right. Right? [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4402.86s)]
*  And it's very interesting to me that, [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4403.94s)]
*  so surfers crossing over to foiling is very interesting [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4406.22s)]
*  because they, a lot of surfers, [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4408.74s)]
*  some surfers do it and they just, they're all in [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4410.54s)]
*  and they want to take it on. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4412.94s)]
*  A lot of the best surfers in the world are crossing over. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4413.98s)]
*  But it's a different lifestyle. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4416.38s)]
*  The ones who cross over, [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4417.3s)]
*  the ones who can embrace the high rep training life. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4418.14s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4420.7s)]
*  The one who can adapt. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4421.86s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4423.0199999999995s)]
*  That's the low rep training thing with surfing [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4424.46s)]
*  I'd never really considered, but that doesn't make sense. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4426.86s)]
*  You have to be able to optimize. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4428.66s)]
*  You have to be able to take advantage [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4430.099999999999s)]
*  of each one of those things and pick it up pretty quickly. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4431.42s)]
*  You have to. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4434.98s)]
*  Especially in the early, [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4435.82s)]
*  think about like learning as a kid [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4436.98s)]
*  and then like everything you're exposed to, [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4438.74s)]
*  the ocean's always moving, always changing. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4441.38s)]
*  But if you can like learn from one rep and burn it in, [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4442.98s)]
*  then that just, well, in jujitsu, for example, [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4446.5s)]
*  you can say, I'm going to drill this arm bar [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4450.9400000000005s)]
*  40 times today, 40 times like this afternoon, [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4452.9400000000005s)]
*  hundreds of times, thousands of times [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4456.7s)]
*  over the next two weeks, right? [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4458.02s)]
*  So you can get as many reps as you need. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4459.58s)]
*  It's not true in the ocean. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4461.54s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4462.5s)]
*  Yeah. It totally makes sense. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4463.7s)]
*  Why do you think that children learn quicker than adults? [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4465.3s)]
*  Yeah. Beautiful question. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4469.14s)]
*  I think it's, I think a lot about unlearning, right? [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4470.900000000001s)]
*  So my life's work is in learning [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4474.38s)]
*  and I think a lot about unlearning [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4475.900000000001s)]
*  because so much of what high level learning is, [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4477.54s)]
*  is being unblocked, which is getting rid of the blocks, [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4479.78s)]
*  the egoic blocks, the false constructs we have, [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4483.900000000001s)]
*  the fucking bullshit we put on everything we do, [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4486.26s)]
*  trying to control the situation. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4489.7s)]
*  We should just embrace the lack of, [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4491.1s)]
*  children don't have to unlearn that. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4492.860000000001s)]
*  They haven't learned it in the first place. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4494.22s)]
*  So they're unblocked. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4495.900000000001s)]
*  Like my little boy, Charlie, [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4496.74s)]
*  learning how to surf was so beautiful to watch. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4497.860000000001s)]
*  He just like, he grew up in the ocean. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4500.06s)]
*  He grew up in the jungle and ocean [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4503.66s)]
*  and he just from a young age was swimming and tumbling [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4504.900000000001s)]
*  and we made a game of tumbling. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4507.54s)]
*  And then when he first got on a surfboard, [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4509.34s)]
*  it was like, it wasn't, we didn't make it technical. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4511.18s)]
*  It wasn't like he should telling him what to do. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4514.34s)]
*  It was like, he could be right foot forward [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4517.74s)]
*  or left foot forward. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4518.86s)]
*  We didn't impose things on him. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4520.18s)]
*  He just like danced on the board and would find his way. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4522.3s)]
*  And he started doing things that were very technical [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4525.38s)]
*  that he would just create. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4527.14s)]
*  It was pure playfulness. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4528.3s)]
*  Well, if you watch people come to a surf, [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4529.86s)]
*  like a surf break, who are like New Yorkers [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4531.98s)]
*  who traveled down for five days [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4533.98s)]
*  and they've got all this gear. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4535.62s)]
*  The gear is amazing. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4537.06s)]
*  They've got like gloves and booties and knee guards [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4537.900000000001s)]
*  and like everything is covered, white face. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4540.740000000001s)]
*  Everything is just like not a part of their body [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4543.1s)]
*  is designed to touch the ocean. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4545.3s)]
*  They're trying to keep the ocean away. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4546.740000000001s)]
*  And they're like, they wanna be super controlling [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4548.26s)]
*  about everything they learn. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4550.5s)]
*  They're like, everything is so regimented in their minds, [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4551.54s)]
*  but they're trying to control their relationship [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4554.46s)]
*  with the ocean. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4556.3s)]
*  But the way to learn on the ocean is to not control it, [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4557.38s)]
*  to embrace it, to listen to it, to observe it, [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4559.780000000001s)]
*  to feel it, to like let it envelop you, right? [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4562.1s)]
*  Kids will just play. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4565.62s)]
*  They're not afraid of failing. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4567.0199999999995s)]
*  The moment a kid becomes afraid of looking bad, [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4570.099999999999s)]
*  like you see that wash over kids [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4572.78s)]
*  when they're like nine, 10, 11, 12, some different ages, [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4574.34s)]
*  and they become, oh, they don't wanna fall. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4577.86s)]
*  They don't wanna look bad. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4580.42s)]
*  And then that's when they get locked up. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4581.3s)]
*  The freedom of, I mean, to me, a lot of what the beacon is [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4583.66s)]
*  as adults is being the post-conscious, [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4589.0599999999995s)]
*  discovering the post-conscious freedom as a learner. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4594.620000000001s)]
*  How can we learn without the ego blocks, right? [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4597.18s)]
*  Without having to look good. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4600.1s)]
*  So if you're crossing over, [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4600.9800000000005s)]
*  like if you're a world-class striker [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4601.9400000000005s)]
*  and you're getting on the jujitsu mats [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4603.820000000001s)]
*  and you're getting your ass kicked. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4604.820000000001s)]
*  Or if you're a great jujitsu fighter [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4606.1s)]
*  and you get onto an MMA gym [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4607.1s)]
*  and suddenly the guys can just beat the shit out of you. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4608.1s)]
*  Like having, or a great surfer switching over to foiling, [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4610.1s)]
*  or a great chess player moving into the martial arts. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4613.42s)]
*  So you're a fucking, or if you're like training [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4615.38s)]
*  in some esoteric Chinese martial art like I was, [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4617.34s)]
*  and then you're moving to the jujitsu mats, [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4619.9800000000005s)]
*  you might have some ego, [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4621.660000000001s)]
*  but you're just tapping out to everybody, [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4622.5s)]
*  all the time, right? [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4623.88s)]
*  And like having the freedom to learn without ego blocks is, [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4625.4400000000005s)]
*  and I actually think that culturally, [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4630.68s)]
*  this is one of the most important things [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4632.64s)]
*  that we need to cultivate [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4634.6s)]
*  because we're living in a world now [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4635.68s)]
*  where the pace of technological disruption [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4637.92s)]
*  is accelerating so fast. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4640.0s)]
*  I know you've done a bunch of explorations on this [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4641.8s)]
*  with Tristan Harris and others [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4644.6s)]
*  in terms of what AI is bringing to society. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4648.28s)]
*  And it's been a big focus of mine for many, many years. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4650.52s)]
*  And it's an area where I'm working. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4654.68s)]
*  I think that we are going to be living in a world [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4656.56s)]
*  where AI is better at everything than we are, right? [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4660.0s)]
*  So if you think about it in the context of chess, [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4665.34s)]
*  I grew up in the world of where chess was crossing over [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4668.4800000000005s)]
*  into the computer realm. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4671.200000000001s)]
*  So computers are first, like I began playing chess [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4672.4800000000005s)]
*  in the pre-computer era, computer chess era. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4674.8s)]
*  Then computers entered, [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4677.26s)]
*  and I initially was very resistant and romantic to it. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4678.72s)]
*  And I remember at 19, I started developing Chessmaster, [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4682.320000000001s)]
*  this computer chess program, [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4686.4400000000005s)]
*  and I developed this academy of mine [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4687.4400000000005s)]
*  for the next 10 years that followed, [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4689.52s)]
*  teaching the human side of chess through computers. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4690.76s)]
*  But when they first approached me, [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4693.080000000001s)]
*  I didn't want to do it [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4694.400000000001s)]
*  because I felt like it was going to disrupt. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4695.240000000001s)]
*  It was going to kill the beauty of human chess, [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4697.4400000000005s)]
*  the art of chess, which is so much about imperfection. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4700.080000000001s)]
*  But like chess players, when I grew up, [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4704.0s)]
*  had to sit in the unknowing, [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4706.0199999999995s)]
*  in tolerance, they had to have a tolerance [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4708.339999999999s)]
*  of cognitive dissonance. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4710.339999999999s)]
*  You might, I might study a chess position [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4711.66s)]
*  and go three months without knowing what the solution is. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4713.5s)]
*  Right, so our psychologies had to be constructed [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4716.179999999999s)]
*  so that we could sit in cognitive and emotional dissonance [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4718.62s)]
*  for long, long periods of time, days, weeks, months, [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4721.259999999999s)]
*  sometimes years. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4724.179999999999s)]
*  Now chess players can click on a button [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4725.0199999999995s)]
*  and they've got a supercomputer right by their side. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4727.259999999999s)]
*  We'll tell them the answer instantly. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4729.139999999999s)]
*  It's interesting to think about [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4731.099999999999s)]
*  how different that is psychologically [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4732.0599999999995s)]
*  and the different kinds of people that that draws in. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4733.5s)]
*  But what happened then is that you had Deep Blue [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4736.18s)]
*  enter the game like supercomputers. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4739.6s)]
*  And then you had the movement of AI entering into chess. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4741.1s)]
*  And we had AlphaGo and then AlphaZero, [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4743.98s)]
*  which came out of DeepMind. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4747.58s)]
*  So Demis Hacibus was the developer of DeepMind. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4748.74s)]
*  He was a child of chess friend of mine. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4750.74s)]
*  So Demis and I from age 11 on were good friends. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4752.6s)]
*  And we had dialogue about the birth of DeepMind, [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4756.1s)]
*  which was this AI company he began. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4758.46s)]
*  And then he developed AlphaGo and AlphaZero. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4760.18s)]
*  And to give a feel for what AlphaZero did in chess, [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4762.54s)]
*  AlphaZero was able to, [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4766.14s)]
*  without being taught anything about humans playing chess, [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4767.38s)]
*  no education of the history of human chess playing, [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4770.820000000001s)]
*  within three hours of experimentation [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4773.38s)]
*  was stronger than any human or computer in history. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4774.92s)]
*  So imagine your life's work. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4777.58s)]
*  Like, I was a pretty good chess player. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4779.38s)]
*  Right, like someone like Magnus Carlsen [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4782.1s)]
*  is a much, much stronger chess player. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4783.38s)]
*  He's a world champion. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4784.62s)]
*  Gary Kasparov, Anatoly Karpov, Bobby Fischer. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4785.900000000001s)]
*  Think about people who are world champions. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4788.820000000001s)]
*  AlphaZero within three hours of experimentation, [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4790.42s)]
*  without being taught anything, was stronger than them. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4793.66s)]
*  Right, so like we really need to, [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4796.34s)]
*  so the strongest AI engine in the world today [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4797.9s)]
*  is rated 3,700 ELO. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4800.86s)]
*  So to give a sense for what that means, [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4803.2s)]
*  when I was nine years old, [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4804.6s)]
*  my rating was like 1,900 or so, right? [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4806.58s)]
*  Magnus Carlsen, like the strongest, [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4809.38s)]
*  the strongest human players in the world now [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4812.58s)]
*  are rated somewhere about 2,800, 2,850-ish ELO. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4814.3s)]
*  The strongest AI is 3,700 ELO. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4818.14s)]
*  So just like the absurdity of the fact, [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4820.9800000000005s)]
*  the gap between like a strong nine-year-old [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4822.740000000001s)]
*  and the human world champion is the same ELO gap [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4825.14s)]
*  as between the world champion and the strongest AI. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4828.700000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4831.22s)]
*  It gets so hard for us to really wrap our heads around [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4832.06s)]
*  what that means. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4834.22s)]
*  That means that everything, [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4835.660000000001s)]
*  like chess players had a front row seat [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4837.46s)]
*  to that happening early. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4838.900000000001s)]
*  When I listened to some of your dialogues with these guys, [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4840.54s)]
*  and I could feel you and them trying to grapple with like, [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4844.400000000001s)]
*  how to communicate what it means [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4846.94s)]
*  to have these insanely powerful intelligences in the world. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4849.54s)]
*  And I think that like, [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4856.5s)]
*  if you can imagine like an art like chess, [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4858.379999999999s)]
*  having millennia of development, [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4860.599999999999s)]
*  people studying it like you train jujitsu, right? [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4862.139999999999s)]
*  So imagine people's training 10 hours a day for 30, 40 years, [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4864.139999999999s)]
*  being the greatest human in the world at it. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4867.74s)]
*  And then something can come in [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4869.78s)]
*  and within three hours of experimentation, [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4871.099999999999s)]
*  be much stronger than them. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4872.58s)]
*  And imagine that's gonna be in fucking everything. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4873.82s)]
*  Nuts. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4876.14s)]
*  Right? [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4876.9800000000005s)]
*  So like, we have to be like children in how we learn. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4877.8s)]
*  We're gonna have to like release the egoic relationship [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4882.14s)]
*  that we have to our level, [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4885.62s)]
*  to our knowledge, to everything. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4889.06s)]
*  One of the great, [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4891.14s)]
*  you know Thomas Kuhn's structure of scientific revolutions? [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4893.3s)]
*  Yes. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4895.38s)]
*  Right, so like you think about what happens, [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4896.22s)]
*  what the human has to do to the internal resistance [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4898.700000000001s)]
*  we have to overcome to embrace the new paradigm. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4901.84s)]
*  So let's say you're a Newtonian physicist, right? [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4904.1s)]
*  You've been studying physics your whole life. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4906.42s)]
*  You've got tenure. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4907.259999999999s)]
*  You've got 40, 50 years of knowledge built up. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4908.099999999999s)]
*  Everyone reveres you. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4910.0599999999995s)]
*  And now there's this new thing, [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4911.179999999999s)]
*  quantum mechanics enters the picture, right? [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4912.7s)]
*  Like to embrace this new thing is to admit to oneself [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4914.96s)]
*  and everybody else that your life's work is, [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4919.98s)]
*  kind of you have to release it. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4923.94s)]
*  It's wrong, it's old, right? [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4924.78s)]
*  This new paradigm is, [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4926.099999999999s)]
*  but we resist it individually. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4927.66s)]
*  Ego. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4929.58s)]
*  Ego and societally, right? [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4930.42s)]
*  Because we will fight tooth and nail [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4932.94s)]
*  to maintain our conceptual schemes. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4934.179999999999s)]
*  That's one of our strongest drivers of all humans, right? [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4936.38s)]
*  And so I think we're moving into a world now [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4938.94s)]
*  where you're gonna have 37, 3,800 ELO rated everything. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4941.9s)]
*  Kicking our ass at everything. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4948.18s)]
*  So we have to become like children [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4949.46s)]
*  to go back to your question, in my opinion, [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4951.16s)]
*  and how we relate to learning, right? [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4953.3s)]
*  We can't, decision making, right? [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4955.42s)]
*  Like when we think about like social media, [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4957.22s)]
*  imagine a 3,800 ELO rated network. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4961.0599999999995s)]
*  Imagine a million networked, [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4964.5s)]
*  3,800 ELO rated super intelligences [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4967.22s)]
*  utilizing everything that they can gather about you [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4971.54s)]
*  on social media to manipulate you [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4973.74s)]
*  to do whatever it wants or whoever is controlling it wants. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4976.7s)]
*  It can have you do anything. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4981.12s)]
*  But we have to like, it's so hard for us to admit [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4983.9s)]
*  that we are the ant relative to the human, right? [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4987.9s)]
*  Like we are the ant. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4991.18s)]
*  We have to have that humility. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4992.3s)]
*  And one of the things that, [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4994.34s)]
*  I think that that's the most important question today [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=4997.26s)]
*  as that we face as a species is like, what do we do? [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5000.06s)]
*  Well, we won't know until it happens [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5004.22s)]
*  and we will become a different thing. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5007.18s)]
*  We will have to admit that we are no longer [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5010.14s)]
*  the apex intelligence on the planet. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5013.2s)]
*  We will have something that's akin [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5016.16s)]
*  to an artificial life form that's far superior to us [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5018.54s)]
*  in reasoning, access to resources, logic. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5022.58s)]
*  It'll be far more technically proficient. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5027.0199999999995s)]
*  It'll make far better versions of itself [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5029.5s)]
*  probably pretty quickly. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5031.38s)]
*  They've already seen AI's duplicating itself. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5033.34s)]
*  It's not being prompted to do this. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5037.3s)]
*  But when you say we don't, I mean, I would argue [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5039.48s)]
*  we should operate as if it's already happening. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5041.64s)]
*  It's an inability. It is. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5044.26s)]
*  So it is happening, but it hasn't [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5045.1s)]
*  completely transformed life yet. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5047.14s)]
*  Right. It's emerging right now. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5049.42s)]
*  It's about to. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5051.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's a god. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5052.1s)]
*  It's a god that's emerging. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5053.26s)]
*  And if it's not a god yet, it'll be a god in 50 years. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5054.700000000001s)]
*  It just is, it's going to be attached to quantum computing. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5058.18s)]
*  It's going to figure out ways to implement better strategies [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5062.02s)]
*  for utilization of energy resources. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5066.06s)]
*  It'll be much better at everything than we are. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5069.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5072.58s)]
*  And then the question is, will it be used to manipulate us? [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5073.5s)]
*  Will it be used to control populations? [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5076.34s)]
*  Will it be, Elon says his estimation is as there's an 80 [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5078.34s)]
*  to 90% chance it'll have a radically positive impact [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5083.54s)]
*  on society at large. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5088.3s)]
*  That 90% likelihood that it'll radically improve [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5090.9400000000005s)]
*  the quality of everyone's life. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5096.7s)]
*  But then there's 20 or 10% that it will not. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5099.58s)]
*  And that will be imprisoned. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5103.56s)]
*  This is like 10% possibility of the matrix. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5105.54s)]
*  90% possibility of a technologically inspired utopia. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5109.74s)]
*  My feeling about it is that, I mean, [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5114.82s)]
*  there are places where it's going to be incredibly, [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5116.66s)]
*  it's going to be beautiful. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5118.74s)]
*  Like just how computer chess raised the level [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5119.62s)]
*  of human chess game, chess players. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5123.9400000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5126.78s)]
*  And now AI chess has made chess players much, much stronger. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5127.62s)]
*  And part of it is because great chess players [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5133.62s)]
*  are partially great because they have had, [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5136.9s)]
*  they're excellent at knowing where not to look. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5140.42s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5143.42s)]
*  Great chess players don't actually look at more, [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5144.26s)]
*  they look at less, [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5145.3s)]
*  but they look in the most potent directions. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5146.14s)]
*  And what's fascinating is that AI entering the picture [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5148.86s)]
*  has forced really strong chess players to unlearn [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5152.9s)]
*  where they've been correct to learn not to look. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5156.46s)]
*  So in other words, areas where they were well-trained [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5160.86s)]
*  not to look because humans couldn't play those positions. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5163.46s)]
*  AI can now play those positions. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5167.139999999999s)]
*  And actually those are the right positions to play. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5169.0599999999995s)]
*  They're the objectively correct positions to play. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5170.58s)]
*  But now humans studying with an AI [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5172.98s)]
*  can be much better at playing those positions. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5174.58s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5176.94s)]
*  And so, like, for example, [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5177.78s)]
*  I'm working on this fascinating project [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5178.599999999999s)]
*  called Lila Science, [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5181.7s)]
*  which is focused on combining cutting edge science, [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5182.639999999999s)]
*  the best scientists in the world and cutting edge AI, [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5185.219999999999s)]
*  to try to have huge breakthroughs [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5187.74s)]
*  in material science and life sciences. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5190.099999999999s)]
*  And now that can only be done, in my opinion, [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5193.34s)]
*  with just best, best, best in class safety practices. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5195.66s)]
*  And in my view, that involves having a higher level AI [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5199.66s)]
*  running safety than you have running the actual science. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5204.7s)]
*  When you say safety, like, what are you referring to? [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5208.0199999999995s)]
*  Making sure that we don't do, that doesn't go wild, [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5210.26s)]
*  that you don't create things that get out there [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5215.54s)]
*  that could be terribly destructive. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5217.9400000000005s)]
*  I think that the part of the AI race that's happening [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5219.54s)]
*  is that people are driven by ego, [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5223.1s)]
*  and there's like a game theory of a race going on. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5225.900000000001s)]
*  And when you have a race, [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5229.66s)]
*  everyone's just running as fast as they can, [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5230.58s)]
*  but they're not, if they slow down to think about what's safe, [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5233.34s)]
*  they might fall behind in the race. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5235.9800000000005s)]
*  And I believe ethically, if we're in the AI scene at all, [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5238.04s)]
*  then we must be developing safety practices [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5243.28s)]
*  that are making it responsible. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5245.8s)]
*  That's a very logical perspective. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5247.5199999999995s)]
*  Unfortunately, we are in a race, [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5249.5199999999995s)]
*  and that's where it gets weird, right? [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5251.46s)]
*  And because we're not just in a race in America. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5253.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5255.5199999999995s)]
*  We're in a race internationally. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5256.36s)]
*  And the consequences of losing the race are grave. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5257.44s)]
*  It's akin to the consequences of losing [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5262.12s)]
*  the Manhattan Project, of not coming to the bomb the first, [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5264.6s)]
*  not being the first to implement a bomb, [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5270.0s)]
*  which is really crazy to think. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5272.36s)]
*  But I think it's that on steroids. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5274.44s)]
*  I think it's the Manhattan Project on steroids, [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5276.759999999999s)]
*  because I think it has the, [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5278.5599999999995s)]
*  if used in the wrong way, [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5281.36s)]
*  it has the possibility of completely imprisoning society. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5283.28s)]
*  All you'd have to do is lock down resources, [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5288.74s)]
*  food, power, electricity, everything. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5290.5199999999995s)]
*  And you've put society at a complete halt. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5293.719999999999s)]
*  If you can figure out a way to completely disable grids [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5297.48s)]
*  and every car has a computer in it now, [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5301.08s)]
*  most cars are connected to Wi-Fi. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5304.88s)]
*  It's most new ones have at least an option to connect to. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5306.86s)]
*  There's a way that someone can connect to your car. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5309.6s)]
*  And this is crazy. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5312.46s)]
*  In phones, everyone's reliant completely on your phone. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5315.32s)]
*  There's AI in your phone now. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5318.64s)]
*  Who knows what could happen if that got hijacked? [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5320.8s)]
*  There's a guy named Robert Epstein, [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5323.5599999999995s)]
*  who spent a lot of time analyzing [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5325.44s)]
*  what the impact of curated searches can do [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5328.48s)]
*  to presidential elections, to public opinion on things, [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5334.639999999999s)]
*  and that when you're getting a search [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5338.599999999999s)]
*  where you're using Google or some of these search engines, [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5340.96s)]
*  you're getting curated search results. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5343.919999999999s)]
*  If you look for specific political opinions, [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5346.4s)]
*  political positions, you will get a curated result [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5350.299999999999s)]
*  that is oftentimes skewed in whatever ideology, [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5354.82s)]
*  towards whatever ideology the people that programmed it, [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5359.299999999999s)]
*  they're aligned with. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5363.94s)]
*  So if you Google something about Donald Trump, [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5364.78s)]
*  you will have as many negative responses [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5367.74s)]
*  they could possibly throw to the front of the line. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5370.78s)]
*  It will take you page after page after page [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5373.28s)]
*  to find what you're looking for, [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5375.98s)]
*  but you'll be confronted immediately with negative stuff. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5377.54s)]
*  Now, if you're a person that's in the middle [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5380.78s)]
*  and maybe a person that's undecided [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5382.78s)]
*  in an electoral process, in an electoral race, [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5385.3s)]
*  you can be swayed in a significant manner, [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5388.94s)]
*  and he estimates it's as high as 30 to 50% [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5392.2s)]
*  of the people that are on the fence, [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5396.3s)]
*  that are sort of undecided voters, [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5398.54s)]
*  can be swayed by search result engines, [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5401.719999999999s)]
*  which is kind of crazy. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5404.0199999999995s)]
*  And that's just an algorithm. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5405.62s)]
*  That's just something that they've devised. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5408.7s)]
*  This is not like a purposeful changing of narratives [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5410.14s)]
*  in order to implement whatever strategy [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5415.34s)]
*  they think would be the best for them financially, [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5418.780000000001s)]
*  whether it's a central bank digital currency [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5421.54s)]
*  or a social credit score system or something, [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5424.18s)]
*  where they could completely control behavior [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5426.660000000001s)]
*  and have your behavior locked up to your bank account, [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5429.700000000001s)]

*  your ability to travel. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5434.64s)]

*  If AI can be, if someone figures out the best version of AI [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5439.7s)]
*  that can traverse these boundaries that we have [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5445.14s)]
*  with encryption and with grids and computer systems [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5448.14s)]
*  and just completely lock everything down, we're fucked. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5452.06s)]
*  Yeah, that's why I don't, you know, [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5456.38s)]
*  when I hear people say things like that, 80 to 90% positive, [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5457.9400000000005s)]
*  I feel like they're jumping to the destination [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5462.02s)]
*  without thinking about the journey to it, [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5465.9800000000005s)]
*  because the journey to it is gonna involve [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5468.3s)]
*  so much disruption, so much pain, so much chaos. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5470.38s)]
*  And I think what you just said about grids [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5472.860000000001s)]
*  and everything is true. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5474.22s)]
*  I mean, you think about how many people had the ability [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5475.06s)]
*  to disrupt in that way 15 years ago, [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5478.1s)]
*  handful of countries, right? [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5480.7s)]
*  Now it's gonna be hundreds of thousands [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5482.3s)]
*  or millions of individuals [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5485.1s)]
*  who just have access to super coders, right? [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5486.42s)]
*  And so how could it be 80 to 90% positive [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5489.7s)]
*  when there's just gonna be limitless humans [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5492.7s)]
*  who have the ability to disrupt armed [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5496.56s)]
*  with 3,800 ELO rated coders [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5499.120000000001s)]
*  that can do anything you want, hackers? [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5502.8s)]
*  It's just like insane. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5505.240000000001s)]
*  In the hands of broken people. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5506.52s)]
*  It's much easier to destroy than to create, right? [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5507.76s)]
*  You can create for thousands of years [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5510.0s)]
*  and you destroy instantly, right? [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5511.4800000000005s)]
*  So it only takes one terribly destructive act [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5513.320000000001s)]
*  or a handful of them to overcome all the positive. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5515.400000000001s)]
*  I don't believe that that 80, 90% thing is right. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5518.4800000000005s)]
*  I think that there are areas like science [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5522.360000000001s)]
*  where we could easily create materials [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5524.4s)]
*  that could have a massively positive impact on the climate. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5527.08s)]
*  We could have life science breakthroughs [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5530.2s)]
*  that eliminate cancer, eliminate diseases, [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5532.12s)]
*  make the human lifespan hundreds of years. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5534.2s)]
*  I think those things could happen, which is great. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5536.16s)]
*  I also think that we could be manipulated [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5538.24s)]
*  into doing increasingly destructive things [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5540.12s)]
*  and we could have horrific things happen like the grid. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5543.96s)]
*  You know, there's a guy who was very brilliant [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5549.12s)]
*  in the espionage world years ago who said to me, [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5552.0s)]
*  he said to me, you know, he's someone who would know. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5554.68s)]
*  And he said, you know, Josh, what you don't realize is [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5558.16s)]
*  a strong AI, and this was years ago, [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5564.88s)]
*  armed with the information [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5567.32s)]
*  that the social media companies have about you [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5571.0s)]
*  could convince 99% of Americans to move to Alaska [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5573.52s)]
*  or Antarctica or anywhere within two weeks easily. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5577.4s)]
*  I mean, just like, it's so hard to have the humility [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5580.0s)]
*  that we are the ant relative to the human, right? [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5583.0s)]
*  If you have a 3,800 ELO, I'm just using that, [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5588.0s)]
*  Raided Intelligence trying to manipulate you [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5591.36s)]
*  and it's armed with everything. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5593.24s)]
*  I mean, humans can manipulate you [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5594.96s)]
*  with what's on social media. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5596.36s)]
*  Yeah, with a British accent and infomercial. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5598.16s)]
*  Yeah, no problem. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5600.04s)]
*  Show some leg, you're gone. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5601.16s)]
*  I mean, it's just so hard to have the, [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5603.4s)]
*  so we have to have the human intelligence [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5606.4s)]
*  so we have to have the real humility [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5609.5199999999995s)]
*  that we are manipulatable. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5611.92s)]
*  And a super intelligence, which is out there, [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5614.08s)]
*  and there are humans controlling the super intelligence [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5616.24s)]
*  so far, maybe that will end. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5618.639999999999s)]
*  So I personally feel, I know, [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5620.84s)]
*  everyone should get the fuck off social media. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5622.76s)]
*  I just think it's, I think that's the most important thing [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5625.44s)]
*  because everything that we're feeding in, [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5628.28s)]
*  I've never been on social media. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5630.32s)]
*  I made that decision a long time ago. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5631.36s)]
*  Really, when did you make it? [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5632.599999999999s)]
*  I was never on it. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5633.8s)]
*  I made it when first, I remember when like, [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5634.8s)]
*  MySpace came out. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5636.639999999999s)]
*  What did you think at the time? [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5638.56s)]
*  I was like, fuck that. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5639.92s)]
*  Really? [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5641.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5642.240000000001s)]
*  I didn't, it felt off to me. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5644.200000000001s)]
*  It felt like something I didn't wanna be involved with. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5647.360000000001s)]
*  I didn't, I'm not saying that I was prescient [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5649.04s)]
*  and I saw everything that would happen, [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5651.4400000000005s)]
*  but I never, there was some people [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5653.200000000001s)]
*  who were impersonating me on social media, [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5654.72s)]
*  but I was never on any form of social media. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5657.080000000001s)]
*  And- [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5659.52s)]
*  Good for you. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5660.96s)]
*  Yeah, I mean- [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5661.8s)]
*  I'm on everything but TikTok. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5663.240000000001s)]
*  TikTok is fucked, it's hilarious. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5665.200000000001s)]
*  When I was flying here, [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5667.320000000001s)]
*  I was listening to your conversation with Tristan Harris [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5668.4800000000005s)]
*  while the dude next to me was scrolling TikTok on the plane. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5672.0s)]
*  And it was amazing listening to this dialogue here [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5676.12s)]
*  and watching him just like- [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5678.56s)]
*  Watching it happen at the same time. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5680.0s)]
*  An hour and a half straight, just like, [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5680.84s)]
*  whomp whomp, it was incredible. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5682.240000000001s)]
*  I've never actually seen someone fucking do that. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5683.92s)]
*  It was the most brainless thing I've ever seen in my life. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5686.08s)]
*  It's so brainless and so addictive. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5688.400000000001s)]
*  And so manipulative. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5690.4400000000005s)]
*  Like it can just guide you to anything you find. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5691.400000000001s)]
*  But why don't we, [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5695.36s)]
*  it's one thing I kind of disagreed with you on this talk, [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5696.96s)]
*  where you were saying that you just don't think [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5699.0s)]
*  that humans are going to do anything about it [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5701.48s)]
*  until we're forced to. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5703.799999999999s)]
*  But I don't know, man. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5705.08s)]
*  I think that what if we just wake the fuck up [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5706.599999999999s)]
*  and take ourselves off of this thing [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5709.679999999999s)]
*  that can be used to steer us anywhere [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5712.08s)]
*  this other humans or AI wants to steer us? [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5715.08s)]
*  Like, why don't we just remove ourselves from it? [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5718.639999999999s)]
*  Well, that's a very rational perspective. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5720.599999999999s)]
*  Let's just fucking do it though. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5722.24s)]
*  But most people aren't rational. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5723.08s)]
*  But why don't we help people be rational? [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5723.92s)]
*  And just, you have to fuck off it. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5725.76s)]
*  You have to change the whole way they interface with life. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5726.6s)]
*  And that's a big ask. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5732.88s)]
*  It's not as simple as logically, [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5734.88s)]
*  social media's bad for you, I'll stay off. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5737.84s)]
*  The small dopamine hit that you get from opening up reels, [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5740.6s)]
*  just scrolling through and seeing people get knocked out [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5744.84s)]
*  and car accidents and big boobs, [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5748.04s)]
*  that is, for whatever reason, [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5750.6s)]
*  much more compelling than the idea of possessing autonomy [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5752.96s)]
*  and the idea of having the ability [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5757.64s)]
*  to completely remove yourself [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5762.76s)]
*  from the thing that everyone's addicted to, [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5766.240000000001s)]
*  which is likes and engagement and getting an outrage, [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5768.4800000000005s)]
*  the algorithm showing you things [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5773.160000000001s)]
*  over and over again that outrage you. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5774.88s)]
*  It's so compelling to people [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5777.08s)]
*  when we're so averse to being bored [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5779.0s)]
*  that at any time when nothing's going on, [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5781.28s)]
*  you pick up your phone, you start scrolling. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5783.08s)]
*  At any time, you just get nonsense [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5785.2s)]
*  just fed into your head at any time. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5787.12s)]
*  But think about the first time [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5789.08s)]
*  that somebody experiences jujitsu. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5790.72s)]
*  They get on the mats and they realize, [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5792.92s)]
*  they might have some hubris, they're an athlete, [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5795.08s)]
*  maybe they've done some standup, [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5796.96s)]
*  maybe they haven't, they're a football player or whatever, [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5799.48s)]
*  and they suddenly are like a fish out of water. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5801.68s)]
*  They're flopping on the sand [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5803.44s)]
*  and their joints are being popped [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5804.76s)]
*  and they're being choked out. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5806.24s)]
*  And the humility that they experience. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5807.08s)]
*  I think we need to culturally experience that humility [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5811.5199999999995s)]
*  before it's too late, [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5815.28s)]
*  because that's how manipulatable we are. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5817.44s)]
*  Just how a first day grappler is on the jujitsu mats [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5820.12s)]
*  against a decent fighter, a decent grappler. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5823.36s)]
*  That's how helpless we are [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5827.24s)]
*  next to a 3,800-ilo which exists. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5830.04s)]
*  It'll be stronger than 30. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5832.8s)]
*  I'm just saying that because that's where it is now. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5833.64s)]
*  It'll be much the fuck stronger than that tomorrow. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5835.32s)]
*  Once it's attached to quantum computing, [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5837.36s)]
*  it literally would be a god. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5839.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5840.96s)]
*  We're about to experience the most bizarre transition [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5843.04s)]
*  that I think any human civilization has ever experienced. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5846.44s)]
*  It's electricity times a billion. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5852.0s)]
*  It's computers times a billion. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5854.08s)]
*  It's something completely different. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5856.44s)]
*  And we're gonna adapt to it. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5858.96s)]
*  We're going to have to. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5860.32s)]
*  We're gonna have to figure it out. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5861.44s)]
*  It's just what will that be like? [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5862.76s)]
*  What will life be like when we adapt to it? [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5865.68s)]
*  That's when things are gonna get strange. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5867.36s)]
*  I think the 80 to 90% improvement of life experience, [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5869.64s)]
*  I think what he's talking about, [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5877.0s)]
*  quality of life experience, [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5878.2s)]
*  I think what he's talking about is [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5880.12s)]
*  it'll make allocation of resources much more efficient. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5883.0s)]
*  It'll be much easier to get water [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5887.16s)]
*  and health services to third world countries. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5890.52s)]
*  It'll be much easier to keep power on in places. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5893.48s)]
*  It'll be much easier for people to get sanitation, [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5898.0s)]
*  medicine, things along those lines. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5900.879999999999s)]
*  And then starving, poverty, nutrition, [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5904.2s)]
*  all those things could probably worked out [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5908.12s)]
*  in a far more efficient and a far more effective way. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5910.48s)]
*  Then the problem is control. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5914.4s)]
*  That's the problem. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5916.5199999999995s)]
*  The problem is human beings, every single government, [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5917.36s)]
*  every single leadership position, [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5920.96s)]
*  everything involves control. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5924.68s)]
*  The CEO controls the company. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5926.12s)]
*  The president controls the country. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5928.12s)]
*  There's Congress, there's senators. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5930.08s)]
*  Control, control, control. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5932.08s)]
*  Everything is control and then financial benefit [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5933.16s)]
*  from that control. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5936.56s)]
*  That's where it gets scary [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5938.04s)]
*  because whoever is actually programming this thing, [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5939.36s)]
*  as we've seen with Google's AI disaster, [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5941.92s)]
*  when they programmed their AI to show you images of Nazis [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5944.68s)]
*  and it showed you multicultural, multi-ethnic, [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5949.56s)]
*  multi-racial Nazis instead of actual, [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5953.8s)]
*  like what is it though? [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5957.68s)]
*  No, Nazis with fucking dueling scars on their face, [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5958.8s)]
*  hard looking, scary German dudes, that's Nazis. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5961.8s)]
*  These are not Nazis. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5964.8s)]
*  This is a fever dream. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5966.160000000001s)]
*  This is some nuttiness that you've put your DEI nonsense [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5968.0s)]
*  into an artificial version of what the past is. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5972.64s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5978.64s)]
*  You can't do that. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5979.56s)]
*  Because if you start doing that with everything else, [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5980.6s)]
*  then we have a distorted version of reality itself [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5982.68s)]
*  by the most potent intelligence [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5985.200000000001s)]
*  that we currently have at our disposal and that's nuts. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5987.6s)]
*  The question is what should we do? [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5990.68s)]
*  And like as individuals, societally, [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5993.56s)]
*  I mean, I know you're having dialogue with people [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5996.12s)]
*  who have a lot of ideas about the society, [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=5998.08s)]
*  and I'm thinking about it on the individual level as well. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6000.56s)]
*  And it goes like your question about children and learning. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6004.320000000001s)]
*  I feel that there's something about having [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6007.84s)]
*  that beginner's mind, which is so liberating. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6010.56s)]
*  Yes. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6013.16s)]
*  And it's very difficult for adults [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6014.0s)]
*  to release their egoic addiction to what they do, [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6017.08s)]
*  to their habits, to what props up their identity. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6022.2s)]
*  But I think that what we could do is take on thinking, [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6025.16s)]
*  take on learning, take on the art of decision making, [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6032.68s)]
*  for example, with a beginner's mind. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6035.8s)]
*  For the world that's coming, [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6037.84s)]
*  like you think about skating to where the puck is going, [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6039.0s)]
*  not to where it was or what it used to be. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6040.92s)]
*  So what does it mean to be a human in the world [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6043.6s)]
*  that we're a year or two or three away from? [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6045.88s)]
*  Where there's a super intelligence out there [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6048.72s)]
*  that can manipulate us, where so many jobs are lost. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6050.16s)]
*  Well, let me throw that at you. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6053.52s)]
*  What do you think the world will look like? [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6054.360000000001s)]
*  What do I think it will look like? [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6058.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6059.6s)]
*  I think that we're going to have [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6061.84s)]
*  thrillingly exciting discoveries being made. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6063.28s)]
*  We're going to have problems solved [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6067.24s)]
*  that we are as humans unable to solve. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6069.28s)]
*  And so there'll be amazing technological innovations [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6073.44s)]
*  that are going to make things much more convenient. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6076.04s)]
*  I think there'll be huge life science breakthroughs. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6077.719999999999s)]
*  I think there'll be huge material science breakthroughs. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6079.96s)]
*  I think there will be wild competition for who controls it. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6083.599999999999s)]
*  And I completely agree with you about that. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6086.599999999999s)]
*  And I think that as that unfolds, [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6089.6s)]
*  it's going to be really messy. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6095.4400000000005s)]
*  I think that there's going to be, [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6097.160000000001s)]
*  unbelievable amounts of jobs are going to be lost [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6100.120000000001s)]
*  and then people are going to not have jobs. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6101.88s)]
*  So what the fuck are they going to do? [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6103.4400000000005s)]
*  So this is part of what I'm describing. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6105.200000000001s)]
*  People need to train at the ability to recreate themselves. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6106.280000000001s)]
*  Like how some people can move from one art to another [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6109.8s)]
*  and others can't. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6112.04s)]
*  I think we have to train at the art of rediscovery. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6113.240000000001s)]
*  So I think we're going to be tested as a species [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6116.44s)]
*  in our ability to recreate our identities [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6118.839999999999s)]
*  and to live in a state of dynamic flux, [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6123.24s)]
*  embracing new paradigms. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6125.5199999999995s)]
*  Paradigms are going to be shifting all the fucking time. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6126.839999999999s)]
*  The pace of change is going to be radically accelerating [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6129.44s)]
*  for the rest of our lives. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6132.0s)]
*  The rest of our lives, right? [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6133.5199999999995s)]
*  So if that pace of change is accelerating, [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6135.04s)]
*  then we need to have the ability to recreate ourselves [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6137.679999999999s)]
*  as things shift. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6140.28s)]
*  We all know that like, [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6141.16s)]
*  you can't be solving the problem that was important [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6142.839999999999s)]
*  in a fight a minute ago. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6146.56s)]
*  It's a different fucking problem than we have right now. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6148.4800000000005s)]
*  Or in a chess game an hour ago or 10 minutes ago [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6150.4400000000005s)]
*  or one minute ago. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6152.240000000001s)]
*  As a society, we need to be solving the problems [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6153.76s)]
*  that are and that are coming, [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6155.88s)]
*  not the ones that were 10 years ago [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6157.400000000001s)]
*  that we're emotionally addicted to. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6158.68s)]

*  We tend to cling to our ideas, the decisions we made, [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6162.200000000001s)]
*  then we try to justify our ideas. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6167.360000000001s)]
*  We cling to our identities. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6169.400000000001s)]
*  I think that this question of identity [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6171.04s)]
*  is a really important one. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6173.04s)]
*  Whether it relates to a belief system, [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6174.64s)]
*  a decision you've made. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6177.160000000001s)]
*  This idea of humans fighting tooth and nail [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6178.8s)]
*  to maintain our conceptual schemes [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6180.84s)]
*  is something that, [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6182.8s)]
*  you think about someone who has, [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6183.64s)]
*  what one might frame as a fear of success. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6185.320000000001s)]
*  That's a term people use, fear of success. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6188.68s)]
*  The way I understand fear of success [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6190.64s)]
*  is that why do people undermine themselves [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6192.64s)]
*  when they are close to something that they want? [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6195.6s)]
*  To a breakthrough they yearn. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6199.240000000001s)]
*  I think the reason is because if their conceptual scheme, [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6200.12s)]
*  if their identity is in not being the person [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6203.68s)]
*  who wins the big game or who succeeds, [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6206.16s)]
*  it is more terrifying to succeed [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6209.52s)]
*  than it is to give up that old identity. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6211.360000000001s)]
*  That's a core driver of human psychology. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6214.280000000001s)]
*  In competition that's a lot of what we do. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6217.04s)]
*  We plant identities in people, tells in people, [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6218.8s)]
*  little egoic addictions in people. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6221.4400000000005s)]
*  Then we exploit the mind being stuck there [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6224.12s)]
*  because it's not dynamic, it can't keep on moving. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6227.8s)]
*  Robert Persig, my favorite, [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6230.96s)]
*  the most important philosopher in my life, [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6232.5199999999995s)]
*  Robert Persig wrote Zen [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6234.04s)]
*  and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6234.879999999999s)]
*  Have you read that book? [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6235.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I did. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6236.759999999999s)]
*  Awesome. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6237.599999999999s)]
*  He was a really important person in my life. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6239.12s)]
*  I could tell you an interesting story about him. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6241.44s)]
*  His idea of dynamic quality. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6244.0s)]
*  I think we have to live in a state of dynamic quality, [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6246.08s)]
*  not static quality. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6248.919999999999s)]
*  You think about the front of the freight train [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6251.4s)]
*  surging through space-time [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6253.12s)]
*  versus sitting in the restaurant car. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6254.2s)]
*  We want to be strapped to the front of the freight train [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6256.24s)]
*  as reality is unfolding and adapting to the new realities. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6257.959999999999s)]
*  I think we need to build the way of life [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6262.76s)]
*  that allows us to do that. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6265.84s)]
*  I have a lot of ideas about what that way of life looks like. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6268.8s)]
*  I think if we don't do that, [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6270.92s)]
*  then we're gonna be dinosaurs in a fucking world [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6272.16s)]
*  with the comet coming and it's gonna blow us the fuck up. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6274.72s)]
*  So we need to create the ability to reinvent ourselves, [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6277.88s)]
*  to be creative, to adapt. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6281.0s)]
*  So what do you think happens [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6283.599999999999s)]
*  with all these people that lose their jobs? [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6284.84s)]
*  Because most people believe [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6287.04s)]
*  that some form of universal basic income, [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6288.76s)]
*  people that study this, [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6291.32s)]
*  believe that some form of universal basic income [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6292.4s)]
*  is inevitable and necessary. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6295.16s)]
*  I worry about that psychologically [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6298.96s)]
*  because I worry about people being dependent [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6301.599999999999s)]
*  upon checks from the state and not having agency [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6304.16s)]
*  and not having a personal sense of worth. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6308.679999999999s)]
*  I think people identify with what they do. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6312.5199999999995s)]
*  If someone's a great mechanic [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6315.48s)]
*  and they have a great relationship with the people [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6316.679999999999s)]
*  that bring their cars to them [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6318.2s)]
*  and they enjoy being able to fix things and help people, [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6319.56s)]
*  they identify with this. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6322.56s)]
*  This is a part of who they are. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6324.160000000001s)]
*  They're a person who fixes cars and works on cars. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6326.280000000001s)]
*  If that's gone and now all of a sudden [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6330.0s)]
*  they just have a check, who are they? [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6332.6s)]
*  What do dudes do when they have nothing to do? [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6334.6s)]
*  Well, it depends on the dude. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6338.04s)]
*  Some people learn new things. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6339.88s)]
*  Some people get excited. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6341.0s)]
*  There's gonna be people that take advantage of it [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6342.080000000001s)]
*  in a very positive way. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6344.8s)]
*  If there's a real living wage [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6346.72s)]
*  that you get from the government [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6350.0s)]
*  where you really don't have to worry [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6351.280000000001s)]
*  about your housing anymore, [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6352.320000000001s)]
*  you don't have to worry about your food. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6353.4400000000005s)]
*  I think that would be, if you were an ambitious person, [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6355.56s)]
*  that would be amazing. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6358.64s)]
*  So then you could dedicate yourself entirely [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6360.16s)]
*  to what you love, whatever that thing is, [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6362.08s)]
*  and just really dive into that [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6364.4400000000005s)]
*  and let that become your focus in life. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6366.92s)]
*  And we're accustomed to believing that survival itself [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6369.52s)]
*  is the primary driving force, food and shelter [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6375.080000000001s)]
*  is the primary driving force [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6378.52s)]
*  for this intelligent species of human beings. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6379.88s)]
*  But part of me says, why? [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6383.6s)]
*  Why is that? [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6385.84s)]
*  Why does that have to be your driving force? [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6386.68s)]
*  If we have unlimited resources, which assumingly will, [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6388.68s)]
*  assumingly we will with AI, if it's implemented correctly, [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6392.4400000000005s)]
*  we have unlimited resources in terms of your ability [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6396.76s)]
*  to never worry about being hungry, never worry about shelter. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6399.280000000001s)]
*  You would hope that what people would do then [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6404.52s)]
*  is pursue their dreams, [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6407.92s)]
*  but some people don't have fucking dreams. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6409.280000000001s)]
*  Some people, they've gotten too far [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6411.280000000001s)]
*  down this journey of life with a rigid mindset [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6413.4400000000005s)]
*  and a very limited perspective, [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6415.92s)]
*  and now they're forced to change. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6418.080000000001s)]
*  And many will change, but many will not. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6421.64s)]
*  And that's where it gets weird, [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6424.56s)]
*  because then you have a whole entire class of society, [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6426.240000000001s)]
*  an enormous swath of human beings [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6430.4400000000005s)]
*  that are addicted to TikTok, that now get checks, [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6433.0s)]
*  have no hobbies or interests, live off garbage food, [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6436.4800000000005s)]
*  and they're lost. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6440.88s)]
*  And they're being told, probably they're being manipulated [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6444.16s)]
*  that someone's responsible for this, [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6447.4s)]
*  that these people need to be taken down and shut down, [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6449.36s)]
*  we need to return to our old way of life. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6452.12s)]
*  You give them enormous potential for unrest. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6454.28s)]
*  Well, I think that in dialogue that I've had [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6458.92s)]
*  over the past 10 years or so with people [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6464.16s)]
*  who are AI optimists, [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6465.8s)]
*  there's this jump to the utopian future, right? [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6468.16s)]
*  Where land of abundance, no more resource scarcity, [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6470.84s)]
*  everything is beautiful. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6473.84s)]
*  People have the ability to study art and poetry and opera, [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6475.0s)]
*  and they don't need to work anymore, [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6478.92s)]
*  they don't need to be grinding anymore, [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6480.72s)]
*  they can think about philosophy, et cetera, et cetera. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6482.04s)]
*  That's the argument. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6483.88s)]
*  Let's just assume that that would be a positive end. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6485.88s)]
*  I'm not so sure. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6488.96s)]
*  I think that we have some other energies [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6489.8s)]
*  flowing through us that we won't wanna express, [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6491.32s)]
*  but let's just say that that would be great. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6493.52s)]
*  The problem is getting there, right? [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6496.12s)]
*  So in chess, there's this interesting dynamic [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6498.2s)]
*  between strategy and tactics all the time. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6500.96s)]
*  We need to liberate ourselves to be strategic [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6503.28s)]
*  and to think ahead, [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6506.16s)]
*  think about what would be the ideal place to go, [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6507.0s)]
*  but then we also have to get the tactics right, [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6508.76s)]
*  the math right to get there. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6510.04s)]
*  We can't just hang our queen or hang our bishop [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6511.32s)]
*  or hang our rook on the path to our strategic dream, right? [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6512.88s)]
*  We need to integrate execution with strategic dreaming. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6517.08s)]
*  Because often if we're thinking too much tactically, [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6520.56s)]
*  we can't see the long-term plan we want to utilize, right? [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6522.28s)]
*  Like the end result we wanna move toward. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6527.72s)]
*  And so when I think about this path of AI, [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6530.32s)]
*  I think there's gonna be so much disruption along the way [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6533.12s)]
*  to that place of resource abundance and utopia. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6536.08s)]
*  Even if that was a positive place, [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6539.4800000000005s)]
*  I think it's gonna be a really messy path to get there. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6541.12s)]
*  But for us to navigate the path, [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6543.28s)]
*  the question to me now is what should we be doing [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6544.72s)]
*  as individuals, as a species, [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6549.24s)]
*  in order to allow us to navigate that path? [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6550.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, I think people certainly, [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6554.2s)]
*  if universal income becomes ubiquitous, [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6555.76s)]
*  we're certainly gonna need some sort of guidance. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6558.0s)]
*  We're certainly gonna need something that guides people [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6560.599999999999s)]
*  towards a feeling of relevancy, [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6565.5199999999995s)]
*  towards a feeling of purpose. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6568.4s)]
*  You gotta give people something. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6571.040000000001s)]
*  Training is a beautiful thing to do. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6572.76s)]
*  Any kind of training. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6574.72s)]
*  Anything where you're learning something. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6575.68s)]
*  But again, it comes to this comfort thing. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6577.360000000001s)]
*  You and I have very similar paths in life [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6580.68s)]
*  in that we've sought things [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6584.360000000001s)]
*  that many people find uncomfortable and difficult. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6585.72s)]
*  And I think there's great value in uncomfortable [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6589.64s)]
*  and difficult things in the beginner's mindset [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6592.4400000000005s)]
*  and the learner's mindset. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6595.360000000001s)]
*  Because there's just, you learn more about everything [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6596.4400000000005s)]
*  by learning about something. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6599.4s)]
*  And I've lived my life like that, and so have you. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6601.04s)]
*  And there's many people out there [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6603.879999999999s)]
*  that resonate with these ideas. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6605.24s)]
*  And they also live their life like that, [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6607.759999999999s)]
*  and they get excited. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6609.5599999999995s)]
*  But there's many people that don't. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6610.4s)]
*  And those are the people that I really worry about. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6612.0s)]
*  The people that just want a good job, [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6614.28s)]
*  where there's nothing wrong with that. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6616.2s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with wanting a good job [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6617.24s)]
*  and being able to take care of your family [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6619.0s)]
*  and having a place where you enjoy working [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6621.08s)]
*  and being able to go there every day. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6623.32s)]
*  And when that's taken away from people [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6624.719999999999s)]
*  and they have to kind of restructure the entire way [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6626.44s)]
*  they interface with reality. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6630.24s)]
*  And then there's this bizarre connection [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6632.799999999999s)]
*  with the government now where the government, [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6637.32s)]
*  the government is now your provider. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6640.4s)]
*  It's not just for the people by the people. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6642.78s)]
*  It's not representative of the people. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6645.28s)]
*  It's now your provider, [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6647.759999999999s)]
*  which is a very strange relationship to have. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6649.54s)]
*  And we see it in welfare states, [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6652.36s)]
*  which I think social safety nets are very important. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6655.68s)]
*  I think if we're gonna be a compassionate society, [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6657.88s)]
*  we need to be able to take care of people [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6660.6s)]
*  that aren't doing well, [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6662.0s)]
*  because a lot of life is about fortune. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6662.84s)]
*  And sometimes people run into horribly unfortunate situations [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6665.92s)]
*  and there's massive potential in those people. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6669.48s)]
*  And those people can realize that potential [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6672.08s)]
*  if they're helped. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6674.26s)]
*  And I think that's real too. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6675.58s)]
*  But I do think there's a certain psychological aspect [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6677.54s)]
*  to having the state take care of all your food [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6680.4s)]
*  and money and resources and housing [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6682.98s)]
*  that all of a sudden, who are you? [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6686.5s)]
*  And what do you do to give yourself meaning [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6689.379999999999s)]
*  if you're not the type of person [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6692.0599999999995s)]
*  that seeks out difficult things [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6693.58s)]
*  and you're 45 or 47 years old or whatever you are, [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6695.0199999999995s)]
*  and this is happening to you? [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6698.0599999999995s)]
*  And you feel lost. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6699.9s)]
*  There's gonna be a lot of people like that. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6703.44s)]
*  And throughout history, [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6705.9s)]
*  terrible times have been very cruel [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6710.219999999999s)]
*  to people who weren't prepared. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6711.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6713.46s)]
*  And I worry about it almost like an intellectual famine, [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6715.0199999999995s)]
*  like a psychological famine, [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6719.639999999999s)]
*  that people will be deprived of the thing [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6721.7s)]
*  that they have rested their hat upon, [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6724.82s)]
*  like their identity, who they are, [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6728.34s)]
*  what it means, their sense of purpose, [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6730.46s)]
*  that it will be pulled away from them. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6733.42s)]
*  That scares the shit out of me, [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6735.34s)]
*  especially when I know how many people get addicted to drugs [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6736.78s)]
*  and how many people get addicted [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6740.12s)]
*  to all sorts of weird lifestyle choices [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6741.32s)]
*  to provide them with some dopamine or some rush [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6743.36s)]
*  or just something that makes them feel like they're alive. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6747.24s)]
*  There's something so powerful about being grounded [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6751.76s)]
*  and a path to being grounded is being immersed in an art, [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6757.72s)]
*  like for example, like Jiu-Jitsu or chess, [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6760.84s)]
*  where if you're on the Jiu-Jitsu mats [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6763.44s)]
*  and you over extend your arm and you get arm barred, [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6768.839999999999s)]
*  you're not gonna say, that's not my fault, [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6771.5599999999995s)]
*  that was his fault. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6773.2s)]
*  Or like, that's... [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6774.16s)]
*  Then you just don't fucking get better [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6776.08s)]
*  and you get arm barred again. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6777.16s)]
*  But you only get better by taking your shit on. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6778.5199999999995s)]
*  Or if you're a chess player and you make a mistake [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6781.0s)]
*  and you lose, [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6783.16s)]
*  people who say, that's not my fault, [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6787.28s)]
*  they're irrelevant very, very quickly. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6789.719999999999s)]
*  They just get blazed by. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6791.639999999999s)]
*  They're just like, everyone else's race has passed [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6793.24s)]
*  and they're not in the race anymore. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6795.599999999999s)]
*  And if you think about a community, for example, [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6797.48s)]
*  of fighters, let's think about Jiu-Jitsu as a vision. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6799.759999999999s)]
*  One of the things that separates people [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6804.839999999999s)]
*  as they get deeper into an art [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6807.879999999999s)]
*  is whether they wanna take themselves on as a way of life. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6809.5199999999995s)]
*  Whether they're hungry to have their weaknesses revealed. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6813.32s)]
*  You think about a school where somebody... [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6815.599999999999s)]
*  I always found it interesting to watch people [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6819.48s)]
*  when they're four or five rounds into sparring. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6821.12s)]
*  Do they look for the blue belt to rest with? [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6822.879999999999s)]
*  Or do they look for the 240 pound fucking bruiser [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6824.6s)]
*  to beat the shit out of them? [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6829.400000000001s)]
*  Or the high level brown belt to exploit them? [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6830.200000000001s)]
*  Or the black belt to kick their ass? [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6831.76s)]
*  Who do they look for? [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6834.280000000001s)]
*  Who does the up and coming purple belt look for? [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6835.120000000001s)]
*  When the young competitor, [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6837.88s)]
*  is he looking for the egoic rest [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6840.120000000001s)]
*  or the place to be exposed? [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6841.72s)]
*  Like the people who hunger for exposure to get better. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6843.360000000001s)]
*  It's like seeking accountability as a way of life. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6846.84s)]
*  I think there's something really powerful to do that [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6849.200000000001s)]
*  with decision making. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6850.92s)]
*  Right? [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6852.76s)]
*  Because we're making decisions [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6853.6s)]
*  and we're making decisions in a higher [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6854.6s)]
*  and higher stakes world. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6856.28s)]
*  And if we train at the art of decision making [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6857.8s)]
*  in something that's grounded in reality. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6861.2s)]
*  Like for example, the chess rating system [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6864.2s)]
*  is just a fucking thing, it's objective. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6866.04s)]
*  There's no bullshit to it. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6867.84s)]
*  But I hear people, like I know people who play chess online [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6869.16s)]
*  and then they're like, yeah, this is my rating [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6872.16s)]
*  but I'm actually much stronger than that [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6873.4400000000005s)]
*  because of this and this. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6874.64s)]
*  It's like, no, you're not. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6875.64s)]
*  You just haven't taken your shit on. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6877.4800000000005s)]
*  Right? [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6879.4s)]
*  You're not stronger than your rating. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6880.96s)]
*  Your rating is how strong you are as a chess player. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6882.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6884.08s)]
*  Right? [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6884.92s)]
*  But there's something about, [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6885.76s)]
*  there's something so beautiful [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6886.92s)]
*  about an accurate feedback loop. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6887.76s)]
*  Right? [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6890.08s)]
*  And that can be with a coach training with you, [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6890.92s)]
*  it could be on the, just getting tapped out, [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6892.76s)]
*  getting your ass kicked, right? [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6894.5199999999995s)]
*  Getting hit, losing, whatever it is. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6895.8s)]
*  I think that there's something so powerful [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6898.24s)]
*  about people cultivating some way of life [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6900.12s)]
*  where they're grounded in some kind of feedback loop [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6904.599999999999s)]
*  in their training life, that there's no bullshit involved. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6908.68s)]
*  That they learn to accept accountability as a way of life. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6912.08s)]
*  They seek feedback loops. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6915.280000000001s)]
*  I think that we can do this in decision-making. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6916.76s)]
*  I mean, my view is that we're going to be making decisions [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6918.240000000001s)]
*  as a species in an increasingly complex world [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6921.64s)]
*  where there is a super intelligence. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6924.360000000001s)]
*  So we need to track our decisions [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6926.12s)]
*  and we need to see objectively when they are good [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6927.96s)]
*  and when they're bad. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6931.12s)]
*  Like just how you can studying tape as a basketball team [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6931.96s)]
*  or as a jujitsu fighter or whatever. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6934.68s)]
*  Like we need to create game tape in our decision-making. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6936.28s)]
*  Right? [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6939.32s)]
*  We have to stop deluding ourselves about the fact [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6940.16s)]
*  that we're actually better than everything shows we are. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6941.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6945.719999999999s)]
*  People love to think that way. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6946.5599999999995s)]
*  They fucking love it. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6947.5199999999995s)]
*  It gives them a nice little out in their accomplishments. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6948.8s)]
*  It gives them a nice little excuse [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6951.8s)]
*  for why things haven't gone their way. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6953.5599999999995s)]
*  Like if you make a decision, [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6955.12s)]
*  write down what the decision is [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6956.12s)]
*  and write down why you made the decision [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6957.28s)]
*  and then look back on it in a week or two or three [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6959.28s)]
*  and create like a spreadsheet, a log, [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6961.5599999999995s)]
*  or whatever the fuck you want to use [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6963.4s)]
*  of all of your decisions and why you made them [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6964.88s)]
*  and look back on them. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6966.92s)]
*  And then if the reasons for making the decision [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6968.0s)]
*  no longer are valid, but you're holding to the decision, [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6970.2s)]
*  which is what everyone does, then don't do that. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6973.04s)]
*  Don't do that. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6975.92s)]
*  Let go of it, reevaluate. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6978.08s)]
*  So when you work with people [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6979.64s)]
*  and I know a big part of what you do [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6981.84s)]
*  is help organizations learn [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6984.92s)]
*  and how do you instill these ideas in people? [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6987.6s)]
*  Do you have a structure that you follow [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6991.8s)]
*  when you go to work with people? [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6994.24s)]
*  Do you try to see what they do? [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6996.16s)]
*  Yeah, I try to see what they do. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6997.92s)]
*  So I have been training for the last 15, [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=6999.12s)]
*  yeah, 15, 16 years, [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7003.32s)]
*  elite mental and physical athletes, right? [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7007.5199999999995s)]
*  Decision makers, investors, [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7010.08s)]
*  athletes, fighters, NBA teams. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7014.84s)]
*  Well, in my school with Marcelo, [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7017.639999999999s)]
*  we had a huge group of fighters, Jiu Jitsu fighters. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7018.84s)]
*  And so I've been in dialogue with people [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7022.44s)]
*  who are like the pinnacles of different fields [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7025.16s)]
*  my whole life. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7029.16s)]
*  And one thing is that I love working with people [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7030.0s)]
*  who wanna take themselves on. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7033.799999999999s)]
*  So it begins with them being all in on the process. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7034.96s)]
*  I'm not great at motivating people to take their shit on. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7037.839999999999s)]
*  I love to begin once we're taking their shit on. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7041.24s)]
*  So, and then it's individualized. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7044.12s)]
*  I get to know someone's pattern just 99% listening, [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7047.04s)]
*  observing. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7050.28s)]
*  A lot of what I try to do is understand the entanglement [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7051.679999999999s)]
*  of their brilliance and their eccentricity [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7054.08s)]
*  or their genius and their dysfunction. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7055.679999999999s)]
*  I think so quickly people try to come in. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7057.48s)]
*  If you come in with some kind of formula [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7058.96s)]
*  for how things will be done, [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7060.639999999999s)]
*  you're gonna be slicing away [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7061.48s)]
*  the brilliance of individuals, right? [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7063.04s)]
*  Like all of our most brilliant creations are interwoven [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7065.44s)]
*  with the dysfunctional parts of our mind. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7069.24s)]
*  Everyone wants to normalize people. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7071.28s)]
*  Like most in the realm of like trainers or coaches [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7073.28s)]
*  of different fields, I think it's mostly bullshit [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7077.0s)]
*  because it's mostly arm shape professors [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7079.48s)]
*  who don't understand what it actually means [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7081.2s)]
*  to be playing on that razor's edge of peak performance [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7083.759999999999s)]
*  where you have to make a decision [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7086.599999999999s)]
*  which is taking a risk that's right on the edge [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7087.879999999999s)]
*  of something catastrophic, [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7090.4s)]
*  but that's the thread the needle solution. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7092.32s)]
*  And so when I start working with someone, [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7094.5599999999995s)]
*  I try to get to know them very, very deeply. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7096.5599999999995s)]
*  Their patterns, their patterns of success, [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7098.759999999999s)]
*  their patterns of failure, [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7100.879999999999s)]
*  where their genius and their dysfunction are entangled. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7102.639999999999s)]
*  I often go into what I call a cave process, [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7105.44s)]
*  which is trying to understand what their self-expression is [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7109.759999999999s)]
*  like going into the cave with them metaphorically, [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7113.759999999999s)]
*  try to understand what their self-expression [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7116.32s)]
*  would be liberated from reactivity and inertia. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7118.48s)]
*  So not reacting away from what they did before [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7122.04s)]
*  and not being subject to the inertia of what they did before, [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7124.919999999999s)]
*  but just blue-skying what the ideal solution would be, [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7127.5199999999995s)]
*  what the most pure self-expression for them would be. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7132.0s)]
*  So it's completely dependent upon the individual [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7134.56s)]
*  and their approach initially. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7136.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and not their approach, [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7138.04s)]
*  the individual and the patterns of their approach. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7140.76s)]
*  Not that we would do things the way they did before, [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7143.360000000001s)]
*  but I have a lot of humility. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7145.120000000001s)]
*  Like I don't think that I know the way. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7146.76s)]
*  I don't think there is a way. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7148.6s)]
*  I think we all have our own way we need to discover. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7149.92s)]
*  The coaches who have been most damaging to me, [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7152.4400000000005s)]
*  for example, when I was in that same period [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7155.0s)]
*  when I was 15, 16 years old, [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7156.88s)]
*  I had a coach who was part of the Russian school of chess [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7159.68s)]
*  who essentially had me move away from my self-expression, [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7163.28s)]
*  move away from my style. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7165.8s)]
*  My style of chess play at that point, [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7167.2s)]
*  my whole life had been creative, attacking, improvisational. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7168.719999999999s)]
*  I love to create chaos and find hidden harmonies in chaos. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7172.28s)]
*  I love to battle. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7174.88s)]
*  He urged me to stop playing that way, [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7176.16s)]
*  stop studying that style of play, [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7179.84s)]
*  play like these cold-blooded prophylactic chess players [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7181.5599999999995s)]
*  like Petrosian or Karpov. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7184.28s)]
*  I played much more in the style, not the strength, [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7185.92s)]
*  the style of like Garry Kasparov or Mikhail Tal [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7188.2s)]
*  or Bobby Fischer, like players who were aggressive, [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7192.48s)]
*  who had a lot of red blood flowing through their body. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7196.04s)]
*  Like I was hot-blooded. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7198.12s)]
*  And he urged me to play in the opposite style [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7199.679999999999s)]
*  from what was natural to me. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7202.839999999999s)]
*  Think what would Karpov do here? [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7204.04s)]
*  Not what would Josh do here. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7206.0s)]
*  Is there a benefit to that just to expand your repertoire? [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7207.0s)]
*  Yes, there is absolutely a benefit to that. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7210.16s)]
*  But there's also the movement of a young competitor [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7212.919999999999s)]
*  away from their self-expression, [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7217.08s)]
*  a love from their love for the game, [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7218.16s)]
*  a love from their passion. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7219.799999999999s)]
*  There's this brilliant man named Yuri Razdovayev [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7222.4400000000005s)]
*  who was on the other pillar of the Russian school of chess [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7224.160000000001s)]
*  who said this amazing thing to me. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7226.76s)]
*  He said to me, Josh, you can learn Karpov through Kasparov. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7227.92s)]
*  And I didn't understand what he meant [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7232.120000000001s)]
*  for many, many years after that. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7233.320000000001s)]
*  And it was a little too late in my chess life [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7235.56s)]
*  to take that in. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7237.320000000001s)]
*  But what he was saying is that you can learn [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7238.160000000001s)]
*  the great defensive chess [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7240.52s)]
*  by studying the defense of the great attackers. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7241.68s)]
*  Why was it late in your career to take that in? [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7243.56s)]
*  Well, good question. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7246.56s)]
*  It's just when he said it to me, [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7248.64s)]
*  like I was in my early 20s [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7251.08s)]
*  and I'd lost my love for chess. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7252.76s)]
*  It had gotten static, stale. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7255.5599999999995s)]
*  I would, good challenge. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7257.88s)]
*  It probably wasn't late, but I couldn't hear it. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7261.32s)]
*  I would have had to go into the cave, go away, [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7266.04s)]
*  go through an existential crisis and come back to chess. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7268.679999999999s)]
*  But there were a lot of things that were moving me away [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7270.599999999999s)]
*  from chess at that point in addition to that. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7271.92s)]
*  I didn't wanna be trapped inside of the confines [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7273.679999999999s)]
*  of 64 squares anymore. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7276.2s)]
*  I felt like a lion in a cage. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7277.639999999999s)]
*  So it was like, if I had known him when I was 14, 15, [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7278.68s)]
*  it would have been a different arc for me in the chess life. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7282.0s)]
*  But maybe it would have been much worse for my life. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7284.72s)]
*  If I had known him in the 15, [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7286.64s)]
*  I might have fucking played chess for the rest of my life [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7287.6s)]
*  and I'm so grateful I didn't. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7289.12s)]
*  So who knows? [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7290.76s)]
*  Isn't it interesting when life takes you on these, [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7292.92s)]
*  or you go on your own journey [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7296.6s)]
*  and you realize that decisions that you've made [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7299.360000000001s)]
*  that have turned you in one way, [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7302.320000000001s)]
*  those are critical decisions if you think of the life [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7304.280000000001s)]
*  that you're living now is this optimal. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7308.56s)]
*  If this is optimal, then yes, it's good [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7310.92s)]
*  that you moved away from chess. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7313.68s)]
*  But if you had gotten that coaching when you were younger [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7316.080000000001s)]
*  and it reignited your love of chess, [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7319.080000000001s)]
*  then it would be good for the life that you currently have. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7320.92s)]
*  Because you would say, well, as a person [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7323.52s)]
*  who's just so in love with chess, [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7325.84s)]
*  I'm so grateful that I ran into this person [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7328.360000000001s)]
*  when I was 11 years old and they sent me [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7330.64s)]
*  in this correct path. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7332.72s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7334.64s)]
*  For me, I love the life that I live. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7337.08s)]
*  I'm so grateful for the life that I've lived. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7340.16s)]
*  And I was moved away from chess in many ways [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7342.16s)]
*  by this alienating experience that I just described, [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7346.36s)]
*  and then also the dynamics of the movie and everything. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7351.88s)]
*  But I played chess for eight years after the movie. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7354.64s)]
*  And so my results were very good, [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7357.44s)]
*  but I was moving into this internal, [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7359.12s)]
*  I was in an existential crisis. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7360.76s)]
*  Every catastrophic injury or heartbreaking loss [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7363.4s)]
*  or losing a world championship [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7367.8s)]
*  when you're a millimeter from winning the finals, [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7369.04s)]
*  all of those losses that were so heartbreaking to me, [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7372.44s)]
*  every big loss I'm grateful for now [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7376.24s)]
*  and led to the biggest wins [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7378.64s)]
*  and led to the biggest insights and transitions. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7380.0s)]
*  And my life today, the crises that I had in many ways [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7382.64s)]
*  have armed me to help people express themselves [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7385.96s)]
*  in their arts, right? [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7390.36s)]
*  And a lot of the reads that I made as a competitor, [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7391.64s)]
*  to go back to your question, I invert now. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7394.16s)]
*  The way I would read chess players, [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7397.56s)]
*  find where their minds were stuck, [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7398.92s)]
*  find where their bias patterns were, [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7400.4400000000005s)]
*  find where their energy was stuck, [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7402.8s)]
*  find where they were static. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7403.92s)]
*  Now, then I would exploit them. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7406.16s)]
*  Same thing you do in the fight game, [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7408.08s)]
*  you find where someone's pattern is static [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7409.12s)]
*  and exploit it. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7410.88s)]
*  Then what I do in training people is I find those, [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7411.84s)]
*  I have a very good nose for those [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7414.96s)]
*  because I spent my life as a competitor, [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7416.240000000001s)]
*  sniffing them out, feeling my way to them, [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7418.2s)]
*  but then I work on liberating them, [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7419.76s)]
*  releasing the obstruction. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7421.400000000001s)]
*  So a lot of what I do today [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7423.4400000000005s)]
*  in my work with brilliant performers [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7425.44s)]
*  is work on unleashing what I used to exploit. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7427.759999999999s)]
*  That's interesting. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7430.719999999999s)]
*  That's great. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7432.799999999999s)]
*  That must be very satisfying [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7434.96s)]
*  to teach people how to get better at things. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7437.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7440.599999999999s)]
*  It's interesting. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7442.799999999999s)]
*  I don't use that. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7443.639999999999s)]
*  I don't teach people, I don't know it. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7445.16s)]
*  I'm not teaching some people something I know. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7448.48s)]
*  But you're teaching where you know. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7450.36s)]
*  Well, I'm kind of discovering their path with them. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7452.24s)]
*  Okay. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7454.28s)]
*  I don't go in thinking this is the way [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7455.96s)]
*  you fucking should do it. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7456.8s)]
*  I don't believe that I know what they should do. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7458.08s)]
*  And I believe that any coach who thinks [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7460.12s)]
*  that they know what someone else should do [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7461.5599999999995s)]
*  without listening to the self-expression [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7463.639999999999s)]
*  of that person very, very deeply is just wrong [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7465.04s)]
*  and they should not be, they reject that coach. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7466.76s)]
*  Right. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7468.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7469.92s)]
*  Well, you have to really understand someone psychologically [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7471.04s)]
*  to be able to coach them as well. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7473.08s)]
*  Because sometimes you don't know what the hitch is [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7474.88s)]
*  until you're like, oh, there it is. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7478.44s)]
*  So this is your whole problem with your whole life. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7481.28s)]
*  But the amazing thing is you find the hitch, [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7483.8s)]
*  but then you see, oh, that hitch is interwoven [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7485.28s)]
*  with your biggest. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7487.76s)]
*  Like I sent you that thing I wrote about Marcelo, right? [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7490.64s)]
*  And like there was this incredible moment [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7494.16s)]
*  that I had with Marcelo. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7496.52s)]
*  Such an emotional moment. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7500.320000000001s)]
*  So he's, I describe him as like this great lower-up learner. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7502.320000000001s)]
*  And he's someone who uniquely in my life, [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7506.76s)]
*  I've never seen anyone better at learning [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7510.6s)]
*  from one experience, big or large, right? [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7512.36s)]
*  And then there was this moment we were sitting, [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7515.759999999999s)]
*  I guess it was six years ago, [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7518.96s)]
*  we were sitting just talking about life [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7520.92s)]
*  and our journey and everything. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7522.839999999999s)]
*  And he started weeping. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7523.88s)]
*  And he said to me, you know, Josh, [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7526.04s)]
*  I never forget my pain. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7529.759999999999s)]
*  And he said, Marcelo had a real tragedy. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7536.28s)]
*  He lost a baby. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7540.5199999999995s)]
*  Marcelo and Tachi, his wife, they lost, [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7541.88s)]
*  they had twins and they lost their baby Joey. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7543.52s)]
*  Olivia and Joey were born premature and Joey died. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7546.4800000000005s)]
*  It was a terrible tragedy. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7550.12s)]
*  It was just devastating for, I mean, [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7551.04s)]
*  just beyond belief, devastating. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7554.08s)]
*  And like the loss of his son, the loss of his mother, [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7557.56s)]
*  the loss of his father. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7561.4800000000005s)]
*  Every moment someone looked at him a certain way, [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7563.68s)]
*  every moment somebody like raised their voice at him [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7565.76s)]
*  and it triggered him into like a fight place. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7568.56s)]
*  Every time he'd been submitted, [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7570.36s)]
*  every time he'd been swept, every time, [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7572.8s)]
*  I realized as he was saying this, [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7574.04s)]
*  like all of his pain is with him every moment. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7575.96s)]
*  And as he described this to me, [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7580.76s)]
*  it was this incredibly emotional scene [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7581.92s)]
*  where he was just weeping in his exploration [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7583.28s)]
*  and just brother to brother talking to me about, [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7585.76s)]
*  like he walks around with every wound he's experienced [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7589.4s)]
*  in life present all the fucking time. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7594.96s)]
*  And so we think of like this brilliant low rep learner, [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7598.36s)]
*  the guy who has a superhuman ability to learn [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7600.4s)]
*  from one experience, but it's a superpower, [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7602.16s)]
*  but also it ravages him all the fucking time. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7606.12s)]
*  And you can't just remove that. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7610.04s)]
*  You can't be like, yeah, release your pain. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7611.5599999999995s)]
*  Be great, but then you also releasing the genius. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7613.48s)]
*  That's the thing about people [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7616.719999999999s)]
*  that are really amazing at something. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7618.48s)]
*  The pain of losing is so devastating to them. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7621.24s)]
*  Like when you talk about genius, [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7625.64s)]
*  like people use Michael Jordan as an example, [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7630.08s)]
*  genius basketball player, but unbelievably competitive. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7632.8s)]
*  Like just can't help himself. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7637.84s)]
*  In everything. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7640.2s)]
*  In everything. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7641.04s)]
*  On and off the court. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7641.88s)]
*  I've heard if you beat him at pool, [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7642.72s)]
*  he won't talk to you for two weeks. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7643.64s)]
*  Yeah, so you can be like, [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7644.4800000000005s)]
*  Mike, just take it fucking easy on the pool table. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7645.320000000001s)]
*  What do you care? [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7647.0s)]
*  But you can't say that. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7647.84s)]
*  Garry Kasparov was the same way. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7648.68s)]
*  Competitive in everything. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7650.04s)]
*  But you can't just like remove that. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7651.4400000000005s)]
*  You're removing the genius with it. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7653.6s)]
*  Right, right. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7654.84s)]
*  That you have a Ferrari engine [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7655.96s)]
*  and you're trying to like navigate 30 mile per hour traffic. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7658.08s)]
*  And you're like, fuck. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7662.120000000001s)]
*  I'll never forget this chess coach, Mark Deveretsky, [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7663.320000000001s)]
*  who he said to me this unbelievably hubristic thing. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7666.56s)]
*  When I was 15, 16 years old, [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7671.240000000001s)]
*  he said to me, if he had had Bobby Fischer as a student, [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7673.120000000001s)]
*  from as a seven year old, [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7680.4400000000005s)]
*  he could have made Fischer a much, much stronger [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7681.76s)]
*  chess player without any of the craziness. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7683.400000000001s)]
*  What? [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7685.64s)]
*  And I remember. Without the craziness. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7686.4800000000005s)]
*  And I was just like, as a teenager, [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7687.96s)]
*  like I just, my hands started like sweating [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7690.76s)]
*  when I just said that. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7693.12s)]
*  It's just like, because to me, it's just, [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7693.96s)]
*  it's just not fucking true. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7696.08s)]
*  Right. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7697.320000000001s)]
*  Like Fischer's- It's a crazy thing to say. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7698.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's hubris, right? [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7699.84s)]
*  And this is the same guy who was urging me [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7702.04s)]
*  into that direction. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7705.360000000001s)]
*  Like, but that's the opposite of my approach, right? [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7706.96s)]
*  And if we are going to try to disentangle [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7711.4800000000005s)]
*  the dysfunction from the genius, [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7713.88s)]
*  we need to understand it very deeply. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7715.56s)]
*  We need to plant the seeds patiently [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7717.08s)]
*  for that genius to sprout somewhere else. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7718.52s)]
*  We need to water those seeds. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7720.56s)]
*  We need to observe them coming. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7721.76s)]
*  We have to very, like slightly sand away [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7723.24s)]
*  the dysfunctional patterning while observing. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7726.52s)]
*  Like it's a very delicate process, right? [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7728.88s)]
*  You can't just fucking excise the tumor. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7731.08s)]
*  Well, there's also a problem in when someone [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7734.36s)]
*  becomes very good at doing something [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7736.56s)]
*  and they have a very specific way, [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7738.64s)]
*  they've become very good at doing something, [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7740.12s)]
*  they assume that this is the way [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7741.88s)]
*  and that this is the way for everyone [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7744.36s)]
*  and that they can impose their way on other people. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7746.48s)]
*  And what led them to become great in the first place [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7749.5599999999995s)]
*  is also that hubris that makes them think [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7753.28s)]
*  they could take Bobby Fischer and make him even better. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7755.68s)]
*  Well, that's why great coaches, [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7757.88s)]
*  the great fighters often aren't great coaches, right? [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7759.5599999999995s)]
*  Because most teachers teach the way they learned, [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7762.2s)]
*  which will alienate 70 or 80% of their students, [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7765.0s)]
*  by definition. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7768.16s)]
*  Right. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7769.0s)]
*  Well, great coaches for a large group [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7770.84s)]
*  need to be able to teach different ways [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7773.72s)]
*  for different kinds of learners. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7774.88s)]
*  Different modalities of learners. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7776.8s)]
*  Are they visual, are they somatic, are they auditory? [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7777.92s)]
*  Like what makes them tick? [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7781.68s)]
*  And you have to know, if you're teaching a chess class, [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7783.16s)]
*  I started teaching a group of kids chess [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7785.56s)]
*  when I was in my teens. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7787.0s)]
*  I taught them from kindergarten through fifth grade [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7788.72s)]
*  and we ended up winning in New York. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7790.96s)]
*  It was a beautiful journey with kids at PS116. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7792.4800000000005s)]
*  And from moving the pieces to winning [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7794.88s)]
*  city, state, and national championships. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7796.32s)]
*  And it was so interesting because I'd be like, [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7797.88s)]
*  teaching eight, 10 kids at once. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7799.36s)]
*  And I would be teaching, [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7802.96s)]
*  it was like giving a simultaneous exhibition. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7804.24s)]
*  Like each one had their own language. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7805.84s)]
*  And it was, I was like so involved with this theme [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7807.16s)]
*  that I would be, it was exhausting. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7810.04s)]
*  Cause I was teaching 10 chess lessons [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7811.719999999999s)]
*  at the same time to 10 kids. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7812.84s)]
*  And I remember I had this moment, [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7813.96s)]
*  this heartbreaking moment, [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7815.2s)]
*  where I had this one student named Ivan, [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7816.96s)]
*  who I, just charismatic, intense, [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7818.84s)]
*  we had a very close relationship. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7823.48s)]
*  I loved the kid. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7824.639999999999s)]
*  And like I was, he was, [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7825.48s)]
*  or at the national championship, [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7826.84s)]
*  I was giving him this, this, this pep talk. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7827.68s)]
*  And I was just like firing him up [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7830.56s)]
*  and speaking to him in the way he needed to be spoken to. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7831.92s)]
*  And, and then he was like, he ran off, [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7834.4800000000005s)]
*  like stoked fired up to go kick some ass. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7836.4800000000005s)]
*  And then this other kid who was on the team, [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7838.320000000001s)]
*  this beautiful sensitive boy came over [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7840.240000000001s)]
*  and I looked at him with the same energy [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7841.6s)]
*  that I just was speaking to Ivan and I brought it to him. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7843.6s)]
*  And, and I was like 15 seconds into speaking to him [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7846.12s)]
*  and I looked at his eyes and I realized [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7849.320000000001s)]
*  like this is a disaster. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7850.6s)]
*  Like, I mean, this is terrible. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7851.76s)]
*  And then I stopped and I like, [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7854.400000000001s)]
*  gave him a hug and we like slowed it down. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7857.12s)]
*  We, you know, he, he, he needed to go into [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7858.6s)]
*  a very different way than Ivan went in. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7860.52s)]
*  Right. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7861.72s)]
*  But coach, think about how often you see [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7862.56s)]
*  cornerman fucking up fighters. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7863.84s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7865.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7866.08s)]
*  I mean, so as a, as a coach, [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7866.92s)]
*  I think we have to like put our own egos aside [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7868.6s)]
*  and our idea that we know how one should learn. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7872.0s)]
*  Yeah. And it's, that's what's very important [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7874.320000000001s)]
*  is finding the right coach. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7876.68s)]
*  You have to find a coach that understands you [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7878.56s)]
*  and has a style that you can implement. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7882.280000000001s)]
*  Cause there's some coaches that just have styles [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7884.96s)]
*  that you don't physically, you're not designed for. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7887.32s)]
*  You don't, you can't learn the way they learned. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7890.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7893.72s)]
*  That's what's fascinating about you is that you've gone [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7895.08s)]
*  from being this hyper competitor to teaching people [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7897.12s)]
*  or coaching people to find the very best version [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7902.36s)]
*  of themselves and how to, how to acquire that. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7907.16s)]
*  That's very rare. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7910.28s)]
*  That someone who gets really good at something [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7911.6s)]
*  also becomes really good at showing people [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7913.44s)]
*  how they can get better at things. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7916.0s)]
*  Like that's a specific focus that you've had. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7919.5199999999995s)]
*  Like why, why is that so rewarding to you? [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7923.48s)]
*  Well, I took on this interesting challenge [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7932.96s)]
*  when I broke my back. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7935.44s)]
*  Cause I was already doing this, but I, [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7937.599999999999s)]
*  I was training people, but I, when I broke my back, [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7940.08s)]
*  I remember I said, okay, during this healing process, [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7942.08s)]
*  after the year and a half to two years of denial [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7946.08s)]
*  and training through it, when I stopped, [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7949.16s)]
*  I tried to take on training people with the same passion [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7954.28s)]
*  and love that I had for training myself. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7957.2s)]
*  I wanted to see if I could like love it as much. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7959.4s)]
*  And I never got there. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7961.92s)]
*  And then I got into the, you know, [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7964.08s)]
*  that's part of what moved me into discovering [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7965.72s)]
*  the ocean arts and being all in on training. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7967.72s)]
*  So a big part of my relationship with training other people [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7969.16s)]
*  is training myself as a way of life. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7970.8s)]
*  Like I'm always, like I'm living at my limit [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7972.320000000001s)]
*  in my, in the arena myself. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7974.8s)]
*  The moment I think a coach like leaves the arena [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7976.56s)]
*  where they're putting their own ego on the line all the time [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7979.4800000000005s)]
*  or their life on the line or whatever the fuck [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7981.92s)]
*  they're putting on the line, then they become static [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7983.360000000001s)]
*  and they start to think they know the answer. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7986.16s)]
*  It's like the fat, you know, martial arts instructor [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7987.64s)]
*  who's many years past training and is smoking a cigarette [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7991.320000000001s)]
*  on the sideline telling people what to do and no longer [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7994.12s)]
*  is like actually dynamic than putting their, [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7996.4400000000005s)]
*  the moment our egos get protected, right? [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=7999.04s)]
*  So my relationship to training is something [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8002.16s)]
*  that I live all the time. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8005.04s)]
*  I think also becoming a dad was a big part of it. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8008.96s)]
*  Like the nurturing and a lot of what I've done is invert [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8012.2s)]
*  what I used to do to break people. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8016.28s)]
*  Now I invert to heal them or unleash them. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8017.48s)]
*  Becoming like being a father is about the most humbling [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8022.08s)]
*  thing I've ever, I thought I had ideas about education [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8024.8s)]
*  until I became a dad and then I realized I didn't know [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8028.68s)]
*  anything I had to start over. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8030.64s)]
*  Yeah, and also the wound pattern, like I think [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8034.68s)]
*  understanding people's wound patterns is very important. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8037.04s)]
*  A lot of my wound pattern is in loving something [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8039.08s)]
*  very, very deeply, being alienated from it [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8042.8s)]
*  and then finding a post-conscious relationship to it [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8046.200000000001s)]
*  and the self-expression within it. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8050.320000000001s)]
*  And I think that helping people with that journey [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8055.16s)]
*  is really important. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8057.24s)]
*  And also I love engaging with all them motherfuckers. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8059.96s)]
*  I just love, whether my current projects are like [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8063.28s)]
*  cutting edge science and AI, just brilliant scientists. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8067.0s)]
*  It's incredibly interesting and being deeply involved [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8069.88s)]
*  with the Boston Celtics, like just the very top [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8072.679999999999s)]
*  of the NBA world and my relationship with Joe Masulo, [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8074.96s)]
*  the head coach and kind of coaching the coaches [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8077.719999999999s)]
*  a modality that I've been playing in for a long time. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8079.4s)]
*  Helping the leader of an organization express themselves [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8082.24s)]
*  as the coach of their people is a big part of what I do [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8085.32s)]
*  and a couple other interesting investing in tech projects. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8088.32s)]
*  And just helping some, it allows me to play [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8090.84s)]
*  in fascinating realms and then studying [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8095.28s)]
*  the interconnectedness. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8097.84s)]
*  I mean a big part of my passion is [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8098.679999999999s)]
*  thematic interconnectedness. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8101.28s)]
*  Like how is what's happening with the Boston Celtics [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8102.719999999999s)]
*  the same as what's happening in this [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8104.44s)]
*  cutting edge science program? [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8105.48s)]
*  The same as what's happening in this wildly interesting [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8107.0s)]
*  tech investing program, right? [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8108.799999999999s)]
*  And how do those principles, those interconnecting fibers [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8111.08s)]
*  relate to culture more broadly? [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8113.16s)]
*  And relate to me and what I'm doing every day [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8114.68s)]
*  on the water, boiling. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8115.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's Miyamoto Musashi. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8118.88s)]
*  Once you understand the way broadly, [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8121.84s)]
*  you can see it in all things. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8123.160000000001s)]
*  So the Book of Five Rings, right? [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8124.56s)]
*  Like to me, I feel that I cannot believe [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8125.92s)]
*  how few people have studied Musashi deeply. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8129.240000000001s)]
*  Right, I mean whether you're reading the novel [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8132.08s)]
*  about his life and then studying, [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8134.200000000001s)]
*  like Book of Five Rings, I think everyone should read [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8135.360000000001s)]
*  like 10 times, maybe a day a page, 10 times over. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8138.08s)]
*  I, you know one of my favorite cadences of Musashi [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8142.84s)]
*  is in so many chapters of Book of Five Rings [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8147.44s)]
*  how he comes back and says, like essentially [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8149.639999999999s)]
*  these words are empty, you have to practice it [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8151.96s)]
*  as a way of life. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8153.4s)]
*  Yes. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8154.24s)]
*  Again and again and people just skip these things [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8155.2s)]
*  but they don't realize, and everyone wants [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8157.8s)]
*  to be told what to fucking do. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8159.88s)]
*  As opposed to understanding they have to work [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8162.32s)]
*  for the path to figure out what the fuck they should do. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8164.5599999999995s)]
*  And you have to practice as a way of life. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8168.639999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8170.72s)]
*  Yeah, talk about a real motherfucker. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8172.52s)]
*  Well, just fascinating that he learned this [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8174.360000000001s)]
*  by being a sword fighter. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8176.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8177.6s)]
*  What is the best way to be a sword fighter? [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8178.4400000000005s)]
*  You can have no bullshit in your mind. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8180.8s)]
*  So you must be balanced. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8183.120000000001s)]
*  And his approach was you must be an artist, [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8184.76s)]
*  you must be a poet, you must be a warrior, [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8188.360000000001s)]
*  you must be in tune with all of your feelings [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8190.96s)]
*  and all of your senses and everything about you [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8195.24s)]
*  and to do everything correctly. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8197.84s)]
*  Do all, all things. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8199.84s)]
*  And he was fighting to the death. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8202.16s)]
*  To the death. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8203.0s)]
*  So there was no bullshit. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8203.84s)]
*  Right. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8204.68s)]
*  There was no room for. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8205.52s)]
*  He killed 62 men in one on one combat. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8206.36s)]
*  You can't say like, oh no, that wasn't my fault. [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8208.12s)]
*  That doesn't fucking work. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8210.6s)]
*  No, you take your shit on. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8212.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8213.84s)]
*  But there's something so beautiful [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8214.68s)]
*  about the truth telling nature of living. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8215.52s)]
*  Like if you, you know when you're in a jujitsu team [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8216.960000000001s)]
*  and you've got some, you watch someone [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8219.92s)]
*  who doesn't think they're competing for a while [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8221.6s)]
*  but then suddenly they're competing next week, [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8223.36s)]
*  how the repertoire compresses, [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8226.04s)]
*  like all the fat just flies off. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8227.960000000001s)]
*  Right? [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8230.48s)]
*  There's something so beautiful about that process [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8231.32s)]
*  and the cadence. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8232.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8233.24s)]
*  And like, if we live putting ourselves in the flame, [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8234.06s)]
*  then we're not gonna be bullshitting ourselves all the time [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8237.08s)]
*  because there's this truth telling modality. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8239.039999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8240.68s)]
*  So the question is, how can we, [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8241.52s)]
*  how can we, as many of us as possible, [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8243.039999999999s)]
*  live in some form that's true to us [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8245.039999999999s)]
*  where we are, there's this grounded truth telling, [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8247.72s)]
*  accurate feedback loop in what we're doing. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8250.8s)]
*  We're practicing as a way of life. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8253.039999999999s)]
*  My fear is that there's so many of us, [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8253.88s)]
*  probably even people that are listening to this right now, [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8256.84s)]
*  that have never developed that aspect of their life. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8258.84s)]
*  And it's very difficult to get started on that path [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8263.2s)]
*  once you've been on this path of complacency and comfort. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8267.12s)]
*  It's very hard for people to sort of embrace [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8271.24s)]
*  this new way of thinking and interfacing with reality. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8273.84s)]
*  But when things are hard, that's beautiful. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8276.960000000001s)]
*  Like that's the beginning. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8278.12s)]
*  We want things to be hard. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8278.960000000001s)]
*  So the first thing is, I think we want people to love [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8279.880000000001s)]
*  the discomfort of being hard. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8282.04s)]
*  It's hard, fucking great. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8283.78s)]
*  Everything worthwhile is hard. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8284.76s)]
*  Right. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8286.12s)]
*  What have you done that's been interesting [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8287.199999999999s)]
*  that hasn't been hard? [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8289.519999999999s)]
*  Every time you get in an ice plunge, it's fucking hard. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8291.0s)]
*  Like I cold plunge every day, I think you do too, right? [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8293.679999999998s)]
*  Yeah, like it's a way of life. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8296.16s)]
*  It's fucking hard every time. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8297.4s)]
*  It's not easy. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8299.0s)]
*  Hard is beautiful. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8299.96s)]
*  Living on the other side of pain, [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8301.0s)]
*  that's where things get valuable. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8302.039999999999s)]
*  We're not doing it. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8303.119999999999s)]
*  And knowing that you didn't do it. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8304.199999999999s)]
*  That's hard, that's not good for you. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8306.08s)]
*  No, that's not good. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8307.72s)]
*  If you let that part of you, when you're 40 seconds in, [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8309.679999999998s)]
*  you're like, let's get the fuck out now. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8312.8s)]
*  If you let that part win, you'll feel terrible [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8314.640000000001s)]
*  for the rest of the day. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8317.12s)]
*  But if you just hang in there for two minutes [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8318.2s)]
*  and 20 seconds more, you'll feel so good. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8319.880000000001s)]
*  You get out of there, you're like, all right, [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8322.880000000001s)]
*  got this one done. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8324.720000000001s)]
*  It's like you go foiling and you don't fall. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8325.56s)]
*  That's a terrible day, man. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8327.52s)]
*  Because you're not pushing your turns hard enough. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8328.960000000001s)]
*  You're not breaching enough. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8330.24s)]
*  You're not ripping it around hard enough, right? [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8331.08s)]
*  Like everyone finds these, it's like one thing [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8333.2s)]
*  that happens with investors, right? [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8336.36s)]
*  They become successful and then they develop a mental model [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8337.68s)]
*  to replicate the success, right? [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8341.76s)]
*  They figure out a mental model to become a groove [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8343.36s)]
*  that they can follow. [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8345.199999999999s)]
*  But then the groove becomes a rut they get stuck in. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8346.48s)]
*  And then it starts to collect water and it's stagnant water. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8348.8s)]
*  And then they hold to an old mental model [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8351.16s)]
*  based on a success 10 years ago or 20 years ago. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8353.119999999999s)]
*  And they're trapped in it for the rest of their lives. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8355.64s)]
*  It happens again and again in every field, right? [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8357.76s)]
*  Some early success creates, you make a framework, [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8360.119999999999s)]
*  you make a modality, you create a mental model. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8362.8s)]
*  You replicate the success. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8364.88s)]
*  It's not working, but you stick to it [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8366.119999999999s)]
*  because your identity gets connected to that mental model. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8367.4s)]
*  And you're not living with dynamic quality. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8369.76s)]
*  Your qualities become static. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8372.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's so hard for people to recognize [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8375.679999999998s)]
*  when that's happening as well. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8377.96s)]
*  Because once people get success, [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8380.039999999999s)]
*  then the fear of losing that success overwhelms them. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8382.08s)]
*  And then sometimes it's easier to control a person [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8385.519999999999s)]
*  who's been successful because they don't want [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8388.679999999998s)]
*  to let this go. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8391.119999999999s)]
*  They don't wanna go back. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8392.279999999999s)]
*  They wanna move forward. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8393.759999999998s)]
*  They wanna continue. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8395.0s)]
*  So what do I have to do to make sure that I'm, [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8395.839999999998s)]
*  I mean, you see this in Hollywood. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8397.64s)]
*  It's a big thing in Hollywood. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8398.92s)]
*  People panic when they start doing well, [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8400.560000000001s)]
*  and then they align themselves [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8403.16s)]
*  with other people doing well. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8404.24s)]
*  And then it kind of changes the way they think [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8405.24s)]
*  and the way they behave because everything is dependent [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8407.08s)]
*  upon you being chosen for things. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8410.28s)]
*  So your whole life is like wondering [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8412.960000000001s)]
*  what your social status is and how you advance that. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8415.32s)]
*  And hey, what do I have to say? [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8418.52s)]
*  What should I tweet today [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8420.0s)]
*  to make sure everybody knows I'm on the right side? [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8421.32s)]
*  Right, then you're playing not to lose. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8423.4s)]
*  You're not playing to win. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8424.36s)]
*  It happens all the time in sports. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8425.36s)]
*  Like if you're a basketball team [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8426.6s)]
*  and you've been dominating the game [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8427.640000000001s)]
*  and you're up eight or 10 in the fourth quarter, [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8428.8s)]
*  then you start to protect the lead. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8430.759999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8432.119999999999s)]
*  No, you didn't get the lead [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8432.96s)]
*  because you were protecting the fucking lead. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8433.8s)]
*  You were dominating with aggression. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8435.08s)]
*  Right. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8436.519999999999s)]
*  The moment, it's like the prevent defense, [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8437.359999999999s)]
*  in my opinion, is the worst thing [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8438.199999999999s)]
*  ever created in sports strategy. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8439.759999999998s)]
*  Right, like you know what prevent defense? [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8442.519999999999s)]
*  I've heard of it, but I don't know exactly. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8444.519999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's like if you're a football team [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8445.359999999999s)]
*  and you have a 14 point lead in the fourth quarter [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8446.359999999999s)]
*  or an eight point lead in the fourth quarter, [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8450.24s)]
*  and you stop doing the dominant things [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8452.199999999999s)]
*  that got you the lead, but you start protecting the lead. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8455.439999999999s)]
*  So your defensive backs sit back. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8457.6s)]
*  You start allowing eight or 10 or 12 yard completions. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8459.16s)]
*  It is now you're protecting the lead [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8462.16s)]
*  versus dominating the opponent. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8463.52s)]
*  But then you let the opponent feel their strength, [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8465.12s)]
*  feel their greatness. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8466.76s)]
*  They're not dominating anymore. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8467.880000000001s)]
*  Like a moment a fighter stops feeling dominated [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8469.16s)]
*  and starts to tap into their greatness, [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8472.2s)]
*  then your fucking opponent's a beast again. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8473.84s)]
*  Right. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8475.52s)]
*  Right, we see it all the time. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8476.36s)]
*  All the time. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8477.2s)]
*  Right, so don't protect the fucking lead, dominate. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8478.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8480.12s)]
*  Right? [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8480.960000000001s)]
*  I do what brought you to the dance. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8481.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8483.04s)]
*  It's just, it's- [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8484.800000000001s)]
*  In life. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8486.52s)]
*  I think that thing that you're talking about [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8488.12s)]
*  is very critical, that fear of losing once you've won. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8489.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8492.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8493.800000000001s)]
*  It's very interesting in the surf world. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8494.640000000001s)]
*  So many people I've observed who are great surfers, [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8495.480000000001s)]
*  they want to learn to foil [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8497.880000000001s)]
*  because foiling opens up so much. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8499.32s)]
*  Right, you can foil all the time in different conditions [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8501.6s)]
*  and sloppy conditions and ocean, big waves, small wave. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8503.880000000001s)]
*  It's just, it's so abundant [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8506.960000000001s)]
*  and they can see how epic it is, [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8508.44s)]
*  but then they try once and they get their ass kicked. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8510.880000000001s)]
*  It doesn't matter how good a surfer you are, [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8513.68s)]
*  not talking about e-foil, [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8515.04s)]
*  not talking about wave foiling, high performance gear. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8515.88s)]
*  You're gonna have two, three months of ass kicking [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8518.839999999998s)]
*  as part of it. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8520.439999999999s)]
*  It doesn't matter how good you are as a surfer. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8521.279999999999s)]
*  But now you have to be, you have to look like a beginner [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8523.679999999998s)]
*  again, you have to go from being the coolest guy [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8527.64s)]
*  in the lineup if you're socialized [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8529.839999999998s)]
*  to being the quote unquote kook, [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8531.92s)]
*  being the guy who's just getting his ass kicked [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8533.24s)]
*  who's falling all the time. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8534.56s)]
*  Right? [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8536.119999999999s)]
*  And they don't want to do that. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8536.96s)]
*  So their ego of the excellent surfer [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8537.779999999999s)]
*  prevents them from learning this art they want to learn [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8540.039999999999s)]
*  because they're unwilling to look bad for a while [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8542.8s)]
*  in front of the people who they're used to looking good with. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8545.48s)]
*  Right, they're so used to being cool. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8547.4s)]
*  So the foilers are people who, [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8549.08s)]
*  it's a very interesting micro culture inside of surfing [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8550.84s)]
*  is that foilers have been people who learned [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8553.88s)]
*  how to foil because they were willing [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8555.359999999999s)]
*  to get their ass kicked and look bad. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8557.72s)]
*  Are there any other things that are exciting to you [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8559.14s)]
*  like that, that you think of? [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8560.92s)]
*  Like if one day you can't foil any longer, [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8562.58s)]
*  do you have like an escape strategy? [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8565.619999999999s)]
*  I don't have an escape strategy. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8567.96s)]
*  I never did. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8569.24s)]
*  I never had like, this is gonna be plan B. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8570.199999999999s)]
*  I've never been a plan B guy. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8572.08s)]
*  I know I could recreate myself, [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8573.64s)]
*  but I love this art profoundly [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8577.4s)]
*  and I love being in the ocean. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8579.16s)]
*  Like there's something about this, [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8580.32s)]
*  this is like to me also, [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8582.24s)]
*  this is not about destroying anything. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8583.72s)]
*  It's not about beating anybody. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8585.039999999999s)]
*  It's about self-discovery, [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8586.279999999999s)]
*  pushing my limits in the ocean, which is an element. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8587.84s)]
*  And the foil taps into ocean energy so fucking potently. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8590.88s)]
*  And the other thing is that the art [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8594.72s)]
*  is at such an early stage of technological growth [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8597.08s)]
*  that foil gear is progressing so quickly [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8600.279999999999s)]
*  and the people who are actually at the bleeding edge [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8601.92s)]
*  of foil performance-wise can ride this gear, [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8603.8s)]
*  which is increasingly difficult to ride. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8606.48s)]
*  But the hardest gear to ride is the gear [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8608.08s)]
*  which can do the most epic shit. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8610.2s)]
*  And so the sensitivity is like, [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8612.48s)]
*  as the gear requires more and more sensitivity, [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8614.6s)]
*  the sensitivity is cultivated. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8616.84s)]
*  And very few people in the world can do it on this gear [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8619.7s)]
*  and it's just so sublime. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8623.6s)]
*  So I'm so fucking in love with this art. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8625.44s)]
*  I do not have a plan B, but you know, fuck, [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8628.04s)]
*  who knows what happens. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8630.66s)]
*  I love when people love things. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8631.98s)]
*  Oh, me too. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8632.98s)]
*  That's one of my favorite things to watch [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8633.82s)]
*  is people that are just absolutely engrossed [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8635.54s)]
*  in what they're doing and are fascinated by it [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8637.82s)]
*  and in love with it and on the journey. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8639.66s)]
*  It's very addictive. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8642.38s)]
*  It's very inspirational. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8643.34s)]
*  It gives you something. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8645.66s)]
*  It's like there's something out of watching people [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8646.86s)]
*  and learning from people that are really, really passionate [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8649.06s)]
*  about something that's so contagious. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8651.74s)]
*  I've never loved an art more. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8653.34s)]
*  Like I've loved some arts really fucking deeply in my life. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8654.5s)]
*  Foiling is number one. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8657.46s)]
*  I've never loved an art more. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8658.88s)]
*  Maybe it's because I'm at this moment of life where I'm at [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8660.3s)]
*  and I'm like integrating everything I've learned [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8663.34s)]
*  from different arts and bringing it into this one [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8665.34s)]
*  and this one's manifesting all of it. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8667.06s)]
*  But in terms of like the day-to-day experience of it, [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8668.779999999999s)]
*  oh yeah, man, I'm a lunatic. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8671.859999999999s)]
*  I fucking just love it. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8673.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8675.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so you have to live by the ocean. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8676.58s)]
*  You're fucked. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8678.58s)]
*  I do. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8679.4s)]
*  That's beautiful. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8680.24s)]
*  I live right where the jungle meets the ocean. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8681.08s)]
*  You were telling me before we wrap this up, [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8683.019999999999s)]
*  you were telling me about a crocodile encounter. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8685.039999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, that was before I started foiling. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8688.44s)]
*  I was surfing and it was like 5 a.m. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8693.36s)]
*  and I was flying back to New York that day. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8697.2s)]
*  So I went out for like a just pre-sunrise, [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8701.94s)]
*  right at sunrise surf. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8704.480000000001s)]
*  And I was on this glassy like head high wave [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8705.62s)]
*  and this gnarled log came up in front of me, [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8709.04s)]
*  this piece of fucking wood. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8712.28s)]
*  And I saw it and I hit it and jumped off. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8713.560000000001s)]
*  It just emerged right in front of me. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8715.68s)]
*  I didn't know how I didn't see it. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8716.62s)]
*  I thought it was a big tree. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8717.5s)]
*  And when I hit the water, my brain was still thinking log, [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8718.5s)]
*  but it was so interesting. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8721.66s)]
*  My skin lit up, goosebumps, [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8722.699999999999s)]
*  and I just realized like red alert, [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8725.3s)]
*  like prehistoric danger. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8727.339999999998s)]
*  And I jumped back on my board [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8729.539999999999s)]
*  and this like 10, 11 foot croc came swimming, [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8731.5s)]
*  just a few feet away from me. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8734.38s)]
*  It was so interesting. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8735.939999999999s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8736.779999999999s)]
*  I spent my life, like I spent a lot of, [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8737.599999999999s)]
*  since I was six years old, [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8739.22s)]
*  I've been free diving, spearfishing, [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8740.06s)]
*  with a Hawaiian swing, Hawaiian sling, [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8741.699999999999s)]
*  like bow and arrow underwater, deep, deep water diving. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8743.38s)]
*  I spent tens of thousands of sharks, [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8746.38s)]
*  but this was so different. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8748.46s)]
*  Like croc energy, and I don't know crocs, [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8749.98s)]
*  like I know sharks, I don't know crocs. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8753.06s)]
*  And it was fucking wild. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8755.02s)]
*  Well, crocs are actively trying to eat you. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8755.859999999999s)]
*  Sharks, I mean, there's a lot of people that believe [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8757.98s)]
*  that sharks are attacking people [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8760.22s)]
*  because the people are where the sharks are [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8761.52s)]
*  and they don't want the people there. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8763.859999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8765.46s)]
*  You know, like when they're interfering [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8766.279999999999s)]
*  with their hunting grounds [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8767.44s)]
*  and they attack people in that regard. [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8768.74s)]
*  I've heard people say that and I'm like, [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8770.58s)]
*  ooh, that kind of resonates. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8771.779999999999s)]
*  That makes sense. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8773.1s)]
*  But crocodiles are different. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8774.18s)]
*  They're just hunting everything. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8775.42s)]
*  And if you're there, you're on the menu. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8777.5s)]
*  They're hyper aggressive. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8779.519999999999s)]
*  They're very different than alligators, [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8781.14s)]
*  which are also very dangerous, [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8782.58s)]
*  but crocodiles are significantly more dangerous [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8783.839999999998s)]
*  and more aggressive. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8787.38s)]
*  It was interesting, when I hit the water, [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8788.9s)]
*  my body lit up like I was in the water with a dinosaur. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8790.099999999999s)]
*  And then it came up, and it's interesting that my body, [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8794.0s)]
*  this speaks to the nature of the intuition, right? [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8796.14s)]
*  Because my mind still thought it was a log. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8797.74s)]
*  I hit the water, something energetically told me something, [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8799.82s)]
*  get the fuck out. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8803.34s)]
*  And then it came swimming right up next to me. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8804.179999999998s)]
*  And like the feeling of the snout, the eyes, [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8807.039999999999s)]
*  like it just came. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8809.22s)]
*  And then another wave was coming in. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8810.5s)]
*  I managed to just pop up and ride the next wave [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8812.259999999998s)]
*  to the beach. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8814.539999999999s)]
*  God damn. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8815.38s)]
*  Yeah, and maybe if I knew the- [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8816.22s)]
*  That would have been the last day I foiled. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8817.039999999999s)]
*  Well, maybe like if I knew the language of crocs, [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8819.3s)]
*  like I know language of shark. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8822.66s)]
*  What's the language? [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8823.5s)]
*  Murder, kill, eat. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8824.38s)]
*  That's the language. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8825.74s)]
*  Maybe there's an internal language. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8826.66s)]
*  I do not believe that's true. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8827.859999999999s)]
*  I think they are the waste management of the ocean [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8830.34s)]
*  and of the ground. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8835.94s)]
*  I mean, they are there to make sure that anything [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8836.98s)]
*  that slips, anything that gets too close, [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8839.06s)]
*  anything that fucks up, it doesn't pay attention [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8841.18s)]
*  to the ripples in the water, that's a meal. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8843.22s)]
*  They clean up. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8845.98s)]
*  They're the cleaning crew. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8847.66s)]
*  They make sure that there's no weakness in the system. [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8848.78s)]
*  And they devour, and they live forever. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8851.6s)]
*  That's the crazy thing. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8855.18s)]
*  It's like the ones that they spotted in the early journeys [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8856.1s)]
*  when they were talking about, [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8859.22s)]
*  like there's talks of 40 foot plus crocodiles [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8860.14s)]
*  probably were real because crocodiles don't die of old age. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8864.74s)]
*  They don't have like a 20 year lifespan. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8869.699999999999s)]
*  They just keep growing. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8871.439999999999s)]
*  And if a crocodile lived before people had guns [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8873.4s)]
*  and they weren't on the menu, and you gotta imagine [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8877.699999999999s)]
*  they could live hundreds of years, [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8881.34s)]
*  hundreds of years eating deer and wildebeest [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8883.42s)]
*  and anything that fucked up, antelopes, [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8886.38s)]
*  anything that fucked up, anything they can get ahold of, [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8888.18s)]
*  and they just keep growing, they could be enormous, [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8890.300000000001s)]
*  enormous, enormous super predator dinosaurs [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8895.02s)]
*  that live amongst people. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8898.94s)]
*  I have a friend of mine who's a professional hunter, [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8900.98s)]
*  Jim Schakey, and he was flown to Africa [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8904.1s)]
*  because this particular village was being targeted [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8908.460000000001s)]
*  by crocodiles, so they hired hunters to hunt these crocodiles. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8911.16s)]
*  And while he was there, he said, [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8916.36s)]
*  everyone you would meet had a chunk taken out of them. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8917.68s)]
*  People were missing hands, some people were missing feet, [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8921.039999999999s)]
*  and while he was there, one of the women [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8923.96s)]
*  in the village got taken. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8926.16s)]
*  And they would set up these posts in the water [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8928.28s)]
*  so that the crocodiles couldn't get through [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8931.52s)]
*  to this one area where they would gather water [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8934.039999999999s)]
*  and wash clothes and do things. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8936.36s)]
*  The crocodiles had figured this out, [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8938.22s)]
*  so they went onto the shore, [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8939.88s)]
*  and then they would go into the water [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8942.2s)]
*  where the posts are and wait for them. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8943.94s)]
*  Oof. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8945.68s)]
*  Oof. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8946.880000000001s)]
*  Oof. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8947.720000000001s)]
*  So the feeling of humility and danger [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8948.56s)]
*  that you have relative to crocs, [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8951.36s)]
*  I have about AI relative to the ability [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8953.48s)]
*  to manipulate humans unless we take on our ability [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8958.720000000001s)]
*  to be manipulated as a way of life. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8962.32s)]
*  Like I feel it like that much in my skin. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8963.880000000001s)]
*  I think you're correct. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8966.76s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're correct. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8968.28s)]
*  I think it's gonna be an incredibly, [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8969.56s)]
*  incredibly challenging time in history, [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8971.28s)]
*  and one that I don't think the brightest amongst us [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8974.24s)]
*  can truly predict the outcome. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8977.92s)]
*  I wanna make one other point, [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8980.52s)]
*  which is that I think that when we talk about [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8981.68s)]
*  like training as decision makers, [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8985.56s)]
*  it doesn't matter how good you are at something. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8987.36s)]
*  It matters that you're on the road. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8989.98s)]
*  You're on the journey. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8991.6s)]
*  So let's just say people started to play chess. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8992.6s)]
*  It doesn't matter how strong a chess player you are, [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8994.6s)]
*  or if you're good or if you suck. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8996.44s)]
*  That doesn't matter. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8997.48s)]
*  It's a journey, right? [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8998.58s)]
*  If you're putting yourself in any arena that's objective [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=8999.56s)]
*  and you're trying your hardest [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9005.68s)]
*  and you have a feedback loop, [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9007.72s)]
*  like the mats, like the jujitsu mats, [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9008.92s)]
*  whatever they are for you, [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9010.359999999999s)]
*  and you look at the quality of your decisions [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9012.72s)]
*  and you jot down why, [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9015.619999999999s)]
*  and you are willing to change your mind, [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9016.92s)]
*  and you take on that training as a way of life, [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9018.76s)]
*  then you're on the road to like being grounded [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9020.92s)]
*  in like a way that we're not today. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9023.76s)]
*  And I think that being grounded in reality, [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9029.08s)]
*  in something like feeling the earth beneath our feet, [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9031.04s)]
*  in our process, [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9033.300000000001s)]
*  is a big part of how we're going to be able to navigate [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9034.72s)]
*  a world where everything is being deconstructed [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9037.0s)]
*  all the time by a superior intelligence, [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9038.84s)]
*  because we're gonna need to recreate ourselves. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9041.04s)]
*  But we have to have, you know how like, [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9042.36s)]
*  when you're deep into an art, [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9043.94s)]
*  like think about you with your knowledge of MMA, [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9045.04s)]
*  like you have this intuition about where the truth is, [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9048.24s)]
*  right, you have a sense for where it is, right? [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9050.58s)]
*  We need to cultivate that sense [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9053.26s)]
*  in an increasingly chaotic world. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9054.56s)]
*  And I do feel that like being involved [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9057.4s)]
*  in some kind of truth telling arena, [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9060.039999999999s)]
*  whatever it is, is a hugely important practice. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9063.44s)]
*  And then taking on the art of training as a way of life, [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9066.84s)]
*  is, I feel like it's one of our, [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9071.08s)]
*  and like that combined with getting the fuck off social media. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9074.08s)]
*  Really. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9077.6s)]
*  Amazing advice. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9078.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's my, [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9080.039999999999s)]
*  Thank you Josh. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9081.02s)]
*  That's my pitch. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9081.859999999999s)]
*  It was a lot of fun. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9082.68s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9083.52s)]
*  Yeah, I was really excited to do this, [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9084.359999999999s)]
*  and really happy to meet you. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9085.58s)]
*  So, really appreciate you. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqbdBiidWE&t=9087.58s)]
