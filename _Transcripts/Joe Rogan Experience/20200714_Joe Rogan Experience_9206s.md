# Joe Rogan Experience #1507 - Bob Saget
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [July 14, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY3CY36WAec)
*  Yee-haw Bob Saget. I am actually excited to be I'm excited to be anywhere but I'm especially
*  excited to be talking to you. I'm excited to be talking to you too. Thank you. And we
*  tested you. You're clean buddy. I am. You're free and clear of the virus. I did. I usually
*  have like Trump had someone take his SAT. I usually have someone take my COVID test for
*  me. Did Trump have someone take his SAT? Is that true? Yeah, it's true. Apparently. But
*  I don't know what's true. Right. What the hell is true anymore? Well, anything before
*  the Internet is hard and even during the Internet, it's hard because they splice things up and
*  edit. Oh, it's all sound bites. You could you could hate anybody or love anybody. I
*  know it's what you know, it's weird man is when the deep fake stuff like how long do
*  we have before you don't know what you're seeing? How long do we have before, you know,
*  we see like a world leader declaring war on us and we don't know if it's real? Yeah,
*  correct. How long? I say now. I mean, somebody could do it right now. I mean, I don't know
*  because North Korea could could fire a missile and it wouldn't go anywhere. I don't think
*  I like how they introduced new players. Like now you have to be worried about the sister.
*  Right. Notice that like the evil sister and she's thin. So you probably think she's mean.
*  She will be. She's gonna be very mad. Oh, yeah. She'll be a Karen. A Karen. Imagine
*  your fucking kids named Karen. What a bummer that must be if you're a nice person named Karen.
*  Well, it's like Corona beer. I mean, I can't believe they had to stop that. That's that makes
*  me sad. I mean, they stop the name. That's what I'm told. They stop making it. I don't know if
*  that's true. That's the source I heard. But I still enjoy a Corona. I'm not a fucking child.
*  I like Corona light. But what am I going to do? And then and then AIDS candy. That was a smart
*  move. You had to stop that diet. Can't. Yeah, it makes you lose weight. It's ironically sad.
*  Most people don't even know what we're talking about. It's a wide S. Right. Correct. It's called
*  it was a diet candy like a chocolate. Yeah. That you would eat. I never took it. I mean,
*  it's like the X lax for dieting. Oh, is it like a well, X lax actually helps you diet also.
*  But all it does is just get rid of the food that's in your body. It's not healthy. No,
*  no. I was somewhere once that I was on a modium because I was having a rough day.
*  I don't know what happened. That's another diuretic, right? Or it's constipator. Yeah. I
*  mean, it's it's it solidifies suppressant candy. Oh, so it's an appetite suppressant. So it's not a
*  no. It's X lax. X lax makes you it's a laxative. It helps you make sure you shit diarrhea. Explosive
*  explosively. If you eat the whole box, you can shit yourself to death. You could OD on it.
*  What is barf? What is barf? Barf is detergent. It's that's funny. Barf's a detergent. Is that real?
*  They did discontinue it because people vomit. Did they find out they really did discontinue
*  Corona beer? That sounds so ridiculous. It sounds that's what I heard from somebody. It's a classic.
*  There was also a candy called anal warts that they decided to take off the market.
*  You know, that's kind of shit that I see. Why do I do it? You never went there. Couldn't help
*  yourself. I could. You know what it is? All those years of full house. They were taking these actions
*  in order to comply with the measures taken by production of Corona beer. Halted the group.
*  See, and I don't understand why it had to be because they're fools. They're just chicken shit.
*  I think so. Nobody gives a fuck. You're not going to correlate. It doesn't correlate to me. No,
*  it doesn't. It's not called covid by the way. Right. And Corona coronaviruses occur every
*  single year. And now we can't see those ads of cool looking people. Gorgeously shot at the beach
*  with the lime and the beers right there. Mark Norman had a funny bit about that. He put it on
*  Instagram, but like it's almost like they already knew because like they're always someone alone.
*  Yeah. It's one person in an ice bucket with four beers or two people. I don't think it was because
*  of the name Corona. I think it was just because of the like lockdown period when people couldn't be
*  at work. Bro, somebody sent me something about Mexico. Holy shit. I had no idea there were that
*  many deaths every day in Mexico. There are so many murders right now in Mexico. Yeah.
*  Holy fuck. It's crazy. This is a bad week for murder. Yeah. This is this is Mexico,
*  but all over the states too. It's been crazy in New York City. Well, they told cops that first of
*  all, cops are trying to they're retiring left and right in New York. And then they told them they
*  can't restrain people by putting weight on them. They can't put a knee on their back or their neck
*  or any other place and they can't administer chokeholds. And there's all these jujitsu guys
*  who train cops that are like Henner Gracie put a video on his Instagram page. He works a lot with
*  cops, Jamie, Henner Gracie and explaining why it's a terrible idea. Like you can't control someone
*  any other way unless you use violence, unless you hit them with things. They used to be the old
*  nut squeeze back in the day. Well, you can meet somebody. Yeah. So he's a warning to Mayor de
*  Blasio, but de Blasio is a fool, man. He's he's a foolish person. Well, we have to have order,
*  but we also have to have peace. I don't know how they are. So we are so fucked up right now.
*  So fucked up. It got so far gone in so many of these precincts and so many of these these these
*  look at this one guy who literally does not know how to grapple and this cop tries to take him down.
*  Well, do you think is adrenaline an adderall in a person that is that?
*  I think that cop didn't know what the fuck he was doing. This is the thing. These cops don't
*  they they should all be you know, Andrew Yang said it best. He said every cop should be like
*  a purple belt in jujitsu. He's right. Everyone should know or judo or something. They should know
*  how to wrestle, how to defend themselves. And a lot of cops don't know anything. They literally
*  don't know how to defend themselves. So then they're left with weapons. There should also be a
*  psychological training as well. I understood. I heard someone speak. I believe it was
*  who's our Carl Sagan? He's Ross Tyson. Lovely guy. So you're talking about Neil deGrasse Tyson.
*  Yes. Thank you. Sorry. I didn't hear the first part. I'm going deaf slowly. Are you? I don't
*  have corona but the left ear is out. Really? No, I took a day quill. Did you ever play in a rock band
*  or anything? I have. Really? Well, I can beat. I play a guitar. I play guitar, stainless place,
*  the drums. Yeah, true. You guys get together? We do. We have a band room. We haven't done it
*  a while because we can't right now. Yeah, you can just get tested. Well, you're not going to get
*  Mike Love from the Beach Boys take COVID. I don't think you won't do it. I love that you gave me one.
*  Personally, but I love that I had one just now. Well, I think it's important for everybody to know
*  because you can get it mindfuck yourself and think you have it. I've mindfucked myself a bunch of
*  times like, am I short of breath? We've all done it. We do it at night. It's a panic attack. Yeah.
*  And it could be just I get allergies. And I've also had walking pneumonia because when I'm on
*  the road over the years, you just are on planes or international stuff. And you go like you're heavy
*  breathing. And then I find out, oh, I just did 10 dates in a row. Then I come back and my doctor
*  says, Bob, you have pneumonia. Yeah. So funk. Right. Yeah. And you don't know what the fuck's
*  coming out of the vents on the planes. It's like just being next to people that are farting in your
*  face to literally actual shit spray. They freckle you. They walk by when they go to the bathroom and
*  people don't know what freckling is. I'm not telling you. Yeah. There's a product called
*  freckled and they're taking it off the market. I wonder if people are going to go back to no
*  masks in public. I think there's going to be a certain number of people that are just going
*  to keep wearing masks. I think you're right. And when I was in Japan, I didn't understand
*  the mask theory, which was not about I don't think it was about a contagion type thing. It
*  was about cleanliness. It was about the air quality. I think it's also about being polite.
*  The Japanese culture, if you have sniffles or something like that, you don't want to give it
*  to someone else. They're more thoughtful and considerate. Now, that is what we're lacking
*  here. Yes. The people that are yelling, I'm not wearing a mask. You're taking away my rights.
*  See that lady in Florida? Yeah. A bar, she's given away 100 free meals to the people that
*  don't wear masks. Yeah. Florida has the fourth number of coronavirus cases on Earth. If Florida
*  was a country, it would have the fourth on Earth. Yes. Well, they opened it up to prove their point
*  that their Petri dish was impenetrable. Well, they opened it up to Disney World. They did.
*  They opened Disney World. And people love the idea of not waiting in line. So they're willing to die.
*  What is a skinny video of Disney World opening day? I'll find it. I saw this going around on
*  Saturday that there were some influencers that went because there's a lot of people on YouTube
*  that just go to Disney parks all the time. Yeah. And they were saying they felt sick and they just
*  went the next day and they're like, oh, this is fun. But all of our throats hurt real bad. Oh my God.
*  I think they all have it. Unless they were faking. They're probably. Well, there's a lot of
*  views. And then there's Splash Mountain. I mean, there's things that there's no way droplets don't
*  come out of you and go into the mouth of the person behind. You ever see the movie Outbreak
*  years ago with Dustin Hoppin? Yes. So there's an amazing shot in the movie. It's a point of view
*  of a flem ball and it's literally follows flem. A guy laughs. It's a comedy, of course,
*  laughs about a piece of flem comes out of his mouth. They follow point of view. They do CGI
*  or beginnings of it and it goes into another person's mouth. And that's how in a contagion
*  way that they should represented how this thing can travel. And I wear a mask.
*  It was funny when you had Bill Burr on here, who's a mutual friend. People do not understand that I
*  was goading Bill into going on a rant. I was fucking with them. They wrote it out like I really
*  don't wear. I have a mask in my fucking pocket. I wear one every day. No, you're it's funny because
*  everything's out of context. Everything's serious. But when that's that's what I'm trying so hard
*  because I'm a newbie at this. I'm on my 33rd episode. You're on the Hebrew calendar. You're
*  5748 episodes. You're 10 years of doing something that revolutionized this. So I just started it
*  because I was before COVID. I started it because I was doing shows and I'd be in a theater
*  and people would be yelling at each other. And I would go, guys, what are you doing? Or I'd have
*  a bit about prejudice when I was six years old, when there was profiling, when there was
*  segregated bathrooms. And I started talking about it. People would get angry in the show.
*  But you?
*  At me for at the world. One guy yelled the South will rise again.
*  This is pre COVID?
*  Pre COVID. The guy yelled out the South will rise again. My response was, sir, we're in Boston.
*  I was at the Wilbur.
*  He was serious?
*  He was 100% serious. And then they went and went to tag him. And I said, no, leave him be.
*  Unless someone continues, I deal with it. We deal with it.
*  The South will rise again.
*  Fucking Boston.
*  But they've had a long downtime. You lost in 1865. You're going to rise again?
*  The other thing is they're pulling down statues, right? So the statues are like,
*  they're like chocolate Easter eggs, Easter bunnies, the ones that are hollow.
*  So if a statue to me is less than an inch thick of the lining around it and it's hollow inside,
*  I think an inch, it could maybe stay up if it's heavy enough. But if 10 guys could pull it down
*  with a rope and it's made of aluminum, that's got to come down. That's like Jiffy Pop.
*  Here's the thing about these statues. This is one thing that people need to understand.
*  I'm only laughing about it, by the way, because I'm trying to find humor in what's so-
*  Chaos.
*  It's chaos.
*  Yeah, the dismantling of history.
*  Some of it should be dismantled. Some of those statues should go. They really shouldn't be there,
*  but they should take them and bring them to some sort of a civil war museum or something like that.
*  But a lot of those statues, there's look, there's Genghis Khan museums, right? There's museum pieces
*  on Genghis Khan. He killed 10% of the world's population while he was alive. There's something
*  about those statues though, that a lot of people don't realize, like they were really cheaply made
*  and put up very quickly in response to the civil rights movement. That's what people don't understand.
*  Those aren't like these long-standing homages to these great generals. No, they were in response
*  to the civil rights movement, so they started putting up these Confederate statues. That's
*  why they're made like shit. They were made really quickly.
*  They're shit. Tin foil.
*  They're garbage.
*  We could make them.
*  I bet we could.
*  Pie pans.
*  Yeah, we could.
*  But then you go to Grant-
*  Melt some aluminum foil.
*  You go to see Grant's tomb or Grant's statue. I mean, it's made of molten lava.
*  They probably want to take his thing down too. See, the thing is-
*  They want to take everything down.
*  Trump said something and everybody thought he was joking. Like, what's next? They're going to take
*  down Lincoln. They're going to take down George Washington. And everybody's like, get the fuck
*  out of here. They're not going to do that. But they are doing that. They are trying to take down
*  George Washington statues. And people are saying you should get rid of George Washington statues
*  because George Washington owned slaves and George Washington was a white supremacist.
*  He didn't want to own slaves. He wanted to abolish it from what I've read and from what I understand.
*  It would be so hard to know. It would be so hard to know other than what he wrote.
*  Unless you have a fucking time machine.
*  You're right. We don't even know what history is right now.
*  I try to watch all news things or none. I try to watch every single channel because I want to see
*  where the world's at.
*  Well, I think that's the worst way to get news is off television. I think you get
*  so much nonsense and so much posturing and virtue signaling and so much bias.
*  Like when I watched CNN, I was watching CNN when they were correcting Trump on these
*  things that he says. It wasn't even news. It was like this weird opinion piece that was on.
*  It's tabloid. It's all tabloid. Fox is tabloid. MNNBC. There's jewels in all of it though. There's
*  reality in all of it because you'll get just the right broadcaster, an actual broadcaster,
*  and news journalist. You'll get a couple of people that are that on every one of those networks.
*  Then you'll get a guest that feeds the beast. Rather, it's become like South Park.
*  It's going to be offensive to some people, what I'm going to say. It'll be like,
*  we have here the President of the United States and it's a split screen and also a midget.
*  And then they'll have a just because everyone has a voice and that's an offensive word by the way.
*  President of the United States. He's a comedian. No rim shot. Please don't hit the button.
*  But that's what they would do or a man in a hoop skirt. They would do that on South Park
*  constantly and we've kind of become that. Here's a person that has 10 million people looking at
*  them on whatever site you look at and then someone who has 5,000 people who has a YouTube
*  page that people go to. But it's just to start. Everybody goes to the news source they want that
*  validates what their opinion is. Or to get angry. My tune into Fox News just to get angry
*  or tune into CNN to get angry if you're on the other side. It's a weird time, man.
*  But it's got to come together. I know that's what you try to do that. I know that that's what,
*  I mean stand up is the root of that in a way. Yeah, because you can make fun of ideas that maybe
*  even someone agrees with the idea. But if you mock that idea and it's so funny, it gets them to laugh,
*  they have to think about it. You know, like if you like say if you're how beautiful is that amazing
*  to be able to do that. How bad do you want to do it right now? Oh, yeah, I'd love to do it right now.
*  I need to do it. I had this bit about Trump and I had this guy come up to me goes, he goes,
*  I'll tell you why that joke's good. He goes, I fucking love Trump. And that joke was hilarious.
*  Like when you can say when you can make fun of something that someone loves and they still
*  think it's funny, right? Yeah, then they have to think there's a skill to that. I try to do that.
*  I try to. It's impossible to come up with something that pleases every side and every perspective. But
*  I'm trying. But that's why I end up talking about my dick so much. Because it does it does lean left.
*  And it's a pleaser. It is a pleaser.
*  I might have to say that again sometime. It's a pleaser. It is a t shirt. You should sell t
*  shirts on your website. It's a pleaser. You just got me some merch ideas. That's a good merch idea
*  right there. Yeah, it's it's impossible to make everybody happy. Because here's one thing.
*  Everybody doesn't want to be happy. There's a lot of people that they love being miserable. They like
*  being angry. It's easier to be angry than it is to dig out and wake up positive and go I'm going
*  to try to write some things today. Yeah, that's right. I mean, R I G H T make things better in
*  the world by putting out my energy by trying to if there could just be a fucking discourse.
*  Yeah, it's just there's also with people that don't agree. But there's also a problem that we
*  have timelines. Like we have a deadline. We have a deadline. Our deadline is November or the world's
*  going to fall apart. We got to get rid of this motherfucker by November and everybody's clamoring
*  and trying to figure out how to do it and pretending Joe Biden's brain isn't melting and everyone's
*  running around trying to put together some sort of a well actually they got a mic stand duct tape
*  and a pipe cleaner. He's going to be fine. He's going to be there. He's going to weekend and burn
*  his ham all the way to the fucking cabinet. He's been doing some good putting out some stuff that's
*  pretty they wear go online. He's been giving tweeting no to some videos speeches things that
*  are a little bit more promising than some of the other deep fakes. That's not even him. That's the
*  guy. Is there a guy who does a good Biden impression? I have not heard a good Biden.
*  If we were doing stand up, there would be a guy who would have there'd be some comic.
*  I would think Dana Carvey would be able to do it. He's such a have you had him here? No,
*  I'd love to though. He and I love him so much. Yeah, he is one of the purest sweetest people
*  I've ever known. He was the his character of Lorne Michaels was the original Dr. Evil, right?
*  Yes. Mike Myers sort of Mike Myers, they hung out and it would always be the pinky in the mouth. And
*  yeah, yeah, it was it was Dana is an original. He's brilliant. Yeah, he's a brilliant. He's
*  we would sit around back when you were I think you were six, but we would go to fabs this
*  Italian restaurant on Van Nuys and we would be with our wives.
*  Fabs he stayed with his wife, my wife and I got divorced, but I have a new wife.
*  She's congratulations. Thank you. Van Nuys used to be a hotspot. I was looking at this video.
*  Yes. There's a thing was the LA Times had a photographic essay of Van Nuys Boulevard
*  in the 70s. And it was amazing. It was all these people with bell bottoms, and these cool cars.
*  And they used to on Saturday nights drive their cars up and down the road. It was fun. Yeah,
*  but it was like a place where people would go to cruise. Yeah, it was boogie nights without the
*  heroin and people getting harm giant prosthetic. Marky Mark prosthetic dicks. So we would sit there
*  and it was right before he got Saturday Night Live. What year was this? 86. It was one year
*  before he got that. And before I had been in a Richard Pryor movie, that was the first thing of
*  consequence. And then what movie was that critical condition? You got to work with Pryor. I got to
*  spend a month with him and I got to hang out with him because I was one of the hosts at the store
*  for eight years. And you got to work with Pryor when Pryor was Pryor. Well, it was after the fire.
*  But it was still 100% Pryor. It was after the fire. It was after the fire. He did Jojo Dancer.
*  And Critical Condition was directed by Michael Apte. He had a great director who did
*  Coal Miner's Daughter. Made a lot of important movies. Did the 7-Up series. Do you ever see that?
*  7-Up, 14-Up, 21-Up. Took seven people through their lives from London and followed them every
*  seven years to the documentary about them. Oh, wow. Just a real special, brilliant, lovely man. He
*  was head of the academy for a while. Anyway, so what happened was, but working with Pryor,
*  we were, you know, when you're doing a movie, we were in a shower stall in an old hospital
*  and it was supposed to be Rikers Island or whatever the hell that prison is up there. Is that,
*  is it Rikers? Which one? In New York. What's the? I think that's Rikers, right? Yeah. I think that's
*  what it was. It was representing that. But we shot it in High Point, North Carolina with really good
*  actors. Joe Montaña and Ruben Blades and all these Randall Tex cops. Some really cool. Oh, shit.
*  Cool, weird, eclectic group. And I just watched him the other day in Raising Arizona. He's a great
*  actor. That's great, man. That movie was wild. That's one of the best. That low point of view
*  shot in the supermarket. Images in that, in a lot of Coen Brothers movies. They're the best.
*  Come on, man. He's fucking shit. I love Brother Bieg Lebowski. Bieg Lebowski is my wife every day.
*  Let's just watch the Bieg Lebowski. It's fucking classic, man. It's a dude floating in space, man.
*  Sorry, I was interrupting you. So you're working with Pryor.
*  So we're in a shower stall and we became friends. We would go to dinner. I was the guy. I'm always
*  wanting to make things better somehow. I was raised that way by my dad and my mom to try to make
*  peace for people. That's the thing. And he liked that I would invite him because people
*  didn't invite him to shit because he was kind of unapproachable to some people.
*  So we would go to dinner and we would laugh and I would make him laugh. We had to do one scene,
*  40 takes, one shot. That was a long, steady cam shot. We had a dead body in it that was covered
*  in water. And I was supposed to say something like, oh, the guy was in the drink. We found it.
*  But it was such a fake looking body. And every time I said this serious line, I was this young
*  doctor. Richard just cracked up. And so he's looking in my face and there's no bigger honor.
*  Look at you. Look at you baby face motherfucker. How old were you then?
*  26, 27. Wow.
*  And that was a good scene. There's Ruben. I remember all of this. He and I, so he couldn't,
*  the fact that he couldn't look in my face and kept laughing and it was a serious scene. Do you know
*  what an honor that is? So the guy that was an idol. So I'm sitting in the shower with him and
*  he shows me this thing. This is graphic. He shows me the scrubbing brush and one side soft, the other
*  side is just bristles. And he says, I don't think he'd mind me telling you this. I always think
*  about when you talk about someone that you love that's deceased, would they be okay with what
*  you're saying? So it's not TMZ garbage. So he would take the hard scrubbing part and he said,
*  this is what they took my skin off with after the fire. They had to scrub my whole body with this
*  shit. And I just sat there and I remember crying. I think there was the combined empathy. And then
*  I told him of like my sister that died and then he was telling me, you just get close with people.
*  And then one night I didn't invite him to dinner because he'd had a hard day
*  and he was mad at me the next day. And I was like, oh my God. So he was enjoying. So I said,
*  but he was in a rough place. He was complicated human. But I remember saying to him, because
*  when you're acting, you're just, I don't know, I was green. I said, so you're upset with me. I'm
*  so sorry. This means we're friends, right? Because I upset you, right? And then we went to dinner
*  again. Cause cause that's like, he's the classic complicated comedian, right? Yeah. With the hardest
*  shit drug addiction, all the chaos grown up in a, yeah, everything. Yeah. He grew up in a brothel.
*  Yeah. I mean, that's his headshot on the wall over there. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, he was, I think he was
*  19 and he was doing the button down Bill Cosby way of doing standup. Yeah. But it's still,
*  when you look at everybody goes over, he went and flipped like George Carlin and all of a sudden he
*  was a different guy. He was still the same guy. You still saw, even though Cosby, I know was mad
*  at him because he thought he was lifting some of his stuff or because we would get mad at a lot of
*  people, but he's doing fine now. Well, I think everybody starts out in imitation of the people
*  they really love and respect. Who did you start out? Richard Jenny a lot. Yeah. He and yeah,
*  I remember on stage once I caught myself like a year in the comedy. I was like, Jesus Christ,
*  like I'm, I'm aping his mannerisms. Like I was, I was, but I don't see that when I got rid of it.
*  I realized that, you know, you become who you are, but in the beginning, you know, I think it's
*  normal. I mean, it happens with bands, you know, look, Stevie Ray Vaughan was deeply influenced by
*  Jimi Hendrix. It's like, and then he became Stevie Ray Vaughan, even when he does Voodoo Child. Like
*  if you listen to Stevie Ray Vaughan's cover of Voodoo Child, it's Stevie Ray Vaughan. It's still,
*  it's Voodoo Child, but it's Stevie Ray Vaughan's version. He became his own man. And I think all of
*  us in the beginning got into comedy because we wanted to be some comedian that we really admired.
*  And when I was just starting out, I got a chance to see Rich Jenny a few times. And I remember being
*  baffled by his ability to turn over material. It was stunning. It's so prolific. You're gonna make
*  me cry because I was close with him as close as you could get because he had such mental health
*  issues. I didn't believe he died. And I, Dave Coulier instant messaged me. That's not how you
*  want to find that out. So I called his number and his girlfriend the next morning and his girlfriend
*  answered and just said, it's true, Bob. And I went, oh, fuck, because I didn't believe it. I couldn't
*  believe it. I met him a few times. I saw him live a few times in the early days. And then once,
*  you know, this was like when I was an open mic'er, you know, I went to see him live at Catch Rising
*  Star in Cambridge when I was just starting out and I sat in the front row and he made fun of me.
*  It was great. Because I had seen him on The Tonight Show that the first time I'd ever seen him was on
*  The Tonight Show and he did a bunch of appearances on The Tonight Show. And then I'd seen one of his
*  TV specials, one of his hour specials. And then I got a chance to see him several times. And I've
*  told this story, forgive me if you heard it on the podcast, folks, but we were at Esod Comedy Club
*  and he had just been there and the host was just, I got there like Saturday night after The Late Show
*  and the host was like, he did four different hours. He did two different hours Friday night and two
*  different hours Saturday night and murdered. And they were like, Jesus Christ. And this was me,
*  I was like three years in a comedy. And I remember thinking, God damn, that is so,
*  that was so impossible to even imagine that someone could be that good. And then I got this
*  chance to see him a year later at the Comedy Works in Montreal as a part of the festival,
*  the Just For Laughs Festival. He was in that little, you remember, you ever worked that place,
*  Jimbo's place? No, no, no, I just did a show there at the Place des Arts for some broadcasted show
*  that I hosted. Jimbo, the guy who owned the club in Montreal, had this little tiny club that was
*  upstairs. He had a great bar downstairs. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I did it the night before. I was there,
*  yeah, I was there. That's where you go the night before anything. I did it with Jim,
*  Norton and, and, uh, I did it with Norton. Yeah. And Brewer. Yes, I did it with Brewer too. Yeah,
*  yeah, yeah, yeah, it was fun as shit. I was going, where the, what the fuck am I doing?
*  Always, you can't always play gigantic, well, you're taking over the world. You're, you know,
*  I like Little Places too, man, though. I love Little Places. But you play spaceships now.
*  I play big places, but I still- I admire the fuck out of what you're doing, by the way.
*  Thank you. I have to tell you that because, you know, there's like five people,
*  Kevin Hart thinks he's two of them, that can, but you know, comedy rock star shit. Yeah, I subscribe,
*  you know, and, and you're doing it and to be on a thing with Chappelle and to be able to do that
*  and to be able to go out there, especially where we're at right now. And this is not, I'm not,
*  there's no, nothing on my nose right now. I'm just telling you the truth from a heart.
*  It's, I do this, I've always done it, but more so now I'm 64 years old now, even though I look,
*  you know, 63. But you're, what you're able to do, if you can unify people in a room and,
*  or we're in a drive-in or at these giant places that you're doing, it is absolutely beautiful.
*  And especially now, whenever you're able to do those dates that are coming up, people will never
*  forget it. When we come out of this. That's very nice. I don't know if we're going to be able to.
*  I've kind of resigned myself to, I think we will. I'm fine. Listen, like legitimately,
*  I'm fine working in comedy clubs for the rest of my life. I don't give a fuck. I just like doing
*  standup. And that's one of the things that I've gotten out of this. You know, I've been doing
*  the last few years, I've been doing arenas and they're great, but so is the OR at the
*  comedy store. Yep. That's great too. I'm fine with that. I don't, I honestly, I just like doing
*  standup. If we can never do arenas again, if no one ever, no rock bands, no UFC ever does an arena
*  again, no football games are ever in a sold out arena. Okay. You can't do UFC in the OR.
*  Well, they're doing UFC with no crowd. That's true. And it's amazing. I love it. I've called
*  two, yeah, two fights now with no audience and it's, I enjoy it, man. It's great. I'm just happy
*  that the fights are happening. And like when I did, I did shows in Houston a couple of weeks ago.
*  Yeah. I was talking to you, wanted to talk to you about that. Yeah. Me, Tony Hinchcliffe and Brian
*  Moses, we did the Houston improv. We had a great time. First of all- It's a great room.
*  It's a great room. I was supposed to go there. I had to not because of what's going on now.
*  Yeah. But you went in, I was like, wow, brave motherfucker. Well, just fucking, we wanted to.
*  We just wanted to, first of all, I missed doing shows, but I miss hanging out with comics on the
*  road. It's fun. My buddy, Mike Young, we always tour together and it's like with my brother.
*  Yes, it's fun. And that's the big thing is like touring on the road with people you love.
*  It's the best because like Moses is the best. I love him and I love Tony. He hosts Rust Battle.
*  I know. He's great. And Tony is one of my best friends. So it's like to be with these guys,
*  we were just, from the moment we saw each other, we'd go to restaurants, we'd do shows. It was all
*  smiles and laughs. Like, holy shit, we're doing standup again. This is crazy. Moses had done the
*  weekend before. He did, I forget, oh, he did American Comedy Company in San Diego. He did
*  that place, which is apparently was open and now they're closed again. They closed La Jolla again,
*  too. They were doing the La Jolla store. Sorry to hear that. Well, you know, they've got to take
*  precautions. Listen, man, I was pretty nonchalant about it in terms of like not worried, but as
*  more time has gone on in terms of like getting sick, my fear is getting somebody else sick.
*  That's number one. Well, that's the key. That's what's fucking lacking and that's what's lacking
*  from our administration that there's empathy. We need empathy. Well, we were talking about that
*  earlier. We were talking about Mary Trump's book. I read some passages out of it today. I haven't
*  read the whole book, but I read this long piece on it about Trump's child. Was she close with him
*  as a kid when she was young? I don't know, but it's his niece. Her brother was his, or her father,
*  rather, was his brother. And you kind of understand. I mean, if she's being honest, and I'm assumed she
*  has, first of all, it's very well written. She's obviously extremely intelligent, like very eloquent,
*  like the way she's writing it. And I believe she has a background in psychology. And the way she
*  writes it, it doesn't, it's not like a hateful thing. Like she's basically explaining why he's
*  so fucked up and why he lacks empathy. And what she said was that the father was like a sociopath
*  and the mother was never around and was absent and didn't give him any love or attention and only,
*  according to her, used the children to comfort herself instead of being there for them.
*  And that he developed this narcissistic, self-centered personality in response to that.
*  And that his father would, you know, would, anytime he showed emotions or anytime he showed
*  his father would cast that aside and squash that inside of him.
*  That's very clear.
*  Yeah. So he developed this, that's the thing that's most disturbing about him. When I talk to people
*  that are fans of Trump and they say, why aren't you, like, what do you least like? I go, would I
*  least, look, first of all, I don't understand the economy. So when people say he's good for the
*  economy, he's good for business, is that short term? What does that mean long term?
*  That was pre-COVID. That's all that was.
*  The world's fucked economically post-COVID.
*  He is not the president for where we're at.
*  Right. But the thing that bothers me the most-
*  He could adjust if he would.
*  But he's not capable. The problem is the lack of empathy. Like when he would make,
*  like when he talked about John McCain, he said, I like soldiers that don't get captured. Remember
*  that? That is a crazy thing to say to a guy who's a war hero. I mean, it's funny, you know,
*  you're laughing at it because you're a comic, but-
*  I'm laughing at it because of the, it's ludicrous.
*  It's ludicrous.
*  I mean, I'm not laughing at it. I mean, it's horrific. I unfortunately will be the first
*  person to laugh at the worst gallows joke. Right. And then it'll get misquoted and then I'm an
*  asshole. And you've been misquoted lately, terribly.
*  There's no way around that. Especially in this day and age when they could redefine you with
*  something out of context. But the point is that what it shows, the lack of empathy is the last
*  thing we need right now. Well, we need empathy. We need someone who can say something that calms
*  people down and brings us together and inspires us, man. People need inspiration and we need to
*  know and understand that we are all in this together and we can go forth and pretend we're
*  not and keep burning buildings and keep going crazy and screaming in the streets for the heads
*  of politicians and kill the cops and all that crazy shit or-
*  Or take your mask off. That's my fucking right. And fuck you. He never, he wants love. That's
*  the crazy part. He wants to be loved. He thinks he's Don Rickles. He wants to, when he puts people
*  down and say, punch him in the mouth and stuff, he's trying to be that guy. I've known people
*  like him who are just assholes. Yeah, but Don Rickles wasn't an asshole.
*  That's why it worked. No, he was like a dad to me. He was-
*  He was a lovely guy. That's why it worked. He was loved.
*  When he would shit on you, it's like when guys-
*  No, it's a gift. It's like the pope. Yes. Right. Exactly. Like, you know, when guys,
*  some guys can shit on you and it's, look, that's the beauty of roast battle. Right.
*  Brian Moses' show. The beauty of roast battle is these people are shitting on
*  the most embarrassing aspects of each other and they're both laughing at it. And it's great.
*  And that's what Jeff Ross, that's his whole theory is I only roast the ones I love.
*  Yes. Which comes from the
*  old friars and old maskers before that. That's Ross's thing. I mean, he loves those.
*  He, back in the day- Everybody hack it and all that.
*  When you're in New York, he would be like, I'm going to the friars club. You want to come?
*  Like, what the fuck is wrong with you? You're going to hang out with a bunch of old dead men?
*  Like, that's how I looked at it. And how much fun did you have?
*  I didn't go. Oh.
*  But he was, but he was always that guy was my boy.
*  You really didn't want to be with a bunch of old dead men.
*  Listen, man, I, back then in particular, I was crazy. Like this is-
*  What were you doing at the time? 24, 25. I just, I had just stopped fighting.
*  I was just no longer competing. So I was still, I still had like this maniacal mindset. I was a
*  crazy person. You know, I just wanted to play pool and go stay up all night.
*  And were you single then? Yes. I didn't want to hang out with a bunch of old dudes.
*  Right. Old dudes and listen to some
*  old jokes and listen to them talk about the Jackie Gleason show. Like, nah.
*  No. Gotta go, bro.
*  The only thing- He always loved it.
*  I have one fun experience that Jeff took me there for lunch. I go there. This is maybe 15 years ago.
*  I think I was there because I was doing the Jack Black roast, which was at the Hilton. I was the
*  host. I was the, whatever you call it. The MC?
*  The roast master. Yes.
*  And so Jack was being roasted. It's for charity. And so I go there and I hadn't been in the Friars
*  and I sit there and I'm just sitting with Jeff and I get the phone. There's a phone next to me
*  and the phone rings. They go, Mr. Sack, I got the phones for you. And I pick it up.
*  And a man goes, look to your left. And I look to my left and it's an old Jewish guy with orange hair.
*  And he goes, fuck you.
*  I went, what? Who was it? Red Skelton?
*  I don't know. He looked like red buttons. I don't know. And I go, what? Do I know you?
*  He goes, fuck you. Welcome to the Friars. And he hung up.
*  That's hilarious.
*  And that was, that to me was kind of cool.
*  Now-
*  It's probably a COVID Petri dish now.
*  I don't think so. Those guys don't make it long enough to-
*  I think it's gone.
*  I think the Friars Club is gone. I would have loved, now as a person who appreciates the history of
*  comedy, I kind of wish I went to one of those things just to see what it was like to hang out
*  with those guys. I got to meet Red Skelton once. That was pretty cool.
*  That's really nice.
*  That was at an NBC event back when I was, I think I was on Fear Factor. But it was cool to meet him.
*  Did you enjoy that show?
*  Fear Factor?
*  Yeah.
*  I enjoyed the money. That's all I enjoyed. I enjoyed the people I worked with. They were fun
*  people. I enjoyed-
*  What year was that? When did you start?
*  2001 to 2006. I enjoyed, I enjoyed some of it. I enjoyed like when nice people won. I enjoyed,
*  I enjoyed like helping people overcome like this situation where they were really nervous
*  and I could coach them and talk them through because it brought me back.
*  Like I used to, I used to teach martial arts and I used to coach a lot of kids.
*  In particular, I'd bring them to tournaments and I would train them and then you know like these
*  14, 15 year old kids, I'd take them to tournaments and they'd be fucking panicking
*  and I would talk them through it. And I would say, you're going to get through this and you're
*  going to be a better person because you got through this because it's so scary. When you get through
*  something so scary, you become stronger and this is something you just have to go through.
*  And if you just shy away from this, you'll shy away from this your whole life.
*  But you can get through this. Other people have done it and you can do it too.
*  And I took a lot of that over to Fear Factor and that's what I, what I loved is those moments
*  where you would see someone overcome and then they would be so happy and I'd be so happy too.
*  I cried a bunch of times. That's why you're so good on it. I was doing the video show and
*  there were things I was like, well, this is my personality. And other times I go, okay, these are
*  people are flying in. They're being flown in to LA. They made a video of their kid reciting all
*  the presidents when he was two. They're all there and then I go, and what are you going to do with
*  the $10,000? And the father says, I'm going to make a down payment on our first house.
*  And the guy's like 50 years old. And I'm like, I'm glad I got this job right now. That's when I go,
*  it was worth to see all those people get hit in the nuts for no reason.
*  Yeah. That's like, there's, there's moments on in these competition shows where you really do feel
*  like you feel like the world got a little lighter, like people got elevated. When you see someone win,
*  you know, we see people win things. We see people, I love watching people do better. I love watching
*  them overcome. I love watching them like go through some difficult thing and figure it out and get
*  through it. And the feeling of relief and of, of, of just watching the adulation and everybody's
*  cheering and they're like, yes, and the surprise, and yet the producers know they've got something
*  special, but will it deliver? Howie Mandel is a dear friend forever and he's on America's Got
*  Talent. So here's a show that I always was against competition shows. I wouldn't go on Star Search
*  when I was broke. I just didn't believe in comedians competing against things. And then
*  did you ever go on any of those competition things? No, no, I didn't. So I'm watching America's Got
*  Talent and they have a handicapped person come out who sings just like you've never heard anyone
*  sing so good. And then you see the true joy in the people. It's not just showbiz bullshit,
*  selling something. And that's that feeling. That's that you came from something that you never
*  it's a dream fulfilled and it's about the human spirit. The human spirit. Yeah, that's real. I
*  mean, it's not people. It's so fun to be cynical for some people and the shit on that. But some of
*  my favorite moments in life, I used to be more cynical and shit on it. It's easy to be, especially
*  as a comic when you're struggling, when you're making your way through the, you know, we, we
*  joke about the worst things where, you know, a lot of us are bitter. A lot of us are jealous. I'm not
*  bitter, but I do joke about things. I can't, I can't do it. I know I need two minutes to tee up
*  some horrible joke and then three minutes to get the fuck out of what I just did. And that's going
*  to continue because I can't not say stuff. It is a part of being a person who's a standup comedian
*  that you know that there's a thing you're not supposed to say and you're going to say it. And
*  if you do say it, you know, I'm going to laugh and you're going to say it and I'm going to laugh.
*  We're going to go, you motherfucker. I can't believe you said that. When do I have asked us
*  of many comedian friends and people, when did you think, I mean, is it, is it the teenager in us?
*  Is it that guy that's being told, don't do this? Is it, or did you lock in at 16? Do you feel,
*  I kind of feel sometimes I locked it at nine because that was the world hadn't fallen apart
*  for me. I didn't see what fuck, how fucked up everything was. I mean, you could go deep
*  psychologically with it, but I think at the end of the day we enjoy, first of all, when comedians
*  are around comedians is when that shit's the worst, right? That's when the most gallows humor.
*  Oh, I try to out worst everybody. And that's how I made friends.
*  Well, that's when you take those things out of context in quotes, that's when you're going to
*  get the most in trouble. People don't, they, it's there, it's going to, for a non-comic to understand
*  some of the horrible shit we'll say at Cantor's deli at two o'clock in the morning and be laughing,
*  ah, like dying, falling under the table. And all we're trying to do is make each other laugh. It's
*  not more horrible, mean people secretly hoping everybody gets cancer. That's not what we're
*  doing. We're just, we're saying inappropriate things because it's fun to do because I know you're a good
*  guy and I know you don't mean it. That's the only way it works. It's letting air out of the pressure
*  cooker. Yeah. It's stating, that's why people go, how could you do that? It's too soon. You don't do
*  that joke. Sometimes you don't do that joke. I mean, you know, Brian Holtzman, vaguely. Yes.
*  Brian Holtzman is a legend for doing material way too soon that only makes comics laugh,
*  but he'll do it on stage. Do you remember Susan Smith? She's a lady who drowned her children.
*  Yeah. And at first she said someone stole the car or something like that. And then it turned out
*  Brian Holtzman's on stage the week that happens. And he goes, I heard those were bad kids. He goes,
*  I heard they sat that close to the TV. They never put away their blocks. They spilt their milk.
*  Those kids will not be missed. And people are like, oh my God. That's the whole, they had it
*  coming thing. We were crying. We couldn't believe. And you know, people would say, oh, these horrible
*  comedians, they love this shock and they're just mean and they just want mean comedy. It's not even
*  that. It's hard to explain to a person that's outside of the business. But to, to me, like,
*  like if I'm around Jeff Ross and something like that happens, I expect that he's going to turn
*  to me and say something fucked up to be the first person to say it. And I go, Jeff, no,
*  but I'm saying no with love. Yes, of course. Of course. I actually, I'm going to date myself.
*  I don't have to now because I'm married. That's the kind of jokes I shouldn't do. No, that's the
*  one thing. But I know as I'm saying them, but I still say it. It's a dad joke thing.
*  Yeah. Bill Burr said to me, he was a guest on my, my, my, my new bio podcast. And Bill said to me,
*  you know what your act is? Sagat said, your act is all the lines you couldn't say on full house.
*  And you just say fuck all around it. That's what your act is. And I went, what, what do you say?
*  And then he pummeled me for 20 minutes and I fucking loved it. And then I attacked him for
*  like 10 minutes, but he is, he's one of the best people. He's one of my favorite people.
*  He's one of my favorite people on the earth. He went to my wedding. I just wanted to wind him up.
*  Oh fuck. I was, I was, I had nine stories to start, but that's why this is, I'm so happy to
*  be doing this. Thank you. My pleasure. Thank you. I haven't talked to anybody. I know you've been
*  stuck, right? Well, I had a zoom last night, uh, night before with a Norman Lear and a bunch of
*  musician friends. Oh wow. And we talk about the world and we talk about what the fuck are we
*  going to do. And, and it's just, uh, interesting. It's, it's, and we used to, we would do it in
*  person. We'd all sing songs for four or five hours into the night and have different friends
*  show up. Stamos came, John Mayer came, Dave Kaz always comes to it and it'd be music.
*  You play, right? No. I thought you were a musician. No, zero musical talent. But you love,
*  I love music. Love it. Yeah. The one, one of the things I love about music is I don't know how to
*  do anything. I don't know how to, I mean, I love that. I can just enjoy it. You should start a band
*  though. Just for the fuck of it. Yeah. Yeah. Just get, take three people that can't play.
*  No, I'm a bit too busy, but I do, I do love music. I love it. One of the, one of the things I love
*  about is the fact that I have no skin in the game. Uh, you know, it's like, I love comedy,
*  but I do it, you know? So when I see someone make a great bit, part of me is like, God,
*  I wish I wrote that. Right. I get, I don't get jealous, but I go like, fuck. Yeah. Or I'll see
*  it and go, wait, I did that 20 years ago. Well, there's always that, right? There's always parallel
*  thinking. But the other thing that gets me is like, if I see someone really kill, I want to go home
*  and write. It's like, I get inspired to create. Whereas music just makes me happy. Like if I,
*  like I've had like my friends, honey, honey, come in here and play and Gary Clark Jr's been in here
*  and Everlast has played in here. Like you have a bunch of people play music in here and there's,
*  there's something about watching someone do something that you have zero talent in.
*  It's really special. Well, I think comics really do. We want to be musicians. We worship music.
*  Some. Yeah. Some. I mean, I, yes, not all of them, obviously. Yeah. I never had any desire to be a
*  musician at all. Zero. No. No. Burr plays the drums like a son of a bitch. Well, I was talking,
*  I was going to say something about him. I finally did something that actually stayed on topic. I
*  think he came to my wedding and then he had to go do a gig and he does the gig and his wife stayed
*  and he comes back in a different outfit, like a pink jacket. He left my wedding and is such a good
*  friend. He came back again because he was so happy for me because who the fuck else would want me
*  than my wife? And he's just, I was there in Philly at the, at the, in Camden at the
*  tweeter center, it was called when we were on the Opie and Anthony virus tour.
*  So it was Tracy Morgan, myself, Louis C.K. Is that the one where Domarera got heckled and he went on
*  and he literally attacked the crowd. It made Bill Burr a legend. That was when Bill, I was
*  he was standing there. I was standing there. I was at under the fucking monitor right through
*  the curtain that I was going to come out. I had the sweet spot, you know, Bob will do like 25
*  minutes in the middle because I'm, yeah, I was just a bitch. So then they put me there and it was a
*  sweet spot because you take a lot of bullets coming up with a Philly audience, you know,
*  a New Jersey audience. And Bill, I'd known him, but I'd known him through clubs, but he got out
*  there and they were booing him. And he's so fucking awesome. His, the way he's made that whole fucking
*  Boston brilliance. And he just started to pummel them back and said the worst things you can say,
*  every inappropriate thing you could possibly say, calling, talking about their cheese steaks and the
*  Sixers and just, you know, the thing you saw. And I watched it and I'm like, this is fucking great.
*  Fuck you and fuck the Liberty Bell. Exactly. It's 15 minutes he did it. And at the end,
*  the boos were as loud as the cheers. I think he got a standing ovation. He didn't see it.
*  He comes off stage like a fighter. He's all sweaty. Did you see that? It was fucking horrible.
*  What the fuck was that? I went, Bill, that was great. Are you kidding? That was fucking amazing.
*  No, he killed. And then he still didn't believe me. And then I said, you're going to remember this.
*  This is going to, you don't know what just happened here. If there's a tape of this,
*  this is, this is going to change. You don't even know. And I bring it up to him and he's like,
*  he doesn't want to talk about it, but it is, it was a defining moment for his everything.
*  Yeah, no, he's, he's that guy that can just take a moment and rant on things. Like he knows how to
*  rant better than anybody I know in terms of like in the moment, pick things apart and piece them.
*  Like that's what his podcast is. One of the brilliant things about his podcast,
*  he does it two times a week and it's just him. It's just him ranting, which is crazy that he's
*  got that sort of muscle that he can just rant on things by himself. Just starts reading things
*  and getting pissed off about this. You know what? Here's what the fucking problem is. And then he
*  just goes off. And what's amazing is he knows what you know, what I, what I know,
*  that you're not, he's not alone. He's talking to all of it. So he's ranting to people that love
*  him and he knows they love him. He's comfortable and he loves people. Yeah. He's one of the sweetest.
*  He's a great guy. He's a great guy, but he does something that, that Chappelle does that I, that I
*  find them both so brave that they know where their A point is and they know where their,
*  their end game is. That's really well phrased, but it's like they dive into, they, they make a
*  statement, then they dive into a pool with no water in it, you know, metaphorically. And then
*  they know where their exit is. They know it. And the exit comes out strong. And it's, it's amazing.
*  Yeah. And sometimes it's not quite as close, but then they still know how to
*  fluff the fluff, the final. Well, they both know how to take a subject. And I mean,
*  it's one of the cool things about being at the store is you get to see like the beginnings of
*  those bits that a guy like Chappelle or Burr or anybody will start out and then flesh it through
*  and figure it out and then tighten it up. And then by the time they're filming a special, so it's a
*  weapon. I got to go there more. I was starting to come there more. In fact, you were nice enough to
*  bring me up. Oh, yeah, it's close. I might come there more disease. A lot of people in the back
*  of that store. I got stories. I mean, I have these stories. No people, people are fucking there.
*  Do you, I got Kenison his first spot at the store. You got him his first spot. Yeah. I told him it's
*  the first time he went on stage. Yeah. I met him in years. Uh, fuck long time. 85, 80. I didn't
*  have a gig. 83, 84. I don't know. That's crazy because 86 he was famous. Yeah. What happened was
*  this. So he'd already been teed up for Mitzi to watch, but I had set up the, I told her to watch
*  him. I met him in Houston and he was kicked out of the comedy workshop in Houston because of the shit
*  he would say on stage because he had been running his tent show of faith healing with his brother,
*  Bill. And, uh, they would, they told me some real fucked up stories about shit they would do. It was
*  a bit charlatan and a bit trying to help people, but also talking about Jesus quite a bit. And,
*  um, he, he was cynical about it, but also very confused, very conflicted about it, about what,
*  what is it? Cause, uh, and is dying on, on the ground. Supposedly he looked up at the sky and
*  was talking to God is what Bill tells us. When I met him, Carl, the bow says Carl, the bow was
*  there. Carl was there. Yeah. Carl was there when it happened. That's a whole complicated, uh, non,
*  uh, non story right now. Cause it's a heavy sparks. It's very fucking heavy. Yeah. Their story is
*  really very heavy. I was around. Yeah. I was around for all of it. I, I was there in the building for
*  those six, seven years. So what happened was, um, I met him, you would have had the same response.
*  He goes, they won't let me work here. I met him at the comedy workshop. Meet me at one in the
*  afternoon. He shows me, he posted, he shows me this, uh, telephone pole and he had put a picture of
*  himself on it and he kept putting up, they kept taking down. He was in the Houston Chronicle on
*  the front page of the arts and entertainment and he dressed himself because they banned him from the
*  club in a diaper, uh, and a crown of thorns and blood coming from the crown of thorns down his
*  face with his eyes rolled back in his head and said that he had been persecuted just like Jesus
*  from playing the comedy workshop, but it's pretty fucking heavy, you know? And he had made it quite
*  a name for himself and had a following there. I went, I don't know what to do, man. I want to
*  come out to LA and I went, well, I'll help you out. Um, I was playing the laugh stop in Houston.
*  In River Oaks? Yeah. I used to work that place. I liked it. I did a guy named Howard. Um,
*  oh, who was the owner then? Um, uh, oh, I'm trying to remember. Anyway, this is our first dead air.
*  It was great. Yeah. I'm trying to remember what happened. What happened was, uh, Sam, I sat in
*  next to Mitzi in her booth. He got on stage and he did the whole bit before he had done the young
*  comedian show that I was on with that Rodney did Rodney's first young comedian show. And it was the
*  whole thing about, you know, the kid and the whenever they do those world vision commercials
*  with a starving kid and, you know, it's famous, the most famous, one of the most famous things that
*  any comedian's done, which was just a truism, which is the cameraman can give them a sandwich,
*  starving kid, go get out of the desert, go to where the food is. That's a bit that I used in
*  a conversation with a guy. It was a weird conversation. There was a guy who wrote a book
*  on comedy. He was teaching a comedy course at a university and he was sitting here talking to me
*  and he said that the best comedy always punches up because there was a time when people really
*  believe that nonsense. Like there was a formula to comedy and that comedy should always attack
*  the large power structures and that the small people should be elevated by common. He's sitting
*  here telling me this. I go, that's nonsense. I go one of the greatest bits of all time is literally
*  about starving children. There's no further down that you could punch. One of his other great bits
*  was about dead people getting fucked in the ass. Remember that? The bit about homosexual
*  necrophiliacs who would pay money to be with the freshest male corpse. Those are two bits where
*  you're punching down as low as you can. Someone's dad died and this guy's fucking him. I mean,
*  it doesn't get any, there's no further you can punch down. He was on stage in the main room
*  and he was doing a bit where he says, this is what happened to my marriage. And he would unplug the
*  mic. This is my dick. You know, he did not need a mic to prove the point, but he would lay on the
*  ground with his girth and he would be pretending he was having sex with his wife from behind.
*  And he goes, this is what happened to my marriage. And she as he says, I'm trying to fuck her. And
*  he's like, she's like, we got to fix the fence. And he goes, shut the fuck up. I'm trying to fuck.
*  It needs a new coat of paint. But we can't, you know, you can't do that now. Really? I mean,
*  you could if you were Sam. He could do it again. He could do it. If he was alive now, he could do
*  it. First of all, he was uniquely, he was uniquely qualified for that kind of comedy because you,
*  he was short and he was fat and he was going bald and he wore a beret and the long coat.
*  And he was hanging out with all the rock and roll and porn people. The coat, he came on stage like
*  he was a child molester or something. Yeah. I mean, that was, look at that. Look at that picture.
*  That's him and Bill Hicks. Oh, I love Bill. Wow. That's a crazy picture. Bill was the sweetest,
*  most timid guy. Bill had his nails done there. He's got nail polish on. What's going on with his
*  tips? Oh, it's shadows. But that was Sam was a sweetie then. So when you see him then, I mean,
*  when you go on stage, he's, that was part of why it worked. You know, it wasn't like, you know,
*  if he was John Mulaney and he had that act, you know, handsome and slim that, you know,
*  hard to pull off. Right. You had to be, you had to look like you got fucked over.
*  He looked like he got fucked over. And he did. And he did. And he was doing faith healing shows.
*  And they told me a story where he had been, I wasn't going to tell it, but it's fucking weird.
*  So they're healing people. So this, they're in some God forsaken place. I don't know where.
*  And he goes, come up here and we're going to, we're going to heal you. And like a seven foot
*  tall guy with drawstring pants and a t-shirt, he said he was like Lenny from Mice and Men.
*  He was mentally impaired. He said he was going to come up and he was going to do the whole thing
*  with him and get out the spirit and all that. And as these guys coming up, he runs up to the stage
*  and he's so tall, he hits his head on a beam and he splits his head open, but he doesn't fall down
*  Bill, his brother will tell you this story and the guy's pants fall down and he had the biggest dick
*  in the world. And so his head is gushing blood and his dick is swinging and he's going,
*  like young Frankenstein, Peter Boyle. And it's horrifically upsetting. And the way it's been
*  told to me, I don't know if these stories whisper down the lane is that they went back to the same
*  place after a while. The guy came back and he had some other mishap. I don't want to say he hit his
*  head again, but he fell. He was the same guy just trying to have a redo to get healed. I mean,
*  I don't know what's more embarrassing. Well, if your head gets split open, but the whole room can
*  see you've got a giant cock, maybe it's a blessing and a curse. I don't know. There's probably a few
*  gals that hit him up after that. But drawstring pants means there's not a lot of cleanliness down
*  in the junk. Well, you can wash them up. If you're a gal looking for a big dick, like there it is.
*  Or a guy looking for a big dick. Or maybe a guy you can trick into fucking you. Yeah. That would
*  be the move. Or you could play like you do with a bat in baseball. Right. So who gets the bat?
*  Make that sound again. I can't do it. I can't. And I can't roll my R's either. But then the answer
*  to Kenison how quick he popped was after that set, like a week later, Rodney came in to see him.
*  And I'd known Rodney. Rodney liked me. I like you, man. I met him in La Jolla. He came up to me,
*  you're funny, man. You're a Jew. You're never going to be happy. You got a fast mind. You're
*  all fucked up, man. You're never going to be happy. And he was trying to clean up at La Costa. And he
*  comes in, he goes, I can't do it, man. No booze, no coke, no pot, no pills. I can't do it. And he's
*  with two women. And I hung out with him all weekend. He stayed at the, he kept coming to
*  the condo and hung out with me. And Kenison, he saw Sam and I love this guy. So I do the young comedian
*  special on HBO. I had a great set right before Sam. I had a 15 minute set. Sam had a 15 minute set.
*  I was in it for three and a half minutes. Sam was in it for 15 minutes because it was monumental.
*  And then a year later he was in back to school. So that's why it was a three year deal with him.
*  That's crazy. And he was a sweetheart. When I was 19, I worked as a security guard at Great Woods
*  Center for the Performing Arts in Mansfield, Massachusetts. And Rodney was there and he was
*  backstage. And I was like, I didn't get a chance to meet him, but I was backstage. It was like a
*  hallway. It's hard to know if this is a real memory because when you're 19, your brain is mush.
*  And it was so long ago and I got hit in the head a lot, but there, I remember
*  they were talking about how he didn't have any pants on. No, never. He had a bathrobe. Yeah,
*  balls out. I remember him pacing back and forth and looking down the hallway. I know I definitely
*  saw him at least once and I definitely saw him on stage with the bathrobe on. But I remember
*  looking down the hallway, seeing this guy, I'm like, how crazy? He doesn't have any pants on.
*  He's going to go on stage like this is what, and then him up there just didn't give a fuck. I mean,
*  had no fucks to give. He was a movie star. He's become a, at 58, by the way, was Caddyshack.
*  That's how long it took him. He was in his 60s when I saw him and apparently smoked a shitload
*  of pot backstage. And went on stage, my wife, and just murdered. I mean, one punchline after another
*  punchline. And people don't know the story about him, quit doing comedy for years and became an
*  aluminum siding salesman. He was born Jacob Cohen, changed it to Jack Roy, and then a club owner
*  called him Rodney Dangerfield. That's how he was named by a club owner. Wow, what club? I don't know.
*  I don't know. But he had a rough go. He had his rough go. The no respect thing was if you're going
*  to pick a brand, a catchphrase, it wasn't a catchphrase. It was his mantra. Yeah, well, that
*  made him. I got no respect, I'll tell you. No respect at all.
*  I fucking loved him. He would have loved you, like loved you because of the fuck. He always said,
*  and I've said this before, I'm sorry if anybody has heard me say this, but he always said,
*  the key man is you just go like a tank, like a tank, because nobody wants you to make it.
*  Everybody's trying to stop you. You just go like a tank, fuck them all. Just go like a tank.
*  He had come up, it took him so long to get anywhere. He would go on Tonight Show. If you look at any
*  of these clips that they're running all over the internet, it's fucking killer. Carson's
*  hitting the desk. It's just real special. Well, he was a special guy. The story was special too,
*  because it showed that he was trying to make it and it fell apart. Then he took a long,
*  didn't he take like 10 years off? It was aluminum siding was the years of.
*  Many years. Then he came back and became the biggest fucking movie star in the world.
*  But he couldn't, it took him to 58 and they put him in Caddyshack and a lot of the jokes
*  were his. Then a lot of them, I mean it was Harold Ramis and stuff, so it was the 18.
*  Genius movie, man. Those movies were so good. Fucking Bill Murray in that,
*  Chevy was great in, everybody's great in that movie.
*  Remember when he's in the classroom and Kinnison's teaching him?
*  Oh yeah. Kinnison played a fucking off tilt Vietnam vet who's screaming.
*  He just wrote him into it too. That's a great movie back to school.
*  It's a fucking great movie. And Easy Money was really great.
*  He had some classics, man. Caddyshack, he had some classics. He was awesome.
*  I officiated his funeral. Oh man.
*  It was pretty intense to put him away. I was with him in the emergency, sorry I got a little,
*  intensive care. He was in a coma so I'd go in and talk to him.
*  How old was he when he passed? 84.
*  That's amazing. He did all that coke and he made it to 84.
*  He stopped doing coke. He just liked pot. But he did a lot of coke.
*  When did he stop?
*  I think about 10 years before he died.
*  Still amazing. 74 years old doing coke going, I got another 10 years. I'll tell you what.
*  How do you stop? No booze, no coke, no pot, no pills.
*  I want to go back to something you were talking about. It's completely off comedy topic.
*  But we'll come back to it. I don't know. It's your show.
*  Trump's niece, the book. I cut you off.
*  I only read one passage. It was just about empathy. It's just about why,
*  what's wrong with him psychologically. Whenever you see someone that seeks power like that,
*  seeks that kind of adulation, that kind of spotlight, what is causing that? What is that?
*  What makes someone want to be that person? You're fired. You don't see any love out of him,
*  any sweetness. I think as a nation, at this time we need someone who has got a real message,
*  not some bullshit, canned speech that's prepared by a focus group where they figured out all the
*  right beats to hit and the right things to say. But they're not even doing the right beats.
*  The Mount Rushmore speech could have had five, six minutes in it that could have added some people
*  to it. Well, he's not that guy. Obama was that guy. If Obama was stuck in this situation, I really,
*  truly believe he could have given a speech that made us all feel like we're going to be okay.
*  100%. 100%.
*  He was an incredibly good cheerleader. He was.
*  Empowering. He was also like, you knew his story. His story is the opposite of Trump's story.
*  Trump's story is he comes from a rich father. The father gives him money, starts his businesses.
*  He's known for being kind of shady. Obama's the opposite. He comes from a single mom,
*  grows up in Hawaii. It's just different. You know that he's gone through some shit to get there
*  and had compassion. We need that. We need someone who sees that we're hurting.
*  This nation is fucking hurting, man. You see what we were talking about earlier with the cops and
*  all these murders that are happening in New York City and Chicago's got record murders.
*  It's horrific. Yesterday was horrific. Every day is.
*  And there's no real hope in sight in terms of the economy because everything's getting
*  more locked down. Like today, what got passed down today in California? They went back to
*  almost stage one. They shut down all the gyms. What did they shut down?
*  Yeah, my yoga teacher's been trying to get me to go to yoga. I'm like,
*  isn't that like a hot room? I do it.
*  People breathe heavy. You can do it online.
*  I do it at home, bro. California closed to close indoor restaurants, movie theaters,
*  and bars statewide as coronavirus cases rise. So did it say gyms as well?
*  Hair salons, barbershops, fitness centers, worship services. Oh my God.
*  Worship services. So that's churches and synagogues.
*  Yep, everything.
*  Well, when they suppress it, it works in countries.
*  Well, here's the thing, though. They keep saying, but it's OK to protest.
*  You can't.
*  But then they're saying that then you hear, and I don't know where I hear it. It might be left
*  information that a lot of protesters were protected, didn't get sick, is what I'm hearing.
*  I can't believe that.
*  Does that make any sense?
*  Doesn't make any sense.
*  They don't want to say that these incredibly significant historical protests have created
*  an uptick in the virus that will likely lead to deaths. They don't want to say that. But
*  both those things are true. Those protests are very important.
*  They're important and they're moving the needle. And life is going to change. So that is a positive
*  for people that have been neglected for so long. But it's all at once. It's like some fucking supreme
*  weird litmus on the whole universe. It's like it's a sci-fi.
*  I don't think it's over. I think we're going to get hit with a couple more wacky moments.
*  Well, the meteor, that's not far.
*  Or solar flare that takes out the power grid.
*  We just don't want to lose our Wi-Fi. That's all that we care about.
*  All the Wi-Fis first.
*  I thought this was germ warfare is what I thought this was. I didn't think this was.
*  And wet markets are open again is what I'm hearing.
*  Well, it's not from the wet market.
*  That's what I want to know. Talk to me.
*  All indications seem to point to the fact that this was a virus that had been manipulated.
*  I had Brett Weinstein on my podcast. He's a biologist. And he, in terms that I will not
*  be able to recreate, explained all the different factors that when they examined the virus would
*  not be very likely to have happened in nature and certainly not as quickly as they had.
*  All these different aspects of the virus point to the fact that it had been something that had been
*  manipulated. The fact that there was a level four lab in Wuhan. This is not, you know, people love
*  to use the term conspiracy theory, but this level four lab where they study coronaviruses that come
*  from bats is there. It's in Wuhan. Why are they studying?
*  Why are they? And that same lab had been two years ago,
*  had been in trouble for violating safety protocols. Look, China's, it's not America.
*  It's not the same. And they do things differently over there. They're completely intertwined with
*  their government. They can get away with things that we can't get away with here. And they,
*  you know, they don't have as strict a protocol when it comes to handling diseases.
*  Well, you know, the word on the street is often that it's wealthy people wanting to have their
*  endangered species fix. That's what you hear. What do you mean?
*  That the wet market bat is like a delicacy. And that's how it got spread.
*  I've not heard that. I don't know if that's true. I don't know where I heard it.
*  I would imagine it would be more like people are starving and they need to eat whatever they can
*  eat and they eat bats. But that's not what- See, I always pictured it laid out like lobsters at
*  the farmer's market. That's what I was picturing. That'd probably be safer.
*  It's not what happened. I don't believe that's what happened. And Brett Weinstein's very careful
*  in not saying that this is definitely what happened, but he put points to all the factors
*  that lead to this very likely conclusion that this is something that accidentally got out of a lab.
*  There's a reason why it's so contagious, that it spreads so easily, that it takes on so many
*  different forms and has so many different reactions and so many different people. It's almost like
*  we're dealing with a bunch of different diseases. Anytime you mate humanity with an animal, there's
*  a serious problem. I'm not talking sexually, although I've seen a couple of goats in my life
*  that kind of had a twinkle. You had a smile while you're doing that because you knew you
*  shouldn't have did it and you did it anyway. I couldn't help it. I mean, I'm just saying-
*  You knew it wasn't even going to work out well. But you have to-
*  It didn't work out well at all. No, but you're enjoying that. But the other thing is I wanted,
*  for the kids out there listening, don't fuck animals.
*  No, don't fuck animals. Is that okay to put that out there?
*  What if the animal really wants you to fuck it? That's what I was saying. A goat with a gleam
*  in his eye. This is where I double down on not working. What about a small animal?
*  No, that's mean. Fuck something that can kill you. If you're going to have the balls,
*  fuck an elephant. Like a bear. Like a bear. Fuck a large predator. Yeah, don't fuck something that
*  you're the bully. Hold that rabbit down and fuck him.
*  So it's the revenant. What he did was get inside a bear, literally.
*  Not, sort of. Yeah, eventually. It took a while.
*  I think this is going to be- This is how I deal with how horrible this is.
*  I go to a place that's fucking asinine. That's what my dad would do. Just stupid. Just stupid
*  because I know that China is completely fucked up with this. They're apparently out of control.
*  They don't know how to stop what's happening, is what I'm hearing also.
*  Well, it's doing better than we're doing. China's got it way more under control than we do.
*  How do we know that though? We don't. They lie about everything.
*  The other thing about what's weird is why did it go so badly here?
*  If you look at the UK, the UK's basically got restaurants are open again. New Zealand has zero
*  viruses now. They're back to normal. I mean, they're not letting anybody in, but they are
*  literally back to a no virus situation. It's like the resistance of the United States is down
*  because so many- Not the resistance, but our immune system is down because there's so much
*  hatred. There's so much fucking weird shit. I wonder what would have happened. It's really
*  crazy that, you know that expression, the wings of a butterfly can become a hurricane.
*  What would have happened if that George Floyd thing didn't happen? If that day did not go down
*  that way, if it was just a normal day, if maybe George Floyd just hopped in the patrol car,
*  or maybe didn't give them that counterfeit $20 bill, never got arrested,
*  what the fuck would we be looking at? It's kind of amazing when you really-
*  No, it's a change of history in one moment.
*  In an incident between two people, between one cop and one man, and then the world sees it because
*  one girl, 17-year-old girl, filmed it. She puts it up. The whole world sees the horror of that
*  guy leaning on that man's neck with his knee. And other people standing by.
*  And then the world explodes, or our country explodes. But imagine, where would we be? It'd
*  be really interesting to see two different timelines. You know, see a timeline where that
*  never happens? I think it was bound to happen anyway. We've been-
*  I mean- But that was so egregious. It was so
*  heinous. Oh, that's the point. That's the point.
*  That led to this explosion. Whereas if there was nothing like that, I mean, because the guy who
*  got shot by those vigilantes was just a couple of weeks before that. Remember in Georgia?
*  I do. If this George Floyd thing, that was like
*  teeing the ball up, you know? And then this George Floyd thing happens and boom,
*  the powder keg blows. I think the enough is enough moment happened. And everybody's
*  holed up in quarantine and everybody can't pay their rent and nobody can do anything but watch
*  all this bullshit of all this racism and all of our bureaucrats spewing a bunch of lies and garbage
*  at everybody. My favorite part of it was the black and white video the actors made to try to fix it.
*  Oh my God. I will no longer stand by. Like, what are you talking about?
*  Imagine the imagine video also. That was the beginning of the coronavirus.
*  This was after that. These actors hadn't worked in months and they desperately needed attention.
*  So they all got together and made that stupid fucking video.
*  Do you see what Jim Norton said about the imagine video?
*  No, what'd he say? He said, when I saw that video,
*  I got all choked up because I tried to hang myself.
*  It was so embarrassing. Well, you know, there's something great about
*  people that have a heart for it that are well known, whether it be acting or sports or whatever
*  music that people are that look up to those people. But it's saturated when it's just people
*  doing it because they're getting publicity. That's all they're doing. That's why they're
*  doing it. They're doing it because this might be an opportunity to let other people know that
*  they're awesome. That's what they're doing. That's their fake way of pretending they have a heart.
*  It just doesn't look. Do you know? I mean, there has to be some heart in there.
*  Of course, of course. It's not like they're evil, but that's narcissism. There's a certain
*  amount of narcissism there that's foul. It smells bad. It's like when you open up some leftovers,
*  like, oh, I can't eat this. That's what it is. It's got a smell to it.
*  That's 100 percent right. Yeah. It's the smell of narcissism,
*  the smell of ego, the smell of the preposterous idea that you're going to sing your way out of
*  people dying. And that's what we're living right now. That's what we're listening to right now.
*  When I see Jared Kushner, and I'm sure he's a delightful guy. I bet he's not.
*  No, I was being totally facetious. Me too. Oh, great. I think he's awesome.
*  Oh, I love him. Pinky swear. BFF. But what it is about him, he really looks like central casting
*  to play the Nazi in a movie. He does, right? He so looks like he's going to have that collar
*  on and be so good. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. But apparently he's running the whole show. I don't
*  know. That's crazy. I don't believe. I don't know. What the fuck? I don't know what to believe
*  anywhere. I just want some where are we going to get truth? Where are we ever going to get it?
*  Weren't they mad that he was the one saying that the coronavirus is going to be nothing
*  and to not. Yes, he was one of the many like the bullfrogs in there and Mitch McConnell and
*  Lindsey Graham. They all look like something out of Dr. Doolittle. Imagine you're the president and
*  you're like, what's going to happen here? Hey, let me go ask that guy who's married to my daughter.
*  He seems pretty smart. He's married to my daughter. My daughter, my daughter, my daughter,
*  girlfriend, wife, want to be. Imagine that too. Imagine that he hires his family.
*  Well, that's a, that's a monarch. I mean, that's, that's a dictatorship and a monarch. But it's just,
*  the only people probably because he wants love and I think they do love him. They must love him. And
*  I've known people that know him. I'm sure you do too, that have said, I worked with him. He was
*  horrible. And I've also talked to people that are hung out with him. He was great. Yeah. I've talked
*  to people that know him that really like him. Yeah, I've heard that too. And then it's a performance
*  that moment it happens. It's a performance. It's well, Ross told me that Ross told me that he had
*  a good time with them when they were roasting them and he, and he, Ross told me that he was telling
*  them like, listen, when they're making fun of you, you've got to laugh. Like if you laugh,
*  Ross just likes that he liked him. I think you're probably right. All right, buddy. Maybe you're
*  right, buddy. Yeah, maybe that's a good point. It's a real good point. It's just, it's just a sad
*  time and we got it. We have to punch through it. That's why I love him. Also is the nature of this
*  business is that the way politicians are taken apart, their past is taken apart. Things are
*  taken out of context. They make these attack pieces. They look into their finances. They look into
*  their past relationships. They try to find every little piece of something that might indicate
*  there's a character flaw. Nobody wants to go through that. So no person who's really like a
*  person that you'd want to be president wants to be president. There's like a few of them. Bernie
*  Sanders, Tulsi Gabbard. There's a few that I looked at. I said I could like Tulsi Gabbard.
*  She's young. I could see her run in this country. I really could. And I think she would do an amazing
*  job at it. I think she's a genuinely good person and a real leader. And I think, you know, Bernie
*  has some interesting ideas and I would love to see what would happen if we went like with some of
*  those ideas, particularly like fixing inner cities, man, doing something to fix these crime written,
*  drug-addled, gang-infested communities that have been stuck like that for decades and decades.
*  Drug-infested, parentless infested. I mean, that's one thing that hopefully goodness will come from
*  is that they will send people to help with mental illness and drug rehabilitation and guidance. And
*  if that can happen, how does that happen? How do you send people into the depths of Chicago where
*  a lot of the pandemic of that kind of lack of love and pain? It has to be done locally and it has to
*  be done in each individual place by someone who understands the community. It has to be done
*  locally in each individual city. Each individual city has unique problems. I don't think you could
*  use Baltimore's solution on Detroit. I think you have to have your own solution for each
*  individual place based on people that actually understand how it got to where it is and what
*  could be done. And mayors and their regime need to be heroes. They need to be people. And the other
*  thing is you were saying, you know, you get looked into, every single scrap of your life comes up,
*  you did something wrong, you dated someone wrong, you paid someone, you did something, you did drugs
*  sometime. I think that should be right there when you come out of the gate, when you're up for,
*  just give the schematic on the person. I want to run for president. Here's all the shit I did.
*  Here's my fucking tax evasion. I didn't know she was 19. I didn't know that her mom was my girlfriend.
*  Shit like that. I never put my finger in that dog. That picture is photoshopped.
*  Yeah, you couldn't help yourself.
*  I don't know. I mean, that's how diseases start.
*  That's not how they start.
*  No, you just get sick. You don't get a disease.
*  Maybe you don't get sick. I think half the people out there could give a fuck.
*  You know, people out in the mountains looking at their sister, you know, in that way.
*  This is the kind of person I was when I was 21. So Jay Leno's at the store.
*  My first night in stand-up Letterman brings me up. That's how my old man stories.
*  So this is my first night. Mitzi said, you got to quit. I was going to USC.
*  What year were we talking here?
*  78. Mitzi said I was going to go to USC film school. I got into the grad program because I'd
*  won a student Oscar for a documentary I made about my nephew having his face reconstructed.
*  I was going to go serious filmmaking. That's what I wanted. And I was also a stand-up since I was 17.
*  So Mitzi said, now don't go there. Work here. You work here. You're good. I'll put you in.
*  You work here and you won't get paid, but work here. I went, okay. Because that night
*  when I moved to LA and I quit grad school, like the day I quit USC grad school, I went there for
*  three days. I went up at the store. Letterman brought me up. The lineup was Leno, Michael Keaton,
*  Billy Crystal, Jeff Altman, Argus. Prior went up later in the evening. It was on one fucking night.
*  That's insane.
*  You're part of the reason that place came back. You and a bunch of the people that came in,
*  you brought it back. I mean, it was not long ago. That place was gone.
*  Yeah, it wasn't looking good.
*  No.
*  It wasn't looking good.
*  You did that. That's the empowerment. That takes a strong thing to go wait.
*  This place is history. And I like these rooms. I need to do comedy. I want to know what was
*  your decision-making process and how did you find... Because you were already on your way to wherever
*  you wanted to make your playground.
*  Well, I was gone for seven years. I was gone from 2007 to 2014. And that was that Carlos
*  Mencia incident that I had at the store. I got banned. And not even by Mitzi. I got banned by
*  the former management. And there's just some weird shit going on behind the scenes. And they
*  had negotiated something with...
*  Where were you working out before then?
*  I was at the store. I was at the store from 94 to 2007. I moved to LA in 94. And the first
*  thing I did is go to the store. That was Mecca. When I was in Boston and I was an open micer,
*  I had heard about the store. In 1988, I started. And that was when Sam Kinison was huge.
*  And I literally started comedy.
*  That's right when I left. So I missed you.
*  I missed you.
*  94.
*  Well, I always wanted to ask you what it was like. Because when you did Full House,
*  you basically had to stop doing stand up. Because you were on this squeaky clean...
*  I still did it.
*  You still did it?
*  Yeah. And I started to morph. And I started to get really fucked up on stage. And I was...
*  Fucked up how?
*  Fucked up on... I would go, okay, that's what I'm doing during the day. And here's... I know when
*  you did News Radio, they wanted you not to do stand up as much? Is that kind of...
*  No, not really. No. The only thing that ever happened on News Radio is one of the producers
*  said, why are you still doing comedy? You're an actor now. Like it was a great thing. And I
*  was horrified. I was like, what?
*  What? I'm going to stop doing stand up for this?
*  That's because they don't understand. They think... A lot of people used and use stand up to get a
*  show, to get a writing gig, to get something. And I'm like, I can't stop being one. I am one.
*  It's part of my hard drive.
*  Well, it was the most fun too. They were asking me to do this thing that I was basically...
*  I never taken any acting classes. I had just gotten a development deal from MTV Half Hour Comedy
*  Hour. And they said, do you want to be on a sitcom? I'm like, okay. And so they made me get an acting
*  coach. And I took a few classes, but it was really annoying. And then next thing you know,
*  I'm out here in LA on a sitcom. And so when they said, why are you doing stand up? You're
*  an actor now. I was like, what the fuck are you talking about? You've never killed. I'm like,
*  you're saying this because you never killed.
*  They also didn't believe in hyphenates at that point. You can't do three things.
*  You can't do four things. I'm sorry. You can only do one thing.
*  That was also when I started working for the UFC. And when I started working for the UFC,
*  they were acting like I was doing porn. They're like, what are you doing? And I was like, yeah,
*  I'm going to Alabama to do a post fight interviews for a cage fighting event. And they're like,
*  the fuck is wrong with you? You can't do that.
*  Because you're in a fucking original. They don't know what that is.
*  Well, it was just no one had done it before. There was no comedian slash
*  cage fighting commentators. Find me another one ever.
*  But it was just one of those things where I was like, I don't care. I'm going to do this
*  because I want to do this. And they were like, you really shouldn't do this. This is probably bad
*  for your career. I'm like, whatever. I don't even know what that means. I'm just going to do
*  what I like to do. Tell me again where you had left off about the Mencia thing with the Carlin.
*  So he had made some sort of sneaky backdoor deal with the store to have them ban me. And he would
*  put his name on the marquee, which he never would do before. Like he would do spots. They would just
*  show up and bump people. That was his thing. You like to just show up and he didn't let them put
*  his name on the marquee and sell tickets with his name because he would do big venues around town.
*  This was around the mind of Mencia days. He was a big star. He was selling out large theaters. He
*  was doing really well. And I wasn't doing as well with standup. I was on Fear Factor and I was
*  doing pretty good with comedy, but I was mostly doing clubs. He was more advanced career wise,
*  if I'm being honest. And so when they said that to me that I was banned, and I knew it was wrong,
*  I'm like, I know. I go, you guys are, you sell art. You sell art. This is what you sell. Like
*  you have an art store. It's just a spoken art. And you're basically taking the side of someone
*  who's stealing. A vampire. You give a vampire of all the other performers. Not just a vampire,
*  but someone who, if you were going on stage, he would go on before you and do your closing bit
*  and then bring you up. There was a lot of dark shit going on. People were scared. They had lights.
*  They would flick in the back of the room when he was there to let you know if you want to stage.
*  Guys would just stop doing their act. I wasn't there for any of that. It was not good. It was
*  accentuated by his celebrity. When he became famous, it got way worse, but it had always existed. He
*  was always a thief. And so I said, okay, I'm not coming back. I'm letting you know. Like you think
*  this is going to be like a two week deal or something like that. So you can go fuck yourself.
*  I'm not coming back. So just make this decision. Understand this is not a temporary thing where
*  you're going to ban me for a little while. And I'm going back and forth with the manager. Well,
*  don't tell me Mitzi said, because I was on the phone with Mitzi an hour ago before this. And I
*  told Mitzi what was going on. I told Mitzi that we are going to make this video about him stealing
*  material because it was a horrible situation there. And I told her, I'm like, I go, you know,
*  this is just what it is. She goes, all right, just keep away from them. She goes, when you want to
*  go up. And I go, when do you want to put me up? She goes, I'm at 10 30. I go, perfect. I love you.
*  She goes, I love you too. It's the last time I talked to her. Last time I talked to her. And
*  then they call me an hour later and say, I'm banned. And I'm like, what are you talking about? I just
*  got off the phone with Mitzi. I go, who's running the fucking store? You're running the store? You're
*  running the store. I work for you. Get the fuck out of here. And so I got furious and I just started
*  working the improv and I did the ice house and I just said, okay, this is what I do now. I don't
*  work at the store anymore. And the store, I put the store's phone number on my blog and told
*  everybody the whole story. And I'm like, feel free to call them and let them know how you feel. And
*  it was a ghost town there for years. It became a wreck. So what, yeah, it did. I crashed that place.
*  Years, years. So what brought you back?
*  Ari Shaffir was doing his comedy special. He was filming and Adam Eaget, you know,
*  Adam, I'd known Adam. I like Adam. I love Adam. And he was, he'd been on the podcast before too.
*  I'd seen him. Adam was at the Tempe improv years before that. And I became friends with him when
*  I worked there. And then he came over and started being the talent coordinator at the store. And
*  they came to visit me at the improv. He said, we'd love to have you at the store. He's like,
*  Tommy doesn't work there anymore. He's gone. It was the manager that I had the issue with.
*  Right. And Mincey had long been just, he had long been outcast from the comedy community. Like that
*  video and the subsequent, all these other comedians coming out and telling stories about him,
*  everything fell apart. And this is what I told them was going to happen. I was like, this is not,
*  this is not going to go away. This is real. This is not like, people make mistakes. They, they
*  accidentally do someone's bit because they forget it was someone's bit. Or you come up with, you do
*  come up with the same thing. People, yeah, there's a lot, but there, there's good people. And then
*  there's people that are victimizing people. And he was one of those that was victimizing people
*  and the worst I've ever seen. And so this had happened. And I knew when Adam came to visit me
*  at the improv, I knew, well, I knew Adam was a good guy and I'd thought about it, but I was like,
*  I can't, I'm not, I can't, I can't go back there. And then Ari was doing his special and Ari was
*  filming his special in the OR and Ari was one of my best friends. And I had been friends with Ari
*  from the time that he was a doorman. And I was like, he had gone through this journey of being
*  a doorman to, I started taking him on the road with me. So I'd take him on the road and we would
*  do all these gigs together. And now here he is, he's got his own television show and he's doing a
*  fucking Comedy Central special and he's filming it at the store. I'm like, I gotta be there.
*  So I came there on Tuesday night. He was filming on Wednesday. I came down on Tuesday night and I
*  was there for Roast Battle and Jeff Ross introduced me to the crowd and I got to see Roast Battle and
*  it was wild. Roast Battle was wild. It was so beautiful. It was like, it was creative and it
*  was fun and it was packed. And I was there one night being a judge, Jeff brought me and said,
*  Bob, you gotta come down. You don't know. You don't know. It's wonderful. If it comes back,
*  it still is so cool. But it'll come back. And then the next night I came back and I saw Ari.
*  I watched Ari film a special and then I said, okay, I'm gonna start doing shows.
*  And so I think, you know, like a couple of days later, I did my first show back there.
*  And that was it. Then you were there and you were playing almost every night of the week,
*  right? I was there a lot until the lockdown. I was there many days a week. I'm gonna come back
*  and do it right and sign up, put my name on the thing. I do drop-ins, but they're five minutes.
*  I don't do drop-ins. I don't. I don't. I want to do sets. And when I was doing the drop-in,
*  it was just, it would be just to, I wasn't sure, you know, I wasn't sure that I wanted to
*  go up and be part of a lineup. Is it competitive? Do people take your stuff? Do people? No,
*  there's none of that there now. There's none of that. That was my, you know, I have PTSD from
*  eight years. Right. And I had a love affair with Mitzi. I was like a nephew to her. So I was kind
*  of like family. Even at her funeral, I was like family, even though I hadn't been around. But
*  there was one time in Vegas where I had a weird experience and I was trying to keep somebody
*  sober and I had to stay up all night to keep them sober so that she didn't find out. And as a result,
*  I hadn't slept and I had a weak set in Vegas at the Dunes. And then after the set, she came
*  backstage and said, you've lost it. You're not funny anymore. Oh no. And that was like, you don't
*  say that to a sensitive Jew comic neurotic motherfucker. She didn't give a fuck though, dude.
*  She had zero filter. No. And you know what happened? It hurt me. And it's just like you
*  teach in martial arts to the kids. It's like, well, I better get fucking funny. I better get funny
*  again. And I just kept- You can't have an excuse. No, there ain't no excuses. And I just worked
*  harder and harder. And now, I mean, I want to do, I might do some drive-ins. I don't know what I'm
*  going to do. But I'm enjoying the podcast thing because I get to, and I call people and talk to
*  them and that's an interplay with people. You get to fuck around a little. And I have some guests
*  that you've had that I love, people that are friends. But the point is I'm born this, I'm born
*  to do this. You're born to do this. And she was- Well, we just got to figure it out. She taught me
*  something. And she loved me and I loved her, but she got really sick. So I, you know,
*  it was really tragic. Some people hated her and some people loved her all the way to the end.
*  I loved her. I know. She helped me. Yeah, she helped me too, man. If it wasn't for her.
*  When I became a paid regular, that was like the most important day of my life at that moment.
*  I was like, holy shit, I'm a real comedian. I'm a paid regular. I didn't know what that meant.
*  I showed up one night and then they put on the website, Bob Saget paid regular. And I wrote to
*  the email or I don't know, I texted somebody who ever did the thing. I went, you don't have to call
*  me a paid regular. I mean, you know, you can just say I showed up. Okay. And he goes, no, no, you
*  don't understand. It's an honor. I'm like, but I don't take the pay. I never take the pay. I'm
*  paid regular. I don't, but I didn't realize it is a rite of passage, like a badge of honor.
*  It is, it was something special. It was something important when that happened. I was like, oh my
*  God, because like I said, when I started out in 88, the comedy store was Mecca. That was the place
*  like I wanted to be there. That was where Richard Pryor performed. That was where Kinnison performed.
*  Those were Hicks performed. I wanted to go there. And when I was there, I was actually there. It was
*  a dark time, man. I was there in 94. It was a shithole. Oh, it was fucking, I went in when it was
*  over. I went in, it was empty. I mean, you know, 20 P it was socially distanced. Well, it was a,
*  it was a bad perfect for now, a bad run for about six years where it wasn't very good from 94 to
*  around 2000 and somewhere around 2000 started picking up again. The poly poly really stepped
*  in and Peter, Peter did a lot, right? Well, it was just better talent. He started coming around,
*  that's all it was. It's like, there was a lot of guys who would, I think there was a week.
*  This is my own personal theory and I'm only basing it on the timeline of Kinnison's death.
*  Kinnison left the comedy store somewhere around like 90 and then he died somewhere around like
*  92, somewhere around there in 93. And then the, you know, so many guys had gone off and done sitcoms
*  and like Jim Carrey had gone off and done movies and in living color. And there wasn't,
*  there wasn't that many people there. And then there was also a lot of really bad talent.
*  There was a lot of guys that said that is a fact. And there are people that could have been
*  accountants and instead chose comedy as a career. And they learned how to walk the stage. Yes. And
*  they learned how to hold the mic and they learned how to talk to the audience. Right. They're like a
*  plumber. They learn to trade. It's not, and they weren't even good at it. They're the plumber you
*  don't want. The plumber that's going to blow your toilet up. Yeah. The plumber puts the wrong
*  gasket and it runs. So I saw a lot of those guys and I was really disappointing. Like I was like
*  one of my first nights there, I remember there was like 15, 20 people in the audience. The acts were
*  terrible. I was like, this is so weird. This is the comedy store. That's why I stayed away
*  because it made me sad. But then every now and then like Martin Lawrence would show up.
*  Every now and then Damon Waynes would show up. Every now and then Don Marrero would show up.
*  Every now and then someone would show up and I showed up. I wasn't there when you were there.
*  That sucks. I didn't see you there for many, many years, many years. But that's why I was asking
*  about like the Full House days. Was it hard? That's interesting because it'll bring you,
*  because you were, you had a dirty act, but it wasn't as blue until after and Full House and
*  the video show were simultaneous and they were family, you know, seven o'clock at night on a
*  Sunday. I'm hosting videos. I can't say here's another fucking video. You know, you can't do
*  that. And I didn't say fuck that much. In fact, a few years ago, Dice called me. He goes, Saget,
*  I got to tell you something. We got to see each other. But also, you know what, man, you stole
*  my shit after you, after Full House ended. You stole my, I said, what did I steal? Well,
*  you didn't use to say fuck as much. I stole fuck. Was he joking? Kind of, but not really. But then
*  he wanted to tour with me. So it was kind of like, see Dice is always half pranking you. I love him.
*  He's always half fucking with you. I started going on the road because of Dice. I was just doing the
*  store and this is when I was on news radio. And one day he, we're in the background, we'll say,
*  you should go on the road. And I'm like, yeah. And he goes, yeah, you're funny. He goes, you know,
*  I'm going to be fucking beholden these cocksuckers. He goes, these motherfuckers and these movies and
*  their shows. He goes, he goes, you go on the road and you make good living. And I was thinking
*  about, I was like, why don't I go on the road? So I just started booking gigs. I literally just
*  listened to him. Cause first of all, you know, I'm 27 years old. I can't believe Dice is talking to
*  me. And I'm like, I'm talking to Dice. And then he tells me to go on the road. I was like, he's right.
*  Why don't I go on the road? So I started doing gigs here and there, you know? And then when I
*  really started going on the road, like really was when I left the store, that 2007 time when I left
*  the store, that's when I started touring. That's when I really started touring. Cause I was kind of
*  angry too. I was like, you know, I put all that time into that place and, and I was, I thought
*  what we were doing, like that Mencia thing, I thought that was, we're doing the right thing.
*  I thought that was a real problem. And so when that was the reaction, I was like, okay, I'm going
*  to show you motherfuckers. I had this, this attitude, like I'm going to show you. And then I did my best
*  work after that. There's nothing wrong with that. Yeah. That was my best work was after that because
*  I was, you know, my best, my first real big special was 2009, which was two years after that.
*  And then, you know, and I don't have any hate for that dude and I hope he gets better. Like
*  I hope he's doing great. I really do. I think he, I think he has learned his lesson. I hope he has.
*  I hope people forgive him too. I don't, I think that's a problem. You know, I think
*  many people have had it, you know, some very famous people have had it. No, I don't mean that. Yeah.
*  Many people have had that like Robin, right? You know, a lot of people had that and his loss is so
*  and his talent is so gigantic that he was just a vacuum cleaner of stuff. He did. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And I loved him beyond. He was, he was so, yeah, he's a, he's, he's from every hundred years of
*  Robin Williams comes here. This is what it's, I mean, you, you brought up what was going on doing
*  those family shows and then doing stand up. Richard Jeni comes into play here. This is kind of
*  an interesting thing that you brought him up because he hits me in the solar plexus. I did a
*  special while the two shows were in the top 10 full house in America's funniest home videos.
*  Long names to say they sound like I'm saying porn when I say the names of the shows.
*  That's like dirty to me. Full house. Oh, that's so filthy, but, but I love doing family entertainment.
*  That's my many different sides. I love doing stuff. The whole family can watch together. I
*  don't look at that and go, Oh, that's bullshit. You know, that's, that's not the cynical guy that
*  can come out and be blue for the sake of blue. I wasn't blue for the sake of blue. I just did what
*  I did, you know, just like you did what you did, you know, your UFC stuff. It's like, I,
*  I wasn't doing anything athletic, but, but to, I did an HBO special and it did well, but in the
*  ratings or whatever, but it was not good. And I made it so you can't see it. Uh, and Richard Jeni
*  loved it. And he would say to me, I loved that special. And I was, I was saying, fuck it. But
*  it was like an hour long and it took a half an hour. It was about me being in a dream, trying to
*  missing my gig. So I was trying to make a film cause I want to be a filmmaker. And then the next
*  half hour was basically a half hour standup. And I just didn't do any of it right, you know? And,
*  but there were a couple of really funny moments and a couple of good bits. Um, and Richard told
*  me he thought it was one of the funniest specials and most invented that he'd ever seen. And I
*  was always thrown by that. And, and, and I started to get more like, well, what do I want to do in
*  standup? And I was like, I just want to make people laugh. I just want to, and then when the
*  shows ended, I started directing some stuff and then I did a special called that ain't right.
*  And that was the HBO special that upset a lot of people and also put me in Rolling Stone and
*  Newsweek and all that was because it was dirty. I said, fuck a lot. Cause I was
*  at subject matters. Well, no, yeah, a little bit. I used fuck as a verb a few times. I don't,
*  you know, you know, if it's an expressive, right. But it was your huge, I mean, it's what I said,
*  funny because that's what you had always been doing, but they didn't expect that out of you.
*  Cause they wanted full house and America's funniest home. But who would go to see that? What am I
*  going to do? Hug people and clean, you know, they wanted that sort of Howie Mandel thing.
*  But Howie's blue? He is blue sometimes, but not anymore.
*  So I'm at the laugh factor. He's actually talking about the dangers of doing a bit that could get
*  him fired from the show. He actually talked about that on stage that if he says anything wrong,
*  I mean, he's on the squeakiest of squeaky family entertainment. You know, he went from deal or no
*  deal to this other thing that he's doing now. What is it? America's Got Talent? Yeah. I've been
*  talking to him a lot. He's a great guy. He's a great guy and he's been, had a lot of mental
*  health issues that he talked about in the book and his OCD is just the outskirts of it. How bad is
*  it now with the coronavirus? He's holding on a germaphobe to have the whole world. Rightfully so
*  by the way, somebody wrote that down. The whole world is Howie Mandel now. Yeah. I said something
*  like he's a prophet. I forget who it was. I forget who wrote, maybe it was Gaffigan. Someone,
*  someone said that like that. Someone had a quote like that. I love Jim. He's great. But anyway,
*  so, you know, I don't know why people think that you're like a character you play in something.
*  Well, because you played that character for a long time for so long. And this was pre social media.
*  This is pre podcast. They just associated like Bill Cosby. Okay, for the longest time,
*  people thought Bill Cosby, but I got it on stage. Bill always was offended that I talked blue on
*  stage because he said you don't need it. And when I would see him, I would almost hear like
*  he's saying motherfucker in between. What did Bill Cosby think about Kinnison? I want to know that.
*  I would have loved to see that. I'm sure he just he just disapproved anything blue. But the truth is
*  look what he acted out in his real life. I would just do it. That is why. Yeah, that's why. That's
*  the boys club that he was in my boys club or hate to say that because it's so misogynistic. But it
*  was a guy that looks like I know what I look like. I look like your dentist, your accountant or
*  somebody, maybe your gynecologist if it's a good week, but not yours. But but I'll continue. I
*  swear. I just had a moment of doing like 10 of those that go nowhere. But but the truth of it is
*  for me to say that is the joke for me. And that gets nowhere also. So I have to have content.
*  And the more specials I did and the more I've done stand up like I was about to shoot a new one this
*  year, I've got like an hour and a half of stuff. Of course, everybody's going to have 12 minutes
*  of COVID. But I don't know what it's going to be. But it was really I was about to talk about racial
*  injustice, ready to go because I've got all this stuff when I was a kid and segregation and I was
*  living it and didn't understand it when I was six, seven years old in Virginia. So it was like,
*  I started to have more much more and much more intent in what I want to do right now.
*  And make people laugh. I got to throw a dick joke in just to make myself happy.
*  Well, stand up comedy is supposed to be here's the world through my eyes. Whenever some other
*  comment comes along and tells you not to do your version of reality, they can go eat shit. And
*  usually there's something wrong with them. And that's obviously the case with Bill Cosby. There's
*  something wrong with him. 100% his need to have everyone deliver this G rated comedy was, you
*  know, he was he had some dark, dark shit going on the back of his head. And I fucking looked up to
*  him so much when I was young, I'd watch him on I spy with Robert Culp. And it was this you probably
*  didn't watch it back because I'm older. He was so great. And then, you know, he got his doctorate
*  after just two years, they gave him a free one at Temple. I went to Temple University also,
*  but I graduated. And I didn't, you know, tranquilize people and ejaculate. Congratulations.
*  Thank you for the non ejaculation clause. But he, you know, you can't preach and then be full of
*  shit. It's like, that's what he got away with for his whole life, though, I think. That's how he
*  like covered his tracks. Like, nobody would believe it. Who raped you, Bill Cosby? Oh, go on.
*  There's no way that's what they would think. I guarantee you that was part of what the hustle was.
*  It's like a priest. Like if no one knew that priests raped kids, and then you came home and
*  said, Mom, the priest raped me, your mom would be like, What the fuck are you talking about?
*  Boy Scouts. Look, I mean, there's a fucking ad right now. Yeah. I can't believe there's an ad.
*  I'm glad there's an ad. What do you mean? There's an ad commercial if you if you've been sexually
*  molested by a Scoutmaster. Yeah. Yeah. So all this shit, that's, that's the cleaning that seems
*  to be happening. That's positive, that people are getting called on stuff that's been going on for
*  thousands of years. And in this country for hundreds of years, and terrible, terrible, terrible shit.
*  So that I, that's a good calling out. That's a good. I mean, well, this calling out is one way
*  to look at it. But what's really happening is the the lines between reality, information, like truth,
*  information and people like how how accessible is truth. It's their way. It's there's way less
*  distance to travel to find out reality than they used to be. And we we're remapping our version of
*  the world because of that. And you know, this is what we're seeing with everything with police
*  brutality. So we're seeing with taxes, that's what we're seeing with with government and the
*  environment and, you know, climate change and fill in the blank every single problem in the world.
*  The pandemic is just a giant fucking representation of all of it. Well, it's a wake up call to all of
*  us that there has been way less funding and planning and strategy to deal with pandemic
*  viruses than should have ever been put in place. Bill Gates warned us about this in 2015. I know a
*  lot of people think Bill Gates is the devil now for some reason. Have you been paying attention to
*  that? Yeah. They think Bill Gates is like trying to depopulate the world or some shit. I don't know.
*  I don't know whether to get off Facebook, TikTok. I don't know. Get off all of them. There's a guy in
*  when they were trying to keep Huntington Beach or Long Beach open. There was no wasn't Long Beach.
*  Wasn't Huntington Beach? It was Huntington Beach. It's a Republican area, right? So they had all
*  these people in the street. We're not going to wear a mask. We're not going to stay inside. It was
*  the early days of the pandemic. Right. And this guy is going, you know, do not wear a mask. Do not
*  give in. Bill Gates is the devil. He's got a fucking bullhorn. He was yelling. This is like pre George
*  Floyd, all that shit. And I remember that to me topped off the madness of that particular moment,
*  like Bill Gates, the devil, the guy who made Microsoft, the guy who wears sweaters.
*  Yeah. Bill Gates is the devil. It was crazy to listen to. But so many people do believe that.
*  We're all over the fucking place. People are all over. And it's like one side's over here,
*  so liberal that I'm not allowed to say anything. I'm talking about just how not as a narcissist,
*  but as a human artist, how it affects me, how it affects you. And then everybody's over here. So
*  far right. It's fundamentalists on both sides. Can't we just cut off the little hands on each
*  side and just have just a, or can't everybody have a, if there has to be a dream discourse,
*  it's not going to happen. This is how change happens. You have to have polars. You have to
*  have polar opposites. This is just a natural- It's like fundamentalism. And it is. It's the same
*  thing you see on the left as you see on the right. Their ideology varies, but what their goal is,
*  is the same. Their goal is compliance. They want you to listen. They want to have power and control.
*  And then there's people that are fairly reasonable that can see other people's perspectives that
*  lean towards the middle. Those are the healthy people. But these people that want you to use 78
*  different gender pronouns and they only want to give money to- I can't keep up. I make so many
*  mistakes. It's not mistakes, man. Well, I did a thing in Austin, which we both love, and I did a
*  thing for the Ally Coalition. And it's for the LG- I always fuck it up. It's LGBTQ, but Q is questioning
*  or queer. It changes. What? Yeah. It's questioning them? Or queer. At that moment it was. And then A
*  now. You know, A's in there too? What is that? Asexual. They got thrown in the mix. I'm fine with
*  that. So I'm not throwing- I'm not- I did a joke at that. They're a gang. I did it for them because
*  they're a wonderful organization that helps a lot of people. And it was- I loved it. And I was with
*  Jay Farrow, who I loved being with. And a bunch of people, a bunch of comedians were on the thing.
*  And I was the, I guess the headliner of the thing that they brought in. This gorgeous structure. I
*  don't know if you've seen it. It looks like the inside of a Mac store, but it's outdoors in Austin.
*  It's like a monolithic looking cool thing. And so I made a joke, something about LGB. I did all the
*  letters and then I said, that's my record locator on my flight. And that got an awful quiet response.
*  And I didn't understand it because I was, I'm with them, but I'm not making fun of them.
*  I'm part of them. Maybe the joke just wasn't that good. I think so from your response.
*  It's possible too. You're carrying around in your head. But then I did another, I did a song
*  about transitioning that I'd written for the event. Transitioning what? From a male to a female
*  and me having a relationship. Cause I do comedy music in a purest way. Cause I love
*  writing songs and singing. And I've always done that in my standup. I started as a musical act
*  that we would all ridicule. And I had to pull before I got to the end of it because it was just,
*  it got quieter and I heard crickets and I felt so bad because I was doing it as saying,
*  Hold on, hold on. Stop, stop. Did that do well in clubs that bit?
*  Yeah, it was killing. I did it on a special. But you're doing it at an LGBTQA positive event?
*  That's cause I'm a fucking moron. And I care about people more. I care about all human beings. I
*  don't, I don't have a racist bone in my, I don't understand anything. I'm an idiot. I'm a fucking
*  what? I heard your dick's racist. My dick is so. Don't. Thank you. Thank you. You saved me.
*  I understand that you. My dick spits at racism. But you know that that's not a comedy. Look,
*  I don't do any sort of benefit. And the reason why I'll just donate money. I don't do benefits
*  cause it's not a good place for comedy. But my sister died of scleroderma and I do.
*  But donate money. No, but would you do a tape for my viral event in October? I wouldn't do.
*  Three minutes on tape. I wouldn't do. She died, Joe. She died. Listen to me. I wouldn't do
*  acrobatics in a benefit to help people with spina bifida. Spina bifida is hilarious by the way. I
*  don't know if you've had it. No. I got over it. Or people that are crippled. Okay. I'm not. Right.
*  You know what I'm saying? Like you're doing comedy in an event where people are talking about a
*  serious issue that maybe they've been maligned and misgendered and just fucking disenfranchised
*  their whole life. And then you're on stage telling, you know, a questionable joke that wasn't your
*  best joke. And then a song about transitioning and you're wondering why they're not laughing.
*  It's not funny to them because it's not a, it's not a comedy show. You're doing comedy out of
*  thing. Why weren't you in my life sooner? I don't know. Will you manage me? No. So here's
*  I'm here for advice. So if you want to call me up. Here's the thing. The thing that I do,
*  I'm part of the sclerotema research foundation because my sister died of this disease.
*  What is this disease? It's a hardening of the skin. Sclero means hardening and derma means skin.
*  And a lot of people have it. Different people. A lot of people. A lot of people. And proportionately
*  hits people of African descent, not unlike coronavirus. It hits the lungs.
*  Um, Queen Latifah's mother passed away from it. I know other people who've, um, had it. Um, it's,
*  it's, uh, and I lost my sister and my dear friend. And the first person to ever do the benefit,
*  benefit was Robin Williams. And he did it seven times afterward and we've raised 53 million dollars
*  and we're curing people. That's amazing. People are getting into remission. What do they do for
*  the cure? Like what, how do they get there's new therapies. Uh, my sister was mistreated and
*  guinea pigged. They gave her cortisone and prednisone, which drives you fucking nuts.
*  And, um, they just tested stuff and the, the rheumatologist that did it to her is no longer
*  alive. And, and I mean, how do you sue somebody that didn't know what he was doing? But now there's
*  centers at Johns Hopkins and at, uh, UCSF and Stanford and they're really new drugs, like really
*  great ones. So it's always been a comedy benefit and there are people, there are patients there.
*  And I've always had everybody's done it. Chappelle did it for me in LA at the Beverly
*  Wilshire. And I had, it was, it was wonderful. I think it was, um, John Mayer got up on stage and,
*  um, I think it was Ray Romano and, um, I'm wondering if it was Gaffigan. I've had almost every comedian
*  do it, but Chappelle made me put on the invite. Um, and Dave Chappelle might come, says Dave
*  Chappelle says he might come and he flew himself out and he did the damn thing and he couldn't do
*  material because we didn't lock up phones and he did a half hour of being the beautiful person
*  that he is. That's awesome. And so all I was saying was Robin did it seven fucking times. So
*  here's my question. So Richard Jeni, uh, Patrice Brody, you know, all these people, Sam, uh,
*  Chris Farley, it wasn't a standup, but why do really truly funny people have to die?
*  Shouldn't there be some kind of universal law? Mitch Hedberg, Bill Hicks. Well, you know,
*  people die, bro. It's part of life. I know, but they, but the love, when you say Robin Williams
*  to somebody, anybody, they get emotional because he, he could have never done standup and just
*  acted in movies. When 9 11 happened, um, you know, about 9 11, right? Yeah. Okay. Uh,
*  can't do that. Can't do that joke. It's not a joke. It's just me being an ass. Thanks for,
*  thanks for sitting through this with me. I knew I haven't had my shrink in a while.
*  You go to a shrink. No, you're smart as fuck. So anyway, sensory deprivation tank. Oh, do you?
*  Yeah. That's cool. Yeah. You get alone with your thoughts for real. I've done it. Have you? Yeah.
*  I got one here. You do? Yeah. It's all salt and you get it in. You play music? No. Tones,
*  any kind? No. Just your thoughts. Just my thoughts. I just do breathing exercises. I know that you,
*  you know, the readings of Terrence McKenna, cause I was a mushroom boy back in the day.
*  I'm good friends with his brother. No shit. Yeah. His brother Dennis is amazing.
*  Holy crap. Yeah. Yeah. I was going to see him. I was, I had a 420 show in Vancouver.
*  He lives in BC now. He's a expat. He bailed out of this fucking wacky country and went to it
*  just as wacky one. Right? Fuck. But I love Vancouver. I mean, he picked a good spot.
*  I love Vancouver. Um, let me just finish the Robin thought please. Yeah. Cause I apologize.
*  Um, so nine 11 happens and I'm home and I'm alone. My kids, I was divorced. My kids were
*  at their moms and, um, all the channels are running the footage for 24 hours and Fox television
*  runs Mrs. Doubtfire. And I'm like, what a great fucking thing they did for me and for people.
*  And I know a lot of people that I've talked to over the years that go, yeah, I watched Mrs.
*  Doubtfire that night. They fucking on their network, which was still kind of a new network
*  in a way. They ran it. And it's a story about divorce and what he would do to get back to his
*  kids. And his acting in, in that is, you know, it's a sweet movie. That's a movie that I gave
*  as an example. And someone's saying, uh, I S because someone was saying that trans people are
*  never funny and a straight person in drag is never funny. I go, you can't say it's never funny.
*  And I said, you don't think it's, it's never funny when someone pretends to be a woman.
*  And the guy says, it's never funny. I go Mrs. Doubtfire. Tootsie. Well, that's a good one too.
*  But there's a lot of them. Mrs. Doubtfire is a very strong example, but it's not about,
*  that's not about that. It's about having to do the greatest disguise to be able to see his kids.
*  Yes. But he's still pretending to be a woman and it's fucking hilarious. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Well, he, he was, all I was saying was if he had never done standup, if Robin had just been,
*  just been a great actor, dead poets. I mean, Eddie Murphy was one of the best standups ever.
*  Yeah. Stops. Yeah. And now he just does films.
*  I have a, I have a story for you about him that I think you'll dig. Uh, so I'm hosting the main
*  room thinking I'll never get a career. Everybody's off. Everybody's gone. Arsenio's gone. Uh,
*  Howie. What do you mean? You think you never get a career? I, I, I was on the road, not making a
*  lot of money, but in the meantime, I would host, uh, for years, the Westwood store, which was no
*  more, which was fun actually. Sam. So you're really young at this time then. You, you were
*  20s. You weren't going to have a career already in your twenties. Yeah. I was depressed. All my
*  twenties, my, all of them. That's crazy. I was, I'd be on a plane and didn't care if it went down.
*  That's how stupid I was. Really? I should have been gone to a doctor. That's what I should have
*  done. Be that depressed. So I'm there and I'm hosting and, um, Eddie Murphy comes in and this
*  is not on the bill. He didn't call for a spot. So Eddie comes in and he's working out raw. And I
*  don't know that it's raw, but then he comes out and he's in, I can't remember if it's the blue
*  leather or the red leather suit, but he's in one of them and he looks like a fucking God.
*  I mean, he looks, I've never seen anyone more beautiful. I want, I look at him, I go, Oh my God,
*  look at it. His skin was like butter. I mean, he's, I wanted to kiss him. He's still beautiful. He's,
*  he's amazing. He's one of the most, but he wanted to be the Beatles of comedy. He is, he, he, he is.
*  So I'm the host on a Friday night and it was, uh, Sam was going to go on later
*  and he comes out and the place standing ovation, the walls shake and he does about 50 minutes on
*  a Friday night. Wow. And I'm watching it and it's good and it's, and I'm laughing and I'm seeing it.
*  He's working, he's working it. Yeah. That's why he's there. And he's getting, and he's getting
*  ready for something because he's dressed in his wardrobe for what will be the suit. That's going
*  to be the show, the movie. And then, um, he finishes and it, and it great applause standing
*  ovation, but what you would expect. I was there the next Friday. I was there all the time. I lived
*  there, which is why I went away for a long time. Besides work happened. I was on Broadway and
*  whatever the fuck happened. Just on the street, you know, I'm just, just begging, but I, uh,
*  but, but, uh, a week later, a week, one week later, the following Friday, he comes out in the other
*  color suit. I don't know if it was blue or red filling. It was blue that, that other Friday,
*  one Friday later. And I asked, had he gone up at the improv or laugh factor anywhere? And they said,
*  no, he comes up and he does an hour and 10 standing ovation. When it starts, I watched
*  how great he is with my own eyes, ears, and heart. It was, I never saw anything like it.
*  I've the, the, when he was done, he had crushed it so strong in a way that was so fucking funny
*  because it was, it had emotion in it and it, it talked about racism and it talked about just,
*  and it was dirty and it was great. And the wall, literally the building shook and that building's
*  got like dead mobsters underneath it. That's very solid. That building, there's cement down there.
*  I'm not kidding. The wall, I thought it was an earthquake and it was minutes, minutes of applause
*  and I come back out on stage, you know, and he's, he's face to face with me and I go that,
*  that was fucking amazing. And he just gave me a, a nod like, yes, sir. And then he was gone. And
*  he was always very kind to me too. But I got to see that I got to see in one week,
*  what brilliance it took for him. So what do you think he did? Do you, do you think he just went
*  and reviewed the material and if he didn't perform at all that week, he must have,
*  not necessarily. No, I think not necessarily is the answer. I think he just did what we do
*  when we're good and went over it and over it and over it. As long as he worked at it.
*  There's no way he didn't work at it. Well, sometimes he didn't just leave it there,
*  but sometimes it's not that sometimes it's just inspiration. Sometimes you feel different.
*  Sometimes you just feel better. Like sometimes you go on stage, you just feel loose. Yeah. He
*  just got an idea of how to do it. You feel physically better. Maybe like maybe you're more
*  well rested or maybe he didn't like the set the week before. So he didn't thinking about it for
*  all that time. I could tell he didn't after that first set. Cause he was, his mind was worrying
*  like it does when we're trying to work something out. Well, listen, man, that's the weirdest thing
*  about doing a special. You leave that material to the ether. It's gone. And then you start from
*  scratch. You have no weapons. So here you have these people that are coming to see you. Oh my
*  God, it's Bob Saget. I love Bob Saget. I'm so excited. And you ain't got shit for them.
*  I did that. You're scrambling. I did that after my last special. Look, every time I do a set of the
*  comedy store, after my special comes out, I don't have anything. I have a few scraps. I have a few
*  ideas, a few premises. You know, this is the last time I got lucky that I had a couple that I couldn't
*  really do in my last special. I never really fleshed out. I could start with them. I could kind of get
*  going, get, get a little bit of momentum and then piece together an act. But that desperation is what
*  creates your, your, your act. This, this last, after that happened and what I could feel was happening
*  in the world the past, and you could too, for the past year, year and a half of what was, what we
*  were going toward with Trump at the helm and all of the shit that's been happening and all the people
*  at each other. So I, it started happening fast where new stuff was coming to me and I was reflective
*  over my life and reflective over real things, more real things, not just a bunch of nonsense or just.
*  So you wanted to do more real, thoughtful,
*  storytelling things that mean something to you rather than just jokes. But I, but I can't help
*  myself as you apparently tell without taking little asides to throw in something that's just
*  like fucking what? When you say that you want to do this though, like how much time were you working?
*  How much years were you doing? Quite a bit. I've been on the road and I've been wanting to be on
*  the road more than I've ever wanted to be on the road. Wow. So up until pandemic, I was set to go
*  to Canada and they closed Canada the day before. Actually they closed it the day after I pulled on
*  Vancouver and they were. So you basically just touring back and forth and just doing a lot of,
*  a lot of clubs, getting everything looted up. A lot of clubs, a theater, a bunch of theater runs,
*  little theater runs, not big ones. Getting everything nice and loose. Yeah. And when were
*  you thinking about filming? I was going to go fall this year. Me too. I was already, I know where I'm
*  going to shoot it. I don't even want to say, cause I have some real cool shit that I have, that I
*  want to do that it's part of the place, part of it. But it's just, I can't look like it's bad. I
*  can't feel like it's just going to, what we're all going through is just going to make me,
*  it mean even more. Everything we're going to get to do when there's a vaccine, when we find out if
*  their vaccine works, we find out what the fuck all this is. When we get to go out and really do a
*  room that's a hundred percent full and we don't know it's, you don't know what's coming with your
*  big dates coming up. I think they're all getting canceled if I had to guess. I mean, unless
*  something happens between now, I mean, I'm supposed to do Madison square garden, October. Have you
*  played there before? Yeah, I've played the smaller room, but I'm doing the big room in
*  Boston garden back to back two weeks in a row. Motherfucker. And I don't know if that's happening.
*  Chappelle and I have a bunch of gigs. I saw. I don't know if that's happening. But you'll just
*  move them. You'll just move them a year, right? Yes, a year. A year's likely, but even then we
*  don't, what kind of a climate are we looking at? What is the world going to be like? That's the
*  least of my concern right now. I mean, doing stand up is great. I would like to do stand up again.
*  Right. It's a selfish concern. Right now I just want to look, if we never do stand up again, man,
*  life is beautiful. I want to appreciate life. I want to appreciate my friends. I want to appreciate
*  my family. I appreciate being able to do this podcast. This has been one of the nicest things
*  that there's a place that I could sit and hang out with people and talk and learn. Like this podcast
*  has made me grow a lot as a human being. It has. A lot. I've listened and watched. It's shifted my
*  perspective. It's made me way more aware of how much responsibility I have doing this thing.
*  When we first started doing this podcast, it was me and Brian Redban and whoever the guest was,
*  Joey Diaz or Eddie Bravo or Ari Shafir, whatever it was. And there would be like a thousand people
*  listening at the most. We'd get like a thousand downloads. It'd be crazy. So we got to practice
*  when there was like no stakes and you could still listen to them. Some of them are terrible
*  and some of them are getting me in trouble now because some of the ridiculous shit we said.
*  Right. Trying to make each other's laugh. But that led to this. And did you, for whatever reason,
*  we just kept doing it or I just kept doing it. It became this. Did you have any vision in your mind
*  that it would be what other people look at as like an empire? No fucking chance. No. You just did it.
*  I'm a grinder. I'm a person that I see something and I try to get better at it. And I know that I had
*  a bunch of podcasts that weren't that good. And so I'd go, what was wrong with that one? Well,
*  I talked too much or maybe I interrupted too much or maybe I didn't have enough to say about the
*  subject. So maybe I should be more prepared or maybe I should be more focused. And then I
*  would be like, what's a distraction? Like make sure people don't look at their phones, make sure
*  you're locked in, be really engaged, be in the moment in the conversation, be better at that.
*  And I just kept doing it. That's kind of, you're an influence on me in a huge regard because I
*  didn't come to podcasts because every fucking person on the earth has, the kid across the street
*  has a podcast. You know, the UPS guy the other day had a podcast. Really? No, but. But it's okay.
*  I'm like on number 33 and I'm learning very fast because I'm a broadcaster. You know, I know how
*  to do things, but it's not. It's a conversation. That's why I'm so drawn to what you do. There's
*  people listening. This is the most important thing. Yeah. And they love it and they need it.
*  But it's also, you have to listen to the way you sound. You have to listen to the way the
*  conversation's going. Like it has to be, there has to be something in what you're talking about
*  and the way you're talking that makes people want to listen. I don't know how to teach that.
*  I don't, I mean, I don't know. I think, but you get better at it. It's a skill. There's something
*  to it. That's just like everything else, man. It's like, I don't play the piano, but I would
*  imagine it's like playing the piano or learning any other skill. The more time and focus you put
*  into it, the better you get at it. And it's, to me, it's, it's fascinating still to this day. If
*  I get a scientist in here or a researcher or someone who's writing a book on something. Yeah,
*  an Elon Musk with a flamethrower. Yeah, it's fascinating. I, I, I, when, when I'm having
*  those conversations, I'm, I'm locked in, man. I love it. I enjoy it. And I never,
*  never thought I'd be doing this. And this is not a plan. There was no plan to this. Isn't that the
*  best? It's great. I don't know if it's the best, but it's great. Well, it's the best. I'm enjoying
*  it. I think it's the best because it comes from an organic place and that's why it worked.
*  That's why it works. I mean, that's why it's going to even, I don't know if you read, but you're,
*  you're, you're, you're moving it. I don't know if you read about it. Yeah, that's why here,
*  some people that work for me to tell me that. Yeah, that's moving somewhere. I can't remember
*  where, but I just move in somewhere big apparently. Yeah. I, you know, and that's a, that's a mind
*  fuck too. Cause now it's like, there's more scrutiny on it. There's more people paying
*  attention and criticism and everything, but it's also, it's like, I just keep doing it.
*  I just keep going and I just keep focusing on that. And that's the real challenge, right? As
*  it gets bigger, can you keep doing it the way you're doing it? Can you keep getting high and
*  get drunk and have friends here and just talk shit? Yeah, I'm going to see until the wheels fall off.
*  They're not going to fall off because you're, you're a special guy. I'm just telling you,
*  I'm 64. I could say shit like that. What if when you're 62, they did not let you? No,
*  I wasn't allowed. I was talking to Norman Lear the other night. He's going to be 98.
*  How's he doing? He's fucking genius. On the ball at 98. We were, we had a zoom with a bunch of
*  music guys, like I said, and he is one of the most beautiful people I've ever, I will ever know.
*  What's his key to being sharp at 98? He cares about humanity. He, you know, he changed television. He
*  gave us all in the family and Sanford and Son and Good Times and the Jeffersons. Isn't it crazy
*  that none of those shows you could do today? But they're doing them. They are doing the live ones
*  on ABC. Jimmy Kimmel and he are doing those, those shows. Doing what? All in the family.
*  And what are you talking about? The Jeffersons have been running new episodes. What? Woody
*  Harrelson's Archie Bunker. Shut the fuck up. And Marissa Tomei is Edith. Shut the fuck up. Sorry,
*  you really need to Google this. Is this actually happening right now? This is gigantic. It's happened
*  a couple months ago. What? Yes, before the pandemic. What? This is about as real as it gets.
*  How the fuck am I just hearing this? How can you, I told you something you don't know. Wait a minute,
*  this is Woody Harrelson? That's Woody and they sing those with the days. As Archie Bunker? Get the
*  fuck out of here. And it's fucking awesome, Joe. It's awesome. Wow. And Norman Lear and there's
*  Marissa. This is crazy. You have to watch it. It's awesome. I can't believe this is real.
*  No, it's, it's. How do you know about this? Are you joking? No, I didn't know about this.
*  Well, I gave you. What did you tell me, Jamie? I gave Joe some, I gave Joe intel. Live in front
*  of a studio audience, all in the family. Holy shit. So it's Norman and Kimmel and ABC and it's
*  fucking. Kimmel's one of the producers? Is that what you're saying? Yeah, they do it together.
*  And it's, it's fucking, it's so special because the stuff is about racism. Cause people didn't
*  quite understand. Some people were just loving Archie and not getting the sadness. They're all
*  dressed like they're in the seventies. Yeah. So it takes place in the 70s. Look at the collars.
*  Yes. And on the, on the Jefferson's, you had Jamie Foxx. I mean, this is. What? Yes. This is big
*  shit. How the fuck do I not know this? You've got to go and watch it. You've got to look it up.
*  You got to watch a little bit of it. I'm that old man that doesn't know anything anymore. I'm
*  completely out of the loop. I'm so relevant. You're the relevantest guy I've ever met.
*  No, the most relevant is Norman Lear. So he's 98. Look at this. This is crazy.
*  It's absolute. Now who's going to do Sanford and Son? I don't know if they're going to do that.
*  Why not? I don't know if you can do Red Fox. DL Hughley.
*  Ooh, there's a few people. I love DL. I do too. I think he could do it. So he was on stage at
*  saying he's in Nashville and he passes out and he's got coronavirus. I know. How good is his
*  tour manager that caught him as he was falling asleep? Yeah. Isn't that amazing? He could have
*  had his head crack open. Oh, for sure. He was going down. You know what? I'm sure this is what
*  I was saying about all these comedians that we love. And I got, I'm so fed up with that because
*  I love comedians so much. I started, I don't reach out to DL that often.
*  We see each other once in a while. I started texting him. Are you okay? It's Bob Saget. Please
*  don't think I'm weird. I can't fucking take it anymore. That is you. Please don't think I'm weird.
*  No, he texts me back. He's laughing. He's going, I'm okay. I wrote something else. I'm sorry I
*  texted you. Then the next day I called him. I said, what the fuck, man? How sick are you?
*  He goes, I'm okay. I'm okay. It doesn't seem to be that sick. I saw him talking. No, he seems okay.
*  You know, Brian Callan got it. Yeah. And he's fine now. He was pretty sick. He had a strong
*  mechanism. His instruments pretty together. Well, he didn't take any medication. Brendan Schaub,
*  his friend, took medication and he was fine in four days and Callan took him like 11 or 12,
*  but he's fine now. He said he feels good. I'm concerned with long-term effects from anybody
*  that has this because I was talking to a friend of mine who is a doctor who is saying he's treating
*  a basketball player who three months, a guy in his twenties, three months after COVID is still
*  having issues with his endurance. He hasn't gotten his endurance back to where it is. Like his lungs
*  are not working at full capacity. So there's perhaps some damage or something. I've heard
*  from people that are scarring. Yeah, that happens. Fucking terrifying. You know, what is this Jamie?
*  Scans reveal heart damage in over half of COVID-19 patients in study. Oh, great. Maybe they should go
*  with more patients. There was something else I could send this to you. There was another,
*  well, it's not necessary, but it was essentially saying that in the autopsies that they're doing
*  on people who died of COVID, they're finding blood clots in all of their organs and their liver,
*  their lungs, their kidneys everywhere. Yeah, this is a fucking weird disease, man. And they don't
*  know if the vaccine, and what I've been hearing with the vaccine, they don't know if you get it,
*  if it doesn't, if it can keep you safe. They don't know. They don't know. Well, they don't know. First
*  of all, they don't know if a vaccine is going to be even possible. Normally it takes a vaccine
*  upwards of four years to develop, and they're trying to do this and fast track it. And they're
*  also trying to do something called an mRNA vaccine. It's a different kind of vaccine that doesn't use
*  a live version of the virus, but instead forces your body to create proteins. See, we could pull
*  up what that means. I remember, I'm a moron. So when I say these things, even though I use the
*  right words, I really don't know what the fuck I'm saying. Very important to remember. You're becoming
*  me. mRNA virus. See if you can, excuse me, mRNA vaccine. I typed it in, but it's not saying what
*  it is. That's it. We'll never find out. The definition of mRNA vaccine. Messenger RNA.
*  Messenger RNA. See, it does something to the body and forces the body to create proteins that fight
*  off the virus. Another thing that's really important is vitamin D. They are finding,
*  and this is what you were talking about with African Americans having a particular problem
*  with COVID. African Americans have a particular problem with vitamin D as well, because of course,
*  with their skin color, their ancestors all came from Africa where your body had all this melanin
*  to protect itself from constant sunlight. So they didn't have to worry about absorbing so much vitamin
*  D from the sun because they were in the sun all the time. This is the reason why Irish people are
*  so fucking pale. The reason why they're so fucking pale is because where they are, there's no goddamn
*  sun. So their body has to be like a solar panel for vitamin D. Your body produces vitamin D because
*  of sunlight and it's not just the vitamins. It's actually a hormone. I've really been getting into
*  this lately. Do you take a lot of supplements of vitamin D? Yes. My wife says- I take 5,000 IUs a day.
*  So I was talking to your guys before I came in here and they were saying, yes, I've been out in
*  the sunlight because I've been out, go to the pool. That's like Hawaii for my wife and I.
*  That's been helpful. It feels good. That's good, but you're also getting a little bit of sun damage
*  there too, right? You got to be careful about that. Yeah, I put on the shit. But is that protecting
*  you from vitamin D as well? Probably. What you should do is get blood work done and find out where
*  your vitamin levels are. It's not hard to do. Go to a good doctor. They can do blood work. My wife wanted
*  me to take supplements. She says, right before I came in here, she said, that's what I've been
*  trying to do. You don't take vitamins? She said, I do. I do, but I don't take too many. You should
*  take vitamins. You should go to a doctor that really understands this kind of shit and could
*  look at your blood work and say, hey, you need niacin, you need vitamin D, you're low in zinc,
*  and all those things protect you. Is it a normal doctor or is it a person that's-
*  We'll talk afterwards. When you have a body that is deficient in nutrients, that body lacks
*  the strength to prevent illnesses. Part of what your immune system is, is your body has an army
*  that fights off bad diseases. When your body doesn't have any building blocks,
*  your body doesn't have any nutrients, your body is deficient in all sorts of critical
*  nutrients that it needs for all these different functions, it's not going to do the job.
*  It's real simple. When your body's weak, it's not going to do the job. Fortunately for us, in 2020,
*  you can take supplements. Vitamin D is not expensive, it's not prohibitive, but it has a
*  huge impact. One of the things that they're showing is that, and this is something that Dr.
*  Rhonda Patrick talked about when she was on the podcast, she went over all these different studies
*  that they've done in places where COVID patients were in the ICU. And in several, but one of them
*  that I can recall, 80 plus percent of the people that were in the ICU for COVID had vitamin D
*  deficiency. Four percent had sufficient levels of vitamin D. And there's multiple studies that point
*  to the exact same thing, is that it's critical in your body's ability to fight off illness and
*  particularly effective with COVID. So when you're talking about African Americans, one of the things
*  my doctor told me was that when he was doing tests in Manhattan with African Americans, some of them
*  had non-detectable levels of vitamin D. So these are people that, first of all, their ancestors
*  come from a climate where they're supposed to be in the sun all the time. Now they're not,
*  because they're in this northern hemisphere, cloudy. It's in the winter, they're not getting
*  anything in the sun, and they're not taking any vitamins. So they're just not getting it. It makes
*  them particularly susceptible. Another thing that makes people particularly susceptible is obesity.
*  That is, according to my friend who's a doctor in New York, is a huge factor in people that are in
*  the ICU. Obesity is a huge factor. Obesity, vitamin D, those are two big ones. Zinc does something
*  that stops the virus's ability to get into the body. I don't know how that works, but something
*  about your body's, the virus's ability to enter into the body is somehow or another stop by zinc.
*  I've always had a problem taking too many supplements. I went on a lot of kicks. I had
*  a couple doctors recommend certain vitamins, and D was one of them for sure, and biotin.
*  D's fucking huge, man. Most people are deficient in D.
*  Does it upset your stomach? C upsets my stomach.
*  How does it upset your stomach? I don't know. I have an acidic stomach.
*  Says who? What are you talking about?
*  It feels like it's burning a hole through it when I take a vitamin C.
*  Well, do you take it with food? That's what I've done wrong.
*  First of all, you should take most vitamins with food.
*  And then when I fart, it's like a white cloud. A white cloud?
*  Yeah. Are you looking in the
*  mirror while you fart? How do you know it's white?
*  Who doesn't? I mean, you've never looked over and farted in the mirror?
*  I haven't. Over the shoulder?
*  I don't think I have. Maybe we should do a photo session.
*  Maybe not. Let's say not and not we didn't.
*  You should take vitamins with food. Most vitamins are, they get absorbed better.
*  You take them before or after? Well, I think the best way to do it is
*  probably in the middle of your meal. Like eat some of your food.
*  When you're eating elk, which I've seen a lot of photos of, a lot of elk pictures,
*  would you take the D in the middle of four pieces of elk?
*  Yes. I have a hard time telling people to do what I do.
*  Basically everything. I don't mind it because you're kind of like a perfect human specimen.
*  But they're not going to do it. They're not going to do what I do physically.
*  They're not going to do what I do. I might. I take advice.
*  I have a stack of vitamins. It's like this, like a fucking monopoly board.
*  And I pull those bad boys out when I eat and I pour four of these and two of those and 10 of those
*  and I just eat those and I eat them with my food. That's what I do.
*  When I'm eating, I'll stop in the middle of the meal and I go out and I get my box.
*  I have a box full of fish oil and.
*  Right. Fish oil, right?
*  Yeah.
*  What does it do? It is probably not a good topic, but what does it do to your stool? What happens?
*  I don't know. I always do it.
*  Do you have a nice one?
*  I have regular shit.
*  All right. Is it tapered?
*  Like a fucking hammer, bro. Comes out hard.
*  Residual or no?
*  It's just shit. It's regular shit.
*  Okay. So it's not in compartments. It doesn't come out all separate like vitamins.
*  No.
*  You don't like shit like 40 vitamins.
*  No.
*  Shit capsules.
*  It doesn't have anything to do with your shit. It's what, you know, just your shit comes from food waste.
*  That's what shit is?
*  Yeah.
*  I didn't know that.
*  It's mostly fiber for a lot of people. When you eat meat only, that's what's interesting.
*  Yeah, you were on that. You just did all. You lost a bunch of weight on that.
*  Yeah, I did. When I did that, I had smaller shits. It was interesting.
*  I was eating a lot of meat, but your body absorbs it.
*  Meat is mostly water, right? So you've got like the tissue and then the water,
*  and the amount that you shit is surprisingly small. Whereas when you're eating a lot of salad
*  and you're eating a lot of like celery and fibrous foods, all that stuff, your body doesn't really
*  digest it.
*  But it's good for you, right?
*  I don't know. I don't know.
*  Everybody's saying that we need to have our vegetables right now.
*  Not everybody.
*  Some people are saying you need to have the vegetables, and then there's some people that
*  are on this carnivore diet that say you don't need any vegetables.
*  Some people are vegan, like my wife's a pescatarian. She worships fish. And I am on,
*  I'm B positive blood.
*  My 10 year old goes, is a humanitarian someone who eats people?
*  I mean, that's going to happen soon. I think we're on the, but I mean, I think it's going to
*  become popular.
*  You think so?
*  Yeah, I think one day.
*  What if lab created human meat is the best thing to eat at a restaurant? It's like the veal.
*  We have some beautiful lab created human, lab created buttocks.
*  You can get it at Umami. They would have that. Umami has people.
*  A restaurant, they come out and they have one of those like fucking bugs bunny silver things
*  where they pull the top off of it and it's a dude's butt. It's just a perfect butt, like an athlete.
*  I ate the best ass today.
*  It's like this, we're going to crock pot this. It's going to be a beautiful, beautiful roast for you.
*  But it's not, it does not a part of an actual person. It was all created in a lab.
*  Right.
*  So someone who's always wanting to eat a guy's ass.
*  Simulated. I mean, who doesn't?
*  Pull that top off and show them.
*  Simulated man ass.
*  Like if you go to Morton's, they come by with the steak tray.
*  Yeah.
*  And they show you this is the ribeye. This is a beautiful marble cut.
*  Five asses.
*  I mean, they're making lab created meat. Why not make lab created human meat?
*  Do you eat that stuff?
*  I have never, cause it's not available, but I would try it.
*  But I mean, not man.
*  Oh, that fake shit?
*  Yeah.
*  No.
*  The soybean shit.
*  My wife gives it to me. I don't really love it.
*  It's supposed to taste pretty good, but it's not good for you. It's not good for you.
*  If you want to eat vegetarian or vegan, eat vegetables, eat actual real vegetables.
*  Don't eat some fake beef bullshit. That's not real food.
*  I need my meat.
*  Well, you eat meat then.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's not supposed to be good for your heart.
*  Says who?
*  People.
*  But have you looked into that?
*  No.
*  Yeah. See, that's the thing that people just keep saying.
*  Yeah. They hear what some guy says.
*  You know what's bad for your heart, man? Sugar. Sugar and refined flour.
*  No, fat's not bad for you. Fat's essential. You need fat. It's actually food for your brain.
*  I thought it's also good. It helps lube up the meat so you can shit better.
*  Perhaps. Listen, we can go down this rabbit hole, but it's already four o'clock. It would take a
*  long time for me to explain nutrition to you. It's four o'clock?
*  Yes. Motherfucker.
*  Time flies in this room.
*  You're enchanted. How the fuck do you do this?
*  You sit, you talk.
*  Yeah.
*  You have a good time. A couple hours pass by.
*  Pa-pow.
*  I love this.
*  It was fun. Glad we did it, Bob.
*  I love it.
*  Tell people about your podcast. How'd they get it?
*  It's on, you know, it's wherever you get them, right?
*  Wherever you get them.
*  Apple, it's Spotify.
*  It's on Zigzag.
*  Is it on YouTube as well?
*  It is, but I got a brand new YouTube site. I'm a newbie. It's up there for Zoom videos
*  because I've been talking to people.
*  Beautiful.
*  But I have really good guests. I've been having that, but I call people too to see how they're doing.
*  And Instagram? Just Bob Taggart?
*  Yeah. Instagram, Twitter. I got TikTok until China pulls it.
*  Don't get off the TikTok. They're watching you every move.
*  Are they really?
*  Yeah. The Chinese government. They're in your ass right now.
*  Maybe I need that.
*  Maybe you do.
*  But what about Alexa? Isn't she listening to everything?
*  She's listening to everything.
*  Everything.
*  So is the Apple thing. The Apple Home. The motherfucker's listening to everything too.
*  Siri's listening.
*  Siri, that bitch is on.
*  Siri's fucking me every day.
*  She knows everything.
*  All of them.
*  Fuck her.
*  She and Alexa should take a slow boat to shit though.
*  There you go. Let's end with that. Bob Taggart, I love you.
*  I love you, Joe.
*  Thank you, buddy.
*  Thank you.
*  This was a lot of fun.
*  This was great.
*  Goodbye, America and the rest of the world. See ya.
