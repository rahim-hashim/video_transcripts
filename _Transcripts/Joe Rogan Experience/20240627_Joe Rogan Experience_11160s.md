# Joe Rogan Experience #1876 - Greg Fitzsimmons
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5.72s)]
*  Then one must be sober for a month. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10.44s)]
*  Must one workout every day? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=18.28s)]
*  Isn't that part of it, too? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=19.6s)]
*  Must one workout every day. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=20.6s)]
*  One must work out. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=22.76s)]
*  One must burn 500 calories in a workout every single day. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=24.28s)]
*  365 days. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=28.68s)]
*  Well, 60. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=29.68s)]
*  30. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=30.68s)]
*  30 days. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=31.68s)]
*  I'm already expanding. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=32.68s)]
*  So isn't it, is there a contest about who can burn the most calories? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=39.68s)]
*  No, we're not doing that because we go crazy. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=43.32s)]
*  The problem with contests is they absorb your whole life. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=45.96s)]
*  And everybody except Ari has a family and obligations and jobs and podcasts and different [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=49.0s)]
*  things they have to do. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  We did it one year, the contest, and it was pretty obvious halfway in that we were fucked. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=56.46s)]
*  I remember you got behind and then you just powered through and came from behind with [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=62.14s)]
*  like some crazy workouts. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=68.7s)]
*  Well, I was never really behind. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=70.42s)]
*  I mean, I might have been behind for like a day. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=73.26s)]
*  In the beginning, we were trying to figure out how much we were going to burn. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=76.78s)]
*  Because we were using this MyZones thing. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=80.06s)]
*  So it's like you wear a chest strap. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=82.14s)]
*  And the chest strap gives you points with the application for however many minutes you [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=84.54s)]
*  are at 80% of your max heart rate versus 90% of your max heart rate, like 90s, two points, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=90.46000000000001s)]
*  80s, one or something like that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=96.34s)]
*  And Ari figured out that you could watch TV while you were doing cardio. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=98.98s)]
*  So he watched movies on an iPad while he's doing cardio. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=105.88000000000001s)]
*  And he ran up a big number, like 400 in a day. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=109.38000000000001s)]
*  We were like, fuck. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=112.34s)]
*  That was a big number. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=114.34s)]
*  That was like two movies. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=115.34s)]
*  And so then we really started getting crazy. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=116.34s)]
*  And then one day I did 1100 points. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=119.82000000000001s)]
*  I did seven hours of cardio. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=122.46000000000001s)]
*  No shit. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=124.62s)]
*  Mostly what, running? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=127.98s)]
*  No, mostly elliptical machine. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=128.98000000000002s)]
*  Because you could watch movies. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=130.54s)]
*  So I watched John Wick like 50 times. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=132.58s)]
*  I kept rewinding it to the scene in the bathhouse where he kills everybody. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=136.1s)]
*  Just because it's so adrenaline filled, you can keep going. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=140.9s)]
*  I watched some fights. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=143.57999999999998s)]
*  I watched a bunch of shit. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=144.57999999999998s)]
*  And it's like, it just got too crazy. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=145.98s)]
*  We were losing our minds. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=147.98s)]
*  We were really losing our minds. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=150.14s)]
*  We were talking a lot of shit to each other. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=151.14s)]
*  And Tom got sick. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=153.34s)]
*  Tom got the flu. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=154.66s)]
*  And then the day he got better from the flu, he ran 13 miles. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=155.66s)]
*  No shit. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=159.18s)]
*  The day he got better, he ran 13 miles through his neighbor, through the hills. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=160.18s)]
*  Damn. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=164.73999999999998s)]
*  That's different than a treadmill. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=165.73999999999998s)]
*  13 miles on the street is like... [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=167.29999999999998s)]
*  That's real. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=169.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=170.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=171.66s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=172.78s)]
*  And if that kept going, imagine if we had it for six months. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=173.78s)]
*  We had a fitness contest for six months. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=178.42s)]
*  And at the end of six months, you win a million dollars. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=180.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=183.7s)]
*  You could have got a sponsor for that. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=184.7s)]
*  Easy. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=187.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=188.94s)]
*  The problem is it would become your whole life. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=189.94s)]
*  We would go crazy. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=191.62s)]
*  And Burt would die. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=193.14s)]
*  Burt would for sure have a heart attack. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=194.14s)]
*  Or he would just be content coming in last like he did the last time. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=196.01999999999998s)]
*  He talked a lot of shit and came in last. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=199.34s)]
*  He did. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=200.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=202.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=203.3s)]
*  It seems like a great idea for your... [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=204.3s)]
*  For me, working out is just for my head. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=208.42000000000002s)]
*  I don't even give a shit. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=210.26s)]
*  I mean, this body, I was naturally born with. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=211.26s)]
*  It's a gift. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=213.3s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=214.3s)]
*  But my brain, if I work out, man, I just feel happy. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=215.3s)]
*  And if I don't, I get depressed. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=218.46s)]
*  So one of the things we talked about, Tom and I talked about specifically, was that [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=219.98s)]
*  when you do a lot of cardio in a day, like four hours of cardio in a day, he goes, all [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=223.98s)]
*  the internal chatter just goes away. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=229.62s)]
*  I go, yeah, there's no negative talk. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=231.7s)]
*  There's no anxiety and angst. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=234.62s)]
*  And I really wonder how much of that that people walk around with all day could be fixed [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=236.98s)]
*  with cardio. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=240.86s)]
*  It could be fixed with rigorous exercise. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=241.86s)]
*  And they say weightlifting helps anxiety too. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=245.5s)]
*  They say strength training does. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=249.9s)]
*  But for me, it's like cardio. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=251.7s)]
*  Cardio seems to put me in this place where it just is like, whatever. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=254.78s)]
*  Who gives a fuck? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=259.14s)]
*  It's just a really peaceful, it balances out what's really important to think about and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=260.82s)]
*  worry about versus things that are just sort of bouncing around in your head. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=269.09999999999997s)]
*  You don't know if I should pay attention to that one or that one. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=272.82s)]
*  And what should I freak out about the most? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=275.14s)]
*  Every time I watch the news, every time I look at the news, I'm like, how engaged do [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=277.78s)]
*  I get here? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=282.58s)]
*  Do I freak out about Russia? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=283.58s)]
*  Am I going to freak out and then my whole day will be a freak out? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=284.86s)]
*  Or do I recognize that there's not a goddamn thing I can do about this and just casually [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=288.54s)]
*  be aware of it and hope it doesn't explode? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=293.58000000000004s)]
*  That's the dilemma. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=297.42s)]
*  Like basically every day. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=298.42s)]
*  With wild shit like the Russian-Ukraine war, most of the time I look at the news, I'm like, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=299.74s)]
*  how much am I going to engage with this? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=304.90000000000003s)]
*  And not just the news, but like everything in your life. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=308.46000000000004s)]
*  I have to do it when I listen. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=311.70000000000005s)]
*  I listen to books about the Civil War because I listen to audiobooks when I go to sleep [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=313.02000000000004s)]
*  at night. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=317.18s)]
*  That's the only way I can sleep. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=318.82s)]
*  I try to find the dullest nonfiction available with like a good British author and it just [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=319.82s)]
*  puts me right to sleep. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=327.06s)]
*  So I've probably listened to 50 nonfiction books in the last 5, 10 years. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=329.54s)]
*  Do you fall asleep with the headphones on? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=335.5s)]
*  Is that a problem? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=338.74s)]
*  It is. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=339.74s)]
*  Do you have dreams? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=340.74s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=341.74s)]
*  I set a timer. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=342.74s)]
*  It goes off after 45 minutes. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=343.74s)]
*  You've got some guy talking to you about some guy bleeding out from a musket wound in the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=345.3s)]
*  woods. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=349.54s)]
*  He got shot by his own cousin because they're on the wrong side of the Mississippi. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=350.54s)]
*  I do. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=355.38s)]
*  The one I just listened to was about Jesse James. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=356.38s)]
*  It was pretty badass. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=358.5s)]
*  Jesse James was born in Missouri. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=359.5s)]
*  And Missouri during the Civil War. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=364.5s)]
*  When you picture the Civil War, you picture like there was the Confederate states and [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=366.1s)]
*  there was the Union states and they fought. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=371.1s)]
*  No. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=374.22s)]
*  Missouri, this family was Confederate, this one was Unionist. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=375.22s)]
*  And they would just go kill each other. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=379.34000000000003s)]
*  It was random. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=382.22s)]

*  It was him and his brother Frank and these other guys. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=388.18s)]
*  They had like, the press kind of like made heroes of them because they said that they [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=394.3s)]
*  were like Robin Hood. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=399.74s)]
*  They were given to the poor because you know they gave a couple of widows some money that [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=402.06s)]
*  they mostly kept. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=406.21999999999997s)]

*  that lived in like Appalachia and how many of them were involved in feuds that led to [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=420.06s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=429.7s)]
*  The mythology behind this, the most fascinating thing, he was saying that these people come [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=430.7s)]
*  like they immigrated from a part of the world where they were herders, like they're herded [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=435.06s)]
*  animals and when you herded animals you had a very different reaction to transgressions [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=440.97999999999996s)]
*  than someone who like say was a farmer because someone couldn't steal your farm. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=447.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=452.86s)]
*  But they could steal your animals. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=453.86s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=454.86s)]
*  You had to be violent in your defense of your property because it could be gathered up by [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=456.02000000000004s)]
*  somebody else. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=461.66s)]
*  You had to constantly be vigilant and you had to be very wary of intruders because people [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=462.66s)]
*  did that all the time when they come in they would steal all your sheep. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=465.82s)]
*  So when they came over to America they carried that ethic about conflict. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=469.18s)]
*  They were to the death. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=476.1s)]
*  They would go to the death. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=477.98s)]
*  They would come for you and that's just the way they lived. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=479.32s)]
*  Like if you stole from them they would kill you. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=482.5s)]
*  If you insulted them they would kill you. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=484.66s)]
*  And they were all living in the Appalachias. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=488.26000000000005s)]
*  Wow. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=490.62s)]

*  uniquely violent? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=494.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=496.14000000000004s)]
*  Well it's because those people. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=497.14000000000004s)]
*  And clannish. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=498.14000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=499.14000000000004s)]
*  They emanated from this population of people that grew up having to defend their animals. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=500.14000000000004s)]
*  It completely makes sense. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=504.18s)]
*  What were they like, Scottish mostly? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=505.5s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=507.3s)]
*  I think they were Irish and Scottish. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=510.66s)]
*  Which also makes sense. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=513.14s)]
*  Wild ass drunks. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=514.14s)]
*  Yep. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=515.14s)]
*  Constantly involved in fights. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=516.14s)]
*  Long history of warfare. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=517.14s)]
*  Yep. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=518.14s)]
*  You know those are wild people man. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=519.14s)]
*  Wild fucking people. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=521.22s)]
*  You know you think about the people that are there are the descendants of people who've [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=522.94s)]
*  lived there thousands of years. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=527.94s)]
*  Like that's what's so crazy about Europe as opposed to America. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=529.74s)]
*  You know if you're not a Native American tribes person who's on your family's land and it's [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=533.3000000000001s)]
*  been that land for hundreds of years. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=538.0s)]
*  You're fucking everyone's from somewhere else. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=539.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=541.46s)]
*  If you live in Scotland there's a good chance that someone 400 years ago from your family [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=542.82s)]
*  also lived in Scotland. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=548.4200000000001s)]
*  Which is wild. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=550.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=551.46s)]
*  To the point we were talking about this the other day. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=552.46s)]
*  When is there going to be like I don't know how this works but I know that when they do [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=555.4200000000001s)]
*  a genetic test they can find out some of your family's from Eastern Europe you have this [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=559.48s)]
*  percentage of Eastern Europe genes. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=562.9000000000001s)]
*  This percentage of genes from Asia. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=565.0600000000001s)]
*  They can do that with like a 23 and me right. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=567.86s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=570.1s)]
*  Is there an American gene. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=571.4200000000001s)]
*  At what point in time like how many generations do we have to stay in this one spot or is [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=572.9s)]
*  it just such a constant melting pot with people constantly moving into here that it never [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=578.62s)]
*  will be like you know I'm saying like is it is it possible that people could say oh your [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=583.86s)]
*  ancestors came from America. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=588.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=590.4200000000001s)]
*  Is that even possible. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=591.4200000000001s)]
*  That is funny because I'll ask people in the audience like what's your ethnicity and they [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=592.62s)]
*  say white and I just look at them going like what the fuck is wrong with you and they'll [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=596.78s)]
*  be like a black person sitting right next to them and they'll be like white I'm white. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=601.66s)]
*  It's fucking great. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=607.8199999999999s)]
*  What's your ethnicity. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=611.8199999999999s)]
*  And so you can't white is not an ethnicity right isn't it odd. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=613.4599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=617.5799999999999s)]
*  It's kind of odd that the Latino is an ethnicity. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=618.5799999999999s)]
*  African-American is an ethnicity. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=622.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=625.02s)]
*  African-American is an ethnicity. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=626.1s)]
*  But that's not like being white. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=627.98s)]
*  Like if you say. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=630.26s)]
*  Germans just white right. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=632.86s)]
*  Irish is just white. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=634.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=635.78s)]
*  Well you would say probably Saxon. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=636.78s)]
*  Or fuck would say Saxon. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=639.5s)]
*  I'd be like get out of my office. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=642.38s)]
*  Tad. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=645.38s)]
*  Tad with the whale belt and the shirt tucked in. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=646.38s)]

*  Get the fuck out of his office. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=651.78s)]
*  Well mine I guess the Irish a lot of the Irish are Normans. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=653.7s)]
*  The Norman invasions that were in like the 11th century or something came over. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=658.5400000000001s)]
*  And so like Fitzsimmons the name Fitzsimmons literally means bastard son of. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=662.98s)]
*  Anytime you hear Fitz that means bastard son of. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=668.22s)]
*  So originally it was Simmons which was like wherever the Normans came from I guess that [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=671.5400000000001s)]
*  would be the French area or north. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=676.34s)]
*  And so they would come in and they would they would give a part they would steal a [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=680.86s)]
*  parcel of land from the Irish and they would say Simmons this is yours now. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=683.78s)]
*  Now you're Fitzsimmons. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=688.1s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=861.8000000000001s)]

*  being a professional and then having it in a way where you're autonomous so you have [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1109.96s)]

*  cast in this thing because you had a joke about that thing because that holds people [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1120.04s)]

*  say woke shit either on stage or on Twitter because they want to affirm that they're in [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1131.08s)]
*  a part of this group of people that will continue to work in Hollywood so they'll say things [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1136.36s)]

*  It's such an obvious thing to say. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1143.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1145.68s)]
*  You're saying this nonsensical fucking silly virtue signaling shit that everybody else [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1146.68s)]

*  Yeah and if your morality or your politics lines up with that type of thinking do a joke [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1157.72s)]
*  that shows it. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1165.6399999999999s)]

*  It's so corny. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1174.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1175.12s)]
*  There's great ways to do jokes that show that racism is bad without ever having to put a [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1176.12s)]
*  fucking light on it. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1181.8s)]

*  They get into this pattern and habit of joining teams. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1195.0s)]
*  And if you're in team Hollywood there's one way to decide about things. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1199.6s)]
*  It's the most progressive, most left wing, most inclusive, most this, most that. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1203.28s)]
*  Poll it. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1207.72s)]
*  Poll it with young people. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1208.72s)]
*  Whatever kids in college think is the most important that's what they're going to talk [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1210.22s)]

*  That's funny. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1247.28s)]
*  It's like you're free of politics in that sense. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1248.52s)]
*  There's not a team that you would like. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1250.32s)]

*  a bad motherfucker. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1256.96s)]

*  Who cares who he's friends with? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1267.28s)]
*  Because he's that good. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1268.52s)]

*  I don't know enough about football to comment on that. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1290.44s)]
*  He was considered a first rate starting quarterback. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1293.0s)]
*  They stopped using him because of his protests? [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1297.08s)]
*  It's questionable. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1299.72s)]
*  Obviously, it's quantifiable to some degree. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1300.72s)]
*  You can look at a quarterback's rating and stuff like that. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1304.4s)]

*  You got it. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1477.9s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1481.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1482.1000000000001s)]
*  And he had a legacy. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1483.1000000000001s)]
*  That's like a jailable offense, isn't it? [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1484.1000000000001s)]
*  Is that one of those? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1490.7s)]
*  I mean, that seems like one of those ones that wouldn't just be a fine. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1491.7s)]
*  That seems like it. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1494.98s)]
*  If you're stealing from welfare, that's the kind of stuff people go away for, right? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1495.98s)]
*  Well especially because one of the millions of dollars went directly to him. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1501.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1505.3400000000001s)]
*  So, it's like some of it went to the school and one of the millions went directly to him. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1506.3400000000001s)]
*  And he's already so wealthy. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1510.9s)]
*  Imagine how much money he would pay to not have that happen. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1512.7s)]
*  He'd pay half his money. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1515.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1519.14s)]
*  If this scandal was about to go down right now and people found out, how much would you [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1520.14s)]
*  pay to not have that happen? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1523.7s)]
*  Definitely be more than a million. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1525.5800000000002s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1528.5800000000002s)]
*  He'd probably give you like two million. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1529.82s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1531.1s)]
*  Well, he's probably worth 30 or 40 million. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1532.1s)]
*  He'd probably give you half of that to not tarnish the reputation. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1535.82s)]
*  Forever. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1538.6999999999998s)]
*  And not only that, but might wind up in jail. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1539.6999999999998s)]
*  You know, there's a problem that needs to be addressed whenever it comes to football [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1542.3s)]
*  players, fighters, combat sports athletes, is that people with CTE oftentimes have very [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1547.02s)]
*  poor decision making. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1553.58s)]
*  It's very complex because everybody's version and severity of CTE is different. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1556.06s)]
*  But one of the side effects of having too many concussions is you become very impulsive [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1563.74s)]
*  and you start doing risky things, risky behaviors. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1570.1799999999998s)]
*  Sometimes people get addicted to substances and gambling and a lot of wild shit. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1573.74s)]
*  And it comes from like your brain being rattled. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1578.82s)]
*  Like it's just not working right. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1582.86s)]
*  Like you have all sorts of impulse control. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1584.54s)]
*  Makes sense. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1587.8999999999999s)]
*  So I think risky things like this might have been exciting. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1588.8999999999999s)]
*  You know, like you should have obviously morally known that's not the thing to do. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1593.5s)]
*  But there's something I think for guys that have been hit in the head too many times, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1597.74s)]
*  like risky things like, oh, they would just want. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1601.58s)]
*  If you're a guy and you've got all your jollies at a playing football, I mean, you got all [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1604.6599999999999s)]
*  your jollies out of being this bad ass fucking quarterback or some bad ass running back. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1610.46s)]
*  And the amount of excitement on Super Bowl day must be unfathomable to us mere mortals. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1615.74s)]
*  To us mere mortals, the excitement of being on that field and knowing that millions of [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1623.78s)]
*  people are going to be watching around the world, millions. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1629.3s)]
*  And there's 50, 60,000 people in that place screaming their fucking heads off. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1632.42s)]
*  And you're playing football at the highest level of the world. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1637.3799999999999s)]
*  Fuck, man. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1640.58s)]
*  You want a guy like that to just go back to normal life after he's been hitting the head [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1641.58s)]
*  50 times. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1645.8999999999999s)]
*  Hey, I got my own mower now. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1646.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Jesus Christ. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1648.82s)]
*  That guy is going to start gambling and going to whorehouses and starting coke and punching [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1650.82s)]
*  traffic attendants. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1655.86s)]
*  Look, he's fucking bored out of his mind. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1657.26s)]
*  Look at Lenny Dijkstra, man. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1661.1399999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1662.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1663.74s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1664.74s)]
*  How about fighters? [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1665.74s)]
*  Think about how excited you are to go to a Super Bowl. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1667.14s)]
*  Think about the excitement level that person has and now you're the guy in the center of [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1670.34s)]
*  it. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1674.46s)]
*  And you got the possibility, if you win, of making an extra million in your bonus or whatever [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1675.46s)]
*  else. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1679.66s)]
*  There's so many factors going into that. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1680.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1682.54s)]
*  There's a lot going on. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1685.54s)]
*  And retiring from that has got to be incredibly difficult. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1686.86s)]
*  And that pales in comparison to someone who they ship overseas to fight in war and then [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1694.3799999999999s)]
*  bring them back to America and then just say, all right, you're done. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1703.62s)]
*  Just go be normal now. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1708.1399999999999s)]
*  Also with the head injuries. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1709.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1710.58s)]
*  Would you have a hundred combat engagements with the enemy? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1711.58s)]
*  How many times did you have to shoot people? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1715.58s)]
*  And then you come back over here and you're supposed to be normal. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1718.1399999999999s)]
*  And when I talk to guys that have served and experienced combat duty and then come over [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1721.78s)]
*  here, I'm like, how much counseling do you get? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1725.78s)]
*  It's very little. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1728.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1729.42s)]
*  Very little guidance. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1730.42s)]
*  You know, reach out if you need help. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1731.42s)]
*  There's numbers you can call. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1732.94s)]
*  But at the end of the day, it's like that's a complex transition to go from literal war, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1734.02s)]
*  actual war, like shooting guns at enemy. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1741.0600000000002s)]
*  They're shooting guns at you. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1744.14s)]
*  You're in a foreign land. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1745.6200000000001s)]
*  You're going through mountains. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1748.14s)]
*  People are yelling things in languages. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1749.38s)]
*  You don't know. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1751.3s)]
*  And you're hearing guns going off. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1752.3s)]
*  And you might die today or your friends might die today. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1754.1s)]
*  But for sure, people, you know, are going to die. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1757.3s)]
*  And also part of your training. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1759.3999999999999s)]
*  A big part of your training is to not feel. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1760.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1763.4599999999998s)]
*  And so now you're coming back and you're being asked, hey, talk to us. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1764.4599999999998s)]
*  Let us know how you're feeling. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1768.82s)]
*  And it's like, well, go, sir. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1769.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1771.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1772.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1773.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1774.82s)]
*  That's why they found that with with trauma, with PTSD with soldiers, they found a thing [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1775.82s)]
*  called EMDR, which is a way of doing therapy that doesn't involve talk. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1778.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean, you talk, but it's not about recognizing feelings. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1783.5s)]
*  It's about they they give you it started with like, you remember, like, watches, the shrink [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1787.86s)]
*  would take the watch and go back and forth with it. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1793.54s)]
*  It's about connecting the two different sides of your brain together. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1795.94s)]
*  Have you ever been hypnotized? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1798.3799999999999s)]
*  No, I have. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1799.3799999999999s)]
*  Really? [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1800.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1801.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1802.82s)]
*  My friend Vinnie Shorman put me under. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1803.82s)]
*  He does hypnosis for a lot of fighters. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1804.82s)]
*  He's like a mind coach for fighters. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1806.74s)]
*  Very interesting guy. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1809.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1810.02s)]
*  And explained to me what it was. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1811.02s)]
*  All right, let's give it a shot. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1812.02s)]
*  So on my old studio, I lay down the couch and he talked me through like this. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1813.1000000000001s)]
*  I forget exactly how he did it, but we went through this thing like, you know, you're [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1820.6200000000001s)]
*  going to be relaxed, you know, this and that. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1824.0600000000002s)]
*  And next thing you know, I was in like a state of mind. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1825.94s)]
*  I was like, this is really fascinating. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1828.22s)]
*  It's like this is a it's almost like you have access with someone else. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1830.5s)]
*  And someone helps you and guides you. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1835.74s)]
*  You have access to a state of mind that you don't achieve independently. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1838.42s)]
*  Or I didn't know how to achieve independently. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1842.3s)]
*  But it's an unusual state of mind. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1844.14s)]
*  It's like a very real thing. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1845.14s)]
*  So like when I got hypnotized, I was realizing as it was happening, this is interesting because [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1846.74s)]
*  this is a very real thing. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1850.22s)]
*  So it was almost like you're on a drug. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1852.02s)]
*  It's like this drug that puts you in a different spot. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1854.74s)]
*  Like, oh, here's let me unscrew you from your life. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1856.82s)]
*  I'm going to put you over here and now look at your life. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1860.98s)]
*  And I was like, wow. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1864.5s)]
*  I was like, oh, this is a real way of doing it. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1866.1s)]
*  And then someone can talk to you logically and they can explain things to you and would [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1868.18s)]
*  make sense. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1873.02s)]
*  I think everybody's afraid they would wake up with no pants on and like what happened. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1874.02s)]
*  But I don't think it works like that. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1877.74s)]
*  So all of a sudden you're singing Madonna with no shirt on in front of a comedy club [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1879.78s)]
*  audience. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1883.54s)]
*  Yeah, that was amazing, though. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1884.54s)]
*  We used to watch Frank Santos. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1886.3799999999999s)]
*  Frank Santos. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1888.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1889.82s)]
*  Rated hypnotist from Rhode Island. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1890.82s)]
*  He was amazing. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1892.14s)]
*  His son does it now. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1893.14s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1894.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1895.22s)]
*  And this guy would he would literally get. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1896.22s)]
*  But wait, but just to stay on that, like so what did what did he walk you through? [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1898.42s)]
*  Did you have an epiphany? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1902.7s)]
*  Like how similar is it to like doing mushrooms or something like that? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1903.78s)]
*  It's like a kind of a drug, maybe a little bit, but doesn't feel scary. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1906.9s)]
*  It just feels relaxed and it just you have you have some additional clarity. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1911.34s)]
*  But it does feel like with someone's guidance, you're allowed to escape from your mind and [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1916.3s)]
*  from your life in a weird way. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1922.58s)]
*  I feel like that's what it is. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1924.8999999999999s)]
*  Like when someone's talking you through it, it's like there's a thing about someone like [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1926.58s)]
*  you're letting someone guide your brain. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1930.86s)]
*  And this is what I said about comedy before, too. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1933.42s)]
*  When someone's killing on stage, like when Joey Diaz is killing on stage, I'm thinking [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1936.26s)]
*  the way he's thinking. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1940.26s)]
*  Like, that's why it's so fun. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1941.26s)]
*  It's because I'm not really calculating anything. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1943.62s)]
*  I'm letting him control my brain. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1945.34s)]
*  I'm letting him and his material take me for a ride. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1947.86s)]
*  And that's what a hypnotist is doing. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1951.14s)]
*  It's like you're letting them take you for this like ride of like peaceful, introspective [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1953.26s)]
*  thinking and clarity on your life. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1958.8600000000001s)]
*  That's how it felt to me. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1962.22s)]
*  I was like, so this is like a mindset that can be achieved this way. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1963.22s)]
*  I mean, maybe it could be achieved by yourself. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1967.38s)]
*  I don't know how to do it. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1970.3000000000002s)]
*  But I don't know much about like achieving psychedelic states through breathing. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1971.8600000000001s)]
*  I really haven't really tried much other than some yoga breathing exercises that make you [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1975.14s)]
*  feel a little high. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1979.38s)]
*  But people get, like people trip balls from breathing exercises. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1980.7s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1984.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1985.26s)]
*  Well, you know, Annie Letterman's got some hypnotist that does finances that helps you [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1986.26s)]
*  deal because money is everything. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1992.78s)]
*  They say psychologically, it's a great place to start. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1994.38s)]
*  Like when you come into a shrink and you negotiate the price you're going to pay them, that's [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=1997.02s)]
*  the first step of your therapy because they can tell so much about you by your relationship [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2000.54s)]
*  to money, how much you hold on to it, how much it scares you. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2004.3s)]
*  So she's got this therapist that she's worked with that she says is amazing that puts her [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2008.3799999999999s)]
*  under and then she said she's made a lot of money since she started working with her. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2012.66s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2017.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2018.42s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2019.42s)]
*  So the therapist is a capitalist. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2020.42s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2021.66s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2022.66s)]
*  Well, I would imagine if you are tripping yourself up less, you'll make more money. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2023.66s)]
*  If you're not getting in your own way. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2031.22s)]
*  Because one of the things you find about like talented people that get freaked out by success [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2033.22s)]
*  is that they'll start to sabotage. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2037.98s)]
*  They'll start to fuck things up. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2040.66s)]
*  They'll show up, miss a flight. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2042.1000000000001s)]
*  They'll do, you know, they start getting a little crazy. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2045.18s)]
*  And it's just like the fear of like fucking up once you've already started becoming successful [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2047.7s)]
*  and people start becoming self-saboteurs. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2053.82s)]
*  Drugs. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2056.14s)]
*  You just stop that from happening. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2057.14s)]
*  You would just naturally have an escalation in your career. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2059.38s)]
*  If you're good and you're getting better, you'll continue to get better. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2064.1800000000003s)]
*  If you keep working, you keep showing discipline, you keep having new material, you'll be fine. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2066.82s)]
*  But along the way, it's the getting in your own way stuff that fucks people up. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2071.1400000000003s)]
*  And if you're a therapist, could just pull that out. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2075.6600000000003s)]
*  Stop getting in your own way. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2079.26s)]
*  Just not alone, you'd make more money. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2080.98s)]
*  I think it also has to do with like my father said to me when I was growing up, we're talking [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2082.9s)]
*  about how successful some people get. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2087.38s)]
*  And he said everybody is at the level that they think they should be at. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2089.38s)]
*  And so you can start to become successful and get scared and go, I don't belong up there. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2094.42s)]
*  And so you have to somehow reframe where you see yourself ending up. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2099.82s)]
*  Yeah, or not think about it at all like I do. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2105.02s)]
*  Just don't think about it. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2108.46s)]
*  I think too many people think too much about like where they want to be. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2109.94s)]
*  I just think you should think about being better at what you do. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2113.86s)]
*  I think being better at what you do is a real thing because being where you want to be, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2116.94s)]
*  you never feel like you're there. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2121.54s)]
*  Trust me. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2122.86s)]
*  No matter where you go, you always want more. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2123.9s)]
*  It just never ends. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2125.7000000000003s)]
*  The only thing that makes sense to me is concentrating on being better at what you do. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2127.06s)]
*  So for me, it's like the things that I concentrate the most is like stand up and podcast. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2132.42s)]
*  And then with the UFC commentary, man, that job is like I'm just lucky to be a professional fan. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2137.78s)]
*  So all I have to do is just like know who's fighting, what their styles are like. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2144.6600000000003s)]
*  And the thing is playing out. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2148.26s)]
*  I mean, I have very little to do with the thing, you know. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2150.6200000000003s)]
*  So that job is just like a beautiful being a fan reaction job. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2153.18s)]
*  But like for podcasts and comedy, if I started thinking about like goals where I want to be in four years [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2157.7799999999997s)]
*  and this and that, then I'd be thinking about that instead of thinking about new material. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2163.3399999999997s)]
*  I'd be thinking about that instead of thinking about like I want to be stimulated by this kind of guest. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2167.8199999999997s)]
*  I want to talk to this guy about this subject. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2173.7s)]
*  Like I'm watching this documentary and maybe I can get him to expand on that and explain it to me like that. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2175.94s)]
*  That's the only way it's good to me. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2181.34s)]
*  Like and that's the only reason why I think it's good period. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2182.9s)]
*  Why it works because I don't think about it every time I've been frustrated with where I'm at career wise. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2186.2200000000003s)]
*  I just I write some new shit. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2192.02s)]
*  I go to the club. I do it. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2193.6600000000003s)]
*  And all of a sudden something happens. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2194.94s)]
*  Yes. It's not not necessarily like there's some talent agent with a cigar in the back going, this kid's a star. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2197.02s)]
*  It's just more of an energy that you're putting out because you're just like your juices are flowing [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2203.3s)]
*  and your confidence is up because you're realizing what you're capable of. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2208.66s)]
*  You just have to overcome resistance. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2212.22s)]
*  And that's one of the terms that Steven Pressfield uses in The War of Art. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2214.54s)]
*  The War of Art, not to be confused with the Art of War. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2220.5s)]
*  Oh, yeah. You gave me that book once. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2222.7s)]
*  Yeah. And he talks about resistance. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2224.3399999999997s)]
*  And that's the resistance is the thing that keeps you from writing. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2226.1s)]
*  The resistance is the thing that keeps you from doing those sets that you know you should go do. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2229.02s)]
*  You know, oh, man, it's Tuesday night. I want to go out. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2233.38s)]
*  Go do that set. Do it. Do it. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2235.42s)]
*  You need to do it. And then write and then write. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2237.7s)]
*  And then the universe will reward you. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2240.2599999999998s)]
*  Like that that feeling of resistance, the feeling you get when you write something new that you know is going to be funny is one of the best feelings ever. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2242.7s)]
*  It's so good. You're like, oh, shit, I got one. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2249.8999999999996s)]
*  It's like I caught a fish through the ice, you know, like, oh, boy. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2253.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's amazing. Yeah. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2257.18s)]
*  And so then you know that you were rewarded for overcoming that resistance. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2258.98s)]
*  But so often you just want to like jerk off or watch a movie or eat a pizza or play a video game. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2263.14s)]
*  But if you could just force yourself to sit in front of that fucking computer, whenever I do, I come up with something, a punch line, a tagline, a new premise, something. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2270.62s)]
*  If I can just get if I could sit there for two hours, just two hours, just drink some coffee, smoke a little weed and just sit there for two hours. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2281.7s)]
*  Something's going to happen, man. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2290.7799999999997s)]
*  That's what's amazing. When I look at people that like you, Bill Burr, people that really like Louis C.K., people that really create at a high level, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2292.82s)]
*  like it is the ability to not eat that pizza or play that video game. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2302.6200000000003s)]
*  And there's something in most people that can't resist that. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2308.54s)]
*  And it goes back. I can remember being in college and having a fucking term paper due and instead going out for a beer or jerking off or whatever. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2311.6600000000003s)]
*  And, you know, and I'm like, you know, it's I don't know what that is. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2319.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't know if that's completely innate or if that's something you can build on. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2324.7s)]
*  You can build on it. One hundred percent. You can build on it. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2328.66s)]
*  Everybody think it's like what you were saying before about being as wealthy or successful rather as you think you should be. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2331.3799999999997s)]
*  You know, that everyone is as successful as they think they should be. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2338.3799999999997s)]
*  Eventually, I think that's I think it's similar to that. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2341.22s)]
*  I think you just decide that you're this person that fucks things up and you continue to fuck things up because that's your past. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2344.7799999999997s)]
*  It's like one thing I've said before that I had to learn very early on because, you know, when I was a kid, I got bullied a lot. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2351.74s)]
*  And, you know, I was kind of very timid and worried about people kicking my ass because we moved around a lot. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2359.8999999999996s)]
*  And then I became a martial artist. And then in the process of becoming a martial artist, [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2365.1s)]
*  I realized, like, I would still get nervous when I was around people who bullied me before when I was younger. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2369.1s)]
*  I didn't I didn't feel like I should have been just like, hey, fuck face. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2374.7s)]
*  But I was still nervous around them, even though I knew I could kill them. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2379.3s)]
*  I was still nervous around them because I program myself to feel like a loser when I was in this town, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2382.7799999999997s)]
*  when I was around these people, when I was in like a certain like I had like a triggered memory. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2387.7799999999997s)]
*  And I was like, oh, and it made me realize like you can decide you are your worst failures or you can decide that you're you. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2393.74s)]
*  You're you right now. Like all that. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2401.18s)]
*  Don't hold on to that. That's a valuable lesson. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2403.2599999999998s)]
*  It sucked when someone kicked your ass or when you fell on your ass and looked like a fucking loser in front of everybody. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2406.1s)]
*  But those moments are very important for who you are right now. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2411.94s)]
*  But it doesn't mean you're still that person. Some people are never separate from their worst memories. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2416.5s)]
*  The biggest mistakes getting their ass kicked in front of people have gotten their ass kicked in high school and never recovered. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2423.7s)]
*  Never recovered. Have been a confidence mess their whole life. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2429.38s)]
*  Been shell shocked from one ass kicking, especially if they deserved it. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2433.62s)]
*  You know, they're picking on some guy and he fucking beats their ass and he gets on YouTube. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2438.2599999999998s)]
*  You might never recover. You will constantly be in your mind. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2443.38s)]
*  You at your worst moment, instead of having the ability to come back, talk to that guy and go, dude, I was a fucking piece of shit. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2447.82s)]
*  And thank you for kicking my ass. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2455.2999999999997s)]
*  You're right. You're right. You're right. I was in the wrong. I shouldn't have been a bully. I was a dick. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2457.54s)]
*  I don't even know why I'm doing it. I'm only 17. I'm a fucking idiot. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2461.78s)]
*  I'm growing and learning, but I'm not your enemy. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2464.7s)]
*  Like that was that's a beautiful moment that everyone's denied. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2467.74s)]
*  Like no one you know, you're not going to see that YouTube video. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2471.54s)]
*  You're going to see the video of that guy who deserved it getting his ass kicked. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2474.18s)]
*  And for that guy, that moment when people experience a bad moment in their life, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2477.7s)]
*  that moment when it's something as brutal as like getting your ass kicked when you deserved it, that can fucking define you forever. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2483.46s)]
*  Well, not only as a kid, but like I think about like we were talking about guys that have gone and women that have gone on SNL. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2492.46s)]
*  And after a year or two, it doesn't work out. And then they just become ghosts in the comedy world. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2499.46s)]
*  And then you look at like Shane Gillis, who didn't even get on the show, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2504.46s)]
*  but had a traumatic experience of almost getting on the show and how he dealt with that and how he recovered and how he rose from those ashes and how he got stronger. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2509.46s)]
*  And then you got the guys that are still that's still their credit that they were on SNL. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2519.46s)]
*  And you're like, I don't remember you on SNL. And it was like 12 years ago. And they never got back on the horse again. They lost their confidence. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2523.46s)]
*  That SNL thing is a totally different environment. And if you've ever heard Jim Brewer talk about it, Jim talked about on this podcast that he would come up with premises for sketches and he'd be working on a sketch. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2530.46s)]
*  And so you have to put in like a database, everything you're working on. And other writers would steal those premises and write their own sketches on those premises and just like take just hamstring them. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2543.46s)]
*  Yeah. And he confronted them and there was like yelling and screaming and eventually his wife talked him into leaving. Jim Brewer is a great example, though, of a guy who because he left Saturday Night Live, people kind of slept on him and they forgot that he's one of the best comics alive. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2553.46s)]
*  That dude is so funny, man. He's so fucking good. And he's such a good guy. He's such what you see is what you get. He's a rock solid human being. He's a great guy. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2570.46s)]
*  And he became more famous over time just through like the accumulation of videos getting out there because he doesn't promote himself. He doesn't try. He doesn't give a fuck. He's like a genuine person. He was happy to just go and he has a legion of fans so he can go sell out comedy clubs any fucking time he wants. He shows up in here and there and he's just killing it for the weekend and goes back home to Jersey and relaxed. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2587.46s)]
*  He's out in the country. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2610.46s)]
*  And then when the pandemic hit and all the craziness in Jersey, he bailed and went to Florida. He's like fuck it. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2611.46s)]
*  Oh, I didn't know that. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2616.46s)]
*  And now he's dead in a tornado. Oh, sorry. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2617.46s)]
*  Is he in Florida now? [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2619.46s)]
*  Yeah, he's in Florida. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2621.46s)]
*  No shit. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2622.46s)]
*  Imagine if he died. I feel like such a piece of shit. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2623.46s)]
*  The last stop. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2624.46s)]
*  Why do I feel like I should feel like a piece of shit that everybody died there? There's like how many deaths have happened in that hurricane? [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2625.46s)]
*  I don't think that many. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2630.46s)]
*  Did you see Don Lemon was trying to talk some climate scientist into saying that this hurricane is because of climate science? [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2632.46s)]
*  And he's like, I'm not, you know, it's not exactly how it works. I'm just trying to explain to you what is going on. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2639.46s)]
*  This is the hurricane. And, you know, we can cover that more broadly. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2646.46s)]
*  I know every time there's a cold day, all of the climate deniers say, oh, where's your global warming? [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2649.46s)]
*  And then every time there's a hurricane, everybody on the left is like, well, this is... [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2654.46s)]
*  Dude, that is a complex issue. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2659.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2662.46s)]
*  That's a complex issue that we're in danger of getting ideologically boxed into. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2663.46s)]
*  Because no one is ever going to deny that climate change is going to have a giant effect on humans. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2668.46s)]
*  And it seems to be increasing. No one's ever going to deny that. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2674.46s)]
*  There's a lot of people denying that. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2677.46s)]
*  Yeah, but no one logical. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2679.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2680.46s)]
*  Like it's happening. But what I'm saying is like the temperature is rising. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2681.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2684.46s)]
*  What's interesting is why people want to ignore the fact that it's always done this. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2685.46s)]
*  Like humans have without a doubt, we have an effect on that. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2690.46s)]
*  With carbon emissions are up and who knows what the fuck the gas is in the air and all the crazy shit we do with mass production and energy consumption. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2694.46s)]
*  But it's always been up and down. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2702.46s)]
*  Like if you go... I had this guy, Steve Coonan, on the podcast who's a physicist. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2704.46s)]
*  And he wasn't even a climate scientist. He's just a guy who decided to like examine the models. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2708.46s)]
*  And he's like, if you go like thousands of years, it's all crazy. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2713.46s)]
*  It's all like this and that. It's up by this many degrees and down by that many. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2717.46s)]
*  It's like it's never stable. Ever. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2721.46s)]
*  When there was humans living in fucking caves, it was never stable. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2724.46s)]
*  But when they were looking at it over a hundred years, you can get these crazy spikes. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2727.46s)]
*  You're like, oh my God, look, we started using gas powered cars and it was going up and up. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2732.46s)]
*  But if you go a thousand years, that's totally normal. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2736.46s)]
*  All that stuff's normal. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2739.46s)]
*  The question is how much of an impact do we have on it? [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2740.46s)]
*  That's not totally being quantified. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2743.46s)]
*  Like they're not exactly sure. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2746.46s)]
*  They know it's a significant impact, but they know this is happening anyway. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2748.46s)]
*  And the Ice Age happened anyway. The Ice Age happened without us. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2751.46s)]
*  Didn't have anything to do with us. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2755.46s)]
*  It's going to happen again. It's probably going to happen again. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2757.46s)]
*  It's probably this constant cycle. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2759.46s)]
*  X many thousands of years, this happens. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2761.46s)]
*  And then X many thousands of years, that happens. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2763.46s)]
*  And that's why the fucking Sahara Desert used to be a rainforest. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2766.46s)]
*  Do you know that? That giant ass fucking desert in Africa? [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2769.46s)]
*  That was all tropical. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2773.46s)]
*  Yeah. All that stuff's like that. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2775.46s)]
*  That's a constant shifting from like these tropical rainforests into deserts. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2777.46s)]
*  And then back and forth over thousands and thousands of years. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2783.46s)]
*  We just look at things through this tiny little window of history. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2787.46s)]
*  What we wrote down. What do we know? [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2791.46s)]
*  What do we know? What do we know? [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2794.46s)]
*  It's hot this time of year. It's had Doris in 1822. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2796.46s)]
*  We don't have satellite Doppler radar from 1822. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2799.46s)]
*  So we have this window of a couple of hundred years of people paying attention and writing shit down. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2804.46s)]
*  But then when they do core samples of the Earth and they find the Earth's temperature, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2809.46s)]
*  they try to do the calculations over thousands of years. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2813.46s)]
*  It's always shifting. It's always going crazy. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2817.46s)]
*  This whole fucking world used to be connected in one island. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2822.46s)]
*  Pangea. It was one big thing, they think. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2827.46s)]
*  And it just separated slowly in his land. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2831.46s)]
*  This is chaos. It's always changing. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2833.46s)]
*  It has nothing to do with electric cars. It's always changing. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2836.46s)]
*  And if you buy one of those fucking houses on stilts, [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2840.46s)]
*  and you're in Santa Monica or Malibu, good luck, bitch. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2844.46s)]
*  What a risk you're taking. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2848.46s)]
*  That shit's going to move. It's going to move in a mile, ten miles. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2850.46s)]
*  There's a lot of cities like Miami, they're already saying when there's a full moon and a high tide, [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2854.46s)]
*  the fucking downtown is underwater. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2858.46s)]
*  That's a big city. This is now. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2861.46s)]
*  Dude, it's so crazy. The ground in Miami, around that area, is porous. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2868.46s)]
*  When the water goes up, it's going to go through the ground. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2873.46s)]
*  It's not like something's going to stop it. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2876.46s)]
*  No, no, no, it's just going to go right through the ground. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2878.46s)]
*  That's a swamp. You guys have a giant, awesome city on a swamp. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2881.46s)]
*  And they were told years ago, they looked at it and they were like, [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2885.46s)]
*  people shouldn't live here. And they were like, no, no, this is great. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2888.46s)]
*  This is great. And they sold land to everybody. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2891.46s)]
*  The crazy thing is they're still selling land. So what do they know? [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2895.46s)]
*  The bankers aren't stupid. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2898.46s)]
*  They would consult with people to try to figure out if someone's going to default on their loans, [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2900.46s)]
*  if they're going to sell them property right there on the beach. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2904.46s)]
*  Because if the insurance companies get involved, like whoa, whoa, whoa, [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2907.46s)]
*  how much is this house? 50 million. Jesus Christ. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2910.46s)]
*  How many feet is it from the water? 10 feet. 10 feet from the water. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2914.46s)]
*  So you're willing to bet $50 million that that water doesn't move any closer than 10 feet? [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2918.46s)]
*  Maybe go 20 feet. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2929.46s)]
*  You know how close 10 feet is, bitch? 10 feet is this desk. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2931.46s)]
*  This is the water. And Jamie is your fucking house. This is the ocean. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2935.46s)]
*  Dude, what about the people that are in New Orleans that are rebuilding? [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2942.46s)]
*  Rebuilding for what? [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2946.46s)]
*  I think it's the vibe. New Orleans is another country. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2948.46s)]
*  I mean, it really feels like those people get to drink on the street. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2951.46s)]
*  They have that cool way of talking. They got great food. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2955.46s)]
*  I'm going there next Friday. It's dangerous there. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2959.46s)]
*  It's my second time ever being there. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2961.46s)]
*  Dangerous crime-wise. They're not doing so good with the crime. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2963.46s)]
*  But as far as the vibe of the city, man, I know people that just, they swear by it. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2966.46s)]
*  But what's nice is when I think about how many times me and my jackass friends have gone to Vegas, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2971.46s)]
*  and you always come home feeling like, had, you just feel that emptiness of leaving a strip club, [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2977.46s)]
*  of like, what did I just do? [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2984.46s)]
*  And then you think you could spend that same money and go to a place like New Orleans or Nashville, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2986.46s)]
*  where there's like a real culture, where there's like real shit that's, you know. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2991.46s)]
*  Well, that's why people like to visit Austin and go see the live music. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2996.46s)]
*  There's so much live music here. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=2998.46s)]
*  Yeah, we went out the other night. It was fun. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3000.46s)]
*  God damn, there's so many musicians here. There's so many talented people. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3002.46s)]
*  It's a crazy town in that regard. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3005.46s)]
*  But to have a thing that you could do like that is, yeah, that's fun. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3008.46s)]
*  Go have a few drinks. Go to a real thing. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3011.46s)]
*  The problem with Vegas is it's like everyone's like, it's Vegas! [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3013.46s)]
*  So it's like you're at a 24-7 New Year's Eve show. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3017.46s)]
*  You know those New Year's Eve shows? I don't like them. I don't do them anymore. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3021.46s)]
*  I stopped doing them. I did one a couple years back, and they were great. People were great. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3025.46s)]
*  But there's a thing where it's like, it's New Year's! [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3029.46s)]
*  It's not just a show. It's like this thing on top of the show. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3034.46s)]
*  It's bigger than the show, yeah. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3037.46s)]
*  Everybody wants to scream and yell. How much is it affecting your life, [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3038.46s)]
*  this weird capturing of time in calendars and watches and cell phones? [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3042.46s)]
*  How weird is that? Because it's just, time is this right there. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3048.46s)]
*  Right now, that's it. That's time. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3054.46s)]
*  All that other shit, like this year is this year, and I've done that for six months. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3057.46s)]
*  That's all in your head. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3062.46s)]
*  It's my birthday! [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3063.46s)]
*  Yeah, oh my God. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3064.46s)]
*  Who gives a fuck? [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3065.46s)]
*  The worst. Bitch, you had one birthday. It was 32 years ago. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3066.46s)]
*  Let it go. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3069.46s)]
*  Why are you interrupting my dinner with your cake? I'm not singing. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3070.46s)]
*  Leave everyone alone. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3074.46s)]
*  You think these fucking three busboys want to be singing right now? [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3075.46s)]
*  There's tables that need to be cleaned up. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3077.46s)]
*  Bro, that's a game changer for me. If there's a buddy and he gets mad that I didn't wish him a happy birthday, [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3079.46s)]
*  we're not talking to him. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3083.46s)]
*  You need to go to a doctor. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3084.46s)]
*  Whatever's really bothering you. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3086.46s)]
*  Aren't we men? I mean, aren't we men? [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3089.46s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about? [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3093.46s)]
*  How underappreciated do you feel that you need us all to say happy birthday to you? [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3095.46s)]
*  And you're 47? That's not even a think. That's not even a round number. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3099.46s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here with your birthday. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3104.46s)]
*  I have not gone out for my birthday. I mean, I'll go out with my wife maybe, [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3106.46s)]
*  but I would not ask my friends to get together and buy me a present. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3111.46s)]
*  I would not ask my friends to do anything. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3116.46s)]
*  I think your friends are supposed to just be your friends. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3118.46s)]
*  If I need some help with something, I'll ask my friends for something. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3121.46s)]
*  I don't need a fucking friend to give me a happy birthday party. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3125.46s)]
*  Hey, bro, I just think it would be really cool if you threw me a birthday party this year. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3129.46s)]
*  I mean, you're my best friend and no one's ever thrown me a birthday party. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3134.46s)]
*  I figure if I was going to come to anybody, I'd come to you. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3137.46s)]
*  I'd just really like it to be at Wild Wings. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3140.46s)]
*  And it could be 80s theme. It would be really cool if it was 80s theme. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3144.46s)]
*  It would be nice. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3147.46s)]
*  And everybody dressed like that. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3148.46s)]
*  Yeah, we all dress like old video games. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3149.46s)]
*  Fuck out of here. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3151.46s)]
*  And I got registered at William Sonoma. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3153.46s)]
*  Oh, the registered. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3157.46s)]
*  Go to a doctor. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3159.46s)]
*  Women talk so much shit about when women register. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3160.46s)]
*  Oh, look what this bitch registered. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3164.46s)]
*  Look what she's trying to get. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3166.46s)]
*  It's like you're airing your needs. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3167.46s)]
*  Look what you need. A douche? [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3169.46s)]
*  You register for a douche? [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3171.46s)]
*  You're hoping somebody goes off. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3173.46s)]
*  You're hoping someone goes off, so you include some high items, high value items, just in case. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3175.46s)]
*  Just in case there's some well-heeled individuals coming to my big shindang. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3180.46s)]
*  And then it shames everybody else because they see the big ticket item and then they buy you some utensils. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3184.46s)]
*  Do you see that Mackenzie Bezos got divorced again? [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3190.46s)]
*  Is that Jeff Bezos' ex-wife? [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3194.46s)]
*  She got remarried and then she divorced? [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3196.46s)]
*  I had a bit about it that I had to bail on the bit because I felt mean and personal. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3198.46s)]
*  Not even mean. It's not mean. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3203.46s)]
*  The bit is that a woman worth $39 billion in the divorce settlement and then she immediately married a high school science teacher. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3205.46s)]
*  So the bit was about a woman worth $39 billion marrying a dude worth $3,200. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3213.46s)]
*  I was like, that guy doesn't have shit to say in that relationship. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3219.46s)]
*  I'm like, that guy doesn't get to pick any other color of the wall. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3223.46s)]
*  And I'm like, you know what I know because... [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3227.46s)]
*  That's a one-sided 69 position. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3228.46s)]
*  Yeah, because the way I know is because I don't get to pick anything in my house. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3230.46s)]
*  My wife doesn't even work. That guy's fucked. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3234.46s)]
*  He has zero chance if she's that rich. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3236.46s)]
*  I'm like, that guy's on his best behavior. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3240.46s)]
*  I go, he's got his pronouns in his Twitter bio. He's drinking white wine. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3242.46s)]
*  He's neutered. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3246.46s)]
*  He's planning her birthday party a year in advance. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3248.46s)]
*  I'm like, that guy's a performance artist. He's putting on a show. He knows how much money she has. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3251.46s)]
*  I'm like, how long can you be cool? Well, it turns out 24 months. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3255.46s)]
*  So he couldn't keep it together. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3259.46s)]
*  There's no way you could be yourself if your wife is worth $39 billion. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3263.46s)]
*  It's just too hard to be yourself. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3267.46s)]
*  Too hard. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3270.46s)]
*  Why is there a Lamborghini in the staff parking lot? [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3271.46s)]
*  I want one! You have $39 billion! [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3274.46s)]

*  Oh yeah, the Netherlands. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3406.46s)]
*  But that's what you do when you get that kind of cash. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3408.46s)]
*  There was an article in the New Yorker about these super yachts. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3410.46s)]
*  There was some guy that was like, it's the ultimate way of saying, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3415.46s)]
*  Oh, you got a house in the Hamptons, I got a house in the Hamptons. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3419.46s)]

*  You got a helicopter, you got a helicopter. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3423.46s)]
*  How big is your yacht? [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3425.46s)]
*  They're like, that's what it really comes down to these days. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3426.46s)]
*  Because the amount of money involved in yacht life, if you go on yacht life, the amount of money is insane. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3429.46s)]
*  These are people that are making like a hundred million dollars a year. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3436.46s)]
*  Like, it's that kind of money to run a yacht. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3439.46s)]
*  I have a buddy who's got a yacht. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3441.46s)]
*  And he's very wealthy. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3443.46s)]
*  And it's very strange. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3445.46s)]
*  How much time does he spend on it? [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3446.46s)]
*  A lot. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3448.46s)]
*  He loves it. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3449.46s)]
*  I mean, he's fortunate enough that he runs a bunch of successful things that he can do them remotely. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3451.46s)]
*  So he's more of like a manager at this point. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3457.46s)]
*  You know, he just like handles all these various entities that he runs. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3459.46s)]
*  But he's very successful. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3463.46s)]
*  Because that's the thing is in the old days, you could, if you were rich and you bought a yacht, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3466.46s)]
*  you couldn't go on it. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3470.46s)]
*  You needed to be running your business. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3471.46s)]
*  And now you can do that shit from Zoom. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3473.46s)]
*  What I was going to say is he's very successful, but he knows how to have fun. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3475.46s)]
*  And he knows like the value of relaxation and fun. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3478.46s)]
*  And he's set it up well, just because he's smart. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3482.46s)]
*  So he parties. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3486.46s)]
*  So he likes to get drunk. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3487.46s)]
*  So he just fucking has this giant house that floats on the ocean. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3488.46s)]
*  And he has a whole staff that works for him there. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3494.46s)]
*  It's a weird life, man. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3497.46s)]
*  But you're like, damn, I get used to this. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3498.46s)]
*  Have you been on it? [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3500.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3501.46s)]
*  Yeah, I hung out with them. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3502.46s)]
*  Family, our families are friends, too. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3503.46s)]
*  So we all hung out together. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3505.46s)]
*  So it was just like being on there like, man, this is a wild life. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3506.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3509.46s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3511.46s)]
*  But things like where do you go from there? [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3512.46s)]
*  And I think that's the thing about money people, people that are just interested in money. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3513.46s)]
*  It's like you constantly want the new, bigger, crazier thing. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3517.46s)]

*  Like if you have a plan to start a business, what's the what's the plan plan is I'm going to do this and that and that. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3663.46s)]
*  And I'm going to make a bunch of money. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3668.46s)]
*  I have a plan to marry that lady because she's worth thirty nine billion dollars. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3669.46s)]
*  Like it's kind of a business. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3672.46s)]
*  Right. Being a gold digger is a business. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3675.46s)]
*  Yeah. It really is. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3678.46s)]
*  Yeah. There was this great podcast about this guy down in Orange County and he had just got out of prison. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3679.46s)]
*  He was homeless and he found this rich lady and he just came up with a plan and he tracked her and he started. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3684.46s)]
*  I forgot how he met her, but he had moved in within three days. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3691.46s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3696.46s)]
*  He just said that he lived in the desert and like the head of house, the big mansion in the desert and he bought and he had scrubs. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3697.46s)]
*  And so he wore scrubs and said he was a doctor, but he wasn't a doctor. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3704.46s)]
*  He just put scrubs and he'd leave every day and pretend he was going to the hospital. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3707.46s)]
*  And he ended up he ended up killing our way. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3712.46s)]
*  Did he kill her? [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3716.46s)]
*  I think he killed her. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3717.46s)]
*  And then there's a crazy final scene where the daughter knows about him and they're in a fucking empty parking garage and he tries to kill her and she fucking kills him. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3718.46s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3731.46s)]
*  Or she at least stabs him where he's incapacitated. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3732.46s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3734.46s)]
*  And gets away. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3735.46s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3736.46s)]
*  And he had done it serially. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3738.46s)]
*  He had done it with a number of women. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3740.46s)]
*  There was a show once where they were following this guy who got scammed by these those guys pretending to be women online and engaging in like relationships with men where they'll send them correspondence and photos and you know and talk to them. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3741.46s)]
*  Can't wait to meet you. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3759.46s)]
*  No. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3760.46s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3761.46s)]
*  Men pretending to be women? [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3762.46s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3764.46s)]
*  Listen to me. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3765.46s)]
*  They're scammers. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3766.46s)]
*  And so they contact lonely men and they pretend to be a woman like Nigerian scammers. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3767.46s)]
*  And they send photos. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3772.46s)]
*  You know they just steal a bunch of girls' photos from Facebook. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3774.46s)]
*  So this poor guy went to Europe. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3776.46s)]
*  He was a divorced man and I think he was a widower. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3778.46s)]
*  He was like in his 60s and he went to Europe twice to meet with this woman and every time she had an excuse why she couldn't meet him. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3782.46s)]
*  And he went back again. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3790.46s)]
*  And the girl's daughter was just so despondent because he's all of his money. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3791.46s)]
*  He didn't have much but all his money he's sending to her. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3797.46s)]
*  He's sending her $20,000. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3799.46s)]
*  She has to get out of this and that. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3801.46s)]
*  And some people are coming after her. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3803.46s)]
*  She's really in trouble and she owes money. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3804.46s)]
*  Could you please help? [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3806.46s)]
*  And he's helping her. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3807.46s)]
*  We're going to get together my darling. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3808.46s)]
*  We're going to be together forever. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3809.46s)]
*  And then he would go there and she couldn't make it. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3811.46s)]
*  Couldn't go. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3813.46s)]
*  My mother got sick. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3814.46s)]
*  Like just like this poor fucking guy believed. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3815.46s)]
*  Damn. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3818.46s)]
*  And it wasn't even a good scam. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3819.46s)]
*  It wasn't even like physical contact. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3820.46s)]
*  Right? [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3822.46s)]
*  But a physical contact scam where someone could pretend they love you and you're lonely. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3823.46s)]
*  And like finally my prayers have been answered. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3827.46s)]
*  This person who's so amazing. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3829.46s)]
*  And then everyone's like listen I think Mark might be full of shit. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3831.46s)]
*  Fuck you. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3834.46s)]
*  Mark's amazing. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3835.46s)]
*  All they think about is how good they feel now that Mark's in their life. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3837.46s)]
*  And Mark gives them back rubs. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3840.46s)]
*  Loneliness is a painful thing. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3842.46s)]
*  I mean I can't. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3844.46s)]
*  I mean of all the human emotions to feel like loneliness is at the top of things you don't [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3845.46s)]
*  want to sit with. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3851.46s)]
*  And if somebody can come in and they can alleviate that and they can make you feel loved and [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3852.46s)]
*  cared about in a world that's full of rejection whether it's work or friends or your kids [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3857.46s)]
*  may be fucking left. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3862.46s)]
*  Like this woman she was actually really successful so it was hard to figure out why she had such [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3863.46s)]
*  a gaping hole in her that she would look to this guy for affection. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3869.46s)]
*  But it was like it's romantic affection. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3873.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3875.46s)]
*  It doesn't matter how successful you are. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3876.46s)]
*  See that's all nonsense because once you're successful enough we don't have to worry about [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3878.46s)]
*  food and money and housing. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3881.46s)]
*  Everything else is nonsense. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3883.46s)]
*  So the success doesn't help the loneliness. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3885.46s)]
*  A matter of fact it probably accentuates it because it's a thing that everybody always [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3887.46s)]
*  thinks is going to like make them happy. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3891.46s)]
*  Like the thing that people think is going to make them happy is success. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3893.46s)]
*  Like one day I'll be the boss and I'll be happy. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3896.46s)]
*  Like no you're going to be happy or you're not going to be happy. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3898.46s)]
*  You'll be happy or having achieved your goals but this is not going to make you happy. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3901.46s)]
*  And so if you're already a rich lady and you're just rotting with loneliness like you're a [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3905.46s)]
*  drug addict who like you never get cured. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3911.46s)]
*  You never get you never get free of the the pull of heroin. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3914.46s)]
*  You need it. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3917.46s)]
*  We all need it. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3918.46s)]
*  It's the worst thing they could do to you in jail. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3919.46s)]
*  That you're in a fucking metal and cement box filled with rapists and murderers. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3921.46s)]
*  The worst thing they could do is leave you alone. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3926.46s)]
*  Like we're connected to each other. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3929.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3931.46s)]
*  And if you don't get that love from people. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3932.46s)]
*  I remember when I moved to L.A. in 94. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3934.46s)]
*  I came out here to do this television show and we were out here for like two weeks and I was staying in the [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3937.46s)]
*  Oakwood Gardens Apartments and I didn't have any friends. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3943.46s)]
*  So I'd go to the comedy store at night and I would hang out there and I tried to do a set and I was what's [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3946.46s)]
*  called a non-paid regular which means I could go up after the show because Mitzi wasn't sure about me yet. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3951.46s)]
*  And so I was doing that and I had no real interaction with anybody. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3958.46s)]
*  And then this girl that I was working with. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3963.46s)]
*  One of the other actresses on the set. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3965.46s)]
*  She gave me a hug. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3967.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3968.46s)]
*  And it was the best hug anybody ever gave me in my life. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3969.46s)]
*  It was totally just loving non-sexual non-flirty. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3972.46s)]
*  Just a just a you're my friend. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3976.46s)]
*  Here's a hug. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3979.46s)]
*  And I was like oh yeah. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3980.46s)]
*  I was like oh my God. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3981.46s)]
*  I'll never forget that feeling because I was like oh my God I needed that dude. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3983.46s)]
*  I got one of those out here the other day. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3986.46s)]
*  What's I'm spacing the woman's name who used to work at the store. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3988.46s)]
*  Give hugs like that. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=3991.46s)]

*  I know. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4000.46s)]
*  When I hug you it's like it's a warm hug. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4001.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4002.46s)]
*  And there's no there's no back padding. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4003.46s)]
*  No it's no bullshit. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4004.46s)]
*  No. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4005.46s)]

*  So his stuff is all like... [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4440.360000000001s)]
*  Some of it's hilarious. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4442.280000000001s)]
*  Some of it's really disturbing. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4443.400000000001s)]
*  Santa came early. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4445.2s)]
*  That must be fun for a guy like that. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4446.2s)]
*  That's his life. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4452.4800000000005s)]
*  He found something he's good at that he loves. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4453.4800000000005s)]
*  And he found a way to wake up every morning and go, let's fucking imagine. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4457.16s)]
*  Let's play. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4463.44s)]
*  Let's do this. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4464.44s)]
*  And he was so consistent in how he did it that he got to... [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4465.8s)]
*  Whoa, are they all changing? [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4470.6s)]
*  Are you doing that? [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4472.44s)]
*  I'm changing it. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4473.44s)]
*  I'm going through them. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4474.44s)]
*  You got a little ADD, don't you, fella? [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4475.44s)]
*  Some of these are good. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4476.44s)]
*  I'm looking at it. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4477.44s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4478.44s)]
*  But the point being is he was just so consistent and so disciplined that he just consistently [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4479.44s)]
*  put them out. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4486.8s)]
*  And now he's making hundreds of millions of dollars doing this. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4487.8s)]
*  Damn, no shit, really. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4492.08s)]
*  The art in the galleries. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4494.12s)]
*  He's like an R. Crumb kind of a guy. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4495.84s)]
*  He's like the... [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4497.8s)]
*  In terms of NFTs and sales of digital art, he's like the number one guy, isn't he? [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4499.4400000000005s)]
*  No shit. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4507.28s)]
*  Or he's one of them. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4508.28s)]
*  2.4 million followers. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4509.28s)]
*  It definitely was. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4510.28s)]
*  It's changing often now because people are doing different stuff. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4511.28s)]
*  Yeah, 2.4 million followers. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4513.28s)]
*  Plus, when you make an NFT, every time it gets resold, he makes more money off of that. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4514.28s)]
*  Click on that chimp one. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4520.2s)]
*  But it's also like you're actually getting real digital art from this guy. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4521.76s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4528.52s)]
*  So what's the difference between if I buy the NFT that shows me that or me just going [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4529.8s)]
*  to his Instagram account and looking at it? [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4534.12s)]
*  Because you get something like that. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4535.92s)]
*  You get a piece, like a digital piece of art too. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4537.68s)]
*  And that's where it gets squirrely with like when they have non-fungible token. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4541.400000000001s)]
*  You own the rights to that thing. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4546.16s)]
*  Even though some of them like Board Yacht Club, Board Ape Yacht Club or something like [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4549.12s)]
*  that, I don't understand because it's just a photograph and you own it, I guess. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4552.6s)]
*  But I can take a screenshot of it and it'll be on my phone. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4556.68s)]
*  But I guess it's not as cool as you owning it on your phone. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4559.2s)]
*  Okay. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4562.56s)]
*  I don't totally get that. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4563.84s)]
*  But I get this. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4565.76s)]
*  I get the digital artwork and I get like that's an original beeple and he sends you these [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4566.76s)]
*  things and go with it. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4572.52s)]
*  There's more to it. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4574.56s)]
*  His gallery that he's doing, he has like these big displays and big things and I'm [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4575.56s)]
*  sure you could buy those too. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4581.240000000001s)]
*  It's like you're buying a real thing. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4583.200000000001s)]
*  Like if you bought one of his art displays and it's like that but it's like seven feet [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4585.4800000000005s)]
*  tall and like you could put it in your living room and people would come over and go, whoa. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4590.080000000001s)]
*  That's a real valuable cool thing, a piece of art. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4594.56s)]
*  Dude, you know who's a great artist is Kevin Nealon. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4598.120000000001s)]

*  I've been on a couple roasts in my life. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4778.08s)]
*  If you ever want to find out who you really are, if you want to know what people really [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4781.08s)]
*  think of you, because we all kind of, it's not what's on the internet. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4784.8s)]
*  When you go on the internet, it's a bunch of trolls that are just saying mean shit. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4789.360000000001s)]
*  But when you do a roast, it has to make people laugh, which means it has to be grounded in [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4793.6s)]
*  a collective perception of who you really are. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4798.72s)]
*  When you hear people make jokes about you on a roast, that's how you know who you really [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4802.4s)]
*  are. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4806.04s)]
*  What I get is like, he looks old. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4807.04s)]
*  That fucking hurts. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4810.04s)]
*  That was the purpose of the Hayoka in the Lakota tribes. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4813.879999999999s)]
*  Oh, you were telling me about that. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4817.44s)]
*  That's wild. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4819.36s)]
*  It's a sacred clown. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4820.36s)]
*  They had someone who would mock everything. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4821.36s)]
*  Because if there was something that could be mocked, if it made people laugh, then you [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4823.92s)]
*  knew that it was true, or that it was bullshit, or that the thing was, it was easily mocked. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4827.5199999999995s)]
*  It was a stupid thing. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4832.28s)]
*  They used that to sort of test whether or not their thoughts were being corrupted, and [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4834.48s)]
*  whether or not they were being delusional, and looking at things incorrectly. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4842.2s)]
*  Like the court jester. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4847.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4848.08s)]
*  I think the court jester was supposed to keep the king honest. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4849.08s)]
*  Was he really? [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4851.04s)]
*  I think that was part of his function, was to show that the king could be in on the joke. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4852.04s)]
*  How many of those guys got their dicks cut off and stuffed in their mouth? [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4856.28s)]
*  You want to talk about the history of stand-up comedy. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4860.280000000001s)]
*  That was the first comedian. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4863.200000000001s)]
*  The court jester. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4865.12s)]
*  And he had skin in the game. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4866.64s)]
*  Nowadays, anybody can show up to an open mic night. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4868.240000000001s)]
*  You work in marketing for FedEx during the day, but you come out at night, you put on [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4871.04s)]
*  a funny tie, and you get up and do five minutes. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4874.8s)]
*  If you bomb, whatever, it hurts a little bit. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4876.96s)]
*  But if you're the court jester and you bomb, off with his head! [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4879.96s)]
*  They'll just kill you for fun. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4883.68s)]
*  That's one of the things that we love about watching Game of Thrones, or any of those [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4885.4800000000005s)]
*  I know they're fantasy, but they're supposed to be depicting a time in which there was [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4889.64s)]
*  no electronics and no civilization was crazy. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4893.4800000000005s)]
*  People just killed people. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4897.68s)]
*  They just decided I'm going to kill them and no one could do a damn thing about it. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4898.68s)]
*  They'll just beat you to death in front of everybody in the middle of a dining hall and [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4902.04s)]
*  no one stops it. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4906.280000000001s)]
*  And you realize, well, this is what people did to each other back then. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4907.280000000001s)]
*  And if someone just decides that you've dishonored the queen with your jester ways, they're just [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4910.12s)]
*  going to chop your dick off in front of everybody. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4915.52s)]
*  And you stuff it in your mouth where you scream and bleed out on the stairs to the throne. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4918.12s)]
*  And they barely pay attention because they see it every day. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4923.72s)]
*  They're not even aghast by your death. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4927.28s)]
*  Dude, the whole Dracula, the whole myth of Dracula, the Dracula story, the Bram Stoker [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4929.08s)]

*  Let's go to his... [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4980.42s)]
*  That was his third reign. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=4981.42s)]

*  23? [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5009.5599999999995s)]
*  1428 to 1431. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5010.5599999999995s)]
*  Somewhere around then he was born. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5013.219999999999s)]
*  He died somewhere around 1476. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5014.219999999999s)]
*  So he's like 45 to 49 years old when he died. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5017.5599999999995s)]
*  They're not sure. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5019.7s)]
*  But during that time, he was fucking terrifying. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5020.799999999999s)]
*  There's so many crazy ways through history that people have mutilated and killed people. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5025.42s)]
*  You ever heard of a Colombian necktie? [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5030.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5033.14s)]
*  You know what that is? [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5034.14s)]
*  Yeah, they slice your throat and pull your tongue through your neck. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5035.14s)]
*  It's rough. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5038.14s)]
*  That's fucking rough. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5040.9800000000005s)]
*  That's rough. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5042.240000000001s)]
*  That's rough. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5043.240000000001s)]
*  And then there's this one called the Glasgow Smile or something where they take a knife [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5044.240000000001s)]
*  and they cut your cheeks from the corners of your mouth up so for the rest of your life [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5049.14s)]
*  you look like you're smiling. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5053.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5055.1s)]
*  There's some evil fucks out there. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5056.1s)]
*  If you find out what the Comanches did, there's this book Empire of the Summer Moon. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5058.82s)]
*  Oh yeah, I read that. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5063.54s)]
*  That guy lives in Austin, right? [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5064.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5066.54s)]
*  I had him on the podcast. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5067.54s)]
*  He's great. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5068.54s)]
*  It's an amazing book. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5069.54s)]
*  And he found all that stuff out when he moved here. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5071.02s)]
*  He moved here and then he started researching the history of the Native American tribes [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5075.14s)]
*  and the Plains tribes. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5078.54s)]
*  And then he writes this book about the Comanches. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5079.54s)]
*  It's a crazy story. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5081.78s)]
*  But one of the things they did is those people would fight to the death. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5084.54s)]
*  They never surrendered because if they surrendered they assumed they were going to be tortured [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5087.66s)]
*  because they torture everybody. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5091.0599999999995s)]
*  And they would take people and they would hack their arms and legs off and while they [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5092.98s)]
*  were alive throw them on a fire to watch them squirm. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5097.82s)]
*  The last moments of your life, no arms. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5102.4s)]
*  They would just hold you down and they'd just immediately hack off your arms, hack off your [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5103.94s)]
*  legs and just chuck you on the fire. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5107.82s)]
*  And then they just kept doing it to more people, throwing them on the fire. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5110.22s)]
*  Damn. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5113.5s)]
*  And there was a lot of rape. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5114.5s)]
*  There was a lot of like, you're going to get raped and your family's going to watch. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5116.46s)]
*  And you're going to get murdered and your family's going to watch. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5120.26s)]
*  And everybody got murdered except for the younger kids that they would try to incorporate [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5123.42s)]
*  into the tribe. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5129.02s)]
*  And they would test them in various ways. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5131.14s)]
*  And if they failed the test they would kill them. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5133.42s)]
*  And if they just kept their shit together they could eventually become a part of the [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5135.860000000001s)]
*  tribe. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5138.900000000001s)]
*  The curious thing is a lot of those people got captured later and released. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5140.58s)]
*  So the soldiers would overcome a band of Indians and find captured white settlers and they [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5145.46s)]
*  didn't want to leave. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5154.0599999999995s)]
*  They wanted to stay with the Native Americans. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5156.0599999999995s)]
*  That's the Cynthia Ann Parker story. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5157.94s)]
*  She's the woman who was, yeah, she gave birth to Quana Parker who was the last Comanche [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5160.219999999999s)]
*  chief. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5164.78s)]
*  And he was half white. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5166.299999999999s)]
*  She was white. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5167.42s)]
*  She was a black settler who was kidnapped when she was nine. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5168.9400000000005s)]
*  She watched her mother get killed, watched her father get killed. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5169.9400000000005s)]
*  Didn't they take her away to like Pennsylvania and then she escaped and went back? [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5172.58s)]
*  Yeah, she went back. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5175.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5176.62s)]
*  Yeah, she was despondent. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5177.62s)]
*  Like when they brought her back to regular society she was despondent. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5178.62s)]
*  She did not want to live like that at all. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5182.9400000000005s)]
*  She was in her 30s by then. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5184.74s)]
*  She had just been living with the Comanche. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5186.38s)]
*  She was a part of their culture. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5188.26s)]
*  I mean it just, you know, it's like a romanticizing it in a lot of our eyes because everybody, [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5189.78s)]
*  you know, like romanticizes the idea of being a Plains Indian. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5196.18s)]
*  Wow, must have been incredible sleeping under the stars. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5198.9800000000005s)]
*  But the people that they did capture and release back in society, they didn't want that. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5201.740000000001s)]
*  Like nobody was going the other way. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5209.740000000001s)]
*  There was no Plains Indians that were like, look, fuck all this. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5211.58s)]
*  I want to join you guys. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5214.38s)]
*  I want to be a banker. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5215.38s)]
*  Like that wasn't happening. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5216.38s)]
*  But people were leaving and they were like living with the Indians and they didn't want [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5217.860000000001s)]
*  to go back. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5222.46s)]
*  And it wasn't a small number. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5223.900000000001s)]
*  There was like some miners that struck deals with them and various people that had made [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5225.5s)]
*  their way across the Plains decided to join. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5229.900000000001s)]
*  And you know, if you got a good band of Indians, didn't want to kill you because you're a white [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5233.26s)]
*  settler if you're in the right place at the right time and you joined in like for them [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5237.9400000000005s)]
*  it was like a better way of life. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5242.02s)]
*  No, and you know, trying to paint the Indians as good or bad, it's not that's not how it [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5243.780000000001s)]
*  is. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5249.14s)]
*  It's complicated. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5250.14s)]
*  It's a culture. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5251.14s)]
*  Kind of just where racism comes in, where everybody has to be seen as good or bad. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5252.3s)]
*  Well they warred on each other hardcore in horrific, horrific ways. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5256.34s)]
*  They cannibalized each other. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5261.46s)]
*  You know, the Nez Perce were famous for cannibalizing the victims that they captured. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5263.46s)]
*  People did horrible things in all ethnicities, in all parts of the world. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5270.3s)]
*  When the barbaric times of human history, people have done absolutely terrible things [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5275.860000000001s)]
*  to each other, to people that look like them, to people that look nothing like them. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5281.34s)]
*  It's just like a part of being a human being or has been a part of being a human being. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5285.66s)]
*  I think like less now because we're more recognizing the horrific nature that we get to discuss [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5291.18s)]
*  it because everybody kind of gets to talk now because of the internet, because of education [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5296.78s)]
*  and like it's way harder to pull off like a Christopher Columbus type atrocity in in [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5301.74s)]
*  2022 and selling it to the public like what they did. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5307.62s)]
*  You would get documentation, cell phone video footage like hey why did you cut their arms [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5311.700000000001s)]
*  off if they didn't give you gold because that's what Christopher Columbus did. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5316.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5320.3s)]
*  But what those people did, like you read the priest's accounts of how they tortured the [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5321.3s)]
*  natives when they got here and what they did like bashed babies' heads on rocks and told [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5327.620000000001s)]
*  people if they don't bring them their weight in gold they would cut their arms off, cut [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5333.18s)]
*  their arms off and show the other people that they're willing to do it and then send them [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5336.46s)]
*  out get more gold like. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5339.54s)]
*  That was just how people behaved. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5342.86s)]
*  Which is hard for us to think about. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5346.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5349.94s)]
*  Because of the world we currently live in. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5350.94s)]
*  But if the power went out and shit went sideways for just six months, just six months. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5353.14s)]
*  Do you know how crazy the world would be? [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5360.74s)]
*  How crazy was the world during like the BLM riots during Covid where people were walking [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5363.02s)]
*  down the street throwing rocks into people's windows and smashing doors open and doing [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5367.66s)]
*  whatever the fuck they wanted to do for no, there's no social justice to that. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5371.7s)]
*  They were just, they were wilding. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5375.58s)]
*  So like you've seen those videos where people just went hey what? [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5377.74s)]
*  That's what happens. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5381.62s)]
*  That's what happens when you get mob mentalities together. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5383.0599999999995s)]
*  You're going to get certain people that don't give a fuck about a social cause or whatever. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5386.26s)]
*  They just want to go wilding and they're going to jump in and come up with reasons why they [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5390.099999999999s)]
*  can light buildings on fire. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5394.78s)]
*  If there's no power for six months, they run the streets. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5396.9s)]
*  They run the streets. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5401.98s)]
*  There's no way to call the cops because there's no power. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5402.86s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5405.02s)]
*  How many bullets you got? [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5406.1s)]
*  What the fuck man. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5407.94s)]
*  Like that's how thin the veneer of civilization is over the world. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5409.62s)]
*  For most of history they behaved the way those clans and the plains Indians did and the way [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5414.9s)]
*  Columbus did and the way the Mongols did and the way the Romans did. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5420.98s)]
*  For most of history people were cunts. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5425.94s)]
*  Just horrible murdering cunts. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5429.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And you think about this country like kids that were born you know just after us [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5431.379999999999s)]
*  that didn't experience the Vietnam War at all like have not seen barbarism in this country. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5436.86s)]
*  Sure. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5441.58s)]

*  For the most part they've been guarded from that. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5445.46s)]
*  And I mean obviously school shootings and you know the amount of homicides take place is [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5447.86s)]
*  something but that's that can't compare to the kind of barbarism that you're talking about. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5452.86s)]
*  Yeah the school shootings it's like the reason why they're so horrific is because they're an [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5457.139999999999s)]
*  aberration. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5461.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5462.179999999999s)]

*  The thing that no one wants to talk about with those is how many of them are on psychiatric [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5469.94s)]
*  medications because it's almost all of them. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5473.0199999999995s)]
*  Or they've gone off psychiatric medications. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5476.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5478.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5478.9800000000005s)]
*  And then the question is like is it correlation or causation. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5479.26s)]
*  Are they already broken. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5481.86s)]
*  Is the psychiatric medication what kept them from doing it earlier. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5482.94s)]
*  Yeah I don't know. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5486.14s)]
*  But the the horrific things that people have done throughout history are are it's so fascinating [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5486.9800000000005s)]
*  how recent that was because it really was only like a few lives ago. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5495.78s)]
*  Like if you want to go to the plains of Texas and the plains of North America in 1700 you are in a [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5500.34s)]

*  Nothing settled. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5515.219999999999s)]
*  It's wild. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5516.5s)]
*  If you're living back then and then someone can put you in a time machine just three hundred and [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=5518.0599999999995s)]

*  I was watching a video of these guys that robbed some kid. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6351.42s)]
*  Twenty one year old kid in New York just walked up to him and just blasted him in the face and knocked him unconscious and the kid falls onto the curb. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6354.5s)]
*  And hits his head and he was dead in five days. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6361.94s)]
*  And you know they're trying to find the kids who did it. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6365.58s)]
*  I don't know if they found him but it's like imagine they got twenty dollars from them. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6367.26s)]
*  They stole 20 bucks. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6370.98s)]
*  Just knocking some out and not understanding like you might as well just be shooting them because you could very easily kill someone this way very easily. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6373.66s)]
*  You're falling so far when you get knocked out and you're standing up you're falling so far and you're hitting your head like if you just fall two feet. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6382.58s)]
*  Dead weight and hit your head. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6391.1s)]
*  You could get fucked up. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6392.82s)]
*  Think of something hitting you as hard as the earth. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6395.0199999999995s)]
*  Hitting your head from two feet away. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6398.1s)]
*  Oh my God it would be devastating. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6399.94s)]
*  Now imagine that happening from five six feet. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6401.5s)]
*  It's like and you're getting chaos so there's momentum you're falling backwards. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6404.0199999999995s)]
*  It's not just as simple as just gravity there's actual momentum too. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6408.42s)]
*  So maybe it's double the power. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6411.98s)]
*  And it's also a lot of people talking about like neck punches now throw punches instead of punching someone in the face and they think. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6413.62s)]
*  Well yeah but who are you talking to is talking to a lot of people are talking about neck punches. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6420.42s)]

*  That's just as dangerous because you could you could break the windpipe. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6432.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6438.62s)]
*  I think you're probably OK. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6440.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6441.54s)]
*  I don't think that's as dangerous that you can get knocked out by getting hit in the neck for sure. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6442.74s)]
*  You definitely can get your neck hurt. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6447.82s)]
*  But I wonder if you get knocked out as easily. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6450.78s)]
*  The chin is where it's really dangerous. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6452.86s)]
*  You get hit in the chin. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6454.66s)]
*  A lot of times people just shut off. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6456.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6457.62s)]
*  Or you get hit in the temple. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6458.0199999999995s)]
*  A lot of times people get shut off. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6459.099999999999s)]
*  And when you get shut off and you fall back that's the most dangerous. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6461.099999999999s)]
*  You definitely. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6465.9s)]
*  I mean it's not good to get punched in the neck but it's not like a smart strategy or boxers just be punching each other in the neck. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6466.46s)]
*  You know they kind of a little bit do that but it's just really like accidentally. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6472.38s)]
*  They're trying to hit the chin. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6476.9s)]
*  Kicks though. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6479.379999999999s)]
*  Some of the best head kick knockouts guys will land a kick on the neck and they're like right here like right here and behind the ear and your head. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6480.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6489.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6489.94s)]
*  Because if you think of someone throwing their shin up at you and where your shin is going to contact with the side of your neck that shuts people right off. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6490.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6498.299999999999s)]
*  That's how Kamaru Usman got knocked out by Leon Edwards. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6498.66s)]
*  Same kind of I think that one actually might have hit his head but it was like the head like right where the neck meets the head. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6503.06s)]
*  Getting hit in the head is fucking horrible. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6512.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6515.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6515.860000000001s)]
*  So back to that Brett Farb thing. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6518.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6520.06s)]
*  Wrong to you. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6520.780000000001s)]
*  That is up to do with it. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6522.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6523.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6524.780000000001s)]
*  In fact OJ Simpson's people said that if he was to go to trial today they would definitely bring up CTE in his defense. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6525.780000000001s)]
*  But then you'd have to admit he killed him. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6534.02s)]
*  Right. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6535.780000000001s)]
*  Because there's no reason why he has rage if he didn't really stab somebody. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6536.38s)]
*  Right. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6540.06s)]
*  Like what what are you saying. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6541.06s)]
*  I heard there was cocaine involved also. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6542.18s)]
*  Oh really. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6544.22s)]
*  I heard that there was evidence that was that was not allowed about a cocaine dealer who had who had sold him a pretty good quantity of cocaine just before the killing. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6544.860000000001s)]
*  Allegedly I should have to say allegedly. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6555.3s)]
*  Why would they suppress that. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6557.620000000001s)]
*  Dude I went to play golf. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6559.26s)]
*  You remember Jackie Flynn. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6560.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6561.700000000001s)]
*  Great comic out of Boston. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6562.740000000001s)]
*  And we go up to this golf course Hanson Dam and it's the two of us and we show up and we show up as a twosome they pair you up with two other people to play. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6564.34s)]
*  So we sign in and the starter goes OK you two are going to play with these two guys over here and we look over and it's fucking OJ Simpson. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6574.3s)]
*  And another dude and I look up. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6582.26s)]
*  What year was this. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6583.660000000001s)]
*  Who's after the murders before he went to jail. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6585.46s)]
*  So we were I just look at the skies like this after the murders before he went to jail. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6588.26s)]
*  So before the trial. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6594.34s)]
*  No after the trial but before he went to jail for stealing. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6596.14s)]
*  Oh right. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6599.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6600.14s)]
*  So but he wasn't allowed at country clubs anymore. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6601.02s)]
*  You know he used to play at Bel Air and you know Riviera all the best country clubs and now he's playing the same shitty public corps as I am. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6603.740000000001s)]
*  And so I just look at the skies like this is the greatest thing that's ever happened to me. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6611.22s)]
*  This is going to be my tonight show story someday you know. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6615.82s)]
*  And and Jackie looks at him and he goes I play with that fucking murderer. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6618.82s)]
*  Fuck that. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6623.62s)]
*  He's a murderer. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6624.74s)]
*  And OJ just turned and walked away and I just looked at Jackie like how could you do this to me man. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6626.02s)]
*  How could you steal the moment they were on like the 11th hole and I'm standing over a putt and I just look at him and I go OJ. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6631.82s)]
*  If I think this you got to tell me she did it. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6638.74s)]
*  Imagine we had a video of that. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6649.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6650.7s)]
*  Jackie fucked you. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6651.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6652.9400000000005s)]
*  I'll never forgive him. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6654.02s)]
*  Were you hesitant at all to play with him. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6655.7s)]
*  No. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6657.3s)]
*  No I was very excited. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6659.06s)]
*  I'd seen him at the driving range there before. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6659.900000000001s)]
*  Would you play with him. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6663.02s)]
*  I don't play golf. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6665.34s)]
*  I play pool with him. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6667.02s)]

*  You know I met people that kill people in war. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6682.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6684.42s)]
*  That's a different animal. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6684.900000000001s)]
*  That's different than chopping someone's heads off with a knife. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6685.9800000000005s)]
*  Dakota Meyer has one of the craziest stories about killing a guy with a rock. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6691.74s)]
*  Overseas. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6696.34s)]

*  Yeah the guy he lost his gun is in a hand to hand combat situation with the guy. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6697.86s)]
*  The guy's grabbing at his gear off of his vest. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6703.46s)]

*  I don't know this guy. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6717.82s)]

*  And he had to try to kill me too. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6722.179999999999s)]
*  And how insane that situation is. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6724.82s)]
*  Like you know you're from here and then all of a sudden you're there and you're in this guy's town or whatever and you're a part of a military. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6726.78s)]
*  Some sort of. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6738.5s)]
*  An action that they're doing that day and you find yourself in a hand to hand combat with some guy you don't know his language you don't know his history you don't know anything about him. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6741.62s)]
*  You just know it's you or him. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6750.34s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6755.98s)]
*  That's a lot different than getting coked up and stabbing a waiter and cutting your wife's head off. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6756.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6761.26s)]

*  Find the video of OJ rapping. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6838.54s)]
*  This is like after he was acquitted he was doing a bunch of different things and they did something some sort of rap music video. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6840.0599999999995s)]
*  It was part of a TV show thing he called juiced which was it's labeled as a TV special but I think it was one of those like too hot for TV DVDs they were trying to sell. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6847.26s)]
*  Oh the girls gone wild. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6857.78s)]

*  Do you remember the Jamie Kennedy experiment. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6862.62s)]
*  Of course. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6865.78s)]
*  Jamie Kennedy is like the most underrated prank show guy in history because people don't talk about him like when they talk about the greats. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6866.82s)]
*  He kind of happened. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6875.5s)]
*  There's juiced those hoes. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6876.14s)]

*  Well he had this thing called guys gone nuts and it was like the response to girls gone wild. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6881.06s)]
*  So this is like the whole series of this. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6889.1s)]
*  But at one point in time they're doing a music video. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6893.14s)]
*  I know we pulled it up before. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6895.66s)]
*  Yeah but the thing is I remember now that when I found it it was not on YouTube. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6896.74s)]
*  Oh so here it is right here. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6900.9800000000005s)]

*  We're going to ruin it. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6910.06s)]
*  For anyone. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6910.7s)]
*  But we're going to ruin it. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6911.22s)]
*  They're going to find it. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6911.9800000000005s)]
*  The YouTube people are going to find it. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6912.7s)]
*  So these gals danced around with the boobies out and there's a rap song somewhere in there. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6913.82s)]
*  Yeah that was not. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6926.0199999999995s)]
*  There it is. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6929.179999999999s)]

*  Yeah, with a bullet hole [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6988.62s)]
*  That was probably one of the skits, probably earlier on [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6990.62s)]
*  And him chasing somebody with a golf club [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6992.62s)]
*  I don't think that was him [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6994.62s)]
*  I think that was somebody else chasing somebody [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=6996.62s)]

*  Oh wow [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7014.62s)]
*  And they're running away from him [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7016.62s)]
*  It was a prank [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7018.62s)]
*  I thought you were talking about the other thing [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7020.62s)]
*  Wow [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7022.62s)]
*  Maybe he just did something which like he accused them of hitting his ball [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7024.62s)]
*  And they got mad [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7026.62s)]
*  Oh my god [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7028.62s)]
*  So it was a prank show [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7030.62s)]
*  From a guy that you knew was a murderer [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7032.62s)]
*  Along with a rap video [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7036.62s)]
*  With topless ladies [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7038.62s)]
*  What if he didn't do it? [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7042.62s)]
*  Imagine if Bigfoot's real [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7044.62s)]
*  Imagine if all those people were telling the truth [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7046.62s)]
*  Yeah [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7048.62s)]
*  What if you're O.J. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7052.62s)]
*  You're this guy that was in Naked Gun [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7054.62s)]
*  And you were in [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7056.62s)]
*  Hertz commercials running through the airport [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7058.62s)]
*  And you were a superstar athlete [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7060.62s)]
*  And you were a great dude [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7062.62s)]
*  To everybody that ever talked to him [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7064.62s)]
*  Great dude [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7066.62s)]
*  This was an aberration [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7068.62s)]
*  This killing made no sense [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7070.62s)]
*  And what if it didn't happen? [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7072.62s)]
*  What if there really was somebody else [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7074.62s)]
*  And this is all hanging on him? That would be crazy [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7076.62s)]
*  It was like a movie [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7078.62s)]
*  It's like a [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7080.62s)]
*  Knives out movie [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7082.62s)]
*  Like they've just set him up the entire time [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7084.62s)]
*  Like a really bad book [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7086.62s)]
*  Who would stand to gain from that? [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7088.62s)]
*  Yeah, some bad evil detective [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7090.62s)]
*  Yeah, well what was his name? [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7094.62s)]
*  Mark Furman [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7096.62s)]
*  Imagine [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7098.62s)]
*  He was a racist, that was O.J.'s defense [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7100.62s)]
*  Imagine if Mark Furman's just sitting there [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7102.62s)]
*  Ha ha ha ha [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7104.62s)]
*  I tricked them all [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7106.62s)]
*  No, I think he probably did it [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7108.62s)]
*  He wrote a book called If I Did It [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7110.62s)]
*  Somebody gave me a copy of that [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7112.62s)]
*  And my wife threw it out [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7114.62s)]
*  I was trying to find it the other day, she's sneaky like that [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7116.62s)]
*  I don't fucking want this [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7118.62s)]
*  Yeah [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7120.62s)]
*  He described in it what if [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7122.62s)]
*  And he described the murder from his point of view [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7124.62s)]
*  He signed it [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7126.62s)]
*  I had a signed copy of the book [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7128.62s)]
*  Probably not a good thing to have around [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7130.62s)]
*  Probably not [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7132.62s)]
*  Maybe it was good she threw it out [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7134.62s)]
*  I mean I never even read it [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7136.62s)]
*  I just point to people [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7138.62s)]
*  I forget who gave it to me [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7140.62s)]
*  I forget who gave it to me, it might have been Sakura [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7142.62s)]
*  Someone like that [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7144.62s)]

*  Chris Evans, Captain America [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7166.62s)]
*  Handsome movie [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7168.62s)]
*  The movie [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7170.62s)]
*  The movie that they did for Netflix [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7172.62s)]
*  One of the most expensive action movies ever [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7174.62s)]
*  Fun movie, but very [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7176.62s)]
*  Different than the book, the book is dark [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7178.62s)]
*  The book is about [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7180.62s)]
*  Like a real CIA hitman [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7182.62s)]
*  That they found [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7184.62s)]
*  When he was like 19 years old [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7186.62s)]
*  He had committed [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7188.62s)]
*  He murdered some drug dealers [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7190.62s)]
*  Or something like that [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7192.62s)]
*  And they incorporated him into this CIA program [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7194.62s)]
*  Where they trained him to kill people [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7196.62s)]
*  True story? [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7198.62s)]
*  No, I don't think it's true story, but I think [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7200.62s)]
*  There's some [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7202.62s)]
*  Basis in history [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7204.62s)]
*  That they have done things like that [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7206.62s)]
*  Oh, absolutely [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7208.62s)]
*  No, that's the CIA's MO [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7210.62s)]
*  Well, they most certainly have hired killers [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7212.62s)]
*  And you know [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7214.62s)]
*  Contractors and stuff like that [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7216.62s)]
*  I know people have done that [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7218.62s)]
*  But this book is about [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7220.62s)]
*  This one guy who's the elite of the elite [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7222.62s)]
*  The Grey Man [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7224.62s)]
*  It's pretty intense [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7226.62s)]
*  This is a series of them [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7228.62s)]
*  They get a little [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7230.62s)]
*  It's hard to keep a good idea going [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7232.62s)]
*  After a while, like how come this guy's not dead [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7234.62s)]
*  This is a little crazy, kills everybody [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7236.62s)]
*  Barely gets shot [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7238.62s)]
*  I know [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7240.62s)]
*  I just watched the [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7242.62s)]
*  Jeff Bridges did one called [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7244.62s)]
*  The Old Man, the series [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7246.62s)]
*  I watched it up until a point [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7248.62s)]
*  I'm like, come on [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7250.62s)]
*  That's what I was just going to say, I bailed out an episode 7 out of 8 [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7252.62s)]
*  I was just like, no [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7254.62s)]
*  And the first episode [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7256.62s)]
*  Was fucking great [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7258.62s)]
*  Some series have a perfect [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7260.62s)]
*  First episode [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7262.62s)]
*  The first few episodes were great, but it got to a point [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7264.62s)]
*  Where they would have found him [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7266.62s)]
*  How are you just driving there? You can't just drive [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7268.62s)]
*  Places anymore [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7270.62s)]
*  Not only that, you have a car that has GPS on it [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7272.62s)]
*  This is nonsense [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7274.62s)]
*  Why is the woman that he kidnapped being left alone [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7276.62s)]
*  In his apartment and she's not calling the police? [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7278.62s)]
*  Because his fucks are good [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7280.62s)]
*  Because he's 80 [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7282.62s)]
*  He's 80 years old, he's not fucking anything [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7284.62s)]
*  No, you're wrong [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7286.62s)]
*  You're wrong, he gives it to him [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7288.62s)]
*  He's getting B12 shots [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7290.62s)]
*  He's ready to go [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7292.62s)]
*  Killer dogs, it would have been a really good movie [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7294.62s)]
*  That would have ended like No Country for Old Men [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7296.62s)]
*  Where it had like a [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7298.62s)]
*  Weird ending [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7300.62s)]
*  That would have been a good movie, but as a series [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7302.62s)]
*  Too much talking [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7304.62s)]
*  And explaining things, not enough showing me things [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7306.62s)]
*  Means that you didn't know how to resolve things [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7308.62s)]
*  You had a little television-ish for a while [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7310.62s)]
*  It was bad writing [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7312.62s)]
*  But it wasn't in the beginning [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7314.62s)]
*  In the beginning it's like they had a great [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7316.62s)]
*  Concept and you bought into it [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7318.62s)]
*  Even the way he survived [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7320.62s)]
*  And the way he managed to thrive [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7322.62s)]
*  You bought into it [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7324.62s)]
*  Up until he kidnaps her and takes her across the country [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7326.62s)]
*  And you're like, get the fuck out of here [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7328.62s)]
*  They're gonna find you bro, you can't just do that [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7330.62s)]
*  There's only so many roads, where are you going? [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7332.62s)]
*  There's only so many roads [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7334.62s)]
*  You get these two actors together [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7336.62s)]
*  And you don't put them in the same scene [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7338.62s)]
*  What's the guy from Third Rock? What's that actor's name? [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7340.62s)]
*  John Lithgow [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7342.62s)]
*  You get John Lithgow and Jeff Bridges together [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7344.62s)]
*  And they're never on screen together [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7346.62s)]
*  Right [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7348.62s)]
*  No! [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7350.62s)]
*  Well, I think it could have been [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7352.62s)]
*  Like I said, it could have been a great movie [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7354.62s)]
*  After a while it just seemed to get a little slippery [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7356.62s)]
*  I don't mind Liam Neeson doing action [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7358.62s)]
*  Either, I mean he's getting up there [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7360.62s)]
*  And I still buy it, he's fucking good [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7362.62s)]
*  He's good [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7364.62s)]
*  The main one? Taken? Taken [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7366.62s)]
*  When he calls a guy up [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7368.62s)]
*  People have used that for so many reels [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7370.62s)]
*  I have a particular set of skills [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7372.62s)]
*  Yeah, I bought that [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7376.62s)]
*  I love Daniel Craig as James Bond [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7378.62s)]
*  I like a good fucking assassin movie [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7380.62s)]
*  A good badass movie [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7382.62s)]
*  An aging action star [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7384.62s)]
*  I actually like that [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7386.62s)]
*  Did you see the video of the 92 year old man fucking this young guy up on the street? [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7388.62s)]
*  No! [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7390.62s)]
*  Go to Lennox [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7392.62s)]
*  Lewis' Instagram page [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7394.62s)]
*  There's a video of [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7396.62s)]
*  These guys pick a fight with a [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7398.62s)]
*  I think he's 92 [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7400.62s)]
*  He's 92 years old [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7402.62s)]
*  And he fucks these guys up [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7404.62s)]
*  He takes his shirt off and starts boxing these guys in the street [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7406.62s)]
*  What country? [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7408.62s)]
*  I don't know, I don't know where it was [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7410.62s)]
*  Let's see if we can find it [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7412.62s)]
*  Just pull up Lennox Lewis' page and I'll show you which one it is [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7414.62s)]
*  That's it, right there [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7416.62s)]
*  So does it say? [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7418.62s)]
*  No [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7420.62s)]
*  Does it say? [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7422.62s)]
*  It says 92 year old retired professional boxer [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7424.62s)]
*  So these people start getting into an argument [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7426.62s)]
*  And start pushing each other around [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7428.62s)]
*  It eventually turns back around normal [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7430.62s)]
*  And so [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7432.62s)]
*  So it's in front of a McDonald's [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7434.62s)]
*  So they're pushing this guy around [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7436.62s)]
*  So they're pushing this guy around [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7438.62s)]
*  And so this guy steps in [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7446.62s)]
*  The guy with the black shirt [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7448.62s)]
*  He's the one who's going to get fucked up, this young guy [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7450.62s)]
*  So he hits a boom [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7456.62s)]
*  The old dude just flatlined him [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7458.62s)]
*  No, it gets better, it gets better [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7462.62s)]
*  Look at him, this guy's 92 years old [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7464.62s)]
*  He flatlines that guy [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7466.62s)]
*  Look at him, he's dancing around [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7468.62s)]
*  I mean this is an old dude [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7470.62s)]
*  And a young guy that he just cracked [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7472.62s)]
*  Look at them stand in front of each other [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7474.62s)]
*  The guy tries to take him out [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7476.62s)]
*  Boom, drops him again [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7478.62s)]
*  And now the old dude's getting wild [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7480.62s)]
*  Now he's getting wild [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7482.62s)]
*  Look, he takes his shirt off, the fuck out of here [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7484.62s)]
*  Let's go, bitch [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7486.62s)]

*  Now this kid's squaring up with him, he's fucked [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7490.62s)]
*  BAM! [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7492.62s)]
*  Look at this, 92 [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7494.62s)]
*  He's pushing everybody the fuck away from him [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7496.62s)]
*  Get up, bitch [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7498.62s)]
*  You want some more? [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7500.62s)]
*  Look at this [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7502.62s)]
*  This guy's still, look at how he's standing [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7504.62s)]
*  Squared off, has no idea how to box [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7506.62s)]
*  And the other two guys stayed down [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7508.62s)]
*  Stayed down, bitch [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7510.62s)]
*  They were down [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7512.62s)]
*  Look at this old dude, man, 92 years old [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7514.62s)]
*  He looks like Russian or something [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7516.62s)]
*  Probably [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7518.62s)]
*  They age better [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7520.62s)]
*  And he probably thought, you know what, I'm 92, if I die, fuck it [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7522.62s)]
*  I'm gonna have some fun [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7524.62s)]
*  Let's die like this [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7526.62s)]
*  But when you see that guy standing with his legs [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7528.62s)]
*  Squared off in front of him, with his hands up [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7530.62s)]
*  He has zero idea how to fight [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7532.62s)]
*  This is the perfect moment for that guy [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7534.62s)]
*  To do that [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7536.62s)]
*  I thought he was gonna start hitting the women [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7538.62s)]
*  After he knocked out the three guys, women started coming at him [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7540.62s)]
*  That's where shit gets dangerous [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7542.62s)]
*  That's a sticky situation to be in [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7544.62s)]
*  What do you do? You don't want to let a woman punch you [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7546.62s)]
*  Women can knock you out [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7548.62s)]
*  Yeah [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7550.62s)]
*  There's women out there that can fucking knock you out [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7552.62s)]
*  Especially if you don't see it coming [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7554.62s)]
*  Like they sucker punch you from the side [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7556.62s)]
*  Fucking dangerous [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7558.62s)]

*  Yeah, you can't let them hit you [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7562.62s)]
*  But if you hit them [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7564.62s)]
*  It's all on video [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7566.62s)]
*  Oh my god, and if you knock a woman out, she falls and hits her head [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7568.62s)]
*  Oh Jesus Christ [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7570.62s)]
*  Oh Jesus Christ [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7572.62s)]
*  And she dies [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7574.62s)]
*  Oh fuck, doesn't matter who jumped you [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7576.62s)]
*  You punch a woman in the head and knock her out [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7578.62s)]
*  I punched a woman one time [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7580.62s)]
*  Oh my god, what happened? [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7582.62s)]
*  It was Halloween and I was like 13 [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7584.62s)]
*  And [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7586.62s)]
*  We were running around our neighborhood [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7588.62s)]
*  You know, we all had on [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7590.62s)]
*  Everybody dressed, you call it bums [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7592.62s)]
*  We used to say bums [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7594.62s)]
*  But isn't that funny, we used to dress as homeless people [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7596.62s)]
*  Yeah, that was like a costume [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7598.62s)]
*  That was a costume to be a bum [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7600.62s)]
*  You would never see that today [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7602.62s)]
*  It's true [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7604.62s)]
*  We used to wear ratty ass clothes [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7606.62s)]
*  And we put dirt on our face [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7608.62s)]
*  And there was a girl [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7610.62s)]
*  And she had [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7612.62s)]
*  I thought it was a guy [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7614.62s)]
*  And she had on a mask [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7616.62s)]
*  And sprayed me in the eyes [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7618.62s)]
*  We used to take shaving cream [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7620.62s)]
*  And we would put an aerosol top on a shaving cream can [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7622.62s)]
*  And it would spray the shaving cream [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7624.62s)]
*  Like 20 feet, it was awesome [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7626.62s)]
*  And we'd bring eggs and you know, we'd go crazy [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7628.62s)]
*  And so [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7630.62s)]
*  She sprayed in my eyes, so I can't see that well [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7632.62s)]
*  And I chase [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7634.62s)]
*  What I thought was him [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7636.62s)]
*  Knocked him down, I'm sitting on top of him [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7638.62s)]
*  And I punch him in the face [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7640.62s)]
*  And then everybody's screaming [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7642.62s)]
*  And they pull me up, they're like, dude it's a girl [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7644.62s)]
*  And I was like, fuck [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7646.62s)]
*  So I just fucking [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7648.62s)]
*  Run away, I run away [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7650.62s)]
*  And it turns out [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7652.62s)]
*  It was a girl from the next town over [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7654.62s)]
*  From where I grew up, she was one town over [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7656.62s)]
*  And then that [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7658.62s)]
*  Winter, we were at the Tarrytown [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7660.62s)]
*  Lakes, which is, they would freeze [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7662.62s)]
*  Over in the winter, and they had these big [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7664.62s)]
*  Telephone poles [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7666.62s)]
*  And they had floodlights, and they had speakers [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7668.62s)]
*  And they would play AM radio [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7670.62s)]
*  And they had a big heated shack, you'd change [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7672.62s)]
*  Your skates, and during the day you'd play hockey [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7674.62s)]
*  And then at night, we'd all show up [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7676.62s)]
*  And they would light it, and [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7678.62s)]
*  They'd stay up until like 11 o'clock at night [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7680.62s)]
*  And that was like our social life in the winter, we'd skate [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7682.62s)]
*  And you know, you'd hide some beers in the [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7684.62s)]
*  Snowbank, and you'd get fucked up [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7686.62s)]
*  And you'd try to make out with a girl [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7688.62s)]
*  And so it was great, so I go there [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7690.62s)]
*  And I'm like 13, and they go [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7692.62s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's so and so [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7694.62s)]
*  She's got a crush on you, I was like, oh [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7696.62s)]
*  Where's she from? She's from the next town over [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7698.62s)]
*  Yeah, you punched her in the face on Halloween [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7700.62s)]
*  And I was like, dude, how [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7702.62s)]
*  That says a lot about her family life [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7704.62s)]
*  You know [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7706.62s)]
*  Well maybe she felt bad that she sprayed you [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7708.62s)]
*  In the face, and then she thought when you were punching her [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7710.62s)]
*  You were kind of cute [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7712.62s)]
*  He's got pretty eyes, and a good right hook [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7716.62s)]
*  Did you apologize to her? [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7720.62s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, I felt terrible about it [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7722.62s)]
*  Did you apologize right afterwards, or did you wait [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7724.62s)]
*  Till you met her at the lake? [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7726.62s)]
*  I didn't know where she was from the next town, the next time [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7728.62s)]
*  I saw her was at the lake [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7730.62s)]
*  And then somebody told me that she had a crush on me [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7732.62s)]
*  So I'm talking to her, and then all of a sudden [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7734.62s)]
*  My friend, quote unquote [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7736.62s)]
*  Friend, skated as hard as [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7738.62s)]
*  He could while I was talking to her [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7740.62s)]
*  And he lined me up [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7742.62s)]
*  Just because that's what we did to each other [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7744.62s)]
*  And I got knocked down [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7746.62s)]
*  And I couldn't get up, I was winded like I was [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7748.62s)]
*  Down, and then [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7750.62s)]
*  I find out next week, and I was kind of into her [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7752.62s)]
*  She was pretty, and I find out the next [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7754.62s)]
*  Week, she had a crush on the guy [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7756.62s)]
*  That knocked me out [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7758.62s)]
*  Oh god, of course she did, she likes abuse [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7760.62s)]
*  She's all for the chaos [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7762.62s)]
*  She probably would have been a wild one [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7768.62s)]
*  Yeah [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7770.62s)]

*  Did you watch Peaky Blinders? [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7814.62s)]
*  No, I heard it's great though [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7816.62s)]
*  It's all about the gypsies [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7818.62s)]
*  Is it really great? [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7820.62s)]
*  It is up there with [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7822.62s)]
*  Game of Thrones [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7824.62s)]
*  In terms of one hour dramas [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7826.62s)]
*  It's not quite as good [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7828.62s)]
*  But it is fucking cool [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7830.62s)]
*  The guy who's the lead is just one of the most badass [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7832.62s)]
*  Protagonists in any drama [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7834.62s)]
*  You've ever seen in your life [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7836.62s)]
*  But it taps into that world [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7838.62s)]
*  They live in [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7840.62s)]
*  I think it's Birmingham [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7842.62s)]
*  Which I guess has a lot of Irish that have moved in [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7844.62s)]
*  And a lot of gypsy influence [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7846.62s)]
*  So that's their dark side [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7848.62s)]
*  They go there, they kind of dip into [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7850.62s)]
*  The gypsy world a little bit [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7852.62s)]
*  It's cool [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7854.62s)]
*  We got a gypsy heavyweight champion in the world [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7856.62s)]
*  The boxer [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7858.62s)]
*  Tyson Fury, he's the gypsy king [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7860.62s)]
*  That's right, I knew that [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7862.62s)]
*  He's one of the greatest heavyweights of all time [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7864.62s)]
*  He's a gypsy, unquestionably [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7866.62s)]
*  One of the greatest heavyweight boxers [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7868.62s)]
*  Of all time [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7870.62s)]
*  He's the gypsy king, he talks the best shit [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7872.62s)]
*  He talks the most shit [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7874.62s)]
*  He's hilarious [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7876.62s)]
*  It's really funny, man [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7878.62s)]
*  It's hard to be a gypsy now because they won't let you just live wherever you want [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7880.62s)]
*  Gypsies used to just [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7882.62s)]
*  They were nomads, they would just wander [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7884.62s)]
*  They would sharpen knives [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7886.62s)]
*  They'd go to places and sharpen knives [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7888.62s)]
*  But they do just bring their caravans [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7890.62s)]
*  Places and park them [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7892.62s)]
*  That does still happen [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7894.62s)]
*  But I think they're having a harder time finding places [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7896.62s)]
*  I didn't know that [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7898.62s)]
*  I knew that I had a friend who lived in the UK [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7900.62s)]
*  And one of her friends from the UK [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7902.62s)]
*  Was telling her that this [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7904.62s)]
*  Band of gypsies just moved into an abandoned [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7906.62s)]
*  Lot on their street [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7908.62s)]
*  They just pulled in [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7910.62s)]
*  We live here now [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7912.62s)]
*  And they couldn't get them to move out [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7914.62s)]
*  These people lived in this [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7916.62s)]
*  Well to do neighborhood [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7918.62s)]
*  Somewhere in the UK [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7920.62s)]
*  I don't know, I don't remember the story [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7922.62s)]
*  But I remember thinking, oh, how does that work? [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7924.62s)]
*  What do they do? It's like you can't get rid of them [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7926.62s)]
*  They're allowed to do that [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7928.62s)]
*  In certain places [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7930.62s)]
*  Shit [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7932.62s)]

*  Where, wasn't Brad Pitt [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7936.62s)]
*  Snatch [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7938.62s)]
*  That was great fucking movie [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7940.62s)]
*  That was one of Guy Ritchie's [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7942.62s)]
*  Fucking classics [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7944.62s)]

*  Imagine that trial [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7958.62s)]
*  You think that the fucking Amber Heard trial [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7960.62s)]

*  Billy Bob Thornton [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7976.62s)]
*  Because Brad physically had it [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7980.62s)]
*  Over him, but Billy Bob was wearing the blood [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7982.62s)]
*  Around his neck [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7984.62s)]
*  They were doing some dark shit [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7986.62s)]
*  They cut each other's skin and dripped blood into vials [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7988.62s)]
*  And kept it on their necks [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7990.62s)]
*  Tattooed shit about each other on their bodies [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7992.62s)]
*  I think [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7996.62s)]
*  All of us fall short of that relationship [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=7998.62s)]
*  In terms of passion [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8000.62s)]
*  Good [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8002.62s)]
*  That's just unsustainable [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8004.62s)]
*  When you see people sprinting [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8006.62s)]
*  You smile and she's kissing him [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8008.62s)]
*  I had a good fucking time, I'll tell you that [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8010.62s)]

*  For as long as it lasted [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8014.62s)]
*  She's one of the sexiest women ever [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8016.62s)]
*  She's pretty hot [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8018.62s)]

*  Psychotic and erotic [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8022.62s)]
*  They're very closely related [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8024.62s)]
*  You gotta [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8026.62s)]
*  Always take that into consideration [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8028.62s)]
*  Some of the most psycho chicks [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8030.62s)]
*  Are the most erotic [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8032.62s)]
*  And it's not necessarily good [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8034.62s)]
*  Amy Winehouse, she must have been wild [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8036.62s)]
*  She's probably so drunk all the time [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8038.62s)]
*  Probably not [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8040.62s)]
*  Drunk heroin life does not lead itself [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8042.62s)]
*  To a lot of wild sexual exploits [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8044.62s)]
*  And chaos [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8046.62s)]
*  It seems like there's a lot of napping [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8048.62s)]
*  And throwing up in the sink [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8050.62s)]
*  Sid and Nancy didn't fuck [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8052.62s)]
*  If they did, it wasn't good [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8054.62s)]
*  Maybe it was, they probably smelled [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8056.62s)]
*  Sid, take a shower [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8060.62s)]
*  Fuck you [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8062.62s)]
*  What do you do? [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8064.62s)]
*  Those kind of relationships [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8066.62s)]
*  They don't have [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8068.62s)]
*  A long shelf life [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8070.62s)]
*  It's like you're sprinting [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8072.62s)]
*  You're tattooing your names on each other immediately [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8074.62s)]
*  And dripping blood [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8076.62s)]
*  Where are you gonna go from there? [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8078.62s)]
*  Eventually it's gonna peter out [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8080.62s)]
*  You don't even cut yourself from me anymore [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8082.62s)]
*  I thought we were done [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8084.62s)]
*  I did it already [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8086.62s)]
*  Your fucking name's on my arm [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8088.62s)]
*  Leave me alone [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8090.62s)]
*  I'm not gonna do that anymore [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8092.62s)]
*  You're just DMing hoes on Instagram [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8094.62s)]
*  Come on [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8096.62s)]
*  You haven't sacrificed an animal for me in weeks [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8098.62s)]
*  Ugh [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8100.62s)]
*  That kind of a relationship [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8102.62s)]
*  If you get involved in that kind of crazy level [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8104.62s)]
*  Of relationship [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8106.62s)]
*  Where you're cutting each other [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8108.62s)]
*  And carrying each other's blood around [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8110.62s)]
*  Where does that go? [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8112.62s)]
*  You gotta look at that in terms of a long term project [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8114.62s)]
*  You start out sprinting like that [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8116.62s)]
*  How is that sustainable? [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8118.62s)]
*  Save it [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8120.62s)]
*  Save it [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8122.62s)]
*  You're not gonna [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8124.62s)]
*  I think you should maybe [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8126.62s)]
*  Wait till you're 65 [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8128.62s)]
*  And then finally [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8130.62s)]
*  You got her doggy style [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8132.62s)]
*  And you go to put it in [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8134.62s)]
*  And she just goes [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8136.62s)]
*  Finally [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8138.62s)]
*  Oh no [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8140.62s)]
*  I wasted all these years of butt fucking [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8142.62s)]
*  That's the thing that people either like it or they don't like [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8144.62s)]
*  Right? [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8146.62s)]
*  Some people like it [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8148.62s)]
*  Some people don't like it at all [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8150.62s)]
*  It's not supposed to be good for you [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8152.62s)]
*  Like Dr. Drew was talking about all the dangers involved in that [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8154.62s)]
*  I was like hey hey hey hey hey [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8156.62s)]
*  Prolapsed anus [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8158.62s)]
*  Oh my god [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8160.62s)]
*  Tom Segura [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8162.62s)]
*  Has sent me and showed me [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8164.62s)]
*  Some of the most horrific things [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8166.62s)]
*  That they show on your mom's house live [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8168.62s)]
*  When they do those shows [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8170.62s)]
*  And one of them was these two guys [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8172.62s)]
*  That had prolapsed anuses [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8174.62s)]
*  They were fisting [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8176.62s)]
*  And they were pulling their prolapsed anuses out [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8178.62s)]
*  And they were rubbing them together [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8180.62s)]
*  So like this pink sock [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8182.62s)]
*  From one guy's butt [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8184.62s)]
*  And one guy [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8186.62s)]
*  Apparently he was internally bleeding [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8188.62s)]
*  Because [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8190.62s)]
*  They're doing such rigorous awful stuff [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8192.619999999999s)]
*  To their assholes [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8194.619999999999s)]
*  That everything was like a bright dark red [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8196.619999999999s)]
*  And the doctor was like that guy probably died that night [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8198.619999999999s)]
*  You're not going to live from that one [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8200.62s)]
*  Like oh [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8202.62s)]
*  The damage you're doing [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8204.62s)]
*  You're basically like rupturing organs [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8206.62s)]
*  How do you wipe your ass after you take a dump? [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8208.62s)]
*  How do you heal from that [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8210.62s)]
*  Where you can shit again [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8212.62s)]
*  Like you're tearing your asshole apart [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8214.62s)]
*  And then poop has to come through there on the way out [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8216.62s)]
*  And when it's all broken up inside [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8218.62s)]
*  And the poop is like rubbing up [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8220.62s)]
*  Against that [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8222.62s)]
*  Do you get infected? [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8224.62s)]
*  What happens there? [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8226.62s)]
*  He's never had anything in his ass [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8228.62s)]
*  Congratulations to him [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8230.62s)]
*  He's a non anal gay guy [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8232.62s)]
*  Good for him [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8234.62s)]
*  I met these two guys at a show once in Connecticut [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8236.62s)]
*  And I had a joke about [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8238.62s)]
*  Two guys having anal sex [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8240.62s)]
*  And they wanted to come up to me after the show [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8242.62s)]
*  And they go we thought you were really funny [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8244.62s)]
*  But we want you to know that a lot of gay people don't have anal sex [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8246.62s)]
*  I go okay [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8248.62s)]
*  I go but some of them do right? [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8250.62s)]
*  It's still a thing [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8252.62s)]
*  He's like yeah they do [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8254.62s)]
*  You just want me to know that you're not one of those people? [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8256.62s)]
*  I go duly noted [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8258.62s)]
*  I'm like I don't know where we're going with this [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8260.62s)]
*  He just wanted me to know [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8262.62s)]
*  That there's a whole community of gay folks [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8264.62s)]
*  That don't have butt sex [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8266.62s)]
*  I'm like okay [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8268.62s)]
*  But it's not like I'm making this up right? [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8270.62s)]
*  Like people do fuck each other in the butt [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8272.62s)]
*  I've seen the videos [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8274.62s)]
*  It's real [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8276.62s)]
*  So what are we doing here? [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8278.62s)]
*  You just telling me? [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8280.62s)]
*  There's girls that don't either [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8282.62s)]
*  Yeah that's the crazy thing [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8284.62s)]
*  I've heard girls yell it out in comedy clubs [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8286.62s)]
*  Like a comic on stage [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8288.62s)]
*  Was on stage and he was talking about [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8290.62s)]
*  Some girls love anal [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8292.62s)]
*  Me! [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8294.62s)]
*  You're throwing up the bat signal [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8296.62s)]
*  Yeah [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8302.62s)]
*  A girl yelling that out [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8304.62s)]
*  How much attention does she need? [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8306.62s)]
*  Damn [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8308.62s)]
*  What kind of choices has she made other than that bad one? [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8310.62s)]
*  Louis used to have a funny bit about [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8312.62s)]
*  Anal sex [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8314.62s)]
*  He's like I never got it [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8316.62s)]
*  He goes you're an inch away from the greatest thing in the world [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8318.62s)]
*  I just did a couple shows with him in Canada [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8324.62s)]
*  We went up to [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8326.62s)]
*  Vancouver [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8328.62s)]
*  Did this theater [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8330.62s)]
*  And man his new hour is fucking good [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8332.62s)]
*  It's so good [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8334.62s)]
*  Have you seen him? [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8336.62s)]
*  Yeah I saw him at the Creek in the Cave [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8338.62s)]
*  I mean [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8340.62s)]
*  I wish I could sit here and quote it [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8342.62s)]
*  But I know he's probably going to put it out [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8344.62s)]
*  On his next special [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8346.62s)]
*  Well he's still refining it [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8348.62s)]
*  And fucking around with it [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8350.62s)]
*  And he was working on new stuff [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8352.62s)]
*  And playing around when he was here [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8354.62s)]
*  But it's interesting to watch him work again [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8356.62s)]
*  He's freer now than he's ever been before [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8358.62s)]
*  He's gone through the worst [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8362.62s)]
*  And now he's on the other end of it [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8364.62s)]
*  And he's still doing the same kind of comedy [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8366.62s)]
*  Really funny, really ridiculous [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8368.62s)]
*  And he's just the fucking greatest guy [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8370.62s)]
*  We had such a good time [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8372.62s)]
*  In Vancouver the mushrooms are legal [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8374.62s)]
*  So I walked into this shop [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8376.62s)]
*  Called the Funguy shop [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8378.62s)]
*  It had the mushrooms on it [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8380.62s)]
*  And there's a girl working behind the counter [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8382.62s)]
*  And she's got on like a yellow [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8384.62s)]
*  Tube top [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8386.62s)]
*  And pink hair and piercings [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8388.62s)]
*  And she's gorgeous [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8390.62s)]
*  And she's like the shroom [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8392.62s)]
*  Tender [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8394.62s)]
*  And I got like [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8396.62s)]
*  I got an eighth of mushrooms [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8398.62s)]
*  Like fresh, fresh out of the field [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8400.62s)]
*  And I took them [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8402.62s)]
*  I don't think Louie took them [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8404.62s)]
*  And then we went to an art museum [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8406.62s)]
*  And just when they kicked in [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8408.62s)]
*  I was in the art museum [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8410.62s)]
*  And then we went to a brunch [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8412.62s)]
*  And then we started walking [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8414.62s)]
*  And we got to a bus stop and I go let's just sit here and look at these people [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8416.62s)]
*  And then a bus pulled up and I go [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8418.62s)]
*  Let's get on the bus [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8420.62s)]
*  And we got on the bus and the bus went hurtling [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8422.62s)]
*  Out of Vancouver [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8424.62s)]
*  Like went over a bridge to an island [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8426.62s)]
*  And we just got off [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8428.62s)]
*  And we're just wandering around and we went to like a marina [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8430.62s)]
*  And we're looking at the boats [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8432.62s)]
*  And talking to people [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8434.62s)]
*  And then we found a bridge that took us back to Vancouver [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8436.62s)]
*  And it was like [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8438.62s)]
*  Six hours [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8440.62s)]
*  And then when we got back to town we realized [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8442.62s)]
*  There was a film noir festival [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8444.62s)]
*  That was happening at this little indie theater [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8446.62s)]

*  As a prostitute in that movie? [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8582.62s)]
*  It seems unlikely [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8584.62s)]
*  She seems a little too emotionally stable [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8586.62s)]
*  Yeah [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8588.62s)]

*  And if love, love can see through everything [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8602.62s)]
*  Right and you can see that it's [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8604.62s)]
*  It's not her background [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8606.62s)]
*  That you're marrying [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=8608.62s)]

*  It was a weird one [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9034.62s)]
*  Because he [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9036.62s)]
*  Was rehabbing off a weed [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9038.62s)]

*  He's addicted to fame [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9062.62s)]
*  Remember Stan Hope had a bit [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9064.62s)]
*  About how unethical celebrity rehab is [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9066.62s)]
*  Oh yeah [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9068.62s)]
*  It's a great bit [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9070.62s)]
*  Because it's so true [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9072.62s)]
*  What a terrible thing to do to people [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9074.62s)]
*  Who are coming off of drugs [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9076.62s)]
*  Take a fucking camera in their face [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9078.62s)]
*  It's like the worst idea ever [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9080.62s)]
*  For someone trying to recover [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9082.62s)]
*  There's a reason why it's alcoholics anonymous [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9084.62s)]
*  Part of the reason why it's anonymous is that [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9086.62s)]
*  You don't want to hold somebody up [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9092.62s)]
*  As a role model [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9094.62s)]
*  For sobriety because if they then [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9096.62s)]
*  Lose their sobriety [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9098.62s)]
*  It fucks up people that were looking to them [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9100.62s)]
*  You're supposed to look to yourself and your higher power [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9102.62s)]
*  Interesting [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9104.62s)]
*  So the last thing you want to do is put celebrities out there [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9106.62s)]
*  To encourage people to get sober [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9108.62s)]
*  Because they're the really stable people [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9110.62s)]
*  Watching them deteriorate on the show [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9112.62s)]

*  And then like [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9116.62s)]
*  I don't care what the fuck your check is [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9118.62s)]
*  And what the attention you're getting [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9120.62s)]
*  It's not worth it [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9122.62s)]
*  You don't want everybody judging you based on the worst time in your life [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9124.62s)]
*  Coming off a coke [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9126.62s)]
*  Trying to get your shit together [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9128.62s)]

*  You need to be on the show [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9132.62s)]
*  You're a famous person and you're not wealthy at all [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9134.62s)]
*  Because you need to be on the show [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9136.62s)]
*  What does the show pay? How much does it pay? [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9138.62s)]
*  It can't be a lot [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9140.62s)]
*  It might get you by for the year [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9142.62s)]
*  But now you're stuck with the memory that everybody has about you [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9144.62s)]
*  Like throwing up in a bathtub [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9146.62s)]
*  Coming down off opiates [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9148.62s)]
*  Unless you can really nail it and know you're gonna get sober [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9150.62s)]
*  America loves a redemption story [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9152.62s)]
*  Dennis Rodman did [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9154.62s)]
*  All he did was run on a treadmill [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9156.62s)]
*  He was fine [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9158.62s)]
*  Because of him it's like alcohol [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9160.62s)]
*  Like parties [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9162.62s)]
*  So he's just working out all the time while he's there [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9164.62s)]
*  But you know [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9166.62s)]
*  People were saying horrible insulting shit [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9168.62s)]
*  To each other and then they just put that on television [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9170.62s)]
*  Yeah [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9172.62s)]
*  I could never watch that [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9174.62s)]
*  There was another show that was called [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9176.62s)]
*  It was a show where they [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9178.62s)]
*  Oh, Intervention [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9180.62s)]
*  You ever see Intervention? [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9182.62s)]
*  No, same kind of thing [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9184.62s)]
*  It was regular people but like [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9186.62s)]
*  You would call them and you would stage an intervention with somebody [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9188.62s)]
*  And they would think that [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9190.62s)]
*  The TV crew was following them around [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9192.62s)]
*  About something else [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9194.62s)]
*  Oh God [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9196.62s)]
*  Until the moment where they walked into the room [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9198.62s)]
*  And their friends and family and therapist was there [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9200.62s)]
*  And then there'd be an intervention [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9202.62s)]
*  What a dirty trap [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9204.62s)]
*  It was a dirty trap but it was a good fucking show man [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9206.62s)]
*  It was powerful, holy shit [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9208.62s)]
*  People get obsessed with watching people go off the rails [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9210.62s)]
*  Like hoarders [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9212.62s)]
*  People love watching that [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9214.62s)]
*  They love watching people off the rails [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9216.62s)]
*  Going to their houses, boxes of newspapers [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9218.62s)]
*  Stacked up to the ceiling, cat shit on the floors [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9220.62s)]
*  Like whoa [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9222.62s)]
*  Yeah, because they're trying to make people feel better about themselves [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9224.62s)]
*  And they gotta go pretty low [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9226.62s)]
*  Yeah [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9228.62s)]
*  They gotta shoot low to go below America [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9230.62s)]
*  But it is weird how we become obsessed with people [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9232.62s)]
*  Whose lives are falling apart [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9234.62s)]
*  Like we'll focus on like [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9236.62s)]
*  My 600 pound life or something like that [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9238.62s)]
*  People, they wanna go [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9240.62s)]
*  Well, I feel better, I'm not that guy [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9242.62s)]
*  Yeah [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9244.62s)]
*  And you also realize like [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9246.62s)]
*  If you think about it as crazy as you've ever been in your life [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9248.62s)]
*  Like what's the worst you've ever been [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9250.62s)]
*  And how much further could it have gone if you didn't self correct [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9252.62s)]
*  If you didn't course correct in your life [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9254.62s)]
*  Would you ever have gotten to the point where you were one of those people [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9256.62s)]
*  That can't get off the couch [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9258.62s)]
*  Because you're 600 pounds [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9260.62s)]
*  Would you be one of those people that gambles away every fucking penny you have no matter what [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9262.62s)]
*  And you're in debt [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9264.62s)]
*  And you're terrifying [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9266.62s)]
*  Like Adam Sandler in Rough Cut Gems [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9268.62s)]
*  Or Uncut Gems [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9270.62s)]
*  Did you see that movie? Yeah [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9272.62s)]
*  Great fucking movie [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9274.62s)]
*  And that movie gave me wild anxiety [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9276.62s)]
*  Because I was like I know people like this [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9278.62s)]
*  I could see this being a real guy [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9280.62s)]
*  He can't stop, he can't stop [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9282.62s)]
*  He can't stop gambling [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9284.62s)]
*  He's just addicted, it's like [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9286.62s)]
*  You imagine that was you [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9288.62s)]
*  When I see a guy like Adam Sandler [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9290.62s)]
*  In Uncut Gems, I imagine I could be that guy [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9292.62s)]
*  Really? Yeah [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9294.62s)]
*  With what? If I was him, living his life [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9296.62s)]
*  With gambling [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9298.62s)]
*  You're that guy [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9300.62s)]
*  You could see that was so well done [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9302.62s)]
*  And well written [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9304.62s)]
*  You could see the thrill in the winning [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9306.62s)]
*  Occasionally he would win [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9308.62s)]
*  And when he'd lose, he'd fucking devastate him [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9310.62s)]
*  But when he'd win he'd be like fuck yeah [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9312.62s)]
*  Fuck yeah [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9314.62s)]
*  Norm had that [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9316.62s)]
*  Norm was a gambler [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9318.62s)]
*  He lost everything like three times [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9320.62s)]
*  And I'm not speaking out of school [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9322.62s)]
*  It was documented [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9324.62s)]
*  He had a real game [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9326.62s)]
*  He would gamble on like my friend wrote on one of his shows [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9328.62s)]
*  He would gamble if [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9330.62s)]
*  If there was no pro football or [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9332.62s)]
*  Basketball or whatever, he would be betting on [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9334.62s)]
*  Girls high school basketball [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9336.62s)]
*  Jesus. Yeah, whatever [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9338.62s)]
*  So how does he do that? Does he have a bookie? [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9340.62s)]
*  So he calls this guy up and he goes [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9342.62s)]
*  What do you got for me? And they're like [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9344.62s)]
*  Girls high school basketball, he's like let's go [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9346.62s)]
*  Jesus [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9348.62s)]
*  Yeah, the thrill [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9352.62s)]
*  Of gambling is apparently one of the [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9354.62s)]
*  Most difficult to kick [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9356.62s)]
*  People with gambler problems [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9358.62s)]
*  Gamblers anonymous, and I think it's a lot like we were talking [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9360.62s)]
*  About with the football players [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9362.62s)]
*  Is the high, obviously it's not [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9364.62s)]
*  Comparable, but they're high [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9366.62s)]
*  That's their highest of high [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9368.62s)]
*  Is winning at gambling [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9370.62s)]
*  And then the thrill of chasing money [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9372.62s)]
*  And the wondering whether or not you're going to succeed [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9374.62s)]
*  And then losing it [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9376.62s)]
*  And then dodging the bookies and trying to like [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9378.62s)]
*  Go to another casino and [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9380.62s)]
*  Well that's what they say is a huge part of it [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9382.62s)]
*  Is it's actually the losing as much as the winning [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9384.62s)]
*  It's the fear of [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9386.62s)]
*  What's going to happen when I lose and then feeling [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9388.62s)]
*  That panic and that low [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9390.62s)]
*  Jesus Christ. Yeah, it's about [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9392.62s)]
*  The low. I knew so many guys [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9394.62s)]
*  That were gambling junkies [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9396.62s)]
*  From my pool hall days [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9398.62s)]
*  So many guys, like every day [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9400.62s)]
*  They'd go to off track betting [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9402.62s)]
*  They would come to the pool hall and they would gamble [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9404.62s)]
*  They'd play cards, and if they had a job [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9406.62s)]
*  It was just to scratch up enough money to gamble with [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9408.62s)]
*  All they cared about was gambling [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9410.62s)]
*  They were just absorbed [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9412.62s)]
*  With it, and it was really [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9414.62s)]
*  Interesting. What kind of gambling? [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9416.62s)]
*  They would play poker, they would play [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9418.62s)]
*  Gin, they would [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9420.62s)]
*  They would shoot pool, but the problem with pool is [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9422.62s)]
*  You have to execute [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9424.62s)]
*  And a lot of guys didn't like that [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9426.62s)]
*  You had to be able to make a shot [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9428.62s)]
*  So it's nerves and controlling yourself [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9430.62s)]
*  A lot of these guys, their nerves were shattered [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9432.62s)]
*  So they were just gambling on stuff [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9434.62s)]
*  A lot of them were horse bettors [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9436.62s)]
*  I knew a guy who [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9438.62s)]

*  With such a fucking great premise [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9568.62s)]
*  You ever see that movie, that Albert Brooks movie? [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9570.62s)]
*  They leave LA [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9572.62s)]
*  It's Albert Brooks and his wife is the woman from [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9574.62s)]
*  Airplane [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9576.62s)]
*  Remember the woman who's the star of Airplane? [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9578.62s)]
*  And so they're successful yuppies [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9580.62s)]
*  And they're making tons of money [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9582.62s)]
*  And they have a nice house and they decide to sell everything [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9584.62s)]
*  They're going to simplify, we're going to buy a mobile home [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9586.62s)]
*  And we're going to spend the rest of our lives [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9588.62s)]
*  Just traveling, living life [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9590.62s)]
*  So they [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9592.62s)]
*  Put all their money into a bank account [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9594.62s)]
*  They get in Winnebago [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9596.62s)]
*  First stop out of LA to get to the [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9598.62s)]
*  Grand Canyon is going to be Las Vegas [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9600.62s)]
*  And so they go down [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9602.62s)]
*  And they play a little bit of blackjack [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9604.62s)]
*  And she's losing and then he goes [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9606.62s)]
*  Come on, let's go [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9608.62s)]
*  And she's like I'm just going to play one or two more hands [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9610.62s)]
*  So he goes to bed and she stays playing [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9612.62s)]
*  And she's got the bug [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9614.62s)]
*  She doesn't realize she's got a gambling problem [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9616.62s)]
*  And she gambles all night [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9618.62s)]
*  And she loses all their money [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9620.62s)]
*  They call it the nest egg [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9622.62s)]
*  Oh I remember that [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9624.62s)]
*  The nest egg, you're not allowed to say nest egg [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9626.62s)]
*  You're not allowed to say egg, you can't say nest [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9628.62s)]
*  And then he goes to Gary Marshall [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9630.62s)]
*  Who plays the manager of the casino [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9632.62s)]
*  And he's trying to pitch to him [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9634.62s)]
*  What if I do a commercial for you guys [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9636.62s)]
*  And I say, hey look, you gave the money back to a customer [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9638.62s)]
*  And it's fucking hilarious [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9640.62s)]
*  So now they're, so that's the first act of the movie [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9642.62s)]
*  And the rest of the movie is just them broke [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9644.62s)]

*  It's her losing the money right here [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9654.62s)]

*  Yeah [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9658.62s)]
*  He played a great like hapless guy who finds himself in terrible circumstances [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9660.62s)]
*  Nothing [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9668.62s)]
*  Well give or take a thousand [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9670.62s)]
*  Give or take a thousand [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9672.62s)]
*  As the boldest experiment [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9674.62s)]
*  In advertising history you give us our money back [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9676.62s)]

*  Yeah [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9682.62s)]
*  One of the greatest comedies of all time [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9684.62s)]
*  The boldest experiment in advertising history [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9688.62s)]

*  Yeah [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9696.62s)]
*  Dude he started, you know who his, how he got started [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9698.62s)]
*  He grew up in Beverly Hills [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9700.62s)]
*  His brother was Super Dave Osborne [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9702.62s)]
*  Super Dave Osborne [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9704.62s)]
*  And did you know that? [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9706.62s)]
*  No, I think I did know [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9708.62s)]
*  The guy from Curb Your Enthusiasm [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9710.62s)]
*  That's his brother [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9712.62s)]
*  And he grew up, and his actual name in real life is Albert Einstein [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9714.62s)]
*  Albert Brooks [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9716.62s)]
*  Wow [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9718.62s)]
*  And so he grew up and his best friend growing up in Beverly Hills was Rob Reiner [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9720.62s)]
*  And so Carl Reiner is on The Tonight Show one night with Johnny Carson [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9724.62s)]
*  And Carson goes, who do you think is the, I mean you worked with Mel Brooks [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9728.62s)]
*  You've been with the greats, like who's the funniest person that you know? [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9732.62s)]
*  And he said, my 15 year old son's friend Albert Einstein [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9736.62s)]
*  Wow [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9742.62s)]
*  And so Johnny goes, I want him on the show [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9744.62s)]
*  So they book him on the show [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9746.62s)]
*  And he comes on and he does this bit [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9748.62s)]
*  I don't know if this was the first bit that he did [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9750.62s)]
*  It might have been the first bit that he did [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9752.62s)]
*  He had one of those Simon Says things where you like push A and it goes A, B [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9754.62s)]
*  And he does like a comedy routine with the Simon Says [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9758.62s)]
*  When he's 15 [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9762.62s)]
*  Maybe 16 [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9764.62s)]
*  He fucking destroys [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9766.62s)]
*  And Carson starts bringing him back [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9768.62s)]
*  And he did Carson like 20 times [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9770.62s)]
*  Before he was like 21 years old [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9772.62s)]
*  Wow [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9774.62s)]
*  And he would always come out with these conceptual bits [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9776.62s)]
*  And he just, that's how his career started [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9778.62s)]
*  I don't think people can even appreciate the impact of being on Carson [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9782.62s)]
*  I don't think people understand [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9786.62s)]
*  There was three channels [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9788.62s)]
*  There was 20 million people watching Carson every night [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9790.62s)]
*  And when he liked someone [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9792.62s)]
*  They would be successful [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9794.62s)]
*  Like a comic [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9796.62s)]
*  Like guys like Richard Jenney [[02:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9798.62s)]
*  Who would do the Carson show [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9800.62s)]
*  That's what made him [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9802.62s)]
*  People seeing him do five minutes on Carson [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9804.62s)]
*  Well it's not dissimilar from doing the Joe Rogan experience [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9806.62s)]
*  It's different for sure [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9810.62s)]
*  You know [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9812.62s)]
*  There's a lot more options now [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9814.62s)]
*  It's like five million podcasts [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9816.62s)]
*  That Tonight Show thing [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9818.62s)]
*  If he didn't like you [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9820.62s)]
*  You were fucked [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9822.62s)]
*  It was over [[02:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9824.62s)]
*  It all came down to that [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9826.62s)]
*  And if he liked you [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9828.62s)]
*  I mean yeah, comedians talked about it [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9830.62s)]
*  They said that all you had to do was tell a club booker [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9832.62s)]
*  That you did the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9834.62s)]
*  And all of a sudden your money went from [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9836.62s)]
*  1500 a week to [[02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9838.62s)]
*  15,000 [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9840.62s)]
*  Didn't Howard Stern have like a famous feud with him? [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9842.62s)]
*  With Carson? [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9844.62s)]
*  Yeah [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9846.62s)]
*  They hated each other [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9848.62s)]
*  That was one of those weird times [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9850.62s)]
*  Where if one of those guys crossed you [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9852.62s)]
*  If you were in a bad situation with one of those guys [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9854.62s)]
*  Yeah [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9856.62s)]
*  With Joan Rivers [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9858.62s)]
*  Joan Rivers was the guest host for him forever [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9860.62s)]
*  And then Fox gave her her own talk show [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9862.62s)]
*  And he was [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9864.62s)]
*  Outraged that she would compete against him [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9866.62s)]
*  And he never had her back on the show [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9868.62s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9870.62s)]
*  Yeah [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9872.62s)]
*  And she was a staple of the show [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9874.62s)]
*  She was like his go-to person [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9876.62s)]
*  She used to host when he was off [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9878.62s)]
*  Shouldn't he be like happy? [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9880.62s)]
*  She's getting her own show [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9882.62s)]
*  But I think the competition then was a real thing [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9884.62s)]
*  Because we don't think of competition the same way [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9886.62s)]
*  Because with the internet all that stuff has been eroded [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9888.62s)]
*  There's so many choices [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9890.62s)]
*  You can do whatever you want at any time [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9892.62s)]
*  So if someone's watching you at 11 o'clock [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9894.62s)]
*  They could watch that another time [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9896.62s)]
*  It doesn't matter [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9898.62s)]
*  But back then it mattered [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9900.62s)]
*  You had to be in front of your fucking television at 11 p.m. [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9902.62s)]
*  And that's when The Tonight Show came on [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9904.62s)]
*  Period, end of discussion [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9906.62s)]
*  It only came on at one time [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9908.62s)]
*  And you had to sit there and watch it then [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9910.62s)]
*  And there was no VCRs [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9912.62s)]
*  And you got to remember [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9914.62s)]
*  That this guy was on The Tonight Show [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9916.62s)]
*  And then if you're on The Tonight Show three times, four times [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9918.62s)]
*  Like oh, it's Don Rickles again [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9920.62s)]
*  I love Don Rickles [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9922.62s)]
*  And they'd see him again [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9924.62s)]
*  And then they became a person that was in the public sphere [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9926.62s)]
*  There's nothing like that now [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9930.62s)]
*  Like does that mean [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9932.62s)]
*  We don't understand [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9934.62s)]
*  Like the access we have [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9936.62s)]
*  To just different content [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9938.62s)]
*  And there's so many more options [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9940.62s)]
*  For people to do things now [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9942.62s)]
*  Right [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9944.62s)]
*  Yeah, now it's like everybody's got a publicist [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9946.62s)]
*  Because they have to work so many different avenues [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9948.62s)]
*  You know, you got to scramble to get on [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9952.62s)]
*  You know, cable and podcasts [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9954.62s)]
*  And blogs [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9956.62s)]
*  Yeah, it's constant scrambling [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9958.62s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9960.62s)]
*  But it's also like some things rise up [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9962.62s)]
*  And some things get noticed [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9964.62s)]
*  And you're like why is that thing getting noticed [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9966.62s)]
*  And some of it's artificial and that doesn't work [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9968.62s)]
*  You know, they'll pop up some celebrity [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9970.62s)]
*  And give them a podcast and make a big deal out of it [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9972.62s)]
*  But after a while people are like this sucks [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9974.62s)]
*  And they stop listening [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9976.62s)]
*  There's too many options [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9978.62s)]
*  When you're alone by yourself [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9980.62s)]
*  And you're finagling and [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9982.62s)]
*  Promoting things [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9984.62s)]
*  And it's like doesn't work [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9986.62s)]
*  People like what they like [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9988.62s)]
*  When you're alone you get to choose [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9990.62s)]
*  Like what do I want to watch? I want to watch this [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9992.62s)]
*  That's the real determination [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9994.62s)]
*  Of whether or not something's good [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9996.62s)]
*  And we don't keep watching [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=9998.62s)]
*  The fact that we both stopped watching The Old Man [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10000.62s)]
*  People didn't need to stop watching [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10002.62s)]
*  You kept watching your series [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10004.62s)]
*  Yeah, I bail on stuff [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10006.62s)]
*  I bail all the time [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10008.62s)]
*  Oh, I bailed on that last week [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10010.62s)]
*  How's the Dragon put all new actors in? [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10012.62s)]
*  That's when I bailed [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10014.62s)]
*  I was like what are you doing? [[02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10016.62s)]
*  And the only compelling actor on the show was the daughter [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10018.62s)]
*  What are you doing? [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10024.62s)]
*  So stupid [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10026.62s)]
*  You could have just made her look older [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10028.62s)]
*  You fucking idiots [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10030.62s)]
*  First of all she looked like a 25 year old actress [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10032.62s)]
*  Playing a 15 year old actress [[02:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10034.62s)]
*  It would not have been a stretch [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10036.62s)]
*  You could have done that in 25 right? [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10038.62s)]
*  In the next one it's like 10 years later [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10040.62s)]
*  That's not hard to do [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10042.62s)]
*  You could do that [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10044.62s)]
*  Why did you do that? [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10046.62s)]
*  And they kept some actors [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10048.62s)]
*  So they kept some [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10050.62s)]
*  And they look exactly the same [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10052.62s)]
*  And then they just replaced people [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10054.62s)]
*  And they said oh but we cast the first people first [[02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10056.62s)]
*  And then they always knew [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10058.62s)]
*  The people that got replaced [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10060.62s)]
*  Always knew they were going to be replaced [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10062.62s)]
*  That's still a terrible idea [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10064.62s)]
*  That idea sucks [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10066.62s)]
*  And there's not enough dragons [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10068.62s)]
*  I want to see dragons [[02:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10070.62s)]
*  I want to see them fighting [[02:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10072.62s)]
*  I want to see them torching shit up [[02:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10074.62s)]
*  They occasionally use the dragons [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10076.62s)]
*  It's very occasional [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10078.62s)]
*  They threaten with the dragon a little bit [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10080.62s)]
*  But nothing happens [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10082.62s)]
*  They had me until they changed actors [[02:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10084.62s)]
*  And my wife was like fuck this [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10086.62s)]
*  What the fuck did they just do to me? [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10088.62s)]
*  What did they just do? [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10090.62s)]
*  Why did they replace the queen? [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10092.62s)]
*  They kept the king? [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10094.62s)]
*  They just made the king look older? [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10096.62s)]
*  But you got a whole new queen? [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10098.62s)]
*  It took me like five minutes to realize [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10100.62s)]
*  What was going on [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10102.62s)]
*  I was like who is she? [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10104.62s)]
*  Oh she's her? [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10106.62s)]
*  No, no, no [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10108.62s)]
*  Why? [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10110.62s)]
*  And the king, who am I to knock [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10112.62s)]
*  Anybody's acting [[02:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10114.62s)]
*  I don't find the king to be very [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10116.62s)]
*  Good [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10118.62s)]
*  I'm sure he's a good actor [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10120.62s)]
*  Maybe he's not right for the part [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10122.62s)]
*  But I'm not excited about the king [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10124.62s)]
*  Yeah [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10126.62s)]
*  It's not compelling [[02:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10128.62s)]
*  But the changing of the actors [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10130.62s)]
*  Was a giant clusterfuck of a mistake [[02:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10132.62s)]
*  Whoever greenlit that [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10134.62s)]
*  Where was the adult in the room? [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10136.62s)]
*  Is there another fucking way here? [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10138.62s)]
*  You've got people committed to these people [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10140.62s)]
*  For hours [[02:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10142.62s)]
*  And hours [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10144.62s)]
*  They're committed to these particular characters [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10146.62s)]
*  Now you're asking this [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10148.62s)]
*  You have to just accept [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10150.62s)]
*  That you have new actors [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10152.62s)]
*  So now I know it's all bullshit [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10154.62s)]
*  When they did it with the crown [[02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10156.62s)]
*  At least they did it from season to season [[02:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10158.62s)]
*  I think there was three different queens [[02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10160.62s)]
*  I never watched that [[02:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10162.62s)]
*  It was good [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10164.62s)]
*  I fucking hate the royal family [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10166.62s)]
*  I just can't believe the queen is dead [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10168.62s)]
*  I feel like it was just yesterday [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10170.62s)]
*  That I couldn't believe she was alive [[02:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10172.62s)]
*  Yesterday [[02:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10174.62s)]
*  All my queens were [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10176.62s)]
*  But I'm not a fan of the royal family [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10178.62s)]
*  But that show is really fucking good [[02:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10180.62s)]
*  Olivia Colman is unbelievable [[02:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10182.62s)]
*  I haven't watched it [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10184.62s)]
*  But if you're going to do it every season [[02:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10186.62s)]
*  As long as I know you're going to do it every season [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10188.62s)]
*  Okay [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10190.62s)]
*  Suspension of disbelief [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10192.62s)]
*  But not mid-season [[02:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10194.62s)]
*  Episode five? [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10196.62s)]
*  What is it? Six? [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10198.62s)]
*  Whatever it is? Fuck out of here [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10200.62s)]
*  Why'd you do that? [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10202.62s)]
*  You could have made those people look old [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10204.62s)]
*  It's not hard to do [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10206.62s)]
*  It's not impossible [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10208.62s)]
*  You have people who look like fucking dragons [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10210.62s)]
*  You have white walkers [[02:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10212.62s)]
*  You have all this makeup [[02:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10214.62s)]
*  Put some old people makeup on that young girl [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10216.62s)]
*  Change your voice a little bit [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10218.62s)]
*  Fuck are you doing [[02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10220.62s)]
*  But the knight is still the same? [[02:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10222.62s)]
*  You have the same knight and he looks exactly the same age [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10224.62s)]
*  What are you doing? [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10226.62s)]
*  And then they've also got [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10228.62s)]
*  Because of the time the men are all dressed the same [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10230.62s)]
*  And they all have black [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10232.62s)]
*  Kind of wavy long hair [[02:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10234.62s)]
*  And so you can't tell [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10236.62s)]
*  Is that that guy? [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10238.62s)]
*  Or is that the other guy? And now all of a sudden you're replacing him [[02:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10240.62s)]
*  So now I've got to make that adjustment? [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10242.62s)]
*  Fuck that [[02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10244.62s)]
*  Here's another point [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10246.62s)]
*  There's another real problem [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10248.62s)]
*  This is a prequel to Game of Thrones [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10250.62s)]
*  There's black people in the prequel [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10252.62s)]
*  They're all gone later [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10256.62s)]
*  They're all gone later [[02:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10258.62s)]
*  So what happened? [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10260.62s)]
*  There's no black people in Game of Thrones? [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10262.62s)]
*  How many black people are in Game of Thrones? [[02:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10264.62s)]
*  I can't remember any [[02:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10266.62s)]
*  But there's quite a few [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10268.62s)]
*  In House of Dragon [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10270.62s)]
*  There's a lot [[02:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10272.62s)]
*  So what's going on? [[02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10274.62s)]
*  You went through how many seasons [[02:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10276.62s)]
*  With no black people in Game of Thrones [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10278.62s)]
*  And in the prequel they're in every episode? [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10280.62s)]
*  And it's the same island [[02:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10282.62s)]
*  It's the same island [[02:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10284.62s)]
*  Where'd they go? [[02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10286.62s)]
*  And why do they all have white hair? [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10288.62s)]
*  I don't understand [[02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10290.62s)]
*  Can we just have black people [[02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10292.62s)]
*  That give them white hair? [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10294.62s)]
*  Why did you do that? [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10296.62s)]
*  Well there was some black people in Game of Thrones [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10298.62s)]
*  There were certainly [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10300.62s)]
*  Those eunuchs [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10302.62s)]
*  The slaves [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10304.62s)]
*  There were those guys [[02:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10306.62s)]
*  Remember those guys that fought for her [[02:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10308.62s)]
*  But they were eunuchs [[02:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10310.62s)]
*  And then there were certainly [[02:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10312.62s)]
*  Places that people went [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10314.62s)]
*  That had people of color [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10316.62s)]
*  But they didn't have royal family [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10318.62s)]
*  Like in this movie it's royal family [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10320.62s)]
*  It's like the Targaryens [[02:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10322.62s)]
*  Or the Lannisters or whatever [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10324.62s)]
*  What the fuck man [[02:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10326.62s)]
*  Crazy [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10328.62s)]
*  Changing actors mid-show is so bunkers [[02:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10330.62s)]
*  It's just such a [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10332.62s)]
*  Bunkers idea [[02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10334.62s)]
*  And they just said okay, this is how we're going to handle it [[02:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10336.62s)]
*  You just fuck people's heads up [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10340.62s)]
*  You're trying to [[02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10342.62s)]
*  You're trying to hook people into a show [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10344.62s)]
*  And just as you build the character [[02:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10346.62s)]
*  And get them excited about it [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10348.62s)]
*  And she was good [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10350.62s)]
*  I liked the young queen [[02:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10352.62s)]
*  Was great [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10354.62s)]
*  And also like her uncle [[02:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10356.62s)]
*  The guy who molested her [[02:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10358.62s)]
*  Spoiler alert [[02:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10360.62s)]
*  He's still around [[02:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10362.62s)]
*  And he's the same [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10364.62s)]
*  Doesn't look any older [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10366.62s)]
*  But she's like this totally different lady now [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10368.62s)]
*  He's in the crown [[02:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10370.62s)]
*  He plays Prince Philip in the crown [[02:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10372.62s)]
*  I haven't watched the Lord of the Rings [[02:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10374.62s)]
*  Thing on Amazon but I heard it's a fucking [[02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10376.62s)]
*  Disaster [[02:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10378.62s)]
*  Oh is it? [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10380.62s)]
*  It's the most expensive TV show ever made [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10382.62s)]
*  Fucking disaster [[02:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10384.62s)]
*  Do you know how much you spent on it? [[02:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10386.62s)]
*  How much? 800 million dollars [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10388.62s)]
*  Right Jamie? [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10390.62s)]
*  Can you look that up? I think it was 800 million dollars [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10392.62s)]
*  For like 7 episodes [[02:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10394.62s)]
*  700 million for 8 episodes [[02:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10396.62s)]
*  Something crazy [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10398.62s)]
*  And I heard that the people that did it [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10400.62s)]
*  Never run a show before [[02:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10402.62s)]
*  First time show runners [[02:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10404.62s)]
*  This is 465 [[02:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10406.62s)]

*  I think that movie was a couple hundred million dollars [[02:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10556.62s)]
*  How much was the Grey Man [[02:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10558.62s)]
*  For Netflix [[02:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10560.62s)]

*  On a film [[02:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10564.62s)]
*  I think it's more [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10566.62s)]
*  200 million? [[02:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10568.62s)]

*  And that doesn't include like marketing [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10576.62s)]
*  And all that shit [[02:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10578.62s)]
*  One release in the theater [[02:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10580.62s)]
*  Shit [[02:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10582.62s)]
*  That's a lot of movie [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10584.62s)]
*  They put it out for a week just so they could win an Oscar [[02:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10586.62s)]
*  That's why they put it out [[02:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10588.62s)]
*  Is that why they do it? [[02:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10590.62s)]
*  It only has to play for one week [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10592.62s)]
*  The movie is fun [[02:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10594.62s)]
*  But the book is way more brutal [[02:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10596.62s)]
*  Way more brutal [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10598.62s)]
*  It's hard to do something like that [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10600.62s)]
*  And turn it into a movie [[02:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10602.62s)]
*  Where you actually like the hero [[02:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10604.62s)]

*  He's the best at killing people [[02:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10608.62s)]
*  They pulled it off with John Wick [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10612.62s)]
*  But that's generally hard to pull off [[02:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10614.62s)]
*  John Wick is a hitman [[02:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10618.62s)]

*  That guy was terrifying [[02:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10632.62s)]
*  But it is weird how you're kind of pulling for him [[02:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10634.62s)]
*  Because he's got a wife [[02:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10636.62s)]
*  And he's really sweet to his daughter [[02:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10638.62s)]

*  Wednesday night was the night when they all met. And so all these limos would start pulling up [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10853.460000000001s)]
*  along the street. They would double park all the way down Mulberry Street and they would go inside. [[03:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10858.94s)]

*  it in, but that's how they took down Gotti. But then Gotti found out about the wiretaps, [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10871.26s)]
*  so they started walking down Mulberry Street. They'd walk up and down and they'd have their [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10876.34s)]
*  business conversations. So the FBI parked cars there ahead of Wednesday night and they put [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10881.14s)]

*  another 200 cash because that was her bingo money. And Tony don't need to know about that. [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gktSDD3BAs&t=10955.460000000001s)]
