# Joe Rogan Experience #1380 - Pete Dominick
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 08, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2aYNheer8I)
*  3, 2, 1. Hello, Pete Dominic. How are you, buddy?
*  Hey, Joe Rogan.
*  Good to see you, man.
*  Good to see you. Psyched to be here. Psyched to be in California,
*  psyched to be sitting across from you.
*  Psyched to have you. You're a free man now.
*  I'm a...
*  You've escaped yourself from the shackles of satellite radio.
*  The shackles of corporate media.
*  Yeah, man. See, that's the thing about dedicating so much time to a company like that. They can
*  just get rid of you and then you don't have a connection to all those fans. You have to
*  reestablish a connection.
*  It's been an amazing experience in the last, what, four weeks since it happened to try to...
*  First of all, I watched my funeral play out publicly because I had a huge community of
*  listeners for 12 years that I created that I was trying to respond to all of them. And I,
*  you know, you can't say... I still can't share like certain details, right?
*  How much time did they give you before the show was ended?
*  The show, basically, they told me after the show that it was the last show and then they
*  let me have like a... They said I could do a last show, but instead I was like,
*  let me just record a message. I don't want to...
*  So you didn't know until the day of.
*  I had a pretty good idea. I had a pretty good idea.
*  Do they have ratings?
*  I don't think so. If they did, I think I'd probably be in pretty good shape. I mean,
*  it's a long story, but the show I was doing was pretty special. It was really helping people. And
*  we were enlightening. It's kind of like what you do here. I mean, that's why I love what you do
*  here. People learn, they get enlightened, they get entertained. You make people better,
*  better people through this show. The contribution that you make, that's what I was doing. We were
*  three hours every day talking about issues, talking about struggles that people are having,
*  and it was rewarding and challenging and satisfying. And I had total editorial control.
*  So, you know, I can't... I really can't complain. 12 years is pretty...
*  Do they know, though, how many people are listening to any given show?
*  Not that I ever know.
*  Not that it was ever shown to me.
*  See, that is a weird thing. That's a thing that you have with Netflix as well.
*  You know, like if you do a special with Netflix and they go, we really like it. It's great.
*  But they don't share it with you.
*  Yeah. And you go, well, how are the ratings? They go, we're really happy.
*  Well, what does that mean? We're really, really happy.
*  Ha! That's like when you first started doing comedy and you came off stage and your friends
*  were like, you looked confident.
*  No, it's worse than that because you don't... like business decisions can be made based on
*  what kind of downloads you're getting, right? If Netflix says, hey, you know, four million
*  people downloaded your comedy special. They've really loved it. We're really happy. Let's do
*  another one.
*  It doesn't make any sense for the company to have the information and the host not to have
*  the information. Why wouldn't you share it so that everybody has...
*  Because they don't want you to bargain with them.
*  Well, it's...
*  They don't want you to negotiate.
*  I mean, the best thing about being fired is you don't have to worry about being fired.
*  Yes.
*  And so you can do your own thing. And increasingly, I think people are taking advantage of that.
*  If you're a network, you have to have a million people listening or watching
*  to keep the ratings up to sell advertising. You're only making just so much money.
*  If you launch your own thing the way you have and so many other people have,
*  you're gambling with everything, which is what I'm doing now with podcasting,
*  which is really an original thing to do and a very difficult way to make money. But if you do,
*  if you're good, then you control it all.
*  Yeah, you can do it. It's like if you've done a serious show and you developed an audience,
*  and that's something you definitely did do...
*  Three hours live every day, yeah.
*  You can definitely do the same thing on a podcast. You just have to...
*  I hope you're right.
*  No, you can. It's like...
*  My family's relying on us.
*  Well, you have comedy too. But you absolutely can do it. And it's just one of those things
*  where I see people doing the corporate route and I'm like, man, I get how you needed to do
*  that 15 years ago. You don't need to do that now. That's a bad decision now. Where it was a good...
*  Like, hey, you got a serious gig 15 years ago. Like, wow, that's awesome.
*  Yeah. I think you're absolutely right. It's terrifying. There's always pros and cons.
*  You work for a company no matter what you do. You're working for somebody. You have a place to go.
*  They control all of the... In our case, in media's case, the promotion, the marketing, the legal,
*  they hire producers to work for you and so on. And so there's a certain level of comfort there.
*  But at the same time, you got to answer to these people. You got to deal with these people. And
*  frankly, you're more talented than a lot of the people that you're working with. And you have all
*  these ideas and these inspirations and they're either going to say yes or no to them. And when
*  you're on your own, you just put the wheels on them and go.
*  Yeah. Well, I remember last time I went to serious offices, went to the studios. I was upstairs
*  and I was like, there's too much money here. This costs too much money. There's too many people
*  here. You see these fucking people wearing suits. What does that guy do? I guarantee you,
*  he doesn't do fuck all. That guy doesn't have anything to do with whether or not this shows
*  any good. And all you have to do is press a button and get it out there. So there's all these people
*  making decisions about, well, we got marketing and this and that. I'm going to make sure we hit
*  the right demographic. I feel like that's the way I've worked at CNN. I worked at MSNBC. I worked
*  at Fox. I feel like that's corporate media or corporate America, where you have to wonder how
*  much work and how much value each person is bringing to whatever their job is. I always
*  want to know, but it's- They're goofy. Serious is very goofy. They offered me a great deal.
*  Zero money. Really? Zero. I feel like you might've told me that before. Zero. Zero money. It's the
*  most hilarious deal ever. We'll put your show on the air and we'll give you zero. Like, oh,
*  that sounds good. I don't even know. When was that? I mean, at that point- Fucking recently.
*  Really? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They're hilarious. How did you- What did you do? I didn't do anything.
*  I don't talk to anybody. I mean, it's all done through managers and agents. And I say no to
*  everything. So I was like, it was easy to say no to- I always did everything directly myself.
*  Wow, that's a terrible idea. I could never allow somebody- I never felt like anybody could sell me
*  the way I could sell myself. Oh, dude. Then you have to think about selling yourself.
*  Which- It takes any- This is, I mean, for people who listen to this podcast regularly,
*  I'm sorry. I apologize for repeating myself. But the way I look at everything, and this is something
*  I've done over the last- Really cultivated over the last 10 years, but really specifically
*  focused on over the last couple, is I look at thinking as bandwidth. Say if you have 100 units
*  of thinking, whatever the fuck you have to- What you're involved in to have this negotiation or
*  sell yourself to this and sell yourself to that and talk about this and pitch your ideas to this
*  person and that person. That's taking away time that you could be working on your other shit.
*  Creating. Yeah, I don't have any time for that. I have zero time. I allocate zero bandwidth for
*  selling myself, zero bandwidth for doing other people's shit. But have you always done that?
*  Were you that way at the start? Because I mean, you're so big now and anybody can understand that
*  you can do that. I never sold myself. I always had an agent and a manager. I've had the same
*  manager since I was an open micer. Really? Who? Jeff Sussman. Oh, wow. I know Jeff Sussman. Yeah,
*  wow. Huh, that's awesome. You're a loyal guy too. Well, he's awesome and he's family. We've been
*  together since 1990. Yeah, I feel that way about my agent too. Conan Smith, he's one of the few
*  guys I met in this business that I really always liked and he didn't seem like he's part of this
*  business. But he'd always be like, what's next? And I'd always say tomorrow's show because every
*  three hour live show, we talked about everything from tax policy to depression to environmentalism
*  to anything, politics, parenting. And so it was really challenging to do that and to prepare for
*  all these interviews with these smart people. And then I wanted to go home and be with my girls.
*  Like I had an amazing work-life balance and I feel like so most people never find that. They
*  never understand it. I found it and I kept it for a really long time, which is what's scary to not
*  have that. I've been working my ass off since the day I left SiriusXM and went right into a meeting
*  and have been on the phone ever since, reached out to you and everybody I knew. I said, hey,
*  you know, what can I do? But it's not balance. I haven't seen my girls, I haven't seen my garden.
*  So I'm excited to hopefully get back to that, to some semblance of that. But most people don't have
*  that. And I think finding, because you get so ambitious, especially as a guy, I feel like,
*  if you're a breadwinner especially, it's just work, work, work, support your family,
*  if you've got a family, there's ego, there's money and you just keep going. But then you realize
*  there's got to be enough. In my opinion, you have to have an idea of enough. And I got there.
*  And that's when I just would work and then I would shut that down. I would still do as much comedy
*  as I could. But that definitely fell by the wayside because the show, it was up at 4.30 in
*  the morning. I was done by two and then I turned it off. I had to.
*  Well, the good thing is you can do your show if you do a podcast. You could do it from wherever
*  you live. You can do it close by. You can either rent an office space or you can do it in your
*  fucking garage. You can do it anywhere, especially when your kids are at school, you could do it.
*  You could do it on your terms. You could bank a couple of them, do two or three in a day
*  and then take days off. But the most important thing I think is that you stay independent.
*  We were just talking about that out there because there's going to be a bunch of bozos
*  that want you to join their network. Oh, they're calling.
*  Yeah, they take a big chunk. I don't know what the offers are. I don't
*  know what the deals are, but it's like, why? I just started doing this podcast.
*  You've already been through what that is. I've got a great community of listeners who
*  are like family to me. They've all been so supportive. You're like, let me just try to
*  test that out. Definitely test that out. How active are you on social media?
*  I try to be as active as I can. I'm not great at it.
*  Well, that's important though that you have some sort of engagement so you can tell people
*  where you're going. Yeah, definitely doing that.
*  But you don't want to be too wrapped up in it because again, bandwidth, it's going to suck up
*  a lot of your time. For a lot of people, it's a giant distraction.
*  Yeah, that's why when I say I'm not that good at it, it's because I feel like it's a distraction.
*  It seems like a very, as a creative person, it's an interesting outlet and there's a lot
*  of creative people who are great on Twitter, but I don't think in terms of what's a great tweet
*  or I should tweet right now or put this up on Facebook. Comics artists do this because they
*  love to create. They love to perform. They don't love to promote what they're doing.
*  Nobody really likes that. Some people do and some people are great at it, but it's usually
*  not why you get into it. At the same time, if you don't do it, I mean, there's a lot of great comics
*  who don't promote themselves and there's a lot of bad comics, if we're talking about comedians,
*  any performer who are great at promoting themselves. I fall somewhere in between.
*  Yeah, people that are really good at promoting usually are not that good.
*  Because they spend so much time promoting and they're trying to get famous and trying to get
*  successful as opposed to doing the work. They're also super conscious of how they appear to people.
*  They're super conscious and they're trying to cultivate an image. They're trying very hard.
*  I can't be bothered with that. It's not good for you.
*  I mean, I know it works, but I can't. To go back to what your deal was at
*  Sirius, when you were there. They don't give you any indication of what kind of numbers you're
*  pulling in. Any indication of how many people are listening to your show.
*  It was hard to know. You see the phone volume, you see the phones lock up, you see... Social media is
*  not really a good measurement because the vast majority... Were you getting people to follow you?
*  Were you saying on the show, hey, follow me on Twitter, follow me on Instagram?
*  What's interesting... I don't want to disparage SiriusXM, not because they gave me a good exit
*  deal, I guess, but because it almost seems inauthentic because they gave me five contracts,
*  which created an amazing life and amazing community. I'm so grateful to what I had there.
*  But yes, certainly the problem, I suppose, is you're behind this firewall. This morning,
*  one of my best friends lives in Australia. He's like, yeah, I listen to Joe Rogan. I listen to
*  Rachel Maddow's podcast. They don't have MSNBC there. They can't get SiriusXM necessarily. You
*  can't, I guess, online. The point is, if you're behind that, you're mostly in the car. I think
*  what I'm trying to say is it's skewed to 50, 60-year-old affluent men who are in cars,
*  which I was psyched to have every one of them. But I would love to have a lot of young people.
*  I'm staying out here with my cousin, and his son is 18, and he found out he was doing the Joe Rogan
*  show, and he's flipping out. But he didn't know what I did at SiriusXM.
*  Pete Slauson I hate to say this because I'm thankful that
*  Sirius put on Howard and Opie and Anthony and all these comics they had on over the years,
*  but you're better off without it. It's not where the future is. The future is not in satellite
*  radio. It's just not. It sucks. You go under tunnels, it cuts out, it cuts – I mean, it's
*  dumb. It's a fucking dumb way. I mean, you can download an entire three-hour show in seconds.
*  Pete Slauson Yep.
*  Pete Slauson If you have a podcast, you get it on Spotify
*  or whatever, you download the whole fucking thing right before a plane ride in the airport.
*  Pete Slauson I just did it, yeah.
*  Pete Slauson You're in the airport and you can go, oh hey,
*  there's a new Artie Lang podcast. Beep, download it. While you're fucking waiting for your gate to
*  be called, you got the podcast, you get on the three-hour flight, you listen to the whole goddamn
*  thing. It's easy. Pete Slauson
*  What's interesting is going – I'm really curious to see what you think – but going from
*  live radio and constant interaction with callers, which I love, you know, I'm a –
*  Pete Slauson You can do that.
*  Pete Slauson To podcasting and just being there alone with the mic and you know –
*  Pete Slauson No, you can do that. You can have live callers.
*  Pete Slauson I'm told I can. I'm told I can go live. I
*  haven't figured it out yet. I got a great group of people that are working with me. Amazing people
*  have come out of the crowd. The greatest thing has been how people have shown up. Like, people
*  from my life, like 15 years ago, 20 years ago, phone just ringing, texts coming in,
*  I know I haven't taught you and saying kind of just what you're saying. You're better off,
*  you know, one door closes. But more importantly, just people talking about how you changed their
*  life and how they can't wait to see what you do next is an amazing, amazing feeling. Like,
*  if you do that with one person, your cup is full. To have an audience of people doing that for 12
*  years is overwhelming joy and satisfaction. To be able to look at my daughters and be like,
*  uh, no matter what happens next, what I got to do there and what I did do there on so many tough
*  issues and helped so many people, that's it, man. I could die right now.
*  Pete Slauson Well, don't die. Don't die.
*  Jared Larsen It would be good for me to do it on the show, though.
*  Pete Slauson You have a nice past, which is wonderful. But the thing about scary things
*  and the thing about this is that it's an opportunity for growth. It's an opportunity
*  to do something. It's an opportunity to stretch your wings, to really take a chance. And that's
*  how you grow. Jared Larsen And
*  I appreciate you saying that and I'm on that same wavelength and I'm a guy who, who thrives in these
*  situations. Like, I've, I've taken advantage of every room I've been in. I've never been the best
*  comic, the best. I've never been the best at anything, but I've always been gritty. I've
*  always worked as hard, if not harder than anybody. And now, it's interesting because I've never been
*  in this type of situation with a family. You know, that's different when you're single and
*  you're young. But I was working that hard and making no excuses and back then doing no drugs,
*  not drinking, everything. It was just about my career and being a good person. I thought if I
*  was a good person, that mattered. And to come to find out being a good person was the best form of
*  currency. Everybody competing and trying to kill other people in our business or in any other
*  business, to me, I have no interest in that and no attraction in those people. All I wanted to do
*  is help people, not think just for purposes of altruism, not to be virtuous, just because
*  same reason you are. Being kind is the way to be, not putting a knife in someone's back. And
*  when the show ended, it was amazing because people started tweeting things that I had done
*  that I never was, thought would become public. They were private things. They weren't for,
*  and it was just like days and days of people. I used to do a segment every week called Stand
*  Up for the Veterans. And this veterans community came out strong. They're like, what? They let you
*  go. You did so much for us. And I was like, I think it's a dying company. I don't think you
*  should dwell on all this. I mean, it's just a dying company. Now you have an opportunity. It's great
*  that you did all these good things. It's great. I don't mean to sound negative. I don't mean to
*  sound like I'm dwelling on it. I mean to say it was an amazing experience that was afforded to me.
*  I leveraged it. I took advantage of it. I'm really excited. Every day I wake up now, just ideas,
*  ideas, ideas, hammering phone calls. While you were doing the show, were you under any sort of
*  exclusive thing where you couldn't do anything on the internet? Right. You were? Yeah. I mean,
*  yeah, pretty much. We couldn't do a podcast. It was direct, no, that was direct competition.
*  Yeah, because do you remember when Anthony from Opie and Anthony, Anthony Kumiya had live from
*  the compound? Of course. He was doing this thing. Was that overlapping with Sirius?
*  Oh yeah. That's why I started my podcast. Because? 100%. Because he had a studio in his basement
*  where he's doing karaoke holding a machine gun and he was drunk. And I was like, what? You could
*  do that. Oh, I'm, I don't know, it's Anthony. I'm sure it was loaded. He's fucking crazy. I know. I
*  always had a great relationship with him though. I love that guy. Yeah. He's one of the funniest
*  guys. He liked me because we agreed on nothing, but you know, we've got along. But he's a genius. I
*  mean, he really is like, he's a pretty smart dude. The way he thinks and talks about things,
*  agree with him or don't agree with him. He's a very entertaining guy. I love doing radio with him.
*  And he had this basement set up where he had a green screen and he, yes, I remember that,
*  like a real production table and real production mics. And he spent all this money on like really
*  high end stuff. And he and I had a conversation. I'm like, what are you doing? He's like, I'm just
*  fucking around. I'm having fun. And I was like, wow. I remember thinking about it going, I need
*  to do something like that. And when me and my friend Red Band, when we started it, we just used
*  a laptop, but I remember thinking about what he had set up. So we were just doing like answering
*  questions and talking to people on, you know, like, I forget what it was. I guess it was Twitter 2009.
*  There'll be 10 years next month. It's awesome, man. But the inspiration was Obi and Anthony first
*  because their show was like just to hang. There was no structure to it. It was just having
*  conversations with people. But then when I saw Anthony have that set up in his basement, I was
*  like, oh, I could do something like this. And by the way, having a studio and I always thought that
*  was weird because he's all the way out in Long Island. I was like, is that going to work? How's
*  he going to get people out there? It was hard when he got fired. When he got fired, it was hard to
*  get people out there. Yeah, I'd imagine. But like him, I had a big, a vast network and technology
*  has gotten so much better in terms of getting guests. But I mean, I just, you got to wonder
*  how it's all going to work and how do you, if you're going to go live, there's just so many
*  things it seems to be thinking about how it's going to, what's going to work, like what works.
*  And- Well, do you know anybody that has a studio that you could maybe rent space in?
*  Yeah, yeah. They all want me to come do it. Yeah.
*  As long as you don't have to sign- But I was going to say the commute.
*  That's the commute. The fact that he has a studio. When I got a studio in my house,
*  Sears XM had me do it early, like six to nine AM slot for two years. And I was like-
*  You did it in your house? Yeah. I negotiated it. I was like,
*  you want me to do six to nine AM, you got to build me a nice studio. And they did.
*  And that was the richest I could ever be. Friend of mine's wife works at a college and walks five
*  minutes. That's her commute. I think a commute is almost a definition of your wealth. My body
*  turned to mush when I had to drive into the city an hour each way. Like everything about
*  a long commute made me feel weaker and less than. And the idea that you can have a studio in your
*  house or work from home, no matter what your job is, is a pretty sweet deal. Yeah. I think.
*  The commute can definitely grind on you, but it also is an opportunity to listen to books on tape.
*  For sure. You do whatever you can to be productive and be positive. Yeah.
*  And you can go two hours early and get an hour workout in before you get there.
*  I did that. There's a lot of good stuff
*  that can come from everything if you look at things correctly.
*  I agree. I share your outlook. I think that one of the things I've been listening to your podcast
*  for years, but like, you know, not every episode, not religiously, but since I lost my job, I was
*  like, let me, let me just start listening to Rogan. And what's really interesting about you,
*  in my opinion, is you're, you are the perfect example of somebody that everybody wants to put
*  into a box and you can't. It's what's wrong with everything in our country and our conversation.
*  Whatever people think that you are, they're everybody's that I tell that I'm doing this
*  show, they say they have an opinion of you. And then I listened to your show and here's the main
*  takeaway I get from your conversations is that you try to find the positivity in everything.
*  You're like the most positive guy, whatever you think about any issue or any idea, any opinion
*  you have, you're always being so positive and so helpful. And it has been honestly in this like
*  trying time. The other thing, my dad just had, I get fired, my dad had a heart attack.
*  And then a week later he's on blood thinners and he faints and bounces his face off a counter,
*  rips his eye open, goes into surgery. Now he can't see out of his eye and he's a ski instructor and
*  a cyclist and he's a race car driving instructor. And so I'm dealing with that, dealing with my job,
*  dealing with my family, listening to you and a handful of other people, just bringing as much
*  positivity to every scenario and situation. And that's my nature too. But it's some days,
*  doesn't matter who you are, you got to peel yourself off the ground. But you know, you can't,
*  I can't let my daughter see me sweat either. Yeah. Well, let them see me vulnerable, but they're not
*  going to see me sweat. Well, you don't have to sweat. You just have to grind. You just have to
*  hustle. Listen, you're a respected guy. You're a very good host of a show. You just have to
*  find a new venue. That's all it is. This is a good opportunity. You're healthy. You know,
*  you don't have anything wrong with you mentally and physically. I've always thought that mentally
*  that I was the happiest, healthiest guy. So it's, it's been a weird thing to not be able to
*  espouse it on people. And physically I'm back to, I'm back to training. Well, that's all,
*  that's good shit, man. And it's like, you just need to find a place. The thing about doing it
*  in the city. And I know you don't want to live in the city, but doing it in the city, you can get
*  guests in studio for sure. And that is so much better. It's so much better. Why do you think,
*  why do you think that? Cause the way we're talking right now, I agree, but you can't look on a camera
*  at somebody. There's a weird delay. Like when I was doing it with Snowden, there's a weird delay.
*  He wasn't even Russia or something like that. Yeah. But it doesn't matter. It was real time.
*  I mean, the, the actual lag was very minimal. What do we think the, like the lag was the Russians
*  FaceTime, right? But yeah, nothing, but even FaceTime, like when I'm on the road and I'm
*  FaceTime my family, it's weird. Like, what did you say? Huh? Okay. Right. You know, so there's a weird
*  I agree with you. I always preferred having people in the studio for sure. It's 50% better.
*  I feel like it might be more. I just made up that number. I feel like one cool opportunity is to
*  travel to different places and find the most interesting people and do gigs there. Do stand
*  up at night, spend a couple of days there interviewing the most interesting people in
*  whatever town that you're in. Oh, a hundred percent. And so that's kind of what I'm doing
*  about that is you're going to need someone to film if you want to do a video element of it.
*  Here's the thing about a video element. When you, when you talk about, some people don't listen to
*  this podcast. They don't watch it. Right. It's a lot of people. Right. When we first did it,
*  the video aspect of it was just an aside. We just, we, we did it with a webcam and then we
*  started putting it on iTunes and the iTunes was way more popular than the video, which was on
*  Ustream, which was, it's not, I mean, I don't even know if it exists anymore. Does Ustream exist?
*  It does. Now it's YouTube. Now it's YouTube. More, you have a, it's a built in platform. Right. So
*  there's millions and millions of people are on it just looking for shit to watch. Yeah, I definitely
*  want to do that. I definitely want to do that. But I'm thinking you're making obviously a lot
*  of good points about where it can be done and what, you know, the best ways to do it. And I've
*  been talking to so many smart people, obviously every day. I mean, my network is, is I'm lucky
*  to have this network of amazing people that are just so kind and generous to give me this advice
*  and honest too, you know, they tell you, don't be an idiot. Don't fucking off. Don't do that.
*  You know, it's a, as a comic, you think that's, that's the way that you think you want people to
*  be as brutal as they can be with criticism. You don't take it personally. You're just like, okay,
*  yep, I'll take that advice. I'll apply that and change that and tweet that. Yeah. Well,
*  there's nothing wrong with getting some constructive or even destructive criticism. Like you just,
*  you have to, you know, you have to have feedback. I mean, it does not always,
*  it's not always accurate or correct, but feedback is important. And that's one of the good things
*  about having like one of those talk shows where people call in, you know, that's one of the good
*  things. They get to give you some free. I love that. One of the bad things is they get to give
*  you some feedback. Fine. One of the bad things. Yeah. So it's always entertaining. Like if you,
*  if they shit on me, it was always very entertaining as a comic. Like I love heckles. I love anybody
*  yelling out. I live for it. Those are my favorite moments. What I like best is one-on-one
*  conversations with people. That's what I like. And that's what I like best to listen to as well.
*  Yeah. And you know, like when, you know, I listened to Stern and then when someone would call in,
*  I was like, why are they letting somebody call in? And some guy would yell out,
*  Baba Booey or talking about sniffing Robin's farts or something. They would just be born and
*  you don't want to be rude, but you have to be like, I can't, I'm doing a show here, man.
*  You're babbling. It's odd that he would just go to callers in the middle of a conversation,
*  with some lady who's an actress or something. It's just, I mean, but that's the chaos that he
*  sort of cultivated. Well, I think that that's what's the great, the great thing about this show
*  is the people that you get and the interaction, the conversation that you have. And I was trying
*  to do the same thing for, you know, at Sirius. Well, you were doing it. You just were doing it
*  in this walled garden with a bunch of assholes that are running the ship. And doing it for like
*  20, 25 minutes a piece. I'm always amazed that you and, you know, a handful of other people can
*  sustain like a two hour conversation. I love that. Anybody can, you can do it too. I think I can,
*  but that was never allowed to. There was always, those rules were always like, like, yeah, yeah.
*  You had hard breaks. I'm doing a podcast and the other day and I'm like, thanks for tuning in.
*  We're almost out of time. I'm like, you didn't tune in and we're not almost out of time. I can
*  do whatever the hell I want. Whatever I want. I could just keep talking. We can just keep talking.
*  Well, the worst thing is presidential debates. You're literally picking the person who's going
*  to run the free world and you have to stop because there's a Paul Malove commercial.
*  This is Paul Malove even a thing. I'm such an old man. Listen, I'm pulling out fucking
*  Paul Malove references. I think they're usually pharmaceutical companies at this point. Pfizer.
*  Yeah, but it's a boner pill. The irony of them talking about the pharmaceutical companies and
*  then they advertise during the break. But you're absolutely, yeah, it's not real. I mean,
*  the presidential debates are so not real and all those networks, I mean, my friends produce
*  those things and it's just like, it's a show. It's like, uh, when you get Bernie, like when I had
*  Bernie Sanders in here and you get to talk to him, like a real human, you go, oh, you're a human
*  being who cares about people and you have a different perspective on what these people are
*  saying. Your, your idea of democratic socialism is not this wacky socialism. Yeah. And it's not
*  this thing where people think you're just going to steal money from hardworking folks and give it
*  to lazy people. That's the worst case, you know, stereotype. It's none of that. No, it's not. We're
*  going to, we're not going to privatize shoe stores and very thoughtful person. And I was talking to
*  his, uh, cause as I told you, I'm thinking very seriously now about also running for Congress.
*  And, uh, I was talking to his, I think deputy chief of staff, a guy named Ari Rabenhoff, great
*  guy. And I was, I was telling him, I was doing your show. And he told me that after Bernie Sanders
*  did your show, he, everybody was recognizing him. I'm like, really? Like he reached a whole
*  different demographic talking to you than he ever had before. Cause he's mostly on those cable news
*  shows. He's mostly on terrestrial or radio. But when you do these, I don't know, what do you even
*  call this now? Non-traditional alternative media might as well be mainstream. But the point is when
*  you have a long conversation with Bernie Sanders and he's not like up there, you know, all that
*  shit is, is annoying. You've heard it before. He sits down and has a real conversation with you.
*  And everybody's like, oh man, that guy's making a lot of good points. Yeah. Well, you got to think
*  of like, what is annoying to people. And one of the things that's annoying to people is that
*  fucking rapid fire. Not healthcare and Medicare and education. And like, like people like, Hey,
*  fuck face. I just got off work. Okay. Why are you yelling at me? He wants to take my money. Fuck him.
*  And you just press stop. Right. And that's, you have to be able to change your cadence, your diction
*  and your commentary. And you have to be able to get questions that are more thoughtful. That's the
*  thing about all these cable news interviewers and network. Like they always want to get some headline.
*  And that's the other thing, you know, about corporate media too. They want you. So I've been in
*  that belly of that beast, Joe, for the last 15 years, corporate, you know, political media.
*  And it's so manufactured. I could tell you so many stories. They call you up and they say,
*  you know, how do you feel about anything? We want to make sure that you're completely the opposite
*  of the other panelists. And so you have a really robust argument. And it's like, not everything is
*  binary. Most things aren't. There's a ton of nuance, a ton of gradation. We don't have to hate each
*  other. That that that's how they get ratings. That's how they sell advertising. I blame most
*  of the problems in our country on corporate media, terrestrial radio, just doing that format all day.
*  It works really well for conservatives, not as well for liberals, but it still works. And
*  they sell ads and a few people make a lot of money, but the country suffers. The idea that we're
*  so divided is such bullshit. I talked to people from all over the country, travel all over the
*  place. I understand the issues really intimately and I don't care what you think about anything.
*  There's something you have to offer me. There's something you have to make my life to enrich me.
*  I don't care what you believe on abortion or guns or certain things, because if you could teach me
*  how to fix this engine, I'm into it. I want to learn how to, if you can teach me how to exercise
*  better, but you don't like our trade policies, I don't give a shit what you think about our trade
*  policies. Let's just not even talk about it. Let's talk about the things. And it's trying to get to
*  the root of somebody's soul is what we should all be trying to do.
*  Every day, we should try to, what happened to you that made you think this way? What is the
*  experience? What is your journey? To me, that's the fascinating shit about human beings.
*  Pete Slauson Well, one of the things about something like cable talk shows or, you know,
*  news shows or any of these political arenas is that there's a lack of real interaction
*  with the general public in terms of like real conversations with people. You have a host who's
*  wearing makeup, who's got spotlights on him and there's a microphone in front of him and he's
*  talking to his other people and his camera's pointed at them and no one really feels like this
*  is not a normal way of people talking. And rarely you see someone sit down and they like, every now
*  and then they have those shows where like it's a one on one, like Trump will sit across from
*  fucking, what's his name? What's that dude's name?
*  Jared Polin Which network?
*  Pete Slauson It's a Fox guy.
*  Jared Polin Hannity?
*  Pete Slauson No, Dobbs.
*  Pete Slauson Dobbs, that guy.
*  Jared Polin Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson Who's hilarious. It's funny watching the two of them together.
*  Jared Polin I mean, Dobbs has lost his mind.
*  Pete Slauson He's just kicking that ass and going like just
*  mwah! mwah! mwah!
*  Jared Polin He is digging way in. But it works. I used to be on with that guy,
*  the most pleasant guy in the world, but what he's doing, he is, it's so much,
*  it's a North Korean situation. Lou Dobbs, it's like state media, every night it doesn't matter,
*  you know, he shall not be questioned kind of guy, worship the president. It's like,
*  what are you doing? That's not even, but that's the, I once got into this long drawn out argument
*  with Chris Cuomo, who I like a lot, but I was talking to him about, you know, listen man,
*  the difference between TV and radio, it's simple. And radio, you can have a long form,
*  you can have a 20 minute to two hour conversation and it's real and you get a lot done. On TV,
*  you can have a five minute conversation. I go, there's so many guests that you have on your show,
*  that I have on my show, they're way more, they have the ability to be thoughtful and nuanced
*  and make points. They can't do that on cable and now, you know, he's doing a radio show,
*  so good for him.
*  Pete Slauson Well, that's what I was getting at is that the separation between the people
*  and then the just unnatural environment that they're in, no one can relate to it.
*  What they can relate to is two people just talking to each other.
*  They can't relate to it, Joe, but they also think because they're conditioned to that if
*  it's on a network, this person must be an authority and must be intelligent. But I'm here to tell
*  everybody, I was talking about credit default swaps in the financial industry. I have an
*  associate's degree and came up in the New York City comedy clubs. Like, I really didn't have
*  any business talking about that. But the thing is, I could sound really smart for three and a half
*  minutes on anything. Give me a minute five, I can't go that deep on certain issues and I
*  shouldn't be an authority on it. But just because I'm on cable news with a jacket and a shirt
*  and I'm this guy, people are like, oh, okay, well, I'll believe this guy. Now, it's not real.
*  Pete Slauson No, it's a dying medium too. I don't think 20, 30 years from now,
*  that's going to exist in the same form.
*  Jared Larkin Shorter than that.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah. And then also the interjection of commercials every seven minutes. The things
*  that they're doing on debates is the same thing they're doing on these other cable talk shows
*  where they're trying to encapsulate these things into these very quick five-minute sound bites and…
*  Jared Larkin Have you ever heard of Intelligence Squared debates?
*  Pete Slauson Yes.
*  Jared Larkin My friend John Donovan is the moderator. He should be moderating the
*  presidential debates. He's the greatest guy. They have these really well-informed panelists
*  that have emotion and they do like two hours. And you can come in thinking so often one idea
*  about the issue and you leave thinking something completely different because you have these very
*  smart people debating with an excellent moderator who doesn't let any bullshit and you really learn
*  a lot. No commercial breaks and you can, you know, listen to it.
*  Pete Slauson Well, even three people is too many people.
*  Jared Larkin Probably.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, it is. It's like if you want to get to know someone, it's a one-on-one because
*  even with three people, there's moments where you have something to say and then someone
*  interjects something else and then you lose your point and then you don't express it. And then the
*  other person's talking and you don't know when to talk and then you find yourself being a little
*  bit more assertive in the way you're talking because you're trying to get your point across.
*  Jared Larkin You're nailing it.
*  Pete Slauson You feel like I'm not talking enough. And then if there's four people,
*  you're fucked. Like the most ridiculous thing they ever do is when they have those seven
*  people panels and one person just starts fucking chiming in and screaming out loud and they talk
*  over people and- Jared Larkin
*  But they're also talking about, because I had one foot in cable news for a long time, still do,
*  I mean, I still go on. And then I had my long form radio show where I would talk to policy
*  experts. It was very, like right now when they're talking about the polls for the presidential race,
*  is anybody that's paying attention to that is wasting their time. It's a complete waste of
*  time to talk about who's leading in what poll a year away. It's a year away. You can have a
*  temperature attack, you can have the economy crack. It's not a game.
*  Pete Slauson Okay, but it is a game. If you're watching
*  basketball, do you not pay attention to the first minute of the game? Because it doesn't really
*  matter. What's really important is how many points are scored over the four quarters. Is
*  there four quarters? Jared Larkin
*  Of a basketball game, I think there might be two have, college or pro.
*  Pete Slauson But the point is, this is a weird game going on.
*  Like Kamala Harris was ahead, now she's fucked. Like this is fun. It's fun for people. This is
*  half of what it is. I know it's serious. I know it's significant. I know there's grave consequences
*  to picking the wrong leader. But this is a game. Jared Larkin
*  Right, but it's a bullshit game because as you said earlier, the reason why Kamala Harris or
*  anybody else takes a step backwards is because one stupid moment. And how will we possibly picking
*  somebody on one? Pete Slauson
*  Not necessarily. With Kamala Harris, there was a bunch of different issues.
*  Jared Larkin Sure. Yeah. But often, I mean, Howard Dean.
*  Pete Slauson Howard Dean.
*  Jared Larkin Come on! Have you listened to that? It never gets old.
*  Pete Slauson It never gets old.
*  Jared Larkin Never ever! But it is weird that this day and age,
*  that that crashed him. Given everything that these other candidates have done and said.
*  Yeah, but honestly, there's probably something else. It's how he responded to that as well.
*  It's like he showed a lack of humility or understanding of what it was. Like, yeah,
*  I sounded stupid. That's not what's important, ladies and gentlemen. Yeah, I screamed out. Like,
*  when you got a microphone on me and I get excited, I go, yeah!
*  Jared Larkin I mean, you can also talk just about the ego
*  of the people who are running for these offices. And they don't seem to have an understanding
*  of the idea of ego and what it means and how they should try to separate from it while using it.
*  Like, once you get into politics, much less entertainment, and you get really well known,
*  and fame, you start believing things about yourself that aren't even remotely true.
*  Pete Slauson There's certainly some of that, right?
*  Jared Larkin Huh?
*  Pete Slauson There's certainly some of that.
*  Jared Larkin A lot, I feel like they all have that.
*  Pete Slauson There's also, you're protecting yourself, right?
*  You have an image, you're protecting yourself.
*  Jared Larkin Yeah, it's a delicate dance that I
*  am completely turned off by. I mean, that's why it's hard to think about, like, I was seriously
*  considering running for Congress. Because I –
*  Pete Slauson You were or are?
*  Jared Larkin It's hard right now because I learned some crazy shit.
*  Pete Slauson What'd you learn?
*  Jared Larkin Dun dun dun.
*  Jared Larkin First of all –
*  Pete Slauson Drum roll, please.
*  Jared Larkin The corruption, I live in New York State.
*  Pete Slauson Wait a minute, New York State's not corrupt.
*  Jared Larkin The New York State –
*  Pete Slauson Stop the fucking, stop this show.
*  Jared Larkin All of, you know, politics, there's levels of corruption.
*  Pete Slauson What?
*  Jared Larkin But in the New York State Democratic Party,
*  there's always been all kinds of issues. So, I met with a whole bunch of really smart people
*  about running for New York 17, which is the district that I live in. Like, the day after I
*  lost my gig at Sirius, the woman had been representing that district for 33 years,
*  announced that she was retiring. And I was like, well, I got nothing going on. And I've always
*  thought about running for office. And let me, you know, seriously consider it. I reached out to a
*  whole bunch of people from all different walks of life, congressmen that were in office, that had
*  been out of office, campaign coordinators. I talked to Chris Cuomo, I talked to a whole bunch
*  of people. But there's, one person told me that if you want to, if you want to win, regardless of
*  your party affiliation, you have to, there's a certain special interest group that you had to
*  promise you wouldn't interfere with and make sure they got an envelope of cash. And I'm like, well,
*  I'm not doing that. I will tell everybody and everywhere I go about that. What is it? I can't
*  because I don't have a second source. So I wouldn't say it, but I'm trying to get one to prove that
*  it's true. What does it rhyme with? The special interest group. Yes. Won't do it because everybody
*  will know. Everybody will know. And it's dangerous. But the point is, the point is, what's the
*  opposite of that special interest group? Maybe the private sector. Right. But what would be like,
*  what would be like, what would be the thing that they're opposed to? What would it be that they're opposed to?
*  You interfering with, you interfering with the way that they run their show. Right, right, right. But I'm saying
*  like, what group that we know would be opposed to them? Well, I could tell you it could be a
*  religious group, a private sector, a union or a company, you know, a corporate interest. It could
*  be any one of those. ACLU? The point is that all of those types of organizations pressure
*  that you have to, I'm an honest guy. I can't lie. I've never said anything into a microphone that
*  I don't believe. And that's been both to my detriment and to my benefit, I think. I'm authentic.
*  So when I was talking about running for office, my brother's like, you can't lie. You can't be
*  dishonest to people. How are you going to do that? You'll have to sell out at least a little bit.
*  That was the other thing. And then I realized, I'm not sure that this district or, you know,
*  the country is ready for someone like me. I'm a comic. I've said a billion things on TV,
*  into a microphone and on stage, and we're in a humorless country right now, number one. I smoke pot.
*  Like, are they ready for, for the, are we there yet? I don't think we're humorless. I disagree. I
*  think there's a lot of criticism going on, but that's because there's a lot of policies.
*  Do you think, I agree with you overall, but I mean for politicians, for me to run for office
*  and you see some standup that I did or something, and then my opponent's playing that out of context.
*  Dude, I got five words for you. Grab them by the pussy. That guy's the president.
*  I think he is an aberration. I do. I don't think there's anything else that can get away
*  with that kind of stuff. I think you're probably right. He's definitely an aberration, but I just
*  Al Franken won as a senator as a comedian, but he was a writer. Like there wasn't a ton,
*  and he got in trouble when there was a photo of him. I've said, well, it's more than a photo.
*  There was actually all the allegations, but the, but the photo, you know, perception,
*  politics is perception and, and whatever people see, it's different than what they hear and what
*  they believe. And so that's the point. That photo was harmless, but it looked bad,
*  just like any joke I've said or anything that I've said out of context. So I just feel like,
*  and then I thought that, you know, I, they could destroy me and any future earning potential
*  that I could have. I just, the second episode of my podcast, I interviewed Tim Ryan, you know,
*  he is, he was running for president because I was asking him, what does it take?
*  And it's, first of all, you gotta run, you gotta raise a million dollars from people and individuals
*  you don't like. You don't want to be affiliated with, but you have to, you gotta make them
*  promises that the whole system is so filled and corrupted with money in almost every district in
*  every state, regardless of the office. And how do you, how does a person, I'm a fairly affluent
*  guy, I'm a white straight guy, whatever, but I couldn't, I don't know how I can afford to apply
*  for a job for a year and pay my mortgage. So I want to do it if it looks feasible. And if I don't
*  have to take care of my family, my parents, not to mention, you know, pay my bills, but it's,
*  you have to be an independently wealthy person, which sucks because it makes it much harder for
*  regular people, there's plenty of exceptions, to run for office.
*  Pete Slauson Now, when you say that you had to give them
*  an envelope and that you had to, what did you have to do? Did you have to support them?
*  Jared Larkin Through intermediaries, you have to say, basically,
*  you have to basically say, I'm not gonna interfere with your business, we'll just look the other way.
*  You had to say that.
*  Pete Slauson That's what I'm told. That was what I was told by a guy.
*  Jared Larkin How are you told this? Are you told this like,
*  hey, if you ever want to be congressman, you have to do this?
*  Pete Slauson You don't have to, but if you don't want to win,
*  you're far more likely to win if you pay off these.
*  Jared Larkin Far more likely.
*  Pete Slauson It's not impossible, but they'll try to destroy you if you don't.
*  Jared Larkin Really?
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, and I can't, it's like, Joe –
*  Jared Larkin They'll just go after you.
*  Pete Slauson You can destroy, if it's just me –
*  Jared Larkin Why can't you say who this is?
*  Because this seems like it's very important.
*  Pete Slauson Only because I don't know if it's positively true.
*  Jared Larkin Oh, okay.
*  Pete Slauson I need another source. I try to act like a journalist.
*  Jared Larkin And someone who's the intermediary, like, what kind of person is this?
*  Pete Slauson He managed campaigns in that district. He knows everything about the politics of and
*  special interest in that district.
*  Jared Larkin So, it could potentially be that he's hoeing you out.
*  Pete Slauson Absolutely, which is why I won't tell you.
*  Jared Larkin Yeah, because he's saying that so that he's like sort of playing both sides.
*  Pete Slauson No, he wanted me to run and he wants –
*  Jared Larkin Sure, I'm sure he did, but he might also want to
*  maintain his relationship with what our group this is. So, he says, hey, I've got an assurance.
*  Pete Slauson Knowing this guy, I don't think he's affiliated with that group, but it's possible.
*  And so, I try to, you know, have journalistic ethics before I would say something. I'll tell
*  you off the mic. But I wouldn't say without having a second source, like, that's what's
*  irresponsible about so much of our media. Like, when Trump or anybody says fake news, it's like,
*  listen, it's not. You can't – you have to have two sources. You go to your editor with those two
*  sources and then you can print it. You can't make them up. If you make up a source, you're like
*  Mancia. That's it. You're done. You can't – that's like stealing a joke. You can't make up a
*  source. You'll never work again. It would be a stupid thing to do.
*  Pete Slauson Well, I think it's even worse when you make up a joke. I mean, if you make up a
*  source, I mean, you literally can't work. Mancia is still working.
*  Jared Larkin Fair enough.
*  Pete Slauson People do work after they steal jokes.
*  Jared Larkin Journalism and comedians are a lot different.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, it's the worst. If someone finds out you're making up a source.
*  Jared Larkin Yeah, nobody does it. In the few instances where someone did make up a source
*  or even plagiarize, which are the two worst things you can do as a journalist, they never work again.
*  Or they don't work for a very long time. You know, Johann Hari, he's been on your show,
*  he's been on my show. He was accused of some, like, I think it was plagiarism.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Jared Larkin And it took him a really long time to win his integrity back.
*  Pete Slauson I didn't find that out actually until after he'd been on the show the second time.
*  Jared Larkin Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson But like, what was –
*  Jared Larkin Great guy.
*  Pete Slauson He's a great guy, but what was he accused of?
*  Jared Larkin I don't remember. It was, I feel like it might have been plagiarism though.
*  And that kind of thing, the point is, that kind of thing ruins you. And so, I wouldn't come here
*  and do that even though I don't, I wouldn't call myself a journalist, but I would want,
*  because of what you're saying, because you're smart, I'm very skeptical too of people
*  and their sorts of what their interests are. And a lot of people really want me to run for
*  Congress for a lot of different reasons, but mainly because they think I can tap my network
*  of wealthy people and, you know, they can make money.
*  Pete Slauson Love Trump or hate Trump, that is precisely what he was talking about
*  when he said drain the swamp. Now, this is the swamp, this sort of convoluted world of influence.
*  Jared Larkin Well, yes and no, the swamp.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, but it's also money and all the other things that he didn't drain,
*  and he actually brought in people that were –
*  Jared Larkin He made the swamp.
*  Pete Slauson Swampier.
*  Jared Larkin It's filled with malaria and crocodiles. Like, I always, we don't even define
*  things unfortunately, we don't have the same baseline unfortunately in this country of what
*  words mean, but I've always thought what that meant was government corruption, that the private
*  sector is influencing government and the way that they obviously do it, the system that we have is,
*  you have to get money from wealthy people and wealthy interests and then you have to advocate
*  for them. Whatever the interest is, you have to or they won't give you more money.
*  And so, that's what's beautiful about Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders,
*  they are not allowing any donations from any super PACs, from any wealthy individuals,
*  it's grassroots and that's –
*  Pete Slauson I think Tulsi's doing that as well.
*  Jared Larkin Yeah, a handful of them are. The whole Democratic Party mostly committed to it.
*  I don't think Biden's doing it. But –
*  Pete Slauson If Biden was doing it, I don't think he remembers.
*  Jared Larkin I totally agree with that by the way.
*  Pete Slauson Dude's out.
*  Jared Larkin Well, listen, I don't think you should be running for president if you're 75.
*  Pete Slauson Well, some –
*  Jared Larkin I think the same about Trump and Bernie and Biden. All three of them are old.
*  My dad –
*  Pete Slauson Some people are 75 and they're very lucid.
*  Jared Larkin My dad is in the best shape of any man I know. Dude just had a heart attack.
*  Bernie Sanders just had a heart attack. Like, when you get older, especially as a man,
*  the ship breaks down. Yeah, but it's like who has the energy? Plus, I just think younger people
*  like just have more of an actual interest and understanding of what's happening. That's why
*  Andrew Yang is so attractive.
*  Pete Slauson Yes. Yeah, no, I agree with that. But I think that there's – I mean,
*  it depends entirely on the individual. There's 75-year-olds that are healthy and there's 75-year-olds
*  that are not.
*  Jared Larkin I disagree. Because you could be the healthiest 75-year-old in the world,
*  did everything right, and then shit can just shut down because you're 75. Your body is just old.
*  Pete Slauson It's possible, but –
*  Jared Larkin It's far more – the actuary,
*  you know, possibilities are just far higher. I don't think.
*  Pete Slauson But you're balancing things out, right? You also have wisdom and experience –
*  Jared Larkin Sure. So, go consult a younger person.
*  Pete Slauson Maybe.
*  Jared Larkin I mean, Bernie Sanders is one of my heroes, but I want him to just, you know,
*  endorse Elizabeth Warren and get it over with.
*  Pete Slauson Well, first of all, being a president is a ridiculous proposition,
*  period. And it's an antiquated idea to have one alpha that runs this whole fucking show.
*  Jared Larkin Absolutely. Yes.
*  Pete Slauson It's a great idea when there's 50 people in a trial.
*  Jared Larkin Yes, I'm a chief, but not a president of 330 million people that is an
*  outsized influence and a bully pulpit. And then, has this – we have this reverence for them,
*  and this defense of them, or this attacking of their every move, their every character.
*  Pete Slauson Yes.
*  Jared Larkin And it's just such an easy thing to dunk on them,
*  and it's just tiresome to me. I agree with you.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah. It's unhealthy for the country, too. It's unhealthy for all of us.
*  Jared Larkin It's unhealthy for our souls every single day, especially like – the thing that you
*  miss about pre-Trump, whoever it was, Republican or Democrat, like, remember when you used to have
*  weekends? Like, you could relax on the weekends. No politics.
*  Pete Slauson Well, that's internet, though.
*  Jared Larkin You're right. There's a lot of that.
*  Pete Slauson Have you seen Trump's religious advisor?
*  Jared Larkin Yes.
*  Pete Slauson How wonderful is that?
*  Jared Larkin She, the woman who says, if you don't support Trump, you're going against God.
*  Pete Slauson Yes. Yes. Can we play any of that?
*  Jared Larkin I don't think so. At least, that video,
*  I don't think we can play because someone had that together.
*  Too bad.
*  Pete Slauson I can do it, I think. If you don't support President Trump,
*  then you are going against God! And it's like –
*  Jared Larkin I'm not going against God.
*  Pete Slauson Those people are so effective as like, I think comics can really relate to them.
*  They're so good at performing. And so conventional.
*  Jared Larkin It's Kinnison.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah. If you –
*  Jared Larkin Kinnison was one of those.
*  Pete Slauson Right, right.
*  Jared Larkin He was a preacher.
*  Right. He's one of the, yeah, who turned into a comic. He had that skill set. Trump is the same
*  way. The way he stocks the stage and works the audience. I mean, it's very, very effective. But
*  it's also, to say that if you don't support a certain politician, like, to me, that stuff is so,
*  it's very boring. Come on, this binary bullshit.
*  Pete Slauson But she's a horseshit artist no matter what.
*  I mean, that's what she does. She's trying to get low frequency people. She catches these
*  nine volt brains. Paula White, Donald Trump's new advisor, ratchets of rhetoric denounces demonic
*  networks opposing president's calling. She's wonderful. I bet that lady does coke and I bet
*  she likes it right in the booty. Jared Larkin
*  I think that every time you see – Pete Slauson
*  I bet she parties. Jared Larkin
*  Every time you see one of these people, I just have a knee-jerk reaction. When I see a Catholic
*  priest, I'm like, mm-hmm. When I see one of these people, I'm like, they're completely contradicting.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, 100%.
*  Jared Larkin You know, these gay conversion people that
*  have come out and been like – Pete Slauson
*  Pray the gay away. Yeah. They're banging guys.
*  Jared Larkin Oh, all the time.
*  Pete Slauson All the time. You remember Ted Haggard?
*  Jared Larkin Do I? I massaged him.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, yeah. I'll bet you did.
*  Jared Larkin Well-paid.
*  Pete Slauson With meth or no?
*  Jared Larkin Smooth skin. Yeah, of course. I would never
*  massage Ted Haggard without meth. Really? Pete Slauson
*  Blocked me on Twitter. Yeah. He said –
*  Jared Larkin That's a quote in accolade.
*  Pete Slauson See, he said – I forget what he said.
*  Jared Larkin He said something like, you know, after Sunday
*  service, you know, what should we do? And I said, how about meth and blowjobs? And that was it. Boom.
*  Pete Slauson That's actually what they do.
*  Jared Larkin That is what –
*  Pete Slauson It's a joke, but it's also probably what –
*  Jared Larkin He was in trouble for.
*  Pete Slauson He seemed like such a nice guy too. But it's so sad too.
*  Jared Larkin Not really though. Did you ever see the thing
*  with him and Dawkins when he got really nasty with Dawkins?
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, well. Yeah.
*  Jared Larkin Yeah. That was before he actually got in trouble too.
*  That was when he was running –
*  Pete Slauson That was when he was still –
*  Jared Larkin The whole arena filled with –
*  Pete Slauson Back to ego.
*  Jared Larkin Yeah.
*  When you have – when you think so much of you and your ideas and you come up in that case,
*  Ted Haggard versus Richard Dawkins is like Mike Tyson versus –
*  Pete Slauson A baby.
*  Jared Larkin Something lower. Something much lower. A fetus.
*  Pete Slauson Right.
*  Jared Larkin And there's no match and so you're going to lose your shit.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Jared Larkin I love those debates on –
*  Pete Slauson Super frustrated. But it's also – he's frustrated that,
*  you know, Dawkins had – Dawkins has an arrogance about him, you know, this –
*  Jared Larkin Yeah, scientists tend to –
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, but he does, specifically.
*  Jared Larkin Well, he's British.
*  Pete Slauson Well, I had him in here recently when he was talking about life after death,
*  that he thinks the lights just go out. And I'm like, well, maybe. But we don't know.
*  Jared Larkin What do you think?
*  Pete Slauson We don't know. I don't think. I don't have any
*  experience with what happens when you die. I really have no idea. It would be very interesting if
*  there was some sort of dimensional travel thing that happens to the spirit or the soul or whatever
*  this concept of consciousness is.
*  Jared Larkin How much have – do you think about your mortality?
*  Pete Slauson Sure.
*  Jared Larkin On a regular?
*  Pete Slauson I try not to. It doesn't do any good.
*  Jared Larkin Right. But when it comes in, what do you do?
*  Pete Slauson You know, I try to be nice to the people I know.
*  Try to be kind to the people that I care about.
*  Jared Larkin That's an interesting answer when I said,
*  when you think about your own death, what do you do? I just try to be a good person. I love that.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah. There's nothing you can do.
*  Pete Slauson Right.
*  Pete Slauson While I'm here, I want as little bad feelings as possible. It's impossible to
*  have no bad feelings. So, whatever I can do to mitigate that, I try.
*  Jared Larkin How have you worked on your anger and had that dissipate? Like, what's the best thing?
*  Pete Slauson Exercise.
*  Jared Larkin For you?
*  Pete Slauson Exercise is the big one. Yeah, because I think a lot of my anger is just
*  caveman genetics. And then a fucked up childhood too. So, growing up in a violent household
*  and being around a lot of violence. Like, I also had to deal with, I grew up essentially
*  all throughout high school until I was 22 fighting. So, I was always involved in violence.
*  Jared Larkin As an outlet for your emotions.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah. Well, it was also, it developed my human potential. It was martial arts,
*  it was competition. But it's also, there's a downside of that, that I grew up like being
*  praised for explosive violence.
*  Jared Larkin That's wrong.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah. I mean, it was in competition, it was agreed upon. I was doing it with other
*  trained killers. But it's still, that's a weird thing to get past.
*  Jared Larkin Yeah, I have an example of, I mean, I'm sure you have a billion of them,
*  I didn't mean to cut you off. But when my daughter was like three years old, just
*  we're visiting family and people I don't really know, my wife's family. And his five-year-old
*  son goes over, my daughter's just looking up at the TV, this little three-year-old girl.
*  And he comes over and he just clocks her, knocks her over. And we're all like, oh my God, what?
*  And the dad comes over and just starts beating the shit out of his five-year-old.
*  And I just start screaming, I'm like, that's why he did it! That's why he did it! You learn
*  what you live. You know, and children learn what they live. And so, when you're, so when you're,
*  but you're saying when you train, when you exercise, are there feelings, are there emotions
*  coming out? Or is it energy that you're just expending?
*  Energy.
*  You're not thinking about when you're…
*  No, I'm not like angry at my child or anything when I'm hitting the bag. No, I'm just exercising.
*  I also, when I'm running or doing yoga or anything I'm doing that's strenuous.
*  I just had this conversation with Ben Westoff, who's on here before you.
*  And the way I described it is I think that a human body has a certain amount of physical
*  requirements. I think there's, your body's a system and this system is designed through nature
*  natural selection and hundreds of thousands of years of being human beings to have issues that
*  come up and to be physically prepared to deal with those issues. Whether it's a neighboring tribe
*  invades you or an animal's trying to attack you or you're just trying to hunt and gather food.
*  All those things are built into our system and it takes tens of thousands of years for that DNA
*  to shift and change and become something different. So we have a certain amount of physical
*  requirements that we're just born with. And it's different with every person. Some people have less,
*  some people have more. I tend to be on the high side and I'm a different person when I exercise.
*  I'm a different person when I get time to sleep correctly and eat correctly and exercise. I'm
*  different and I like that person better. That's a nicer person. I like that guy better. So I try to
*  be that guy as much as I can, but I have a million different people living inside my brain all the
*  time bouncing around fighting for dominance. Really? Yeah. It's like there's a director that
*  try to keep them all in order, which is like the consciousness. Is that a struggle?
*  Everybody has it. There's always things like you're a better person when you're well rested,
*  life is going well. For sure. You had great interactions with your family,
*  great interaction with your friends, and then you run into someone on the street versus you
*  just got fired from your job. You walked in and your wife's sucking the plumber off. You have
*  all these things go wrong. All that happened to me just now, by the way. All those things can happen.
*  I lose my job, I go home, there's my wife with the plumber. You are a different person,
*  depending upon what you encounter in your life. I completely agree with that, but it's a practice.
*  I like that word. And you have to practice it every day. And you have to find out-
*  Yeah, you ain't fixing it. You're not going to fix it.
*  Right. You can't stop it. You're not just going to get better.
*  You're just going to get better at forming the good habits.
*  What about therapy? I don't do that.
*  Never did? No, but I do get in an isolation tank. I've done a lot of psychedelics.
*  I was going to ask you about that. I'm thinking about trying that.
*  You should. I feel like that's been a big-
*  Want to do it right now? ... part of your life.
*  What do you want to do? Yeah, right now.
*  Are you going to do some mushrooms? No.
*  Have you ever done mushrooms? No, but I can't.
*  No? You can't?
*  I mean, I would like to. If I do it, I want to do it with you, for sure.
*  Okay. But I got a long night ahead of me, I think.
*  Oh, what are you doing tonight? I have a family.
*  Oh. That was your boy. I haven't seen
*  a long time that they're just begging me to. Yeah, you want to be tripping balls.
*  I probably don't want to. Oh, microdose.
*  Microdose is not a bad way to get through a day.
*  Can you drive with it? Oh, I wouldn't recommend it.
*  Yeah. And I don't know where I am. I got a rental car.
*  Yeah. I really want to do it. I'm ready for it, but I feel like I need-
*  You've done nothing? Huh?
*  You've done nothing? No, I mean weed every day.
*  Yeah. That's been my saving grace.
*  Yeah. You got any of those Kevin Smiths? No, I don't want to smoke-
*  We can smoke a little weed. ... on the show because I feel like
*  it makes me verbose. Well, you're already verbose.
*  You talk for a living. There's something wrong with that.
*  But it makes me even worse. And I don't want to-
*  This one. What happened to this one? It got crusty and broken.
*  Don't worry about it. We can do it. Or towards the end. Whatever.
*  I love- Yeah, but for me, that- I didn't- My brother was in rehab when I was 16.
*  He was 18. I love that you're scanning the room.
*  Where's those Kevin Smith joints we have on the table?
*  Door over there. Oh, okay.
*  What's that right there? That little tube right there, Jamie?
*  That's hilarious. There's just stuff everywhere. What's that?
*  Oh, there's one. What is this?
*  This ashtray filled with treasures?
*  Mm-hmm. But I didn't touch any alcohol or drugs until I was like 25.
*  My brother was in rehab. We had to do an intervention. It was nuts.
*  And I was like, I knew I wanted to be a comic. And I thought that if I did anything,
*  it would affect me. It would distract me. Make you a loser.
*  No, no. It would just make me pursue that and not my dreams.
*  This is the other thing. If I take a hit off this and I still want to run for Congress,
*  it shouldn't matter. This is how I deal.
*  Well, it's legal. It's no different than having a drink.
*  Yeah, of course. It's preposterous to judge, but people do.
*  Yeah, but I think the generation that's coming up will judge less. The generation after them
*  will judge less. And it's just we're living with the echoes of reefer madness, right? We're living
*  with Harry Anselinger and William Randolph's first work in the 1930s.
*  Look them up, everybody. Look them up. Yeah, no doubt. But
*  I think that you say they're the echoes, and I think they're pretty loud. Certainly pretty
*  loud in certain parts of the country. Yeah.
*  And it's hard to measure. Well, the good thing about
*  being a congressman is you're representing a district, right?
*  One of the guys is I've become really good friends with him. He was a Republican congressman.
*  His name is Trey Radel. And he's the guy who got from Florida.
*  Trey Radel. I like it.
*  He got kicked out of Congress for buying cocaine from a Fed. You remember that?
*  No, I don't.
*  It was like three years ago.
*  I don't pay that much attention to politics. I think politics is like baseball. Some people
*  just watch the World Series, and some people watch college and look at fucking first round draft picks.
*  I'm addicted to it.
*  Yeah.
*  I was. That's another nice thing, and not having to be live every day and not having to know
*  every single step of everything going on, because you realize that you're a very small minority of people.
*  When you found out that thing, when you were told that thing by that guy...
*  Let me just make sure this doesn't go to waste, Jimmy.
*  Well, there's plenty of it. When you were told that thing about the guy who was the congressman
*  job, that you were going to have to play ball, was that... Did you feel like...
*  Let down?
*  Almost like, okay, I've been promoting a rigged game.
*  No, I know how well... I know intimately how rigged the game is. It's just that you don't always know
*  where and who the players are. I mean, I've done enough.
*  Right, but isn't it... You're an honest person. You're not a bullshit artist.
*  I hope everybody thinks that.
*  I do. If you're a part of a bullshit system, it's almost like you can't. To be who you are,
*  can't be a congressperson.
*  You just nailed it.
*  If the system...
*  What you just said almost made me want to cry.
*  Don't cry.
*  Because, well, I get very emotional when someone pings the truth. That's what happens to me.
*  I'm like, Jesus, I can't believe he just said that. My brother, who's my moral compass,
*  my older brother, is just radical, ridiculous, radically different person. He's like,
*  said just what you said right before I came over here. Because the problem with you running
*  is that, do you really buy into this corrupt system?
*  And I think because I'm such an optimist and such a positive thinking person,
*  I've convinced myself, and that I do know a lot of people in congress,
*  know them personally and intimately, and I know a lot of people that work in government that I
*  really admire. But the system... It's not the people as much as the system, but I also
*  think that the way... I don't want to talk about it in a way that exonerates the public.
*  Right.
*  Like, we have to not be apathetic. That's what my show has always been about. It was
*  always a confusing title, Stand Up, because I'm a comic, but it meant stand up for something.
*  It meant care about something.
*  You didn't mean it initially.
*  We don't have to be a full-time activist, but don't be apathetic. The United States of
*  Apathy, we can't sit here and blame the systems that we are complicit in. Watch these...
*  You watch this... Every weekend in Hong Kong, every weekend, they stand up for their democracy.
*  They've been doing it for months.
*  Right. That's the biggest story. That'll be the biggest story of 2019, and maybe the decade,
*  because they are fighting off China. It's unbelievable. Meanwhile,
*  I just feel like we're just so comfortable.
*  And Hong Kong used to be a part of Great Britain, right?
*  Yeah.
*  And until like what?
*  Ninety something, when they had to give it back after like it was a 100-year agreement
*  or something like that.
*  Which is so crazy.
*  But China's deal was China's like, listen, we're not going to bother you. You could keep
*  doing what you're doing. And then they started bothering them. And they said, no, we're going
*  to... Your art now behaves, because they have so much more power and leverage. And then human
*  beings stood up. Now they're doing it in Chile, and now they're doing it in Iraq. People are
*  protesting, and they're getting shot. The greatest thing that I was ever a part of
*  in media was probably, well, there was a lot of good things, but CNN and SiriusXM's coverage
*  of the Egyptian revolution, it was a fucking amazing...
*  And that was something that was organized by social media, essentially.
*  Exactly. Same thing in Iran and the Green Revolution of 2009.
*  What's interesting to me about this whole Hong Kong thing is that they're being introduced
*  to the government of China over the last few decades. That this was something they were
*  separated from. And then all of a sudden they become property of China again, essentially.
*  And so then you're seeing this thing where they become accustomed to the British way of things,
*  and the original Hong Kong way of doing things, and then things shift over.
*  It's a really unique moment of protest, because it's very rare that you see the actual government
*  of a country shift the way it has in Hong Kong. Correct me if I'm wrong.
*  Well, I don't profess to be an expert in revolution, but this is what the conversation
*  is about right now. It's watching people in other parts of the world
*  going out in the streets, risking their lives, literally. And meanwhile, in America, what is it
*  that will get us unified and out in the streets? What is that issue?
*  Things get us unified, particularly disasters.
*  Yeah, of course, 9-11. I was in New York.
*  What I'm saying about the... Yeah, that was a big one.
*  I have a billion stories.
*  Communicate.
*  A billion stories.
*  What I'm saying though is we've never seen, like in our time, we've never seen a government shift
*  over. You've never seen that kind of a shift where a free democratic sort of western way of running
*  things all of a sudden shifts over. And because of that, I think the resistance to it is very unique.
*  I think if you studied the British colonization of the world, there would be a lot of that.
*  Sure.
*  I think that's what we're talking about, literally, because it was Britain.
*  And then I can't speak to the specifics of the history of that, but it's what you're bringing up
*  is a fascinating question that I'd love to get to the bottom of, and there's probably a billion
*  people who would be so good on it. Because it's so important. People stand up for something and care.
*  I think.
*  Even with our limited understanding of the history of it, this is one thing we know for sure.
*  They used to be under Britain, and now they're not. And now they're under China,
*  and we're watching this resistance. And we're seeing these people,
*  hundreds and hundreds of thousands of them in the streets.
*  Yeah.
*  And you know what my favorite part of it all was? There was one time where an ambulance had to get
*  through, and all the people from Hong Kong just stood on the left and the right, and they let the
*  ambulance go through. And I'm like, whoa, good luck with that in Boston.
*  This is fucking not going to happen, bro. Look at this. Look at this video, man.
*  I mean, this is incredible.
*  This is what my brother and a lot of people who I respect and admire, but maybe I'm not courageous
*  enough to challenge our system more, want to see here for something. But what's it for?
*  Well, right now-
*  And why can't it be climate?
*  Well, the hustle is the right versus left. That's the hustle.
*  Yeah, that's the hustle.
*  And the real hustle is the fact that people get ideologically driven and they pick a side.
*  And they go, the problem is these fucking liberals, these fucking pussy liberals.
*  And then the problem is these racists, these white racist assholes.
*  I love your liberal person.
*  That's how it goes, man. I'm from Berkeley, man.
*  More. More. I want that. This is a character that should definitely break out.
*  Shit, man. I should bring him out every now and then, man. It's like fucking hetero normative
*  bullshit, right? But these characters, but the problem is these are patterns of behavior that
*  people slide into. And that's why, you know, we were talking about putting people in boxes.
*  People love to be able to put you in that pattern. I want to find out who you are.
*  Who are you? Are you a liberal? Are you a libertarian? Are you a mean person?
*  Are you a nice person? Who are you?
*  My trick for my mom when she would be telling whoever what her son does.
*  Well, he hosts a radio. He's a comedian and he hosts a radio show. Oh, what's his radio show about?
*  Oh, he talks about all kinds of news and issues and politics. Oh, is he a liberal or conservative?
*  They immediately want to know that.
*  And that's why he's a shit racist or a cuck.
*  Cuck, please. But my mom, the answer, it really is. It's really underappreciated.
*  I hope they keep it. I hope it doesn't become racist or something.
*  It's one of those words where it's like, I hope it doesn't slip away from us.
*  Like, we have it right now. We can enjoy it.
*  You can silence a lot of nonsense by calling somebody a cuck. You really can. It's like,
*  woo. And it's been overused for sure, but it's because it's so-
*  Not in text messaging.
*  It's recent and so effective. It's just got such a pop to it when someone calls someone a cuck,
*  especially if there's a ring of truth to it. You know what I'm saying?
*  I like it most used when you say something in daring. I'll text my brother. He's the kind
*  of person that will use it, maybe to me.
*  Stop being such a cuck?
*  I'll be like, I love you, bro. You're saving me. My brother's like my hero.
*  He's always there for me. He wrote my first standup material in high school when I was
*  hosting a talent show and he was getting kicked out of the house and I had no material.
*  And I was doing him, Dana Carvey's impressions, hosting a talent show and I had no material and
*  I walked out and I see a whole script that my brother had written.
*  Wow.
*  Didn't let me down.
*  That's awesome.
*  Even though he's high and drunk, didn't let me down.
*  Plus the guy's the best writing for you.
*  I'll say something in daring to him like that, loving, and then you get back, cuck.
*  That kind of response.
*  Perfect.
*  Yeah.
*  Perfect.
*  I actually now don't even know if he's actually using that or if I'm just high.
*  I'm sure he used it. It's a good word. He's a smart guy.
*  But back to revolution, why can't it? And what you're saying, the hustle.
*  I love that discussion because everything is about defining. So the answer my mom would give,
*  excuse me, getting back to that was, well, he talks about issues.
*  So, you know, that's what he talks about.
*  But they want to pin you into something so they can know how to feel about you, to like
*  or to hate you. Are you on my team? Are you not? And that is destroy, it's so destructive.
*  It is. And the other thing is the resistance to what you're saying.
*  The resistance is toxic too because people think, no, it's important that you take a side.
*  It's important that we de-platform Nazis. They say things like that and you're like,
*  who's all fucking Nazis? Stop. Look, they're real Nazis.
*  And the problem is you start calling everybody a Nazi and then one day you meet a real one
*  and you ran out of words. You fucking cried wolf. These aren't Nazis.
*  And when people feel like you're treating them unfairly or talking shit about them,
*  and this is a problem we have both in the right and the left, they fucking double down.
*  They dig their heels in and they go fuck that other group. It's team red all the way.
*  Fuck you, it's team blue. It is so destructive.
*  And watching it is so sad and being a part of it when we are is the problem.
*  The answer to that, the solution to that is to try to listen to each other and to try to understand.
*  Because I completely agree with you that if they don't feel respected,
*  you've lost them completely. People enjoy it like a team.
*  Like when the Celtics win, people get pumped. When the Republicans win, people get pumped.
*  When the Democrats win, people get pumped. It's their team. I had a friend of mine,
*  the comic, who said, we got to win the house because if we win the house, we win the White
*  House. I'm like, what are you talking about? What is we? What is we? Are we in this? Are you
*  running for something that I don't know about? They have to.
*  I feel that way about sports, by the way. When we say we, you're not on the team.
*  You're not a giant. You're out here. It's not exercising.
*  And it's the same thinking. It's the same thinking. People attach themselves.
*  I remember when I was a kid, I was a big fan of this guy named Donald Curry. He was this badass
*  boxer, this world champion, welterweight champion. He was a fucking beast. And then one day he got
*  knocked out. And by this guy, Mike McCallum, the body snatcher, he was another world champion,
*  a bad motherfucker. And he hit him with a left hook to the body and a left hook to the head,
*  knocked him out cold, flat on his back. I couldn't believe it. He was my favorite boxer.
*  And he just got knocked out. And I felt so bad. I couldn't take it. I put my running shoes on and
*  I ran out of the house and I ran for like a fucking mile. And I was just so worked up. I was probably
*  like 17, I think somewhere around then 16, 17. I don't remember. Maybe a little later, 18th,
*  the latest. I turned around and walked home. I ran like a mile and a half, a mile, whatever.
*  I turned around and I just walked home. I'm never going to get upset about someone I don't even know
*  losing like that. But that was a team thing. I was on team Curry. And people really literally
*  do that with fighters. I feel like I have a litmus test that I feel like I fall victim to the
*  criticism that you're laying out on the planet, on environmental stuff. I feel so panicky and so
*  anxious about that. And I care so much about it. And for me, it is religious. It's a spiritual
*  connection to nature that it brings me so much joy to be in it and around it and professing it.
*  And to see us destroy it by the way we're living. I'm one of those people that feels guilty about,
*  I rail against single use plastic, which is why I want to advocate for you guys to get a
*  big tank and everybody has thermoses. Because if you do that today, if you made that choice,
*  just get a big thing and a glass or mugs and sell them and raise money or something.
*  And Ari would come by and dose the bucket. You can't have a big open bottle water around with Ari.
*  Ari Shaffir gave out like a plate of pot cookies years ago at the Stan Comedy Club. My wife does
*  not. Did she know it was a pot cookie? Didn't know. Went to take it,
*  took a sniff of it and she's like, oh no. And Ari's like, oh sorry. Oh boy. She almost took it.
*  She is no good with the weed, the edibles especially. Well, edibles are rough on you.
*  She once had like a whole Kit Kat because she was hungry and went to the sink and was washing her
*  hands and just said, this water is so wet. I go, oh shit, something's wrong. Put some headphones on.
*  Yeah. This water is so wet. When you look at that Hong Kong thing, right? Yeah. You know,
*  I don't think we need a revolution. I think we need a resolution. Like I think we need to like
*  relax and come to this understanding. Like most of the stuff we fight about is because we're tricked
*  into this tribal way of thinking. I don't mean tricked by some overlords. I mean,
*  tricked by your own biology. We have a natural inclination to form teams and we have a natural,
*  because there's only two real ones. I mean, you could be one of them fucking dudes who's
*  only into independent music and you always vote green party. But for the most part, there's two
*  parties, right? When it comes to like national politics and when we think about whoever the fuck's
*  going to win, whether we think about what the really important thing is the economy or protecting
*  our borders. Or you think the real important thing is the environment and stopping global warming.
*  We've got to do something to engineer like biodegradable plastics and make them mandatory.
*  And whatever thing becomes your side and you can make arguments for both sides. The problem is
*  people then subscribe to whatever ideas are in that party. You could almost pick to a person.
*  If you're pro-life, you're probably pro-war. But when you said,
*  you know, we're doing well or, you know, relax, we're doing well, I react to that with
*  working with and advocating for all these anti-poverty organizations. What do you mean
*  relax? We're doing well. I felt like you were saying like when everybody is getting fired up,
*  maybe I misunderstood you. It was like, I don't think we need a revolution, but.
*  I think instead of thinking about it like a competition between two teams,
*  we should think about it as a resolution. We should resolve our issues.
*  And what are our issues?
*  It resists being tribal.
*  Absolutely agree. That's the entire problem. And I'll do anything to work with you or anybody else
*  on furthering that conversation because that's all bullshit theatrical,
*  manufactured shit that you're divided by your neighbor because of any number of stupid and
*  we're not talking because of that. I believe that our species can do a lot better.
*  But it's normal. That's the thing. It's like normal to not like people that,
*  you know, you look at some of those conservatives, it's normal if you're a liberal to not like them.
*  If you're a conservative, it's normal to think these fucking silly liberals,
*  they're going to ruin everything.
*  Don't put them in that box. What kind of a man is he? What kind of a father?
*  That's how I evaluate men or women. What kind of a partner? What kind of a parent?
*  I just watch them behave with their kids. I don't think about what they think about guns.
*  If I find that stuff out later, then we talk about it. But how, what kind of a role model
*  are you for your children is how I evaluate another man. I don't know if that's a good measure.
*  That's what I do. I don't think about what show he watches or what kind of car he drives or what
*  his job is. What kind of a man is he? What kind of a father, a role model, a contributor to society?
*  Does he care about other people and other things? What is his morality?
*  Perfect.
*  Yeah, I mean-
*  I don't know, but that's not that, why is that abnormal? Isn't that how we all should be? Isn't
*  that how we all are to some extent?
*  I think this resonates with a lot of people that are listening. There's a lot of people that try
*  very hard to do that. There's a lot of people that also escape the grips of tribal thinking
*  as they get older and wiser. I think I'm one of those and I think a lot of people are one of those.
*  I am too, I hope.
*  And I think one of the ways that you help it is by having these conversations.
*  People listen and then it resonates with them. Maybe it only resonates to a certain degree
*  and maybe they slip away from it a week later when they're drinking and hanging out with their
*  friends or they're not exposed to the ideas very often. When they do, it's not as effective as it
*  would be if they were around people that were like-minded. But just having these conversations,
*  you're affecting, like right now we're affecting a lot of different people's thinking. They're
*  listening to this and they go, a lot of interactions could have been different on
*  both sides depending upon what you did. Like sometimes you run into someone and they're
*  douchey, but if you just turned around a little bit, say, it's all right, brother.
*  And then they relax and they go, oh, he's okay. But if you've ramped it up and they ramped it
*  up more, you can go, that guy's a piece of shit. Well, yeah, he acted like a piece of shit, but
*  maybe part of the way he acted like a piece of shit was the way you dealt with his initial
*  weirdness. Because sometimes people are just fucking weird and sometimes people come off douchey.
*  People are complex. People are so complex and so rooted in so many. I mean, I just go straight to
*  interviewing. I've interviewed murderers and rapists.
*  Who have you interviewed that's a murderer?
*  Senghor, I think his last name is, Shakti Senghor. He wrote a book. He changed my life.
*  He killed a guy when he was 18, went to prison, served 19 years and got out and wrote a book.
*  And redemption, like he felt like, how did he get there? To murdering somebody.
*  And how did he become the man that he was? That's the way to measure a man. And so he
*  did the worst thing. So when you say you have this idea about any number of issues from race to
*  energy issues, to guns, to abortion, to feminism, to all this stuff, it's like, well,
*  where did he start? Who were his role models? There's so much data about the zip code that
*  you're born into in this country determines where you'll be when you're 18. And it's so accurate.
*  It's so hard to get out of certain places. I heard you and someone talking about that.
*  It was Dakota Meyer, who was amazing. I loved that whole interview. It was fascinating.
*  Yeah, he was awesome.
*  Really interesting guy. And nothing but respect for that guy. But talking about America as like
*  this place where it's the greatest place to get ahead, like, it's not. It's so hard to get ahead
*  here. In some spots. In some spots it's very hard to get ahead. In way too many spots.
*  I'm with you if you're talking about impoverished neighborhoods that have a history of crime and
*  violence, because they don't fix that and it doesn't change. And it's really hard to get ahead
*  if you're in that. But in other places, if you're in a nice city and you're in a nice neighborhood,
*  it is difficult. But compared to the rest of the world, it's far, far easier.
*  I'm just talking about social mobility.
*  In what sense?
*  In terms of being able to move up a rung in the ladder.
*  Okay, I feel like that's only true in impoverished areas that are riddled with crime and drugs.
*  But that's not how it's measured.
*  But I'm thinking if you're talking about places where things are doing well, right?
*  And you're comparing them to the rest of the world, this is one of the easiest places to get
*  ahead ever that's ever existed.
*  Because there's...
*  Only if you start in a certain spot. If you start at the bottom in America, it's almost impossible,
*  which is why the media loves to focus and Americans love to focus on it. Even there's themselves.
*  So many people say, you know, listen, I started with nothing and now I'm a major success. And so
*  they don't then have sympathy for somebody else. I'm like, that's your story to tell.
*  What were your opportunities? Who were your role models? What did you have? Did you have health
*  care? Did you have universal pre-K? That's the bottom line. If you have universal pre-K
*  all over this country, this whole country would be so much more intelligent. That's what all the
*  education data says. That's what every other country does. We don't have it. But what we do
*  have is just so many fucked up budget priorities. The budget is a moral document. It means where
*  your values lie and you spend what on health care, what on defense, what on anti-poverty,
*  what on nutrition, what on education. Yes. That's how I determine, by the way,
*  in a thoughtful conversation, not only are you a liberal or conservative, pro-antigovernment
*  ants, how do you think we should spend our tax money? Where should we spend it around the world
*  and domestically and in terms of... It's like we have this huge defense budget with these weapons
*  that will never be used and Russia beat us with Facebook and North Korea hacked into Sony. It's
*  like that's where the threat is. Right. Let me ask you this when it comes to defense,
*  because that's always an interesting subject. There's two arguments, right? There's this pro
*  military argument that is you have to have a certain amount of military might all over the
*  world. We have to be the world's policeman because if we're not, someone else will,
*  and we are protecting America by doing this and we fight them over there so that we can be free
*  over here. Right? That's the pro argument. The anti-argument would be you could do everything
*  that you need to do to protect us with less money and you could take that money and inject it into
*  these inner cities that are impoverished and crime-ridden and you could, in my words,
*  is why I always like to say, if you want to make America greater, what's the best way to do that?
*  Well, have less losers. Have less people that are losing the game because they have a shitty roll
*  of the dice and the bad-handed cards when they were young. Of course. Of course. Give people
*  opportunity. Give people healthcare and education. Give them an opportunity to succeed. It's not that
*  hard. Most of us got it. But the pro military argument would be, okay, that is not going to
*  work. We will get fucked over by another country and then no one will have an advantage. We have
*  to maintain a certain amount of power worldwide. This is not my argument. Okay? I'm just saying.
*  But I would reject the binary on its face because it's a thoughtful binary and I'd love to answer it,
*  but it's so much more geopolitical and filled with history and then technology.
*  And so now I think if I am going to answer the question, it's like the threat, the threats that
*  were faced, the threat matrix is a way to look at it. Like what are the existential threats, nuclear war
*  and any kind of geopolitical, what kind of conventional war? It's everything's online
*  in terms of the way that we countries are fighting. It's all going online.
*  It's all transparent.
*  Well, I don't know if it's transparent.
*  It is in some ways.
*  But the point I would like to say, like how is the Department of Defense not only focused
*  on saving the planet? That's it. That's it. Just do that. Everybody wins.
*  I think it's complicated, man.
*  Well, of course it is.
*  I think it's way more complicated than we would ever understand. I think to be a military leader
*  in 2019 and to be making decisions one way or another when you attack people.
*  Whoo. Good luck with all that. Good luck with trying to figure out how to kill terrorists and
*  do it live on television while the president's watching from the fucking Oval Office or whatever
*  really happened. I think he was golfing. Yeah, that was a whole weird situation.
*  How about the picture afterwards? Like, I know what a post picture looks like.
*  Dude, every single one of those pictures, it does look bad when every one of those pictures
*  are coming out of the Oval Office is a bunch of white dudes.
*  Well, God wants you to wear makeup and God wants you to sit right there.
*  That's right.
*  God wants that.
*  Right.
*  People don't talk enough, man. There's too many of us. That's a lot of what all this shit is.
*  I think you're leading, I think one of the reasons why you're doing so well is because
*  you're leading the conversation about how the conversation should be.
*  I hope as evidence from what we're saying.
*  Well, I hope so too. I'm just happy people enjoy it, but the conversations that we're not having,
*  we're not having enough of is face to face, one on one like this. Everyone's distracted.
*  You can't get to know people over sound bites. You definitely can't get to know them through
*  text messages or little tiny snippets of a conversation that they're going to have
*  before they cut to commercial.
*  To get to know a person is very easy. You just look at their internet history.
*  You find out what kind of porn they like.
*  Oh my God.
*  Whether or not they like muscle cars.
*  It's my greatest bit. I mean, it's the idea that Facebook and your social media is what you want.
*  People think you don't. Here's my family in the Bahamas. But like, if you had a video of me
*  melting down, just smoking weed and feeling my heart thumping and sweating because I'm having
*  a panic attack. It's like that's your internet history. Like you're looking up every lump that
*  you find.
*  Right. And you go down weird rabbit holes. You find out about strange diseases.
*  Very unhealthy.
*  All day today about parasites.
*  Mind fucking. I saw your tweet about that. I was like, no, don't put it out there.
*  There's so many parasites.
*  Don't put it out there. It's interesting as hell. But it's terrifying because the idea like I always
*  get so worried, especially that one, because it's like trail running is my favorite way to run.
*  Yes. I love it too. That's why I posted it. Some lady got eyeball worms, man.
*  But kids are terrified to go outside. There's this amazing organization,
*  Children in Nature Network. Everybody should discover and support and look up the work of Richard
*  Louv, who's just written a new book about relationships. You'll love it with animals
*  and humans. And he wrote a book called Last Child in the Woods that is my Bible, changed my life.
*  And kids are afraid to go outside because there's ticks. There's Lyme disease. There's
*  parents afraid that there's kidnapping. No, there isn't.
*  There is definitely Lyme disease.
*  Well, yeah, but you just be vigilant.
*  Yeah, but Lyme disease is really significant.
*  It's horrible. I grew up in-
*  I have several people-
*  I live in Rockland County. Me too. Horrible. Don't get me wrong. But we can't not send our kids
*  outside.
*  No, I agree.
*  Cut your lawn and check your kids for ticks. Good night.
*  Yeah, you gotta be vigilant.
*  But the kids have to stay out. They have to be outside to appreciate getting out dried.
*  Yeah, no, I agree.
*  The connection to nature. That's what it's all about. It all works together. The idea
*  that we're drinking out of bottles that are made of petroleum. That's what plastic is.
*  This is going to be here for 700 years.
*  Unless we melt it and make cool shit out of it.
*  Let's take some ideas. Let's go to the calls.
*  Do you know who Boyon Slat is? He's that guy-
*  Oh yeah, the guy collecting plastic. Dutch kid.
*  He makes everybody else look unaccomplished.
*  Like 19-
*  He's like, I'm 18 and I'm going to take all of the plastic out of the ocean. What
*  else I do? And I was bashing mailboxes.
*  The first one didn't work and everybody's like, he did no shit. He's like, yeah,
*  that one is a prototype. We're trying to make it work. Look, the next one works.
*  He's still only 20.
*  Let's cheer for him.
*  I know. People are hating on him.
*  Why are we tribal on getting plastic, getting rid of this horrible single-use plastic?
*  Because it's connected to ego. Because someone who's 19 years old figured out how to do some
*  shit that you've never figured out how to do. He's a better person than you.
*  Fine.
*  No, it's a game.
*  It's a game.
*  I'm rooting for him.
*  No, you're not. That's why you're happy when his machine breaks. Like, haha.
*  Never.
*  I don't know that mentality. I don't understand that mentality.
*  But you understand it.
*  I understand it, but I don't feel it. I'm not rooting for your pain.
*  If I don't like your opinions, I don't want you to get sick.
*  I don't want you to even get your finger crunched in the garage door. I don't want you to have pain.
*  I think it's the same sort of feeling.
*  Because of your beliefs.
*  It's the same thing that leads people to be tribal. It also leads people to be jealous.
*  It's the same kind of thing. It's like a pattern of thinking that's easy to slide into.
*  It's like a well-oiled chute. You just slide right in there.
*  You can name that and acknowledge it for your kids. That's what you're doing. That's what I'm
*  doing, hopefully. That's what that is. Don't fall into those veins. People, I think, by the way,
*  are mostly good. All day. All day. Most of my interactions.
*  Yes.
*  I'm walking out the door with this lady out of the bank and we both walk out the same time.
*  We're both like, oh, sorry. Both are faults. Have a good one. Little smiles. That's most interactions
*  that I have, at least. But I'm very attractive.
*  You're a handsome man. I agree with you, though. I think that is the case.
*  Also, it has to do with how you interact with those people. We've all been guilty of being loaded up
*  in one way or another interacting with someone and it doesn't go as well as it could have gone
*  if you were in a better place when you met that person.
*  It's all about reactions. That's the second time you mentioned that and that's the most important
*  thing I've learned in therapy and with my wife. It's if you choose how to react to a situation
*  or a comment and everything rides in that reaction, potentially your life.
*  I forget which book it is, whether it's one of those ancient philosophy books, but I never
*  forgot this term. Nothing has any meaning other than the meaning that you give it.
*  Yeah, it's whatever it is, tragedy or a positive thing. Look, for sure it's a tragedy. It's very
*  difficult to not have an automatic. It's not what we see. It's how we see it.
*  Yes. But talk regular moments in your life. The worst case scenario for a person is approaching
*  any moment in their life and being like, whoa, it's me. God damn it. Why does it always happen
*  to me? Instead of having a perspective like, look how lucky I am that my real concern is someone
*  keyed my car. The reason, and I look at that and I say, why is that person always saying,
*  what was me? Why? It's a pattern.
*  Yeah, but why? Where does it come from? It's a natural pattern. It's like-
*  It's a role modeling. That's why you have to give people an opportunity to break out of that.
*  We are so evolved. We are so far, probably too evolved that we've created plastic bottles and
*  we're killing ourselves. We're killing ourselves with plastic bottles?
*  We're seven billion people or it's just too many people.
*  That's a lot. Do you buy into the argument that the more westernized or the more advanced society
*  gets, the population actually starts to decrease? Because there are certain cities that they point
*  to where that's on the trend. I think Tokyo is one of them. But the idea is that as people,
*  as a civilization advances, people decide to pursue careers before having children and less
*  and less people have children. And that there's some sort of a direct correlation with the amount
*  of children people have versus the amount of technological advancement is around them and the
*  amount of education and the level of the city. Like if you're in around a place like New York-
*  I think it's generally education based. Yeah, education and affluence too. I think affluence
*  has something to do with it as well. Well, affluence usually comes with education.
*  Sometimes. Usually you could be any nut- you could have examples of people who came from
*  absolutely nothing and had a general heart defect and overcame it to become, you know,
*  a CEO of a McDonald's and then have to step down because they had an affair.
*  Start their own businesses and shit, you know? Yeah. I mean, a lot of that and nothing but
*  certainly I have nothing but I look at someone who's started a business and ran a business from a
*  dry cleaning store to whatever they're doing. My dad owned an insurance agency in Syracuse,
*  New York. That's what my dad did. And my mom was a public school teacher. And it's like,
*  so I saw the public and private sector. That was my role model. That's a good combination too,
*  to grow up with. And I had healthcare and I had nursery school. My mom was a
*  early childhood- she had an associate's degree. My dad didn't go to college. Shout out to my
*  pop, by the way. He just had a heart attack and ruined his eye. How bad is his eye? Can't see
*  on it. It's not surgery number three. Dude just wrapped up 44 years as a ski instructor.
*  And he's a competitive cyclist. He ripped off- broke every bone in his body. He's a fucking
*  man of steel. What is the damage to the eye that doesn't allow him to see? I can't explain it,
*  but it's a laceration. He was on his, you know, blood center. He fainted and bounced his face off
*  the table. Lacerated his eye. Has a big impact on whether or not he heals quick, right? Oh yeah.
*  And he's all filled with blood so he can't see out of it. And my dad is like- my dad is a very
*  physically healthy guy. So it's aging, man. It's tough. I mean that's where my situation is. My
*  mom and dad married 48 years. But that's- you know, my dad- I look at my dad and he's a great story
*  in America. He didn't go to college. He started his own insurance agency. He did well, supported
*  us. We lived in the suburbs. Marcellus, New York. You know what's crazy about America? It's only 300
*  years old. And the idea of a new America is out of the fucking question, right? The idea of someone
*  coming along, of the millions of years of life on this planet and the hundreds of thousands of years
*  of being humans and the 300 whatever, almost years of the United States. If someone said,
*  we're going to start a new country now and we found a new spot in New Zealand or Greenland
*  or something. Be like, fuck you. You can't do that. You can't do that today. We'll see. Do you think?
*  I think everything's changing. Everything's changing. But if, first of all, anyone who-
*  people would be super suspicious. Well, yeah. If you were going to start a new country, they'd go,
*  oh, that guy's just going to fuck all the women. Ah, well, there's a lot of that. I mean, that's a
*  lot of the world right now. Yeah. Well, that's a lot of why you would start your own country.
*  But- That's why it has almost probably always been the reason. That's religion. There would have to be
*  some leader, right? There would have to be someone who says, listen, this is how we're going to do
*  this. We're going to have an open-ended constitution. We can amend it whenever we see fit.
*  Instead of having a president, we'll have a council of elders. I'm all for blowing up the system
*  and redoing it to make it more equitable, however you describe that. We're going to need nukes,
*  okay? Because the North Koreans aren't fucking around. The Russians are always shifting. Those
*  Chinese, man, they're plotting things. I think they're going to try to cancel our internet.
*  The fact that we haven't- cancel our- You made it sound like they're the cable company.
*  They got to cut the cord. The fact that we haven't had an accident-
*  That's amazing. Who is it? Schlosser. Eric Schlosser wrote this book and documentary
*  is fascinating. History of accidents and close calls is nuts. And we got to get rid of all nukes.
*  Yeah. All thinking people believe that. It's so crazy. That was a horrible statement,
*  what I just said, by the way. All thinking people? That's wrong. That's, by the way,
*  a great example of a condescending thing for a person to say into a microphone.
*  All thinking people think blank. Stop it. But it's also one of those things where
*  it doesn't help to say it. Even if it is true, all thinking people agree with me. No one is going to
*  go, wow, I didn't- I don't want to be considered a non-thinking person. Exactly. That's why I nailed
*  this. People are yelling into a microphone, what is wrong with you? You must be a non-thinking
*  person. I'm like, I don't want to be yelled at. I dated this girl once when I was 21. She'd get
*  upset about shit. She was older than me. She was smarter than me too. But she got upset once and I
*  said, will you just please, just please relax. And she goes, no one who's upset ever wants to
*  hear you saying relax. And it doesn't work. And I thought about that. I was like, damn, she's right.
*  That doesn't work. Someone says relax. Relax doesn't work. It just doesn't work. You don't go,
*  thank you. I mean, sometimes you do, but you have to be not very wound up and you have to
*  really love the person who's telling you to relax. No, it's an absolute condescension.
*  I've done that a hundred times to my wife. She nails me every time. Every time. I remember
*  thinking as a 21 year old savage going, oh, okay. She's, okay, she's right. That makes sense. Yeah,
*  I don't want to hear that either. That's very- but that's called being open-minded and being
*  vulnerable. Being able to check in with yourself as opposed to being this kind of authoritarian
*  beast of don't you tell me this is my castle. Like I don't understand that kind of whatever
*  you want to call it. I don't want to even name it. It's just an attitude that we have to- our
*  generation of men is so much more vulnerable, I think, than our parents. And so much more open-minded
*  and sensitive and it has nothing to do necessarily with sexuality. It has to do with human growth and
*  evolution. And realizing that you're actually weak to pretend that you're strong. Absolutely.
*  Yeah. That somehow- You don't feel-
*  Addressing your PTSD as a combat veteran is somehow seen as weak. It's like, no, that's- if
*  you're taking on your worst nightmares, that's strength. And by the way, how do we measure
*  strength? I mean, it's always about what you can lift, not the pain you can endure, which is why I
*  think if you're measuring strength by gender, women can endure more pain. So that's one measure
*  of strength. But more importantly, that's whatever you overcame in life, that's the measurement of
*  strength, not how you can force yourself. I mean, I'm a small guy, so that's a small guy mentality.
*  I talk my way out of every- you know, my dad's like, just when you walk into that class, you make
*  friends with the biggest kid in the class and I've done that my whole life. So that's- I just talk
*  my way out. But- Well, whatever works.
*  But not that in an authoritarian way, in a way that you're saying, in a way that you think about-
*  When you say any thinking person agrees with that, that is a version of saying relax.
*  Oh, yes.
*  It's the same thing.
*  Oh, for sure.
*  Yeah. We both agree.
*  No, yeah, no, no, it's a perfect analogy. Absolutely. We could do a whole long story about
*  condescending remarks, especially in marriages or any relationship. In this conversation, if I put
*  you down in the way that you're thinking, it's like the whole conversation then changes.
*  It gets gross.
*  It doesn't respect my intellect, my experience. And it's like-
*  The conversation gets gross.
*  Yeah. And ineffectual and damaging, which is-
*  Well, that's the easy way-
*  But that's how you sell ads. That's how you create ratings.
*  Oh, that's so crazy. This show does pretty good. We don't do that. You don't have to do it.
*  Exactly.
*  But the thing about online conversations is that you don't have this interaction like we're having.
*  This is probably more intimate than a regular conversation because we're in each other's ears.
*  Right? We're wearing- I prefer headphones.
*  Yeah, I wish all of life was this way. I don't want this to stop right now.
*  All the time. It's too narrow focus, but it's good for conversations.
*  Don't send me what I want. I will stay here and put anybody in those headphones.
*  And you need to relax.
*  Calm down. Everybody just calm.
*  Any thinking person would agree with me. Relax.
*  Calm down, Joe. Will you calm down, Joe Rogan? That's my favorite thing to say.
*  When someone's not worked up, you're working with a young person in a corporate-
*  Yeah.
*  You know, it's serious. It's CNN.
*  Calm down.
*  And they're not at all worked up. They're like, hey, do you want me to send that over?
*  Calm down, okay? Like I was totally normal.
*  Um, what percentage of people that you worked with run Adderall?
*  Oh my God, I wish I know. I thought everybody around me was on something.
*  What do you think the number would be?
*  Anti-depressants, I thought.
*  Would you think it would be a high number?
*  Adderall? I don't know. I don't know anything about Adderall.
*  I know a lot about- and I hear a lot about Xanax and anti-depressants and anti-anxieties.
*  None of which I've ever put in my body.
*  Those are spooky. I think some people need them.
*  I think for some people, they have a bad chemical makeup. I mean, this is just a fact.
*  Just like some people have thyroid cancer, right? Some people have- there's a missing link.
*  There's something wrong with the way their brain's firing. And this is just a biological issue
*  because we're, you know, we're not- you don't pick your biology.
*  There's situational depression.
*  Sure. There's a lot of issues.
*  Johan Hari writes about that in his new book. And there's been a lot of really great
*  work written about it, academic research on it. And the academic research on neuropsychology,
*  my understanding is that it's like, we know so little about the brain.
*  We're very early in trying to understand it. So these medications, like right now,
*  dealing with like career- like my career transition, and thinking about running for
*  Congress, dealing with my dad, that to me is not a reason to take an anti-depressant.
*  That's- no, you work. Now you just hit it hard and you do what you do and you don't make excuses
*  and you just work.
*  My friend Jordan Peterson had an issue where his wife was- she had developed liver cancer.
*  It was very serious.
*  Oh dear. Yeah.
*  Very scary.
*  I did not know that about him. I know of him and his work, but I did not know that.
*  She was very, very sick. And he, you know, they've been together since high school.
*  Ah!
*  He loves her dearly. And he started freaking out. So he got on something- what was it called?
*  Colonopin? Is that what it was?
*  Oh yeah, yeah. I'm familiar with that.
*  And-
*  I've heard of it.
*  No, not a lot of people.
*  She had a miraculous recovery. Everybody's happy about that.
*  Oh!
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  That's amazing.
*  She had surgery.
*  Oh wow. Did she get a transplant?
*  I don't know.
*  But he had a really difficult issue with the colonopin. Really bad.
*  Oh, he used it to deal with that situation.
*  Yes.
*  And what was the issue?
*  Well, he was going through severe withdrawals. He had to check himself into a rehab center.
*  Oh yeah. That's a- I hear that's a very- I have a family member who did everything,
*  including heroin. And it's so great to hear Artie on the show. Because I called up Artie
*  when he was doing heroin to ask him how serious it was. He goes, let me ask you two questions.
*  Alright. And he goes, is he having a good life? Is it a job or kids or anything? I was like, no.
*  He's just a single guy. And he goes, is he shooting it or snorting it?
*  He's shooting it. And he goes, I can't help you.
*  Like that was the worst.
*  That's true though.
*  I have so many Artie stories on the road with him for so long.
*  So nice to see him doing well.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  He's doing great. I mean, he really is.
*  He certainly seems so. Artie called me.
*  He's a crackling man.
*  He's one of my closest friends. My wife and I spent a lot of time with him and I love him to death.
*  And his story is the most remarkable- story is one of the most remarkable stories in comedy.
*  He's one of the funniest. He's one of the kings of comedy.
*  And he's a close brother of mine for a long time. So watching him with you, I can't wait to see him.
*  I got 17 numbers for him.
*  I'll give you the real one if he lets me. No greater storyteller alive.
*  He's up there.
*  He's no greater.
*  Yogi Berra was good.
*  His fucking stories are incredible.
*  De Kavett's pretty good.
*  He's got this thing he does with his fingers too.
*  Artie tells you stories.
*  He does a lot of this-
*  Hey, we're so in love.
*  A lot of movement with his fingers. He's got a little show he's doing.
*  There's a lot happening.
*  He is a performer. He gets it. He gets it all.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I was waiting in the wings. He's going out.
*  I open for him. I come back. They play The Who, which song that he came out to.
*  And he just at his heaviest just falls back into me.
*  And I had a brace. I'm a tiny muscular guy and I push him back up and literally push him on stage.
*  He's zoning off.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Like falling asleep out there.
*  That's hilarious.
*  I mean, there's just so much to see him in his recovery.
*  Should give everybody hope. It should give everybody hope.
*  It's interesting too, because I don't think he's ever been funnier.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Artie is at top of his game and I'm really excited to see him and one of the funniest guys.
*  And one of the most generous guys, man.
*  He helped everybody. It was too much. I would tell him, like, you can't-
*  Did that guy supported so many comics in ways that were like beyond generous?
*  The way that you do, by the way.
*  I believe it.
*  By the way that you do.
*  I want to see his standup. I want to see it.
*  I want to know where he's at.
*  Because I know he's doing only gigs around the New York area.
*  But I'm thinking about, if I have to go to the East Coast, I'm thinking about taking a trip.
*  I just want to see it.
*  Yeah, because like, see him now.
*  It's like all the years that I've known him, he was always fucked up.
*  Yeah. I was on the road with him a lot of that time.
*  I witnessed a lot of stuff.
*  It would just be hanging out. He'd be gone all day.
*  Like, where were you?
*  Like, I'm a hooker all day.
*  We were in Vegas by the pool at his cabana.
*  He wasn't with us.
*  Like, where's the king, man?
*  Is he ever going to come down?
*  Did you see the hooker? Maybe.
*  I mean, yeah, I wouldn't have hung out with us either.
*  Don't get me wrong.
*  But it was a nice day. We wanted to hang out with him.
*  He's got through on the other side.
*  I just hope he can stay on this side.
*  Yeah, but the point is, Artie is not, he's an aberration.
*  He is an exception for any number of reasons.
*  He has to be one of the most talented, really funny people that he just can't fail.
*  Because everybody wants to be around him and be with him.
*  But, and see him perform.
*  But drugs in this country, whether they be anti-depressants or the opiates,
*  that's something we should come together around as well.
*  I think so.
*  And we're medicating, you know, I think far too much.
*  I'd love for you to talk to my friend, Dr. Aaron Carroll, who's written so many writes
*  for the New York Times. He's got an amazing YouTube channel.
*  Beg you to have him on the show because he talks, he's a research expert.
*  And there's so much to talk with him about in terms of all this stuff,
*  supplements and fasting and nutrition.
*  And you'll absolutely love him.
*  I want everybody to know about his work.
*  Is he a doctor?
*  Yeah, he's a pediatrician at Indiana University School of Medicine.
*  He contributes to the New York Times.
*  He's got this YouTube channel, like it's called Healthcare Triage.
*  He's a really smart guy and he does all, he's just really great at explaining research.
*  Is his thought that people are over-medicating?
*  I'm not sure. I don't want to speak for him.
*  Yeah, that's a tricky one, right?
*  I think it's those words.
*  No, I mean, people get very resentful about that.
*  Number one, don't tell me I'm a bad parent or a bad person.
*  This helps, works for me.
*  Yeah, no, I mean, we've got to be careful.
*  We've got to be very easy on the judgment with all that.
*  Whatever, I kind of feel whatever gets you through the day.
*  Well, I don't know how your brain works.
*  Like to pretend that your brain works like my brain and that I know for sure
*  that if I was inside your head, I would be thinking the way I think out here.
*  Amen.
*  It's impossible.
*  Amen.
*  I don't know what it feels like.
*  Like I know I have a baseline.
*  When I'm healthy, I know who I am.
*  I'm that guy.
*  Could you imagine being someone else other than what you know and what you're comfortable with?
*  You can't.
*  And that's why I have to-
*  Imagine the chemical makeup of a different person.
*  You can't know what anybody's going through in their day.
*  Imagine if you were a woman and you were on your period.
*  I have.
*  You remember what that feels like?
*  Often. I've thought about that. I've thought about it all.
*  I never thought about it until just now.
*  Don't you have daughters?
*  Yes, but I never thought about myself having a period.
*  Or having premenstrual syndrome.
*  Yeah, that sounds like very little fun.
*  PMS sounds like a real bummer.
*  Yeah.
*  Once a month, you're going to become a cunt.
*  The whole situation.
*  You let everybody know in advance.
*  I'm going to take calcium tablets. I'm going to do my best.
*  But when the storm comes, imagine.
*  I try to just be aware of that, but my wife and I are usually at the same baseline regardless
*  of what's going on.
*  It doesn't affect everyone.
*  Some people don't get that.
*  I don't know if it does. Maybe it does.
*  But it's something to be sensitive about because it's something that we don't have to deal with.
*  You know what I hate, dude? I got a vasectomy.
*  And this idea that any guy would ever not do that is bizarre to me.
*  It's the greatest thing. I highly recommend it.
*  Population control and no more condoms.
*  Your wife should never have to put a drug on her body or cut tire tubes.
*  That's horrific unless I guess she's just giving birth maybe.
*  But I'm very pro vasectomy.
*  Do you think that there's going to come a time in America where there's too many people
*  where we have a Delhi, India type situation?
*  I think that is the case in too many communities right now, impoverished communities, that
*  there's too many people for the resources.
*  That's how you measure it.
*  How do you measure too many people?
*  Congestion, overabundance of traffic.
*  Right now in LA, when I come home from the 405, get home from the airport, I'm driving
*  home on the 405, I'm like, why?
*  Yeah, this is my first experience on it.
*  It's 10 o'clock and it's bumper to bumper from miles and miles and miles.
*  Where is everybody going?
*  That's another way to define poverty.
*  Unless you're listening to a great conversation like ours.
*  But even then, it's not worth it.
*  How dare you?
*  It's not worth it being stuck in that.
*  One thing is being stuck in it, the other thing is being stuck in it every day.
*  It's horrible for your body to sit there.
*  When I stopped commuting, I had this driving neck pain every day, 43.
*  Like a knife every day, I stopped commuting, gone.
*  Gone.
*  Absolutely sitting in a car, you got to try to offset that if that's something you have
*  to deal with because it's really hard.
*  I think that having right now in America, in many communities, there are not enough
*  resources for the people that are living there in terms of healthy food and access to education
*  and healthcare.
*  That's Joe, that's how I define morality of a society, how we take care of each other.
*  And we all don't have the same access in this country.
*  I urge people to study poverty and not get caught up in the tribalism of the argument
*  of why people are in poverty.
*  No, there's a long, really interesting and important field of study and there's a whole
*  bunch of anti-poverty people that I love talking to.
*  What do you mean by anti-poverty people?
*  That just working to decrease poverty using private, public, any number of different
*  resources, solving the problem.
*  That's one thing that I think morally we fucked up with, with not having healthcare available
*  to everybody readily, easily.
*  If you're going to pay for things, if we're going to decide that we're a community, we're
*  basically a community of 300 million people.
*  We've got two things, you've got to educate people and you've got to take care of the sick.
*  And you should have food figured out.
*  Right?
*  We don't have two of those things and one of them is terrible.
*  The education system in inner cities is often terrible.
*  The food thing is a fucking mess.
*  Food stamps is a mess.
*  The education system and rule in tribal communities.
*  Nobody ever talks about tribal communities.
*  I've done a lot of work with them and I keep saying that by the way, I'm no noble, just
*  like advocating the type of stuff that I know that you do and just trying to understand
*  what they do and advocate for the solutions.
*  And tribal communities and impoverished communities are all over this country in rural areas
*  and obviously in urban areas.
*  We have a lot of it and we can solve those problems, but being divided the way we are
*  on not understanding the root of poverty.
*  Michelle Alexander's The New Jim Crow takes on racial injustice and mass incarceration.
*  You just read that book, you'll be a completely different person understanding history.
*  Well, the things that we need to have in order to establish, yeah, drug war for sure.
*  I mean, when is that going to end?
*  Where are we?
*  Our generation has an agreement about that.
*  End that.
*  End that shit.
*  Legalize all of it.
*  All of it.
*  Legalize it.
*  Regulate it.
*  Anything anybody wants to do.
*  What we have been doing, what's going on in Mexico right now is nuts.
*  It's crazy and that's because of our demand for it.
*  We're directly connected to their problems.
*  That's just basic economics and commerce.
*  Legalize it.
*  It's not going to solve.
*  It's not going to end the drug cartels.
*  They're always going to be there.
*  Yeah.
*  But don't simplify this problem and don't demonize it.
*  Name it and solve it.
*  We've just been so much loss and pain.
*  It's got to end.
*  Yeah.
*  And I can't, whoever gets elected as president has to stop with this punitive justice bullshit
*  where you punish people for their behavior.
*  I just heard about this kid who got caught with weed in his car in high school and his
*  principal threw him off the golf team and his dad was like, why would you do that?
*  Why would you not let him do the thing that he loves?
*  That's not that, you know, I was just going to get sit around all day.
*  He's doing a great thing.
*  Don't this idea of punishment is changing your behavior.
*  Like we can get beyond that.
*  I think we can get beyond that.
*  We certainly can, especially weed for a kid.
*  No, but anything for kids like consequences for kids like spanking your kids is prehistoric.
*  It's prehistoric.
*  But I mean, what you're talking about when it comes to this kid with weed is completely absurd.
*  Do you think he would have got kicked off?
*  He got caught having shot at Jack Daniels.
*  Would have gotten kicked off a team for life if, you know, something happened at a party
*  and he wound up having a shot of vodka with his friends?
*  Well, you also, I should say he had a bucket of grenades in the passenger seat as well,
*  Joe, and a bag of cash.
*  What kind of grenades?
*  Love grenades?
*  No, that's what it was.
*  You're absolutely right.
*  That's all it was.
*  Stupid.
*  Whoever made that decision is an asshole.
*  Well, yes, of course.
*  Well, hold on.
*  Their judgment is clearly wrong.
*  Yes.
*  But minimizing them as an asshole, it is an asshole move.
*  It's an asshole move.
*  Taking a kid and you're ruining his life.
*  And try to understand.
*  You want to be an asshole or not.
*  Try to understand why that person made that decision in administration, why the system
*  has that kind of punitive component to it.
*  I mean, that's what our whole incarceration, the capital punishment only in America,
*  if all the civilized, that's so horrific and stupid and expensive.
*  And now even, you know, most conservatives now agree that that is the case and when
*  hopefully we're drumming it out.
*  Well, what about the death penalty for mass murder?
*  Crazy.
*  What do you do for someone like, um, a gain?
*  It doesn't matter what they did, Joe, because you can't prove if you, 1% of the numbers
*  are like 4% of people who were killed were innocent.
*  That percentage, everybody agrees, is way too high.
*  Some people like if it was only 1% in the, in the community that debates these issues.
*  But as long as it's 4% of people are innocent, you can't have that system for that reason.
*  Regardless of the penalty, A and B, no one's thinking when they're murdering someone about
*  what the penalty for murder is going to be.
*  That's not why they're doing it.
*  Doesn't it does not work as a deterrent.
*  There's a ton of research on that.
*  It's silly.
*  It's silly that you think, well, I'm not going to murder this person because I'm going to
*  go to jail for like, that's not why you don't murder somebody.
*  No, nobody wants to murder another person.
*  But what do you do with that person?
*  Do you just put them in a cage for the rest of their life?
*  No, you rehabilitate them.
*  You rehabilitate John Wayne Gacy?
*  Yes.
*  Or you take your guy who fucks kids and kills them.
*  There's a hole in his basement and leaves the kids there.
*  If you can't rehabilitate him, you put him in a humane place cage.
*  You don't kill him.
*  That's what I mean.
*  But you're killing him.
*  You're just killing him real slow with life.
*  You're separating him from freedom and you're locking him up in a cage.
*  You have to separate him from freedom if he's raping kids.
*  I agree with that.
*  Right.
*  But if you know for a fact that he did it.
*  But you can rehabilitate people.
*  Hold on.
*  You're killing him either way.
*  You're either killing him with nature and time or you're going to kill him.
*  If you're going to leave him in this cage and he's innocent,
*  that's almost worse than killing him.
*  If you kill him, it's quick.
*  If you're going to leave him in that cage and he's actually one of the 4% that's in.
*  I'm for letting him kill himself.
*  Okay.
*  You're not going to let him kill himself.
*  Yeah.
*  Give him a...
*  Give him...
*  Unless he gets...
*  It's like, listen, here's a rope.
*  He gets exteemed.
*  Here's a rope.
*  If you can make a rope swing and I'll give you a swing and you can swing on it if you want.
*  That's what I get there.
*  I mean, I don't...
*  It's...
*  The problem is you're trying to find a binary answer to a messy question.
*  No, I don't think it's a messy question.
*  My answer is no.
*  I don't believe in the state, by the way.
*  If your kid...
*  The state exec...
*  That's the state executing people.
*  Yeah.
*  By John Wayne Gacy.
*  And they've found your kid in the basement of John Wayne Gacy's house.
*  You wouldn't want him dead?
*  I can't deal with that hypothetical.
*  I can't either.
*  I'm not doing that.
*  I'll think for someone else and I'll say yes.
*  John Wayne Gacy definitely killed a bunch of his kids.
*  A lot of people...
*  I don't think the people...
*  I mean, this is worst case scenario.
*  We're playing a thought game.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  It's a great part...
*  It's a thought experiment.
*  It's a hypothetical.
*  And I just wouldn't...
*  If someone was in that situation, if they're a parent in Newtown, I think a lot of those
*  parents...
*  I mean, this guy who was killed in the Charleston church shooting...
*  I don't say these maniacs' names into microphones.
*  But the Charleston shoot...
*  The white supremacist one started the Civil War, shot all those black people.
*  Obama went down there and sang Amazing Grace.
*  It's lovely.
*  Remember that when we were to recover from horrible disasters with the president singing
*  Amazing Grace?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, you remember 9-11.
*  But those people forgave that shooter.
*  They forgave him for killing...
*  All those black people forgave that white man and were the greatest role models of actual...
*  Christians behaving Christian, by the way.
*  And I think that you can forgive.
*  I think that that doesn't have to be a religious tenet.
*  I think that you can forgive and you can rehabilitate.
*  But I won't buy...
*  You know, in the hypothetical situation...
*  Obviously, I would, by the way, I would defend my...
*  I would kill anybody who ever threatened my family.
*  I would have no problem with that.
*  I'm not morally against that.
*  Yeah, it's a different thing than killing someone that you've got detained
*  when deciding that their life is over.
*  Yeah, I don't think the state should be responsible for that.
*  And the idea that we would give the state the trust...
*  The most horrific shit is when you find out that the DA withheld information that would lead to
*  the exoneration of someone or that they're unjustly incarcerated and one of the cops...
*  Happens all the time.
*  That's one of the most horrific injustices in this country.
*  And obviously, it's got a racial component to it and it's horrible.
*  And the justice system is obviously...
*  That's a really interesting thing to talk about.
*  And constitutional law is a fascinating thing for people studying this idea that
*  we argue about the Second Amendment.
*  Like, let's let constitutional lawyers, I think, discuss a lot of those things and
*  we should all understand that and be curious about it.
*  But I would...
*  Our constitution is also silly.
*  Like, let's remake everything.
*  Like, let's have that conversation.
*  It's so much better that we can do.
*  Have a serious conversation about what kind of guns and bullets people can have.
*  Not that they can have them or that they can't have.
*  Like, that's the conversation.
*  That's where we should be right now.
*  Everything gets regulated.
*  Everything...
*  There are trade-offs in healthcare.
*  There are trade-offs in everything.
*  But Americans now are so divided.
*  They want everything that they want.
*  That compromise is something that we don't do as Americans, much less in government.
*  That's preposterous.
*  The Democrats that demand purity or anybody that is doing that, you don't agree with me.
*  You're wrong.
*  Hold on.
*  That's not...
*  You don't have any relationships with people in your real life like that.
*  Like, my wife and I don't agree on a lot of stuff.
*  But I love her.
*  I adore her.
*  Well, it's what we talked about before.
*  They're on teams.
*  And you want your team to win, so you state...
*  Why do you want your team to win?
*  It's a natural thing with human beings.
*  All right.
*  I agree with that.
*  What I'm saying about the gun thing, the most fucked up part about the messiness of the gun thing
*  is that even if you made guns illegal, even if you said you can't have any bullets,
*  you'll all go to jail, there's so many guns.
*  You're not getting them all.
*  It's not possible.
*  There's more guns than there are people, which means there's more than
*  330 million guns in this country alone.
*  It's absolutely the most important point in the discussion.
*  That's a nutty number, man.
*  You really stop and think about that number.
*  You're like, what?
*  Is that real?
*  But you don't really stop the behavior by necessarily creating certain laws about why
*  someone might behave a certain way and shoot people.
*  That's not going to necessarily change.
*  What you do is you do limit the access to certain types of weapons and rounds of ammunition, right?
*  The real question is why would someone do that, right?
*  That's the number one question.
*  You're like limiting...
*  It's a harder question to answer.
*  The easier question to answer is make them less accessible.
*  Yes, if you could make them less accessible.
*  We can't figure out or solve.
*  If you could make them less accessible.
*  The president would blame, I mean, to get political, but there's no data on the video game argument.
*  There's no data on that.
*  The video game argument is interesting because I've had soldiers bring it up to me, including
*  Dakota Meyer.
*  Yeah, I heard that conversation.
*  I'm willing to have it.
*  I don't think it necessarily makes sense that people would act out in a certain way that's
*  horrific because of video game, but if they were already inclined to violence to begin with,
*  maybe they already had a fucking short circuit and then they get desensitized to violence in movies
*  and violence in video games, does that have an impact on them?
*  I'm not the guy to answer that question.
*  Whether or not it has an impact on them is...
*  But it's a variable.
*  It is.
*  But it's a variable that I think merits discussion.
*  I don't know if it's true or not.
*  Here's why I don't think it is.
*  Because...
*  You don't think it merits discussion?
*  Well, let me make this point and then you decide if you think it merits discussion.
*  Okay.
*  The violent video games are played at far higher rates in Japan and they don't have
*  the gun violence we have.
*  It's a good point.
*  They have a very different culture though.
*  They don't have access to guns.
*  That's true.
*  That's it.
*  But they don't also have a lot of...
*  They've had a few mass scabbings.
*  It's the access...
*  I've shotguns.
*  I shoot guns.
*  I have nothing but respect for hunters.
*  I grew up in a hunting community.
*  But I mean, I don't know.
*  I don't think that there's much past the conversation about accessibility to
*  guns that can fire that many rounds that quickly, killing that many people.
*  I don't think...
*  We have to get rid of those somehow.
*  But I agree.
*  How do you do it?
*  Yeah, that's the question.
*  That's the most important point.
*  There's already 330.
*  There's more guns than there are people.
*  So what do you do?
*  So by the way, I think you buy as many as you can back for sure.
*  You spend a whole bunch of taxpayer money.
*  Just help...
*  By the way, there's a ton of people in a bind right now that have a rifle.
*  Like, oh my God, I'm not going to be able to afford my insulin.
*  Let me get rid of this AK-47 to live another month.
*  You buy some guns back.
*  It's a good expenditure of money.
*  And then melt them down and turn them into furniture for people.
*  So if you wanted to do that without changing the Second Amendment,
*  like you just have a buyback where you just offer people the opportunity to make some money by
*  giving their guns up.
*  Well, the Second Amendment has been interpreted wrong by the Supreme Court, in my opinion.
*  I mean, it doesn't say that people should have...
*  Until 2008, it didn't say that.
*  Nobody thought that, that people should have a personal right to guns till the Heller case.
*  But so I don't think you even need to talk about the Second Amendment.
*  People just need to agree that these guns shouldn't be sold.
*  Well, you need to talk about the Second Amendment.
*  I mean, it's a big conversation.
*  No, because people can have guns.
*  You can have guns.
*  The Brick has a right to have guns.
*  You just can't have these guns anymore.
*  No more of those ones.
*  You can have all these guns.
*  There's regional restrictions anywhere, right?
*  Like in New York City, you can't have a handgun.
*  Yeah, they work.
*  You can't even...
*  I don't think you can have a switchblade in New York City.
*  Yeah, Cyrus Vance, the DA there, is like...
*  It's terrified that they're changing.
*  The federal government has changed the law because he knows that those gun laws in New York
*  work really well.
*  And by the way, people always make the argument,
*  well, they have those gun laws in Chicago and there's a ton of violence.
*  That's because Chicago's on the board of Indiana.
*  It doesn't have them.
*  Guns go across the border just fine.
*  That's the...
*  The gun laws work.
*  They work.
*  Well, Chicago is also in the middle of a bitter drug war.
*  Well, yeah.
*  I mean, that's where the violence is coming from.
*  But people should have less accessibility to those types of guns.
*  Like every other civil society in the world.
*  Come on.
*  This is like...
*  But it goes back to what you were talking about before.
*  Like that drugs, if they were legal, you wouldn't have that sort of a drug war.
*  Right.
*  For sure, it's the root of most of the violence in the inner cities and obviously in Mexico.
*  Yeah, it's black markets.
*  It's the illicit drug.
*  Yeah, they're making tons of money on that.
*  What is the Second Amendment exactly as it's written?
*  The right to bear arms shall not be infringed.
*  So how do you think that the Supreme Court misinterpreted that?
*  That in the 2008 al-A'la case, everybody should just...
*  I would plug the work of Eric Siegel, who said...
*  The well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state.
*  Comma.
*  The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
*  Yeah, those commas get argued by...
*  I know.
*  ...constitutional scholars.
*  For days, days on time.
*  But the Supreme Court didn't decide until 2008 that Americans had a right to have their own
*  weapon.
*  That's such a crazy statement.
*  Like when you read it, it's so interesting because we're going back in time, trying to
*  figure out how people in 1776 thought about guns and whether or not that applies to us.
*  Because if it doesn't apply to us, we have to think on 1789.
*  If it doesn't apply to us, we have to think, well, then who gets to decide?
*  Like one of the reasons why...
*  We get to decide as a society on any of these things.
*  One of the reasons why it's so interesting...
*  Is what I want to believe.
*  One of the reasons why it's so interesting to read these things is like we have, for
*  whatever reason, when things get written into stone or carved into a stone or written onto
*  a document like the First Amendment, like the freedom of expression, that is...
*  We have it.
*  So we all agree on it.
*  Freedom of speech.
*  We don't want to change it.
*  Yeah, freedom of speech, freedom of expression, whatever.
*  We want to hold onto that.
*  We want to keep that.
*  Sure.
*  This is our law.
*  All humans do.
*  In the Second Amendment, the right to have a gun.
*  That's our law.
*  We got it written down.
*  Look, look, look, it's written there.
*  So they'll study these ancient words like scrolls, like they go over these scrolls and
*  look at the commas and look at the words.
*  Yeah.
*  Shall not be infringed upon.
*  What did they mean?
*  That's fascinating.
*  It is fascinating, but I think that they didn't mean this, Joe.
*  I think that...
*  How could they?
*  They didn't know what this is.
*  They didn't.
*  And the whole gun thing is a racket to make money.
*  That's what that is.
*  It's a way...
*  You sell fear.
*  Like, I mean, home invasion is any family's worst fear, but it doesn't happen very much,
*  nor does kidnapping, nor do all a lot of these crimes that all my helicopter...
*  Our generation of parents is helicopter parents terrified of everything, not...
*  That's true.
*  That's true.
*  Not letting their kids go outside.
*  You're right.
*  Come on.
*  Thinking that your kid's going to get kidnapped, you don't know anybody who had their kid kidnapped.
*  You're...
*  But you're generalizing because home invasions do happen sometimes.
*  Right, but that's not how we should make laws.
*  But we don't have to exist like everybody's going to kidnap your kid
*  or everyone's going to break into your home.
*  But I'm saying those kind of...
*  The balance is that sometimes it's real.
*  That's why people want to be able to have guns,
*  because sometimes someone can break in your house and people have defended their house
*  and their property with guns.
*  Sure, but is it a way...
*  Is it a realistic threat or is it something that the gun industry creates these amazing
*  ads and scares the shit out of people?
*  Oh, come on, man.
*  Crime's real.
*  Whether they make ads or not, crime is still real.
*  I think the clear point is the reason why we have so many guns in America
*  is because there's so much money to be made off of them.
*  I think we could absolutely limit them and regulate them and have a thoughtful conversation.
*  I think that's where most people are at, although I hate that generalization.
*  There's something to that, but there's also something to the reason why we have so many cars.
*  People like them.
*  I'll have that conversation.
*  We should get rid of all the cars.
*  Okay.
*  Well, I mean, we're not.
*  Don't get me wrong.
*  That seems ridiculous.
*  Why should we get rid of all the cars?
*  Do you not like freedom or do you have a better solution?
*  Are you going to transport places?
*  I don't have a better solution, but there should be one,
*  or I think that we are killing ourselves with all the cars.
*  The pollution is...
*  Okay, but you can get an electric car.
*  Make them electric.
*  Yeah, then that's fine.
*  I think I would be fine.
*  I have a Chevy Volt since 2012.
*  I have solar panels.
*  I'm trying to be the change I want to see in the world.
*  If I'm coming off as...
*  I'm a complete hypocrite on all of it.
*  I eat meat and I do all kinds of things.
*  I think having a thoughtful conversation about guns and why they're each part of our culture
*  and not another culture, the way that other cultures and countries regulate their weapons,
*  the problems that they have, our problem, sure, we should talk about mental health,
*  but the problem with that conversation that people don't want to have is everything costs money.
*  That's why you have to pay taxes.
*  Paying taxes is the price of civilization.
*  What does that have to do with mental health?
*  You have to pay for people to help people.
*  You can't advocate in government, Republican or Democrat, for the...
*  This is what, unfortunately, Trump and Republicans have advocated.
*  Let's get mental health solutions to the violence.
*  Let's do that.
*  And everybody's behind that except they cut the Obamacare programs that funded mental health.
*  It's just you can't do...
*  You have to spend the money providing mental health.
*  It is a problem.
*  It should be addressed, but it's not...
*  The main issue is definitely the guns and the bullets in them.
*  Well, the main issue is the person that's capable of shooting people with the guns and the bullets.
*  No, it's the guns and the bullets.
*  The guns and the bullets are inanimate objects.
*  Without a person pulling the trigger, we're talking nonsense here.
*  They're not going to just shoot themselves.
*  The main problem is someone who's willing...
*  People shoot themselves.
*  The main problem is someone who's willing to grab the gun and shoot people, right?
*  We agreed.
*  We both agree there's problems with having guns.
*  But don't you think the main problem is the person who actually shoots people?
*  I think that in every other country in the world, they don't have this problem
*  because they don't have the guns.
*  That's where I start and end on the argument.
*  Okay.
*  Why is that wrong?
*  That might be the case that they don't have the guns,
*  but there are places that do have guns and they don't have a lot of mass shootings.
*  Canada is one of them, right?
*  No, they don't have the type of guns we have up there.
*  They have a lot of guns.
*  They do, but they don't have AK-47s with unlimited rounds.
*  They don't have...
*  That's crazy.
*  It's crazy.
*  Do you think they have more or less limitations?
*  I've shot those guns.
*  They're awesome.
*  I get it.
*  Do you think they have more or less limitations to what firearms they're allowed to have in Canada?
*  I believe the Canadian gun laws are far stronger, more regulated.
*  I think they just tried passing something...
*  Really recently, Trudeau announced something that was going to severely limit...
*  This is very recent.
*  Severely limit the type of firearms you could have,
*  including things that can have multiple rounds in chambers and certain types of
*  guns that are used right now as hunting rifles.
*  So there was a big pushback about that.
*  This was really recently.
*  There's always...
*  See if you can find that?
*  The conversation about like the freedom, like the Second Amendment to me is...
*  It's just your interpretation.
*  Fine.
*  Whatever your interpretation is, is fine.
*  That's what's interesting about it is it is.
*  It's a healthcare issue.
*  It's so extreme.
*  It's really...
*  If you want to know the answer to healthcare, it's usually talk to public health experts.
*  They have those answers.
*  They have the research, but...
*  Hold on.
*  What research?
*  On what?
*  Well, they don't have enough research on gun violence, unfortunately.
*  What are you talking about then?
*  I'm talking about if you want to know the solutions for what is impacting
*  and creating death by any measure, accidental death...
*  Right, but we're talking about gun violence, right?
*  What healthcare professionals have the solutions to gun violence?
*  I think a lot of healthcare solutions...
*  I think certainly surgeons have argued for why certain ammunition
*  has destroyed the inside of the body and unsurvivable.
*  I think public health officials have argued, certainly pediatricians all argued this idea
*  that you can't ask a parent if they have a gun in the house because the gun lobby
*  is against that because they're building this conspiracy that the government is going to track
*  your gun.
*  That's terrible.
*  Your pediatrician has to ask you, do you have a pool?
*  Where do you keep the poison?
*  Where are the guns?
*  Because God forbid, you're not responsible enough or educated enough to know that that
*  kid might accidentally get that gun and it happens all the time.
*  There's a rule against that.
*  Yeah, public health officials and doctors and physicians are pretty much on the same case
*  with this issue.
*  These guns and mental health, I think experts too.
*  I don't know, maybe there's a large disagreement.
*  And if there is, I'm happy to be wrong about this or any dumb shit I've said.
*  What you're saying is that these public health officials
*  would be able to make these guns less lethal by banning certain types of ammunition because
*  it's destroying people and checking to see if the parents know if they have a gun or where the gun
*  is or how it's treated, how it's locked up.
*  How do you feel like public officials, public health officials could have any impact on that?
*  Well, public health experts are their entire responsibility is to keep people safe from
*  sickness and death.
*  So they have to-
*  If you have any bullets at all, they're lethal, right?
*  So do you want to have bullets that are less lethal?
*  I think that could be a law, for sure.
*  Why not?
*  Less lethal.
*  Yeah, to human bodies?
*  Yeah, we shouldn't be killing each other with bullets all the time.
*  A bullet will stop anybody, a blunt or whatever it is.
*  I don't understand the arguments about ammunition, but the point about-
*  But you brought it up.
*  That's why I brought it up.
*  Fine. Public health experts will look at what is creating sickness and death.
*  Okay.
*  Car accidents.
*  What I'm saying to you is that I think it's disingenuous to say that public health officials
*  have an answer to why we're having so much mass violence.
*  I don't think anybody has an answer.
*  I think we're terrified.
*  And I think we could say it's- if they didn't have guns, they wouldn't be able to do it.
*  You're right.
*  And I could say if these people weren't mentally handicapped or filled with-
*  I shouldn't say handicapped, mentally compromised, filled with-
*  All kinds of demons.
*  All kinds of demons.
*  All sorts of different medications that are fucking with their judgment.
*  Maybe, yeah.
*  Abuse, all sorts of traumatic experience in childhood.
*  There's a lot of factors.
*  Sure.
*  No one has any idea why someone who is abused and who's fucked up is capable of making that leap.
*  We have some thoughts on it. That's all.
*  We have some thoughts on it and we talk about it endlessly.
*  And you're right.
*  If no one had a gun, there would be no issue with that.
*  You wouldn't be able to mass shoot people.
*  But would we still have fucked up people that are lashing out trying to hurt people?
*  I think we would.
*  Of course we always will.
*  But we have to fund mental health.
*  We have to fund research.
*  No one's arguing with you.
*  Yeah, a lot of people are.
*  No, I'm not.
*  I think you should.
*  I think we should-
*  Not only should we completely change the way we spend money.
*  Mental health, it should be a top priority.
*  We should think about having four-hour work days being mandatory.
*  Done.
*  I think we should help people.
*  They just did an experiment, Microsoft did in Japan, in fact.
*  And they found that a four-day work week increased productivity by 40%.
*  I think a lot of people, maybe this is their culture,
*  or maybe this is a specific instance, the type of people that would get a job at Microsoft.
*  But what you're dealing with for most people is beaten down shells that are tired-
*  Tie all that together, go back to the gun argument,
*  argue for the four-hour work week and any other type of benefits that
*  civilized nations around the world, especially in Scandinavia,
*  have studying that culture is really interesting and what they do.
*  And you realize that there's any number of things that you can do to help people.
*  And you have to be able to fund those solutions.
*  And people don't want to do it.
*  Right. People don't want to pay more taxes,
*  but they also have a distrust in the way the government spends their money.
*  So it becomes a catch-22.
*  I'm sorry.
*  Even if they wanted things to be better, they don't trust the government to spend their money.
*  If you work hard and you make X amount of dollars and the government wants 45% of it-
*  That's always a fair argument, but there's not necessarily a better way.
*  I give you that argument, but we have to come together as a deciding
*  great. This is how we're going to spend money on a fire department, on schools, and so on.
*  Yeah. Well, no one's arguing.
*  Yeah. But the rest of the world, why is so many other places, Scandinavia, happier than us?
*  One of the reasons is we have to worry about getting shot.
*  We should not have to worry about that.
*  We have to worry about health insurance.
*  We should not have to worry about that.
*  We have to worry about getting paying for our education.
*  Those are things that other people in other countries don't have to be as concerned about.
*  They're happier. They're more relaxed.
*  Well, they're also way smaller. It's like Idaho versus the entire United States of America.
*  And you're right about a lot of this stuff.
*  But that's not how you study it. Socio-economics says something different
*  about the size of the country matters, but-
*  It's a huge factor. It's affecting the way people behave. I mean, they've done studies
*  where they've taken cameras and they put them on opposite ends of the street and they can
*  tell by how fast people walk and they can tell by how many syllables they say in a minute,
*  exactly the number of people that are in that city.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a direct correlation between large groups of people and hostile behavior,
*  fast thinking, moving quickly, talking quickly, being impatient.
*  All those things contribute to a less healthy society.
*  When you deal with a small country that has less people, you have less of that.
*  But it still doesn't change the idea, even if we disagree on that,
*  that looking at how other nations, societies, neighborhoods, by the way, forget about that.
*  Don't make it about America. What's this city over here doing?
*  What's this community doing over here? Mayors are working together really effectively to solve
*  problems in cities. They have these unions all the time. He's coming together. And they're doing
*  a lot of good work. Communities can copy other communities, but if you look at, we so often talk
*  about our national system, and that's generally what we're talking about with many of these issues
*  here. You look at Scandinavia, people are happier there. Why?
*  I don't know if that's true. Why is that true?
*  There's so much research in it.
*  But why is it true that they're happier? What does that mean?
*  Because if you don't have to worry-
*  It's a big, big, giant generalization. There's got to be some depressed people in Scandinavia.
*  There are, of course there are.
*  So are there less?
*  Don't get me wrong, dude. They're horrid, they're suicidal. They have all kinds of problems.
*  There's places in the United States that are happier than other places in the United States.
*  Of course. Yeah, it's access to education and health care. You can't be-
*  It's also environment. It's also the beauty of their surroundings. It's also,
*  whether or not it's a small town or a large city. Yeah, I mean, there's places like Boulder,
*  Colorado, super healthy, happy places, but there's only 100,000 people there.
*  It's gorgeous.
*  I think we have to radically change the way that we live in our communities. And I think
*  there's so much interesting conversation we had about sharing everything. The car,
*  the car comes to pick you up whenever you need it and all that. You can still have your own car,
*  whatever, but just the idea of ride sharing, home sharing, communities-
*  Home sharing? You can share your house with somebody?
*  You could have, through technology, you could just have- No, you're not going to share your
*  house with somebody, but in a community, like a kibbutz of the future, surrounded by, there's a
*  place called Serenbe down south. It's got biophiliac design and everything is like renewable. The way
*  they live, everybody is just how you described. It's like a small town. Everybody's always on foot
*  walking, communicating, surrounded by nature, exercising. It's definitely better when you can
*  get that. If you can get that, it's just, it's hard to sustain large groups. I mean, there's-
*  Absolutely. There's no getting away from the number of people we have here, you know? And then,
*  like also like- You're absolutely right.
*  The smaller the group, the less minds you have that you interact with.
*  You were talking with somebody that's a scientist who lives in a van. It was a fascinating
*  conversation. Chris Ryan.
*  And I feel like you made the point about- That's my boy.
*  He's great. It was great. I was ceiling in my parents' basement listening to that show.
*  And he talked about, or you did, maybe Moore's Law?
*  I think he talked about it as well. That was pretty interesting. I never
*  heard anything like that, but about, it's only, you have to have a certain amount of people before,
*  kind of chaos- No, no, no.
*  Or corruption.
*  No, no.
*  What is it?
*  That was Dunbar's number. Dunbar's number is 150 people. Moore's Law is the law that pertains to
*  technological innovation. Oh, technological-
*  Improvement. Yeah, yeah. The-
*  Dunbar's number- The rate of improvement of
*  how technology, and that's going straight up and that's fascinating. And Andrew Yang understands
*  that and Joe Biden doesn't. That's a huge issue. Dunbar's number is the amount of people that you
*  can keep semi-intimate relationships with. And it seems to have a direct correlation
*  between ancient tribal structures. I'm fascinated by that.
*  They think it's about 150 people and more or less, I'm sure people vary. They vary in everything
*  else. Intelligence, height, people vary in everything. But this number seems to be fairly
*  consistent that you can't really have more than 150 people in your life.
*  Don't you think Thanos was right? And still be in a way with them. Yeah,
*  yeah. No, that's the problem with that movie. Thanos had a point.
*  Right. Yeah. I mean, he's a piece of shit,
*  but he had a point. The way he went about it was wrong.
*  Yeah, he's a dickhead. He killed a lot of people. He snapped that everybody died.
*  And then he wanted to live on his own island like an asshole. He has a whole planet where he lives
*  on it. And his son would always sit on his face.
*  Yeah, fuck him. And James Brolin.
*  I was glad when Thor fucked him up. Spoiler alert.
*  My daughter got to interview the co-directors as part of my old show, my favorite-
*  It's Josh Brolin, by the way. What did I say?
*  James. They're both handsome.
*  They are. But yeah, Thanos. And, but the idea-
*  That's the idea of balance. Do you think about that? Like all this stuff that we use and we
*  consume and the way that we live, I think about that a lot.
*  Yeah. I do. And I'm happy when someone like Boy On Slot comes around that has like a real
*  legitimate solution that could be implemented at large scale and could eventually be a gigantic
*  solution. Not only that, but a source of resources. So we can take this plastic and this plastic,
*  instead of being a detriment, can be used to work at certain things. Maybe the money could
*  be used from the sale of that plastic and it would go to charitable causes. Maybe it could
*  actually be a positive net benefit to the earth. If someone comes along with some technology,
*  they could do that. Why do we have in this country an argument about the future of
*  energy and the way that we live and how to create a better renewable future? Like I have no idea
*  why we're arguing. Everybody wins. We're going to make a shitload of money. The argument is that
*  if you invest in a Green New Deal, that that is a socialist idea. That's a bad idea in any way.
*  No, everybody will get rich or we're all going to die. I don't think that's what the problem is.
*  What do you think of that binary? Well, I don't think we're going to die either. I think fear
*  mongering is not helping anybody either. I think things are going to get shittier. I mean, I think
*  that's probably why Trump wanted to buy Greenland. He's like, I got an idea. Let's get up there.
*  Such a move. It would have been amazing if he pulled it off. However much time got spent.
*  It was brilliant because he came out of nowhere too. Well, because he really knows how to play
*  the media. He's like having a bad day. He's like, I'll buy Greenland. How does that sound? Okay.
*  Then we talk about it all day on the radio and on TV. It's like, well, we just lost everything
*  that you and I just discussed. All these really important issues. Not really. I think people are
*  going to solve a lot of the problems. It's going to be thoughtful people that are geniuses that
*  are going to figure out a lot of our problems. They're going to solve them. It doesn't mean we
*  should give up. I think there's going to be a way that they're going to be able to extract carbon
*  from the atmosphere. They have many different prototypes and many different theories that
*  they're working on right now. Yeah. I don't mean to sound negative. I'm on board with solving the
*  problem. I just don't want to argue. I don't want to argue about the problem. I want to have really
*  thoughtful discussions about the solutions and how we can do it, but fossil fuels have to go
*  rapidly. The problem is also that- I don't know how you do that, but they have to go rapidly.
*  The problem is also that the conversation has become ideologically driven. If you're on the
*  left, you think climate change is of the utmost importance. If you're on the right, you're supposed
*  to at least slightly dismiss it as- I think that's a bizarre binary course. It's the most
*  important thing. But it's what we do with everything. What we do with abortion. What we do with murder.
*  It's the planet. I understand. I always put it like, people will be sensitive about sexism
*  or racism. Oh, easy for you to say, white guy. No, I'm not dismissing what's most important
*  directly to you. I'm looking at it in the aggregate of our species. It's the planet.
*  The emergency bells are ringing. We have to stop burning fossil fuels. We have to. Dude,
*  it burns here every couple of months. Like crazy burns. It's horrific. It's like we get evacuated.
*  Think of a hellscape should look like on film. You guys are living through it. Dude, I've been here
*  for 20 plus years. 25, I think. 25 years. It's never been like this. Where every four or five
*  months a fire erupts. And there's a feeling that you have when a fire erupts that's real weird,
*  man. Explain it because I think it's important to people. I've been evacuated three different times.
*  And there's a feeling that comes over you. Like first of all, there's, in my case,
*  I can only speak for myself, there's a releasing of any, like you don't, no importance is attached
*  to anything other than your kids and your wife. And you know, just get the fuck out of there.
*  The dog, whatever you got to do, get the fuck out of there and realize, look, you're a human
*  who's doing well living in the United States of America. You already got four aces. Just get the
*  fuck out of there. Stay alive. Don't worry about your house. Don't worry about your car. Just get
*  out. Go. That's number one. And two is the intense fury of nature. And when I saw the last ones,
*  when I got evacuated last year, our fucking neighbors, three of the houses burnt down
*  right across the street from my house. So here's my house. This house, this house, this house are
*  gone. And there was hundreds of houses all throughout Malibu. There was like 600 houses
*  burnt to the ground, man. And it's a fucking terrifying scene. There was a woman, we played
*  a video, there's a woman who was trying to drive to go get her horses and she was driving through
*  a firestorm, screaming and filming it at the same time. And the fucking embers are flying.
*  I think she had one of those dash cam things on. Why? Uh oh. Well, I mean, but you're talking about
*  a community, one community out here and you're talking about really affluent people so they
*  should care. They're homeless, their property. No man, it's everybody, dude. Yeah. But I'm talking
*  about Katrina. Like it's hurricanes, it's wildfires. And the impoverished nations
*  are suffering the most because they're burning the most fossil fuels and they have the least
*  resources. And we, meanwhile, are having everything we want. And I think that that's like also kind of
*  just a holistic spirit. We should have, we should use less. It's a philosophical debate for sure,
*  but we should have it. We can use less and be happier even in so many different ways. I'm not
*  sure. I don't think that's going to stop the fires though. I don't know what you're saying.
*  Fires are coming because it's getting warmer. No, it's climate change is the issue I'm talking about
*  and it's, and it's people. But using less, it's like maybe. Yeah, but sustainability. Reusing.
*  I mean, the problem is gigantic. The problem needs to be addressed on a global scale. Green new deal.
*  It's the whole thing. It's not addressed on a global scale. China and India and all these other
*  countries that are still polluting at a fucking rapid rate, they're not contributing to this.
*  Every one of those countries is in the Paris climate. Every one of them. Only we aren't.
*  And we just made it official and it's a dagger to the planet, but do not give up and fight every day
*  to create solutions and care about it. That's what we should be in the streets for. Read Bill
*  McKibben. Read. Oh, I don't know if we need to be in the streets for this, but I think you're right.
*  You don't think that we should be out in the streets. Do you think that's really going to
*  stop people from burning coal? Do you think that's going to stop people from? Yeah, I think it's
*  working. I think the divestment movement has worked really, really effectively. 350.org is a
*  very effective organization to get the fossil. But you're talking like I'm arguing with you.
*  I'm sorry. I mean, I'm not. Dude, I mean, I think we're all on this together. Joe, that's my tone.
*  I'm sorry. No, it's okay. But it's like whenever I say something, you're talking, like, we're talking
*  about here is there's a bunch of different solutions, but no one's arguing with you saying,
*  don't do that one or don't do this one. What I'm saying is we got a real gigantic problem
*  globally. And to just do less is not going to stop these fires. We're already in it. It's
*  already happening. Like we have to figure out a way to protect ourselves. You're absolutely right.
*  That's actually probably the smartest thing that either of us has said in this conversation. It's
*  my issue, obviously. Yeah, we have to adapt. We have to find solutions to adapt in ways to live.
*  And that's what I'm talking about in terms of sustainability and biophilic design and
*  architecture and just infrastructure in general. Like we have to do that. I feel like it's our
*  responsibility to our kids. We have to be mobile. You know, one of the things that always freaks me
*  out is I study a lot of ancient history and I'm really interested in these civilizations that they
*  find. Like when, you know, like for some reason, like a storm takes away some water and moves to
*  a different place, they find some structure underneath the water they didn't know existed
*  before. And you realize like, oh, Jesus, there was a city here at one point in time.
*  Right. This happened several times in our history. Pompeii? Yeah, I mean, that's a good one. That's a
*  volcano one. But there's a bunch of these places that used to be like during the time of the Bering
*  Land Bridge, right? There was the water was much lower and that was only like, what was that?
*  I don't know. 12,000 years ago, I think. There was a whole country. Like people don't know that. That
*  was a goddamn country. There was a country that the way we describe it today. Wait, there's a
*  nation of people living? No, they called it the Bering Land Bridge was a place called Beringia.
*  Like I didn't even know this. I was listening to this book on tape by my friend Steve Rinella
*  about, it's called the American Buffalo. I think it's called American Buffalo. Sounds awesome. It's
*  an amazing book, but it's about the history of wildlife and Native Americans and what changed
*  and like that these people who migrated here from Siberia, how long it took them to do it
*  and that it wasn't even migration. We think of it as migration, but it wasn't. They were just
*  following food and it was a slow process over thousands of years. But we think of it as like
*  they're going across a bridge. It wasn't a bridge, man. It was a fucking country. Well, that's what's
*  happening. There was so little, look how big it was. There was so little water because of the ice
*  age that you could walk through this Beringia area. It was fucking thousands of miles wide.
*  Like it was huge. One of the issues in Central America is just what you're describing. It's
*  climate change right now in Central America. The coffee growers can't grow their coffee. They can't
*  grow drugs by the way and they can't grow their coffee. So what are they doing? What you just
*  described, they're walking up through Mexico and they're being demonized. The only thing they're
*  guilty of is they can't grow their crop. Well, we have this thing that we're doing now. But that's
*  because of climate change. Forgive me. That's because the soil down there is drying up. That's
*  what's going to happen. And it's forced migration and talking about adaption, to me that's the most
*  interesting thing about what your point was. But how do we adapt to people migrating away from these
*  areas that are, and how do we live in America on the coasts and in California? Like that's really-
*  You're going to have to move. All those assholes that have houses on the beach-
*  Upstate New York, baby.
*  In those pokey things that stick into the ground.
*  Distilts the giant.
*  These people are hilarious.
*  Yeah. What is-
*  Like you're so cocky.
*  Who's buying that house? Those houses are like 10 million bucks, man.
*  I feel that way to some extent by even going up in a sky rise at Sierra Six-Eleven,
*  Oregon, on the 37th floor. I'm like, this is silliness.
*  Silliness.
*  Why am I all the way up in the sky? I don't want to work. That brought me a sense of
*  unhappiness. I don't want to work or live in the sky. These people live way up. I don't like that.
*  It's scary. It's a great view though. That view is sick.
*  Yeah, but-
*  It can really give you a little brain tingle, make you excited about writing.
*  Look at all those people. I'm so high up here.
*  Dance everywhere.
*  It gives you ideas.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I feel like anytime you get some sort of surge of ideas,
*  it can be translated into some sort of a push of creativity.
*  Always.
*  Yeah. And sometimes-
*  It's lovely when it happens.
*  A great view is a kicker. It kicks you in the balls and keeps going.
*  I think, like, what's your best one?
*  Views?
*  I'm like, where you've had one of those.
*  I'm a mountain person. I love mountains. I fucking love it, man. Fuck paintings.
*  Paintings can suck a dick.
*  Oh, is that right?
*  I like looking at mountains.
*  Is that right? You won't-
*  I mean, paintings are cool. I like paintings.
*  But we-
*  This place is filled with artwork.
*  Yeah.
*  What I'm saying is that to me, there's no comparison.
*  Like, a mountain view with a lake in the background, that to me is like,
*  whatever it is about my DNA, that to me just draws me in.
*  Where's the place you were in nature that you felt the most just happy, connected?
*  I've felt it a lot of different places.
*  Great answer, first of all.
*  I'm a big fan of Colorado's mountains. I'm a big fan of the mountains of Utah.
*  I love mountains.
*  That park in Vancouver was for me.
*  Park in Vancouver, which park?
*  Have you ever been in that big park? It's like Park City.
*  James, could you look up that? I'm so embarrassed.
*  It's bigger than Central Park?
*  Yeah, I think it's bigger. I think the same guy might have designed it.
*  But it's got beach, mountains, lakes.
*  That's one of the best moves about New York City. They've got a giant park in the middle of it.
*  That was brilliant. The guy who designed it is a fascinating guy.
*  Oh, that's so smart. It changes everything.
*  Yeah.
*  When you're in that park, you're like, I know this is bullshit. It's not really nature.
*  I found myself.
*  Nature trapped, but it's good enough. It's good enough.
*  By the way, that was so well described. Nature trapped. I feel that way.
*  It's by the way why I feel on resorts. When I go to resorts, I'm like, this isn't it.
*  This is not Turks and Caicos, right?
*  Yeah. Nature is only nature when it's connected to bears and shit.
*  If you just keep going in the woods, something can eat you.
*  If it's not, then it's nonsense.
*  What you're in in Madison, well, there's one thing though. They do have coyotes now
*  in Central Park, which is really amazing.
*  What is the concern about them? We've got coyotes.
*  They're wolves.
*  Yeah, but what are they doing? People are like, we get coyote alerts.
*  They'll bite your kids.
*  Where they really, forgive my ignorance, folks. If you just lost your dog to a coyote,
*  now I feel like a douche.
*  Well, people's kids do get bitten.
*  They will take people out upon occasion.
*  But I mean-
*  A woman who was 19 years old in Vancouver, in fact, was killed by-
*  Stanley Park.
*  A pack of coyotes.
*  Shit happens.
*  I know, but that's why you worry about them in your city.
*  You don't want them eating your kids.
*  Fair enough. You actually answer my question.
*  Look at that fucking park, man. It's beautiful.
*  That park is where I had an experience. I agree with you.
*  The mountains and the Rockies in general, Colorado has got to be for me.
*  Yeah, parks are close. That's close because it's kind of like attached to the water.
*  The ocean's there and you got all the trees and shit.
*  Oh man, what a beautiful place.
*  The real deal for me though is when you're out in real wilderness and you run into real
*  wild animals-
*  No, human creations is my art. I want to see nothing that's created by a human.
*  That's my full heaven. That's where I'm most at peace.
*  It's just something about a campfire and you're staring up at the night sky
*  and you're cooking dinner with your friends and just no one around for miles, man.
*  It's just peace.
*  Rolling down the Allagash in a Rowland-Thurlow canvas kayak.
*  Fly fishin' away, not catching anything.
*  You just see stars.
*  Yeah.
*  Why would you not want to catch anything?
*  No, that's what happened to me. The place that I went in Maine that we're describing way out
*  and we went on a fly fishing trip where I learned how to fly fish and caught zero.
*  Maine's tricky. There's a reason why Stephen King's from Maine and every one of his books
*  is horrific. There's a reason.
*  What is it?
*  It's horror.
*  What is it? I got this scar of Maine. I split my finger there.
*  There's no people, man. There's no people.
*  A bunch of comedians, me included, had a joke. We would do bits about how we'd drive from Boston
*  and there's this one stretch before you get to Bangor where Stephen King lived.
*  They did a gig there.
*  Huston College.
*  No radio. There was no radio.
*  Yeah.
*  You would hit the scan button and you would never find a signal. You're like, what?
*  And there was a full hour, I think it was 60 miles or so, 55 miles or so,
*  where there was no gas stations. So you'd get gas and then you're on your fucking own
*  for an hour of driving.
*  Love it.
*  And it was weird, man. But there was something about the people that you would run into along
*  the way. It was disturbing. They didn't have enough contact with people. You know how people
*  get rickets and they get scurvy when they don't get vitamin C? Well, people get some weird shit
*  when they don't meet enough people. When you're just out there in the woods with your uncle and
*  your cousin and that's it for your whole life and then all of a sudden you're 24, listen to me.
*  That ain't a good combination either. That's weird.
*  That is a really great idea for a bit. I mean, that guy, his social problems when he comes into
*  Fifth Avenue, he's got some weird interactive or lack of social.
*  Yeah. He didn't get the right diet.
*  But that being said, now the measurement isn't can you get a radio connection? Does your phone
*  still work? And I think everybody should, I mean, it's very dangerous. So not everybody should,
*  but if you can go with a guide, like that's real, to me, that's real human connection. That's where
*  we're supposed to be. And you should have that experience. We're so connected to our screens.
*  I feel like that's gotta be bad, but the research is not.
*  That we're connected to our screens. It's gotta be bad.
*  It's an interesting conversation.
*  No, the research is pretty solid. It's bad from, yeah, you've read Jonathan
*  Haidt's work about it? The Coddling of the American Mind? You should read it.
*  Yeah, G Twangy.
*  It's really interesting because when he discusses-
*  Yeah, I've read Coddling of the American Mind. Jonathan Haidt, yeah, he's right.
*  Okay, but it shows the consequences of these young kids that are getting involved in these
*  screens. You think that's any different with us as adults to be indoctrinated into this world of
*  social media and constantly on our screens? There's showing a direct correlation, particularly with
*  young girls. They're very vulnerable because of the pressures of social media,
*  people talking shit about each other.
*  I've seen it. I've got a 14 and 12 year old.
*  Bullying, and you're seeing a big uptick in self-harm, big uptick in suicide. These are measurable
*  statistics.
*  I think that that is pretty good on it. I'm not quite sure you mentioned-
*  The data is better than climate change.
*  It's as good as it gets. The data shows a clear line.
*  I don't know about that. I think it's a different type.
*  Dude, it shows a clear line from the invention of the iPhone to massive-
*  But that could just be a correlation with something else.
*  What a coincidence that smartphones who every fucking kid who's 11 years old and up now
*  has a smartphone and every kid that you're looking at from before had a giant decrease in suicide.
*  It may be.
*  Maybe. I would push back on that it's stronger than climate science.
*  It's pretty fucking strong.
*  Okay. Yeah. I think you're probably right. I certainly want to do something about it.
*  And I think it's a really important issue. That's why connecting to nature is the answer to that.
*  My kids have their phones in their faces all the time. I think it's terrible for so many
*  different reasons, but I'm just not sure exactly, number one, our generation of parents really
*  struggling with how to solve that. What do you do?
*  Well, now we're admitting it's real. Okay. So admitting it's a problem.
*  Oh, I completely admit it's a problem. And I do think there's a lot of data.
*  I'm just not sure about it.
*  I don't know if going to the woods is going to help it. It's going to make you feel a little
*  bit better while you're in the woods. But I don't think it's going to overall-
*  You're not-
*  There's a problem with having these goddamn devices where you're constantly addicted and
*  checking it and you're getting this little dopamine hit.
*  Yep. Yep. Jonathan Haidt wrote that with, I think, or he wrote a book about that with
*  Lenore Schenazy, who also advocated that this is the problem with parents being worried about
*  their kids too much.
*  Sure. Helicopter parenting. Yeah. Jonathan Haidt talks about that too, letting kids-
*  You've got to find your-
*  His own fear of letting his own kid walk his way home.
*  Yeah, yeah. It's real.
*  His kid was really young and he got lost and it was terrifying for a short amount of time for them.
*  But he built the life skill probably. He didn't die.
*  Yeah, maybe. It's all an interesting conversation about who we are now versus who we used to be
*  and is it better?
*  Yeah, I don't know. It's a fascinating conversation. I do think that our generation, like our kids,
*  we have more of a disconnection to what their experience is than any generation before us.
*  That's my argument. I don't know if that's true. But what did our parents have? TVs. What do we
*  have? Upgraded TVs, more channels, microwaves. But it was a gradual change. Telecommunications
*  gradually changed from beepers to phones. But then, bam, back to Moore's Law and it's just-
*  And how do we react to all this? How do we parent in this? How do we live in this? People are dying
*  looking at their phones and their cars. A lot of really serious consequences about them. I kind of
*  wish we didn't have them in a way.
*  I don't know.
*  But there's no going back to this.
*  Moore's Law specifically deals with processors, honestly, I think. I don't think it specifically
*  deals with-
*  There is technology.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  But the argument is that technology is a wrap.
*  I think it only connects to processors because I don't think they could really measure
*  innovation that well because things come along like splitting the atom. There's things that come
*  along to just fucking throw a monkey wrench at the hole.
*  Yeah, great point.
*  I don't know if there's a benefit that we're not quite aware of because I think one of the
*  things that's happening is people are way more aware of virtually everything. We can complain
*  all day that we have less freedom in terms of our ability to joke around about things and people are
*  more restrictive with language and all these things are true. But isn't it interesting that this is
*  something that's happening? So there's a pushback. So we're feeling this rejection of certain types
*  of words that we always like to use. We're feeling this rejection with certain behaviors
*  that a lot of specifically men took advantage of. We're seeing this giant change. Well, why are we
*  seeing this thing? This giant shift is because of social media and these technologies that we're
*  talking about that create problems. So the question is, will this ship right itself? Are these
*  corrections eventually going to lead to a better society? Are we going to be more understanding of
*  each other once we get over these initial growing pains, which is what we're going through right now
*  as a culture, as a society, getting accustomed to these devices and these devices and the
*  connectivity that they have? Are we going to get more responsible with them? Are we going to be
*  nicer to each other through it? We're going to recognize as we get older that, hey, being shitty
*  to someone on social media is just like being shitty to someone in person. And we shouldn't
*  support either thing. And then we develop this sort of ethic. Yeah, it's a really important set
*  of questions you just asked about social media's effect on us. I would pinpoint one just for people
*  to watch this intelligence square debate that you would love, because given your conversation that
*  you have with people, is, I think it was the motion was, is Twitter specifically good for democracy,
*  or does it create democracy? And I was on the side of, yeah, it does. And I would set examples
*  like Egypt and even China and different places where people in Iran, where people use Twitter
*  to rise up. But the argument was it's worse because on Twitter, a lie travels so fast, so rapidly,
*  and it's so believable that it creates more damage about things that didn't happen and conspiracy
*  theory than it also, you know, it's a little of both, obviously, in terms of it creating democracy.
*  You would think more speech on Twitter, it's equal, creates more democracy. How could you argue with
*  that until you hear the other argument, which is fascinating about how much disinformation travels
*  and how effective it is? Well, my answer, I think, would be the same as my answer about technology,
*  that I'm not necessarily sure it's all bad. And I think we're going through some growing pains,
*  but I think we go through some growing pains with virtually every new changing thing.
*  That's the argument that economists make. You're talking about how it affects us,
*  but the economic argument is interesting in terms of, is it Andrew Yang's argument?
*  Is the rapid technological transformation in the planet going to lead to a jobless society?
*  Right. I don't know about that.
*  A jobless society. And economists always argue what you're saying, did the cotton gin put the
*  farmer out? Did the horse put the car, all that? But the new argument that I hear from a lot of
*  people who are a billion times smart, I'm not smart. All these people are experts, they study
*  this stuff, is mostly, yeah, this is way different. The rapid change in it's absolutely automation is
*  going to kill economies around the world. Well, the numbers are crazy. Now stop and think about
*  you, right? You're a smart guy who's had a successful radio show, you do stand-up.
*  This is going to hurt in the end. No. You now are in this position where you have to adjust
*  because you've been released from your job, right? Yeah.
*  But you have options. Now imagine you're a truck driver and imagine that's all you've ever been
*  and you're 60 years old and all of a sudden they come along and say, hey man, we have these self
*  driving luxury trucks that never crash into anything. We don't need you anymore. And you
*  don't have any skills. You don't have any other way to make a living. The angst that you feel
*  right now, imagine that squared. I could not agree more with you. My perspective is,
*  mine alone, we see things as we are, not as they are. And thinking about, and this is,
*  I always talk to this about my daughters. It's a good expression.
*  My wife painted that. It's a good expression. Put it up on our wall. And so my experience,
*  it's only relative to me, but you have to widen your perspective to understand,
*  some people are struggling to just get toilet paper and understanding that.
*  And your point though about the truck driver, his skill set is narrow and maybe his education,
*  his grit, maybe doesn't know how to network. He doesn't know how to use the internet. But he
*  did a valuable job and if he's going to lose his job at 63, I don't want to live in a society that
*  worked hard. Guy worked hard his whole life. And by the way, he's paying more as a percentage of
*  his taxes as a truck driver than most of these guys in financial industry, which is a complete
*  injustice. Tax done your work. How much work you're doing? But this guy should not have to go
*  struggle and learn a new job. He's 63. Let him ride into the sunset. Give him a life right now.
*  I'd pay for that. If you get screwed out of your job with technology, create a system,
*  government where we take care of those people. It sounds romantic. It sounds wonderful. But here's
*  the problem with that. It doesn't make people feel good to just get a check. People feel like shit.
*  Absolutely. You want to have absolutely great.
*  You get depressed. By seeing you saying, ride off into the sunset, this is a euphemism for death.
*  You're going to die. I mean, you're being cute.
*  No, go for me. It's let me go be in my...
*  You're making it like the end of On Golden Pond, but it's not. That guy's going to shit himself and die.
*  No, no. Let him go fish and hunt.
*  That's great, but he's not going to be able to do that. He's going to be scratching and clawing
*  to get through life. If you're getting a thousand dollars a month, that's not enough to exist.
*  How do you feel about it, by the way? How do you feel about it?
*  I like it. I like the idea.
*  Do you think it's realistic?
*  I'm open-minded. I don't know. I don't know what's going to happen, but I think we should have all
*  possible options on the table because what's happened in our lifetime from 1994 with give
*  or take a few years, which is the invention of the commercial version of the internet,
*  right? With all those AOL and all those things that people used, it basically all started
*  sort of blossoming around 1994 with mass use. I like your jazz hands.
*  Here we are in 2019. That's not that long. That's 25 fucking years and the world is an
*  unrecognizable place. People have devices in their pockets all the time. You're recording
*  everything. Think about all the shit that Snowden figured out that they're recording every goddamn
*  phone call you make, every photo you take, every email you send. Everything's being recorded in a
*  database to use against you someday in the future. We have no idea what 25 years from now is going
*  to look like. If we really believe that we don't need universal income, and then it turns out we
*  do, we fucked up. I think we have to do it. I think we should look at all options on the table.
*  I don't know if it's the right option, and I think humanists, people that understand human
*  nature, people need something. They need a sense of purpose. Great argument. I completely agree.
*  Well made. By the way, when you say, I'm open-minded about it, that's the conversation.
*  That has to keep being the conversation. You and I have gotten into a couple of arguments about
*  little things, and it was awesome. I learned your point of view. That's the conversation and the
*  idea that somehow there's got to be a beat down, and one percent's a win, and it has to be a
*  competition. Yeah, you've got to dunk on each other. Yeah, it's entertaining, but that's the problem.
*  But it collects and likes, and it's valuable. But what do you think about the idea that
*  the automation is the main driving force putting people out of work, not this idea of immigration?
*  I think some of it is true, and some of that mindless work is also soul-sucking. So you're
*  saving someone from some assembly line job that makes them want to fucking shoot themselves.
*  I think both those things are true. I think we're looking again for a binary answer here,
*  when it's a very nuanced issue, filled with complexities and a lot of issues.
*  People like to have something to do, but the problem is sometimes people get beaten down by life.
*  Again, they're 60X whatever it is years old, and they don't know what to do. Then they can't live
*  the same lifestyle that they had when they had a job, because when they had a job, they were making
*  $1,000 a week. They're making 50 grand a year, and now all of a sudden they're making $1,000 a month.
*  So you can kind of live, but how do you live? That's why I got to plug my podcast.
*  What? You got to get to work. To keep from riding off into the sunset?
*  Yeah. I mean, so I can work. You want to work. You want to do work. I completely agree with that argument.
*  I don't have three jobs because it's healthy. I have three jobs because I'm crazy and because
*  I need to stay busy, and also because I don't trust any one of these things to stick around.
*  Do you really not? No. Never have, never will.
*  What? Now? Come on, that's irrational.
*  Never have, never will. Come on.
*  No. Never have, never will.
*  What do you need?
*  Just, I don't need anything. I don't think that way. I think now I'm doing it. While I can do it, do it.
*  Do it and do the best you can. It's going to vary. Some days I suck. Some days I'm better.
*  It's going to vary. But do the best I can. Keep doing it. But don't think it's going to last forever,
*  and don't think it's going to go away either. Don't think about it at all. But it could go away.
*  What are you doing?
*  Everything could go away. People get pulled off of YouTube all the time. You get banned from things.
*  Things happen. Weird shifts take place. Some of them are illogical.
*  People get banned for saying the most ridiculous things.
*  What weird shifts that are illogical? I'm not following you.
*  What weird shifts? Internet banning?
*  Sure. Do you know who Megan, what is her name? Megan Murphy? She's a woman who's a
*  TERF. I've talked about her too many times. She's a trans exclusionary radical feminist.
*  I don't know anything about it.
*  She doesn't think that trans women are women. I hope I'm not paraphrasing here. She doesn't
*  think that they should vote and speak on women's issues. That women are women who are biologically
*  women. Then you have a trans woman who dominates women's issues. She thinks it's fucked up.
*  And this is her perspective. She wrote on Twitter, a man is never a woman. They told her you have to
*  take it down. So she took a photo of it. Twitter did?
*  They told her she has to take it down. So she took a photo of it and reposted that photo.
*  She took a screenshot, reposted the screenshot. Then they banned her for life.
*  I have no patience for that. I had not heard about it.
*  But that's crazy. That's crazy.
*  That's not, no. How is that a pretty thought? Talk about it.
*  It's progressive nonsense ideology.
*  Not even if you can label it. I mean, I think that's what it is.
*  But that's what it is. It's ideology.
*  Yeah, but I think everybody has these, I don't want to hear that. I want to shut down speech.
*  I don't like things. Right.
*  There are some people that are really consistent, but I like to think I am.
*  But only social media companies have the power to decide whether or not a person gets to express
*  themselves to an unlimited amount of people. Well, it's an interesting-
*  And if you tell them that based on your ideology, which most people don't agree with,
*  based on your ideology, they have said enough that something that merits you taking away
*  their ability to express themselves, then I think you open up a real discussion,
*  much like the Second Amendment discussion about the First Amendment. What are we doing here?
*  What is this and what is free speech and is this a town hall?
*  And Jack Dorsey from Twitter believes it's a town hall.
*  He thinks everyone should have the ability to express themselves, but that,
*  like everything, is fucking complicated and messy.
*  It certainly is. Nadine Strossen, who I think used to be something at the ACLU, wrote a book
*  about speech and about how in Germany you're not allowed to fly the swastika.
*  And they have censorship on speech. Yeah.
*  And that it's not effective for any of the outcomes that it's intended for.
*  They also make a lot of shit porn. Is that right?
*  Germany is right. The Germans?
*  Could you use anyone in the plug or? I don't think I know any names,
*  but for whatever reason, a lot of shit. That's a thing?
*  Shit porn. That's not a thing.
*  I try to be very open-minded, but I don't understand. I'm not going to be.
*  You don't have to understand it. No, I don't.
*  But you allow people to do it, right? I would never allow people to think about,
*  of course. Yeah. That's a weird one, right?
*  Weird. Yeah, people want to shit in people's mouths and smother themselves in shit.
*  My instant reaction is what went on? What's that about?
*  Oh, hell yeah. Where's that?
*  That's true. I want that story.
*  I want that script. How do you get to that? That sounds very abusive and it sounds like
*  it's a tough thing to talk about. But no, the idea of censoring speech backfires.
*  It's just not healthy.
*  But I think people should be generally sensitive and not assholes at the same time.
*  But it's also the thing about someone saying something in print that you read on Twitter.
*  You can't even say anything back to them. You can make your own comment, but you're like,
*  fuck, this is such a shitty way to talk. It's poison.
*  Yeah, it's a shitty way to communicate. Unhelpful.
*  I don't engage in it anymore. I post things up that I think are interesting.
*  How did you evolve on it?
*  Just decided these arguments make you riled up. They're not healthy.
*  I told my daughter, hold on. I'm arguing with someone on Twitter, said it out loud.
*  I was like, oh, I'm the shittiest. That's the shittiest thing that I could be doing right now.
*  It's also unmanageable when you get to a certain number of followers. You just can't.
*  There's no way you can. It's also people are just like, they're fucking in their cubicle.
*  They're just trying to get a rise out of people. They're angry. They're bored.
*  You can't expect that everybody's existing in the same vibration that you are.
*  I woke up to a tweet that said, you're a pitiful person.
*  I was like, oh, good morning.
*  Bro, you're not. That guy's a liar.
*  No, no. It doesn't phase me at all, but it doesn't. It is fascinating that someone would
*  write such a thing. I'll click on him and be like, I wonder what his deal is. Clearly he's
*  projecting. I wonder what happened to that guy. Then you look at their picture and then you decide
*  everything about their life. Do you ever look, this is another reason I can't run for Congress,
*  I think. I want to keep doing standup and I want to talk about things like,
*  you ever look at a guy, like the guy I ran in the car from yesterday, LAX, I thought about how much
*  he jerks off for a little while. I never think about that.
*  I will sometimes look at a guy and be like, I bet that guy is good for him and whatever,
*  but that kind of, I don't know why I brought that up.
*  I'll think about that now. Every person I meet.
*  Well, you brought up shitting in the mouth. Dude, I watched a video once of this lady.
*  No, don't describe it. This lady was really into the guys
*  shitting in her mouth and she was speaking in German and they were translating it to English
*  and she was talking about all of her experiences and when the first time a guy did it and what
*  kind of diet she likes the guy to follow when he shits in her mouth. I'm like, okay, this is not
*  pleasant. I'm not enjoying this, but honestly, and this is like, it's kind of a dumb thing to talk
*  about, right? But here's why it's not. Human psychology?
*  Yeah. That's a person. That was a baby. You have daughters. I have daughters.
*  Yes. You try not to fuck them up.
*  All of a sudden this baby is 50 and she likes guys shitting in her mouth and she wears like
*  lingerie. The bar for parenting should be
*  somewhere around no shitting on other people. Then you know you've succeeded.
*  And by the way- What if you get a lot of money for it,
*  like Robert, what was his name? Robert Redford? Indecent proposal with Demi Moore?
*  Oh, a million dollars? I want to put myself out there right now.
*  Yeah. Shit on your chest for a million bucks.
*  Please tweet me. It's not that long.
*  I've got a- How long can a guy shit on you?
*  I've got a number. What's your number? What is your number?
*  Would you rather get shit on slowly every day as a clerk at Dunkin' Donuts or one giant load on
*  your chest that is like a really rough afternoon? Not even an afternoon. It's like an hour.
*  Hit me with a giant load. You shower up.
*  I think everybody says hit me with a- You go to the bar.
*  Rounds on me, boys. I just became a millionaire. Can I just shit on your chest?
*  You're impending, Eric. It's like saying that it's solid. What if it was like a diarrhea to pull-
*  Hot. Lots of variables.
*  Whatever. Let him shit all over you. Splatter.
*  All that salt water. As long as you have goggles on and you
*  get to close your mouth. There's a lot of things.
*  When those thought experiments come up, I'm always like, you wouldn't kiss a guy? Never.
*  Told my dad this. For how much money?
*  I was like, dad, a million bucks. What if you're dad?
*  He goes, no. I go, dad, that's preposterous. That's ridiculous. You got a problem.
*  He goes, no, I wouldn't do it. He calls back and he goes,
*  he tells me who- He names a guy in old Italian. He goes, Paul Sorvino. Okay, that's my answer.
*  Million bucks. He'd make out with Paul Sorvino.
*  Everybody would. What would you do with that money? You could save other people's lives.
*  You got to do it. Or you could just buy a fur coat and start balling.
*  Either way, it's a million bucks. Yeah.
*  No matter what that thought experiment is- Fly private jets until the money runs out.
*  Go everywhere. Party. I don't know if I'd do that.
*  Well, I wouldn't either. But I also wouldn't make out with Paul Sorvino. We're living in this
*  fantasy world. Why does everything have to be ethical and moral? Just have a good goddamn time.
*  White fur, like Snow Leopard or some shit. Something exotic.
*  When you say that, what do you mean, why does everything have to be ethical and moral? You
*  have your moral cup. Yeah, man. But I'm talking about making
*  out with Paul Sorvino for a million bucks. That's free money. You don't have to do good with that.
*  Oh, yeah. Don't get me wrong. Oh, yeah. You don't have to do good with that.
*  Well, everybody should. You can do whatever you want.
*  Whoever you want, of course. Paul says, listen, you want to make it
*  real shit right on your head? Just take a big meaty meatball shit.
*  That's exactly how you imagine it would be.
*  Last time I was all right in your fucking head. Bang. Extra two. Three million bucks. You had
*  a bad memory of making out with Paul Sorvino and him shit on your head. But at the end of the day,
*  the guy kept his promise and now you're rich. Did you put me in the best mood I've been in
*  in four weeks, man? Well, that's good. Let's end it with
*  this then. When are you going to start your podcast? Where are people going to be able to see it?
*  Podcast is up. It's up now.
*  Yeah, I can't say it's great. I hope you give me a chance. I'm just figuring it out. I put up one
*  with that guest, Dr. Ann Carroll. I talked to Congressman Tim Ryan about running for Congress.
*  How many have you done so far? I'm going to have a third one, hopefully,
*  in the can tomorrow with Emily Atkin, who writes the heated newsletter about climate change.
*  Excellent. But I'm taping a special. If I'm going to plug
*  anything in my hometown, I'm taping a very special stand-up special.
*  A very special stand-up special? Very special. I'm going to do a very special
*  thing. What's it going to be for? Do you have a buyer for it? Do you do it on yourself?
*  No, no. I learned on this show what Andrew Schultz did and I thought it was brilliant.
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. He's nailed it. He's nailed it. Schultz is the master.
*  I texted him and I was like, dude. He's the master.
*  I admire what you did. We don't agree on political, but that's the kind of thing. I'm like, dude,
*  he knows we don't agree. I'm like, that's brilliant. Good job.
*  What do you not agree with? I don't know. But I mean, he was on the show and we just
*  argue. About politics?
*  I don't even remember. Do you argue with everybody?
*  Yeah. You're a little argumentative?
*  Yeah, it's not a good quality. So was I agitating you?
*  No, you didn't agitate me. I like you. But you definitely were like,
*  you have an argument mode that you fall into. It's bad. It's my flaw. I hate it.
*  You can get out of that. I'm working on it.
*  Yeah. I think that you could see the change. Totally surmountable.
*  Today. But I mean, it goes back and forth. I don't want to defend it. I don't want to be
*  defensive, but I feel really, I guess I'm very sensitive about a lot of things. So I get
*  passionate and I get that tone and it's the worst thing in a relationship.
*  Oh, yeah. I mean, like it's not-
*  You don't want to be annoying. It's like what I said about podcasts. You know, that's a thing.
*  People hearing your voice, it's not just your thoughts, right? The way you express your
*  thoughts, it changes. If you express them well, in a nice way, it changes how people absorb those.
*  It sounds so simplistic, but it's true. I think when you talk about how to communicate
*  on your podcast, it's often one of the best things you do. I've learned a lot from it.
*  I've been listening to you talk about trying to understand people and listen to people you
*  don't disagree with, and I'm just sitting there beating myself up. I'm like, I got to be better
*  at that. And the idea that I would get, you know, that I was too argumentative today, it's like,
*  oh man, I'm sorry. I never want to communicate that way. I don't think it's effective. I
*  completely agree with your thoughts on it. It's completely ineffective.
*  Well, we get better at it.
*  I wonder how the pod affected me.
*  Probably got you a little jabber-jaw on.
*  What do you think?
*  That's when things changed, right? Got a little jabber-jaw on when the pod came out.
*  I started getting verbose. I knew I shouldn't have touched it.
*  Yeah, you maybe shouldn't have the second hit. I only had one. I knew. I knew.
*  This one you got to stay on the surfboard.
*  Good role modeling.
*  No, dude, it's fine. It's all good. But I think that if I've learned anything from doing this
*  podcast, it's how to be better at talking to people.
*  I've learned from listening to this podcast how to be better.
*  Yeah.
*  There's an art to it. There's a dance.
*  I completely agree with you.
*  It's like dancing with someone. You're dancing with someone in a conversation.
*  They do condition you to be argumentative in live radio. All the people who think they know.
*  Oh, the producers and shit?
*  Oh, the program directors.
*  I'm lucky. I never had a job.
*  Yeah, but I mean, it's toxic. I agree. It's a toxic way to communicate. It's not effective.
*  If you're trying to convince someone, don't do it like that.
*  No, I imagine. Imagine trying to go from being a cable news broadcaster on Fox TV,
*  like Shepard Smith, and then have him try to do a podcast. He's in that fake voice,
*  no matter what. That fake voice is coming out. I mean, they're all doing it. It's like,
*  this is the climate.
*  You're absolutely right. You're very right about that. And that's why I think your podcast,
*  by the way, is very... I think it's not the sexiest thing to talk about, but it's a huge part of why
*  this discussion is so popular because people like a thoughtful, open-minded discussion.
*  I mean, whether you agree...
*  Well, people like to think.
*  Yeah.
*  Whether they agree.
*  Some people pretend they don't, but it's really because they're bored with what they have to do
*  all day, so they don't want to think. But if you have some time and you're a curious person,
*  you like to hear other people thinking too, and you like to hear someone who's thinking
*  either in a way like, oh, I would think about that too, or in a way like you hadn't considered,
*  like, oh, this guy's making me think, or this woman's got an idea that I never considered,
*  or this guy's got a solution that I never thought was possible.
*  Yeah.
*  I try to measure... I think measuring intelligence is one great definition I've heard is
*  by how good the questions are. Like, are you curious? I've tried and still and engendered
*  my daughter's sense of curiosity about everything rather than saying, you're going to do it because
*  I'm your father and I said so. Like, I'm going to explain to you why that's... And try to, you know,
*  create critical thinking skills. And that's how I measure intelligence. How good are your questions?
*  You're really curious. I mean, that's why the art of the interview, learning something,
*  which is what I'm definitely trying to... That's what I did for 12 years in series exam. That's
*  what I want to do with the podcast. Getting people who are a billion times smarter than me.
*  I don't know anything but anything. I think it's definitely going to help you too to be free of
*  people's influence. Some production people and executives just... I work with some talented
*  people that contribute to good things. Also wondering when the day is going to come like it
*  did, where they drop the fucking hatchet on you. Don't need that every day. Always worrying about
*  that. Have it over your head. Done. So what's the name of your podcast? Stand Up With Pete
*  Downman. Oh, it's the same as your show. It's my brand. You own that? Yeah, they let me have it.
*  Serious? Can't sue you? Yeah, they like... Just get it in writing? Very gracious. Talking a lot of
*  shit about them. You get it in writing? I did not talk any shit about them. I've talked a lot of
*  shit about them. I did not. I think what they did for me was really great. But I think corporate
*  media in general is the conversation. They're all kind of in the same system. I've worked and made
*  money out of all of them. I'm excited to be independent, but I can't deny that they created
*  a platform for a really thoughtful conversation for 12 years. I can't... You don't have to. Yeah.
*  So I'm... And that... It was a good life for me. Beautiful. And now it's on to the next thing.
*  Now it's on like Donkey Kong. The Syracuse Funny Bone, November 29th and 30th. Oh shit,
*  petedominic.com. Right? petedominic.com, standupwithpetedominic.com, Twitter, Instagram.
*  Joe Rogan, I love you. I love you too, buddy. Good luck. I really admire you and what you've
*  done here. Jamie, thank you. You guys are awesome. Bye, everybody.
*  Shouldn't have taken a second hit. No, it was good, man. You sure? What's the matter, Jamie?
