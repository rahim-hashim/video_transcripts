# Joe Rogan Experience #1526 - Ali Macofsky
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [August 15, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eRR7j1OCOs)
*  Hello Ali, oh you fired up the vape? Yeah, vape. I brought two jules. Cigarettes, two
*  jules and camels. Coffee and a smoothie. I wasn't sure what to expect. What would you
*  what was your worst case scenario? Oh my god worst case scenario I pooped my pants
*  right off the bat. Have you done that before like when you get nervous? Not when
*  I get nervous but I used to well only once in college. You pooped your pants?
*  Yeah. Were you drinking? Yeah I was hungover I ate Chipotle. I ate Chipotle pretty much
*  every day in college. That's not good for your brain. It was not good at all. You were trying to learn? Yeah. Actually Chipotle like those bowls they are pretty good.
*  They're so good. Like if you get like one of those steak bowls with rice like
*  that's about as clean as you can eat. Yeah and in college it was nice because
*  you could eat like half of a bowl and be like super full and then eat the other
*  half later and you can do the tricks of getting half steak half chicken or
*  something that way they give you more. Oh is that a trick? I don't think it is a trick. I think they have like a scooper.
*  They have a scooper but if you say you want half this and half that they're not
*  gonna put half in the scooper they're putting a full scooper in there and then
*  you're getting a full pooper on the couch in college. Yeah. Sorry to hear
*  about the poop in the pants. It's alright. People are very embarrassed about that but it
*  does happen if you take chances. I feel like it happens to everyone. Everyone has a
*  poop story I hope. If you don't I feel like you just not taking enough chances
*  with your diet. No and it's like I think everyone's poop story starts out with
*  them being like oh I thought I was gonna fart and then it was not a fart. Yeah
*  that's in the car that's when it happens. I was honestly on the drive up here I
*  had a little bit of gas and I was like just wait until you're there hold it
*  because you don't want to take any risks right now. So I you know it actually
*  worked out I let it out. I've had a podcast once where I legitimately
*  thought do you remember who it was? I legitimately thought I was gonna shit my
*  pants. I was like pinching my my abs down I was crunching myself like listen if
*  I don't get out of here right now I don't know if I'm gonna make it. I do
*  remember who it was but I might even set it on the air. I barely got out. It's kind of a
*  nice feeling though I like that like adrenaline rush of like I need to hold
*  like it really tests my skills. Like cramming for a test. Yeah. Like oh my god
*  there's not much time left. Yeah I dropped out of college so like I feel
*  like me trying to hold in a poop is the most cramming for a test I feel like I
*  do. Why that is a psychological thing the cramming thing. They say that some
*  people like procrastinate until they know they just they have to tell like
*  okay I'm gonna stay up all night. I'm a procrastinator. Yeah. Always. Most comics
*  are. You think so? Yeah yeah yeah I think there's something look we're all broken
*  we're all broken toys and most most comics there's something about like the
*  laziness and the nonconformity and you know the unwillingness to do trudgery
*  is that a word? I think so. Yeah the unwillingness to do the you know like
*  boring mundane life choices jobs that's what leads people to comedy. Like oh maybe I
*  could just talk shit. Yeah. Yeah. I literally thought I always knew I wanted
*  to like entertain people somehow. I didn't know exactly how until my senior
*  year of high school but before that I was like maybe I'll be a singer or a
*  comedian you know. Well you have a great voice. I have a decent voice. You have a
*  very good voice. Thank you. And you use it in your acts sometimes. I try. You do. You
*  started doing stand-up how old were you? I think I did my first open mic when I
*  was like 17 but I didn't start then. You were about as it like there's only one
*  other person I know Olivia Grace. Yes I love Olivia. I met her at I think it was
*  Brea she came up to me and she was like 16. Yeah. And I was like what? And she had
*  been doing it since she was like 14 or 15. That's crazy. Crazy. She's very funny too.
*  She's so funny. Super cool. Yeah so I when I started I was living in Long Beach at
*  my parents house and so I would go back and forth between Orange County and LA
*  and Olivia was in Orange County and she was like the first person my age kind of
*  you know that I like met and so we became friends and I was like I was like
*  you're so funny like it's so cool that she had already had so much time under
*  her belt when I was like 18 you know. Yeah it's crazy. I didn't know you
*  could start until you were 21. No I didn't either. I had no idea. I thought and I
*  also didn't know that open mics happened at like coffee shops and bars and like
*  literally anywhere. Yeah. At all you know laundromats. When I started I waited until
*  my 21st birthday but then I met my friend Robbie and he was 19 I was like
*  how did you get in and they're like you they'll let you in but you can't drink.
*  Yeah. Oh yeah I had my. Is that still the case like at the store if they if they had a show an
*  open mic night? No. Did they let you in? Well when I when I started doing open mics for real I
*  was maybe 18 on the verge of 19 or something and I would go to the comedy
*  store but I had already been doing open mics around town so all the guys who
*  worked at the comedy stores door guys knew me they didn't know how old I was
*  so no one ever checked my ID and I never talked about being young or anything so
*  I would just perform hang out and and then when they found out I was under 21
*  I got kicked out for a year and I couldn't perform there again so I had
*  already been doing Kill Tony and then they found out and so then I would like
*  do shows do open mics and then I would just come to the comedy store and hang
*  out on the sidewalk and just be like hey guys what's up. That's hilarious. And on my 21st
*  birthday at midnight I walked in. Really? Yeah. That's hilarious. And I remember Red
*  Band was there and George Perez and on my 21st birthday they each gave me $21
*  and then on my 22nd birthday I was at the comedy store and they gave me $22
*  and I was like you guys better live for a long time. That's a crazy place to be
*  when you're 21 years old you know to be around let me just the people you just
*  named George Perez and Brian Red Band and you're 21 like hello yeah like a
*  little a little fawn yeah well that place is I mean especially when
*  you're dealing with you know so many like you're going there you're 21 years
*  old and you're just seeing Jessel Nick and you know and all these like big-time
*  headliners and Joey Diaz and you know when Chris Rock shows up and Dave
*  Chappelle's there and you're fucking 21 you're walking around going this is
*  crazy yeah yeah it felt so surreal just like being there and hanging out and
*  feeling kind of like I was a part of it you know like in a small way but yeah I'm
*  super grateful for Kill Tony because I feel like that's what helped me become
*  like more ingrained in the scene at the store well that's how I found out about
*  you yeah I found out about you through Kill Tony and Tony kept raving about how
*  good you were and then I saw you do some sets and your progression it's a kind of
*  a hilarious story like you opening for me I know because you did a couple shows
*  and like the improv couple shows at like you know the comedy store and then I'm
*  like hey you want to do Vegas well no no what happened was you had been the guest
*  like on Kill Tony and I was a regular so you had seen one minute of my material
*  maybe two times I'd seen you other times I've been in the room while you're
*  sitting up a couple other times but then you invited me I remember Tony hit me up
*  one day and he was like hey is it cool if I give Joe your phone number and I
*  was like Joe and he was like Rogan I was like what I was like yeah of course
*  and so then you text me you were like hey do you want to do some shows at the
*  improv with me this week and I was like yeah of course you're like are you
*  available I'm like I think I can be available for that I knew you're funny
*  you know I mean that's how I do it when I think someone's funny I'm like all
*  right let's see yeah let's see what they do in front of a packed house yeah you
*  know with Joey Diaz and Duncan Trussell and Ari Shafir and just like let's see
*  what's up yeah and then I had been doing that for for a couple months I'd say
*  just like doing the hosting spot or like little opening spots at the improv in
*  the Comedy Store and then you were like oh I was like oh I saw that you're gonna
*  be in Vegas this week like I think I'm gonna drive and come watch you because
*  I'd never seen you in like a bigger venue than a comedy club and you you were
*  like okay do you want to open and I was like well I wasn't hoping you'd say that
*  but I was kind of hoping you'd say that so you did Vegas that was the coolest
*  experience of my entire life still to this day one of like the highlights of
*  my life it was really fun it was really fun but you were so composed and so like
*  on top of it you crushed and then I said okay do you want to do an arena you went
*  from I mean how many times have you been paid to do stand-up other than the times
*  opening for me and you know like a couple little gigs on the road yeah I
*  mean I never really got paid to do comedy like besides like drinks or like
*  a couple bucks for gas so you do the Mirage which is like I think the Mirage
*  is 1,300 people or 1,200 people it's a good-sized place yeah good-sized place
*  then we do a fucking gigantic basketball arena you know what I think you know what
*  I think helped me with the Mirage was in my head I was like 1,200 is giant I was
*  like this is gonna be huge crazy and I like over hyped it so much that by the
*  time I saw the venue it was like it was so beautiful and it felt intimate for
*  some reason well it's the most intimate place in Vegas in terms of like those
*  big theaters you can play yeah it's my favorite place in Vegas I love it yeah so
*  as soon as I got there I was like I got this I used I was doing bigger places
*  there and I came back to the Mirage just because it's a better setup yeah and I
*  feel like the people who run that place are really helpful they're awesome they're
*  the best they're the nicest folks and they all love comedy yeah you know there
*  you are that's you kid oh Jamie was taking pictures I was like can you get
*  more my mom really wants to see me yeah it's too bad you can't really see the
*  audience in there too but so then you go from that well what arena did we do we
*  went to I believe Dan was it Portland oh yeah it was the Moda Center yeah that
*  place is fucking huge yeah oh my god and it was in the round the first one was in
*  the round so there's literally people all around me I'm like I don't know where
*  to stand I don't know like how to use the space of the stage yeah that's like
*  13 or 14 thousand oh my gosh yeah bananas but I told you after I was like
*  you know what I hate about this is that this feels that the best way to perform
*  I was like this is where I feel the most myself well it's definitely the biggest
*  pop like the rush that you get from a big a big joke that kills in you know a
*  15,000 seat arena or whatever it's it's bananas like the biggest I did was
*  Chappelle and I did the Tacoma Dome yeah we did 25,000 people that was crazy it
*  was bonkers like when you would hear the laughs they were deafening it was a
*  people scream 25,000 people screaming it's just was there like an echo like
*  away it's what it's nuts it's wild because I remember after the Moda Center
*  which is like an inside arena then we did that outdoor theater amphitheater
*  in the Bay Area yeah yeah where the Grateful Dead yeah yeah yeah that was fun
*  too that was fun but that was cool because it was outdoors and I was like
*  there's a lawn like I it was just crazy because when I was little I would always
*  go to concerts and I would always watch the performer and I'd be like I want to
*  do that so the first time I got to like do the arena and the amphitheater I was
*  like I'm literally doing what I've always wanted to do yeah those shows are
*  fucking awesome but I still think 200 people is the that's the right size
*  two to three hundred people is the right size yeah I agree like if you wanted it
*  so like there's no nothing wrong with those shows they're awesome I love doing
*  arenas but the you know like the original rooms like 190 people that shit
*  is perfect yeah when everything's popping I like the 200 300 range or
*  even smaller because that's when you get like the honest feedback yeah and I
*  think that's why it's fun to also do the like arena or amphitheater because it's
*  the jokes that you've been working on that you know work right and so you're
*  getting the response that you want from those jokes and you kind of almost
*  expect that response but when you're doing the smaller intimate shows that's
*  when you get the like kind of pause where you're like huh maybe that joke
*  needs tweaking or like you can figure out yeah and that way when you do get a pop
*  in like a smaller room you're like oh that really works yeah small small
*  crowds like late at night that's when you find out if you're full of shit yeah
*  because you get to see the the fat in your act you see the clunky fucking
*  those weird segues that you do or yeah or when you act something out it seems
*  cheap and stupid you like oh my god like you're just doing it in front of like
*  three people yeah materials terrible yeah that's why I liked working at the
*  comedy store because you'd have to be there until the last person's offstage
*  how much comedy have you done during the quarantine I've done a decent amount of
*  zoom shows and then those they're weird I kind of just like I think I grew up
*  always being like on the internet and interacting with strangers online so I
*  I felt like I was prepared for something like a zoom show and I also was like
*  okay don't look don't expect to get anything out of this or get the same
*  feeling out of this like just have fun engage with the people watching as best
*  you can and like see where it goes have no expectations it's just yeah yeah
*  fucking blows mark Norman said it best he said like it's like methadone comedy
*  yeah it's like you know he was talking about how he did stand up in the park
*  yes I was watching his YouTube park Normand so good but it's you know we're
*  all like desperate to get back in LA we're not doing any comedy but New York
*  is doing stand-up again yeah I've seen that yeah which is crazy I feel like I'm
*  starting to see some shows my friends are doing some shows outdoors here so I
*  don't know I'm kind of hopeful but I'm also like if if I get an offer to go to
*  a state that's open and doing comedy I would take it are you taking vitamins are
*  you taking care of yourself you just tested negative I just tested negative
*  you don't have the vid I don't I don't got the covey but I've been getting
*  tested a lot because my sister just moved to Arizona last year so I've been
*  going out there a lot which is hot for the Rona yeah yeah and so I've been
*  getting tested really frequently and whenever they say like it's hot for the
*  Rona I always wonder like what makes some place hotter than others like why
*  why are other places more susceptible like what's going on there I don't know
*  well I guess with Arizona everything's open it's almost like Corona never
*  happened there yeah they don't give a fuck yeah well that's a wild west town I
*  know I told them I'm like they're the COVID Cowboys you know wearing maskless
*  chaps they they have open carry like you could have a gun in your pocket just walk into a
*  store I did a show in Arizona I was like what are you guys gonna do shoot COVID
*  when you see it is that your defense well in their defense like they're on
*  the border of Mexico and that is a place that has literally changed very little
*  since people came across the fucking country and covered wagons yeah like
*  that's Arizona yeah Arizona like Phoenix is as big as it gets I love Arizona
*  great I love it it's so beautiful there's so much to do I filmed my 2005
*  special there okay brag I love it there yeah I've been going there forever I
*  love that Tempe improv that place is great dude Tempe is my favorite that was
*  the first place I had lined and the Casey the manager there one of the best
*  people ever he just like I feel like every comedy club manager should like
*  take a class under Casey because he's like so compassionate and he gets it and
*  he's like not full of bullshit he's just like an honest caring dude I feel like
*  he rubs that he runs that club so well well that place has a history of cool
*  people running it cuz Adam Egan used to be there yeah and Paige from the improv
*  yep so I met both of them I think I met Paige there I might have met yeah I
*  think I met Paige there um I just feel bad for those people now oh you're
*  taking the yeah I was like what's that sound how about how addicted to those
*  things so addicted completely addicted yeah well when I was at my mom's house
*  during lockdown my mom's a smoker oh boy I know it's just it's this weird thing
*  when they get to be a certain age and they're still smoking all the time I
*  know oh you are on the edge huh well she was trying to read that book Alan Carr's
*  book what stop smoking how about just stop smoking all right well I guess if
*  you've been doing it all your life I don't know take up another hobby I know
*  you'll have to talk to her we'll get her on the pod she's not yeah no when you're
*  when you're in it you're in it you know but when I was with her she was smoking
*  and I'm like I don't want to be smoking like cuz my mom always says don't smoke
*  it's bad and I've just been smoking since I was like 17 but I quit for two
*  months off Nick off like the jewel when did you that at the beginning of lockdown
*  for two months so why'd you start back up again cuz then I came back home to LA
*  and I was like what was the first one like did you know that you're being a
*  loser no reaching for that first one well that's like no because in my head
*  I'm like it's just one hit of the jewel I'm fine I'm not gonna get addicted
*  again I got this and then a couple more times I hit my friend's jewel and I was
*  like I need to buy my own damn yeah that's what happened with cigarettes
*  like I wasn't addicted like I think people think that if you smoke one
*  cigarette you're gonna be addicted and that's not the case I smoked one and I
*  was fine no I've smoked one multiple times before shows yeah I started with
*  Tony I smoked one of Tony's before a show back when Tony used to smoke and I
*  was like dude this gives you a crazy rush you smoked mine in a like st. Louis
*  or st. Paul or something and you were like buzzin I took some cigarettes from
*  Dave Chappelle when we did shows together a cigarette before a show gets
*  you buzzed cigar doesn't quite get you that buzzed like you got it in hey and I
*  think there's like whatever funky chemicals they put in those cigarettes
*  get you addicted those are good yeah those those so yummy those chemists are
*  fucking they know what they're doing do it's so you're gonna kill people yeah
*  it's crazy that no one's trying to stop it but yet it kills half a million
*  people a year that's what's bizarre that everybody's worried about COVID COVID
*  has killed less than 200,000 people cigarettes have killed probably in the
*  same time of COVID more than 200,000 people it's always crazy when you find
*  out someone like someone's family member a friend got lung cancer and never
*  smoked that always freaks me out yeah you can get lung cancer yeah you can get
*  lung cancer from toxins in the air you can get lung cancer from genetics you
*  can get lung cancer you know environmental shit if you work in a
*  factory that has a lot of weird fumes but there's also so many things that
*  kill people like fast food is so unhealthy I love that too what's your go
*  to really you like eating garbage I love garbage like straight I that's why you
*  shit in your pants all the time it was once okay only once yeah I've shit my
*  pants at least once this month you've got a couple more years on me yeah yeah
*  but I mean I also eat like a lot of meat yeah doesn't that make you shit oh yeah
*  yeah yeah it's crazy give you loose oh my god it gives you the most ridiculous
*  diarrhea like I told Tom Segura you got to try this carnivore diet because he
*  was trying to lose weight and I lost 12 pounds in a month I got shredded but
*  isn't that kind of unhealthy to lose that much weight in a month I don't know
*  it felt great okay I don't know yeah I really don't know I was gonna get my
*  blood work done but then I had to travel and then the Kovac hit it's like
*  another Christ yeah I forget what my excuse was I had an excuse yeah not a
*  good one but I had an excuse do you have any fast food oh yeah yesterday you were in
*  and out yeah you had the craziest order well I thought you were feeding your
*  whole family with your order he was on speaker he was like yeah can I get like
*  12 flying Dutchman I'm like oh four I know four flying Dutchman it's not that
*  much meat I guess is that one patty or two two patties with cheese so that's a
*  total of eight patties yes okay got a feet all this yeah you know do you eat
*  like three meals a day no one generally I eat very light in the morning
*  mm-hmm usually unless I'm I have a really hard workout and then like this
*  morning I just had eggs just a couple like three eggs yeah and then how do you
*  cook them fry fried eggs I thought that I would know how to cook eggs at this
*  point in my life you know I'm 24 that's something that's pretty basic I keep
*  fucking up eggs how do you fuck that up I get really impatient and so I put the
*  heat on the pan way too high and then the eggs are just like fried instantly
*  but I've gotten better I'm getting better but I don't think I could fry
*  this is not that complicated you know you have a very minor issue that you're
*  complaining about here so I eat that you know I'll eat like a light breakfast
*  before workout and then I work out and then I won't eat until dinner I usually
*  eat twice a day okay and I eat a large yeah I see it on your Instagram well you've
*  seen me eat live yeah in real time it's an experience it's like going to the zoo
*  and like feeding a giraffe you're like whoa well people don't believe it like
*  when I go to a restaurant and I'll order two entrees like like the waiters are
*  like what are you doing yeah like you're not gonna eat all that I'm like just
*  watch me bitch it's fun going out to eat with you because when I was growing up my
*  dad would you know we have two older sisters and my dad was kind of single
*  dad shopped like food on a budget and so he'd be like you know the drill no soda
*  water only like the bare minimum so then when we get to go out after shows and
*  eat I'm like I can get two entrees if I want and an appetizer yeah that is the
*  good thing about growing up poor is that you really appreciate when you know you
*  get good stuff yeah I don't want to say I grew up poor but we weren't like you
*  know right you weren't starving yeah yeah well I grew up you know I mean we
*  weren't starving either but we were poor yeah you know we were on welfare when I
*  was a kid we drank powdered milk you know the whole deal we had we're on food
*  stamps yeah and I'm on food stamps now are you yeah that's so crazy I know I'm
*  on unemployment it's crazy how much are they giving you how much they give you
*  for unemployment I think I you have to like put in all of your information and
*  like you know whatever and so I think I'm getting like $400 a week hmm the
*  good news is you're you're living with your mom right so no I'm living in my
*  house oh you are yeah yeah when you were with your mom for a little while yeah
*  but I kept my place because I was like who knows how long this is gonna last
*  who knows if I want to stay at my mom's house whatever like it's nice to know I
*  have that as an option because my parents live like in the greater Los
*  Angeles area I read that they're going to there was a ban on evictions and and
*  and you know and making people forcing people to pay rent yeah but that's gonna
*  go up September 1st they're gonna force people to start paying again but I'm
*  like I've just been paying my rent but what happens to those people if you have
*  five months of back rent and the rent is $3,000 a month that's crazy yeah and all
*  of a sudden you have to pay it all yeah it makes no sense that's why I was like
*  I'm gonna pay mine now because who knows how much money I'm gonna have saved up
*  after this so I might as well just pay luckily my rent is like cheap so it's
*  manageable and if I ever was in a pinch like I know my parents would help me out
*  how long do you think this was gonna last I've everyone was saying it was
*  gonna last like three months but I was like this is gonna last longer there's
*  no way things are just gonna be like okay if we do this it's all gonna go
*  back to normal it just felt too big for it to be over that quickly well I was
*  optimistic unfortunately I really did think it was gonna be three months I
*  thought it was gonna be two months really yeah I was like look it takes you
*  get sick and then you're only sick for like a week right so if everybody just
*  stays home the people that are sick will get better people won't get infected
*  this is simple I just feel like I'm like Americans are so like don't tell me
*  what to do yes and there's America's such a big country how would you expect
*  everyone to be on the same page well we're there's a big country we're all
*  crazy yeah we travel around a lot yeah yeah it's
*  spitting each other's face yeah and here you go here we are five months later is
*  it five now yeah right yes five months five fucking months no no end in sight
*  do you feel like it's gone by fast or slow for you slow doesn't feel good I
*  don't like it I'm not worried about myself I'm worried about other people
*  and I'm worried about the city I'm worried about the economic aspects of
*  this as much as I'm worried about the health aspects of it yeah cuz it just I
*  don't know how look when people get sick they get better right hopefully but when
*  a city gets that far gone like as far as LA is right now like I don't know how a
*  city bounces back I've never seen it happen like I've seen cities that used
*  to be big like have you ever been to Detroit do we ever do a gig in Detroit
*  Detroit is interesting okay because Detroit used to be one of the most
*  wealthy cities in the world like at one point in time during the height of the
*  auto industry you'd go to Detroit and it was fucking Cadillacs and Camaros and
*  Corvettes and it was beautiful and everybody was making money and it was
*  just amazing now Detroit is sketchy as fuck isn't it getting coming back a
*  little bit a little bit but when you drive through Detroit you could buy a
*  house for like five bucks crazy the the guys from Top Gear they have a new show
*  now it's called the grand tour is that what it's called grand tour they bought
*  homes in Detroit they went to Detroit just bought houses it was like a bought
*  a house for like two thousand dollars and then they were like you know like
*  showing like what you can buy for two thousand bucks and then they were
*  driving their cars crazy so crazy I think once I make like a good amount of
*  money the first thing I'm gonna do is move to Detroit yeah move to Detroit no
*  I think I would like invest in real estate that's what everyone says right
*  don't listen everyone okay yeah I mean investing in real estate is generally a
*  good idea if you do it in the right place yeah but you know I don't know just
*  keep kicking ass I remember when COVID first started I hit you up I was like
*  Joe I'm scared do you have a guest house and you're like I'm scared too I'm like
*  that's not the answer I was looking for I was scared if you're scared I'm scared
*  in the beginning I was real scared yeah yeah because I was like because I didn't
*  know first of all the information you get from China is so it's so filtered by
*  the Communist Party or the the Chinese government so like who is telling the
*  truth like how bad is this so when you hit and then you know when you see them
*  driving on the street with those big tanks spraying the houses do you ever
*  see those videos from China no I don't oh yeah yeah like like big Lysol truck
*  like Ghostbusters exactly I was like this is not good no what are they doing
*  and then you were getting information from cruise ships that were saying that
*  it lasts up to 17 days just on surfaces I'm like oh my god we're fucked I know
*  super bug I was on a cruise at the beginning of the year so I got it I got
*  it out of the way you were on a cruise yeah I got booked to perform on a rave
*  cruise oh jeez and I was like this might be the worst experience of my life but
*  there's no way I can pass up on having that you know was it good it was so fun
*  it honestly like changed my life I like I was like first of all who goes on a
*  rave cruise second of all who goes to see comedy on a rave cruise yeah and so I
*  was like I need to bring a friend so I brought my friend Danny and I was like
*  he's gonna be the perfect person to have whether this is the best or the worst
*  time and we pull up to the port in Miami and it's like 11 a.m. and there's people
*  in like blue wigs and fishnets drinking like Jack Daniel oh that's me I look at
*  that smile you look so happy I was and look at everybody has no mask on no
*  mask this was oh what a good time the old days the old look at it looks like
*  I've abs in that picture when do you think we're gonna go back this is January
*  21st this is right before the world ended yeah when do you think we're gonna
*  go back to no masks do you think some people just gonna wear masks forever now
*  I think so yeah yeah well isn't like I watched this Japanese reality show and
*  it's so good it's called Terrace House and they just film people in this house
*  it's beautiful and and people over there wear masks when they're sick like that's
*  just always been a thing and so I think maybe that's something that'll be
*  implemented well they did a really good job in stopping kovat because of that
*  yeah just because they wear masks all the time they didn't stop their
*  businesses yeah they didn't close down and they only I think only a thousand
*  people died yeah see if that's true I think that's the number and they're
*  starting to have resurgence in cases unfortunately but it's probably that's
*  like losing their hair yeah I heard this one oh and other people I think with
*  her it might be due she might be have stress in her life she seems like a
*  little high stress that lady needs a joint what is that I don't know
*  recovered 35,000 1000 deaths that's amazing 1073 deaths in Japan that's
*  amazing that's incredible yeah that's incredible I mean how do they do that I
*  look at their big spike the big spike is like towards the end of it looks like
*  April 22nd do you think that this is like mostly accurate as best I think
*  Japan is honest yeah I mean just a ditch is very disciplined you know they're
*  very disciplined and then they follow order yeah like if you have you ever
*  gone no I want it well I wanted to it's really interesting it's like you're I
*  love this I love when people are just human beings but they have a whole
*  different way of doing things like you go they're like oh look how they do it
*  yeah you walk down the street everybody's like real polite like nobody's
*  bumping into each other yelling at each other it's like very orderly yeah and
*  you know it's it's interesting it's like really packed with people but there's no
*  litter yeah it's what's your favorite country you've been to well I'm a big
*  fan of America I love Canada I guess that's kind of a country that's
*  separate from us because you could walk over there but I mean you could walk to
*  Mexico too yeah I love Canada perform they're fucked they're so nice up there
*  they're like America but I always say with 20% less douchebags mmm that's nice
*  they're fucking nice they're really nice and it's cold and they so it violates my
*  dickhead cold weather theory I used to have a dickhead cold weather theory
*  because I grew up in Boston I was like why is there was a dickheads here
*  because it's freezing but it's not because Canada is colder than that and
*  they're nice if you go from Boston to Montreal it'll ruin your dickhead cold
*  weather theory yeah cuz I'm like well it's fucking colder here and people are
*  nice hmm it maybe gets so cold that they're forced to be nice ah yeah
*  cuz they're all struggling stay together yeah have you been to Montreal no I've
*  never been to Canada oh you gotta go yes I was hoping to do new faces this year
*  but if I had a bail off the continental North America if I had to get out of
*  this this spot I would go to Australia oh really yeah I've never been but it's
*  not a place that like I'm super dying to go to I really want to go to New Zealand
*  I would go there too I've never been but it looks amazing road trip oh my god
*  they just had four new cases they had no cases yeah yeah they're pretty
*  impressive but Australia the first thing I do if I do I did move there is try to
*  convince them to drive on the right side of the road like what are you doing it's
*  weird why over here with you staring on the wrong side why how did that happen
*  what happened when we came over to America was someone just like let's just
*  switch it all up everybody's jealous of us because we're the shit so they're
*  like they do it like that we're gonna do it like yeah do you know why though
*  honestly no that's why I'm asking the reason why is they drive on the left
*  side of the road because if you were a knight and you were like in combat you
*  would want to have your enemy on your right side so if you were riding towards
*  them you would want to have your enemy so you could slash at them with your
*  your dominant arm yeah that's also why when you shake someone's hand you shake
*  someone's hand with your right hand because that's your dominant arm yeah
*  supposedly yeah so that's your sword arm so these are all sword people they're
*  all old fucking what type of cars were knights driving like a Cadillac escalator
*  on horses okay and stab each other they would want to do with their right arm so
*  they want the enemy to be on the right side of them crazy yeah so they were on
*  the left side of the road hmm it's weird to think that that's like I might have
*  made that up by maybe you know I just trust what I have blind faith I'm like I
*  know less so I'll just take that as a fact yeah I still talk like the days
*  before the internet I just start saying shit and I'm not sure if I fully
*  researched I know but that's the crazy thing about the internet is I feel so
*  confused all the time you can with many things with many subjects you can get
*  really confused is that a fact I mean it's I'm pretty sure that's right but I
*  know like America drives on the right cuz we're like fuck that we're driving
*  cars bro did we fuck that we're driving on the right forward motherfucker I get
*  to anti-drive on the left is why we drive on the right it's because they
*  drive on the left is why we drive on the right kind of yeah we're like the
*  younger sibling who's like fuck you we do it our own way oh you that's how you
*  drive with horses well with cars we're gonna flip it yeah I don't know I mean
*  what is the reason why they decided to drive on the right it's got to be a
*  reason that's that's what I'm saying it's good it's like colonization just to
*  be different in the early colonization of North America English driving
*  customs were followed in the colonies drove on the left ah after gaining
*  independence from it that makes sense they were anxious to cast off all
*  remaining links with their British colonial past and gradually changed to
*  right-hand driving aha that makes sense have you ever did you when you were in
*  Australia did you like rent a car and drive yourself on the left side no I
*  have never driven a car on the left hand side yeah I remember reading about
*  Matthew Broderick and he was over in Ireland I believe and he got in a fatal
*  car crash smashed into someone and the speculation was that he was on the wrong
*  side of the road like he was coming home from the set and then he fucked up I
*  remember reading that off that's the case but I do know he was in a bad car
*  crash and I was like oh my god you got to be on your fucking Ps and Qs if you're
*  driving the left side of the road because your head like do you know when
*  you're driving you get into that weird auto mode where you just like you ever
*  be in your car and then all I don't know how I get home sometimes how did I get
*  here do you text and drive no no I do not I do not yeah I mean anything I have
*  a little slot in my car from my phone and just go yeah right in there I don't
*  I don't do shit in every car you have you have a slot well in the car that I
*  drive the most yeah the tests the test of the slot but the thing I like to do
*  is this I like to do hey Siri text Ali mccroft ski and the boo would you like
*  to say and then that kind of shit yeah your phone go off and I said hey Siri
*  get mad at you like if you they listen to the podcast they get mad I have like
*  an iPhone too so I don't have to worry about half the time it's dirty oh that
*  yeah the why don't we well when I replace it in the new studio you're gonna visit
*  us in Texas duh I was like you when you called me yesterday I was like maybe he
*  like wants me to like move with him and then you're like don't do the podcast
*  I'm like fine I guess I'll stay in LA well once everything's up and running
*  okay well good I've got nothing over my daughter likes you I know she's so cute
*  adorable she's so cute I was like are you on tick-tock that's like how I
*  whenever I meet a young person like are you on tick-tock I know the dances the
*  Chinese government is watching you do you think they're actually gonna ban it
*  yes I think they're gonna force a sale that's what I think yeah probably some
*  big American tech companies gonna buy it because there was a group of soft I
*  don't know if a group or some software engineer that back engineered tick-tock
*  and they said this is the worst application we've ever seen in terms of
*  violation of privacy well it's the worst like it tracks fucking everything and
*  they send that information directly to the Chinese government so they're
*  data mining is it bad that I don't give a fuck don't give a fuck should I care
*  more that people are taking my privacy um this is how I feel about that okay
*  you are a 24 year old stand-up comedian 25 next month so you're like what am I
*  gonna do what are you gonna find out where I should yeah I'm gonna find out
*  where I take naps I keep my laptop on with the camera on when I'm pooping just
*  in case if the government's watching I want them to get the full range of me you
*  know I feel like if they're what they're paying attention to like hedge fund
*  guys who are trying to overthrow government yeah you know they're paying
*  attention to like they don't care about me what do we do we talk shit yeah what
*  you know people think that the government's watching everything you do
*  like but bro you're boring yeah okay they're not they're not paying attention
*  to you I guarantee you they're not but they're probably watching you don't you
*  think yeah they're watching you listen to everything I say I'm sure but I mean
*  say everything publicly yeah the things that get me in the most trouble I say
*  right here yeah just talking shit but you know that's the business the business
*  is the talking shit business yeah what are you gonna do but that's the thing to
*  get back to like being so confused about information now because there's so much
*  information I don't know what to believe isn't it crazy like having a podcast
*  and then like saying something and being like I don't know if that's right well
*  that's what Jamie's for Jamie Jamie Jamie pulls things up all the time that I
*  thought were right I know I've always actually actually you're wrong well I
*  mean if you're coming to me as your major source of information you are
*  already fucked yeah if I say something that I absolutely know to be sure I will
*  say that I absolutely know this to be sure yeah if I say something and I go I
*  don't know if that's true please Google it I just I'm not supposed to be a
*  source of information I'm just not yeah it's not my thing you just have a lot of
*  information I'm a shit talker that's what I'm a professional shit talker I
*  talk shit eight out of ten times I don't even mean when I say yeah that's the
*  crazy thing too about the internet is that some people will just like assume
*  that everything you say is real and it's like no there's some you know there's
*  some like I'm gonna put this up later here I'll send this to you Jamie right
*  now this is Tim when he was getting his COVID test oh my god this is something
*  that I'm sure people are gonna be pissed about but this is a perfect example of
*  what I like I don't need everyone to be serious and or telling the truth yeah
*  and I like the fact that I can tell the difference and I like when people say
*  outrageous shit they don't really mean yeah and I'm that's one of the things
*  that frustrates me the most about this internet culture is that people love to
*  take something like that Tim Dillon would say in his clip and put it in
*  quotes and pretend that he really means it play that and have it totally out of
*  context oh it's it's actually a fairly large video should I got it oh you got
*  it yeah put it up there and then give us some volume this is Tim Dillon taking
*  his COVID test here we go I'll put it on the internet after the podcast
*  oh how's that buddy I don't like you don't like I don't like this disease
*  doesn't exist what this is outrageous I can't even put this on the internet
*  exists it's fake oh no see now there's a lot of people that'd be like that's
*  Jamie but it's like there's so many people that are like you know how many
*  fucking people died 147,000 Americans that's what they would do they would
*  take that clip and then he go oh you're yucking it up ha ha ha grandma's dead
*  yeah what are we supposed to do be sad about grandma all the time all the time
*  all the time we're supposed to be sad everything's supposed to be serious
*  humorless fucks who spend all day complaining about things yeah but I get
*  it because there's no work yeah what are you gonna do like of course it's sad
*  but that's like why comedy is so important and to make light of things
*  and be ridiculous because it's like there needs to be a balance that's what
*  we do yeah and it's also like what we enjoy like one of the things about the
*  comedy store is that I enjoyed the most is like going there and people to go
*  like talk shit to you you really wearing that like what you are you really
*  wearing that and then also they'd be like a roast fest you'd be standing
*  there what did I do yeah and then you're shitting on my clothes or shitting on my
*  shoes or you know it's like it's fun it's fun like in saying things you don't
*  mean or fun I remember when it was like me you and Santino out somewhere and we
*  were getting brunch and I was like wearing a shirt and you're like what the
*  fuck is that tattoo on your arm we're just going back and forth that's dumb
*  what does that mean you thought it's a thrift store what is that tattoo I don't
*  know it's a rowboat with a flower in it I got it for ten ten bucks I want to do
*  yeah stays with you forever yeah when you're 80 years or ten bucks today
*  we're gonna look like that yeah it's a thousand I am my friend got a tattoo
*  gun on Amazon you know that anyone can just buy a tattoo gun on Amazon start
*  tattooing yourself oh my god you tattooed your palm I saw the post-mortem
*  episode and I was like I got to get another tap before I come on we think
*  about getting one your cheek no no you like a little star like I have thought
*  about a face right above your eyebrow like a tiny little one over here maybe
*  there's been multiple face tattoos on this podcast and you know the one I
*  forgot who Mike Tyson I forgot he has a face tattoo yeah I forgot a prominent
*  one the first one though is Kat Von D she was number one she has a gang of them
*  she's a little stars all over the place and then the second one was a second one
*  Tyson who else you had Kevin Von Dion well yes yeah early in the day she's
*  awesome yeah but Travis Barker probably has the most tattoos he's so talented
*  he's a great guy too he's like a legend he's so cool he's such a sweetheart of a
*  really genuinely nice guy but he's got face head neck everything he was on his
*  Instagram the other day getting new tattoos he's like I'm out of space yeah
*  so they're just like drawing over old tattoos like new writing yeah like do
*  you think you'd get like a skin graft just so he can do like a new well he's
*  actually had skin grafts yeah yeah um I don't think you would skin gaps are
*  fucking painful yeah but he's covered yeah I was skin graft once he's got
*  literally them everywhere he's got them everywhere I mean yeah yeah everywhere
*  like top of his head all the way down his hands his arms his legs everything's
*  tattooed like you see that see if you can find the video the video is kind of
*  crazy I have a weird amount of tattoos where I'm like I it's like I feel like
*  I'm playing blackjack right now I'm like should I quit yeah look he's out of
*  space damn it's everywhere under his chin there's still some face room yeah
*  some cheeks well there was a fake picture that somebody may it might have
*  been him that he posted of his face fully tattooed is like damn he might have
*  went all in but it was fake how old were you when you got your first tattoo 23
*  do you remember what it was yes it's like a demon with a jester's hat on nice
*  stupid I know all my tattoos are so stupid it's there to remind me that I
*  used to be a moron yeah I feel like that's what these are I'm like you know
*  what you're gonna be a different person well I'm still a moron but I'm definitely
*  less of a moron than when I was 23 yeah that's why it's that's why that's why I
*  really liked like being at the store and like having people like you and Tony and
*  Santino and just like all the people there like you know because for me being
*  a young person in comedy I'm always like were you guys like bad when you first
*  started we were terrible I'm like did you guys know what you wanted to talk
*  about and it's so cool being able to like ask you guys for advice and like
*  have these mentors and well it's also the the guys you're talking about
*  everyone's Jen genuinely honest like they'll tell you the times they bombed
*  like the worst is people that don't admit they bomb or don't admit when they
*  bombed because like okay you're protecting yourself and you're damaging
*  our relationship yeah by protecting yourself first of all doesn't really
*  work you're not really protecting yourself until you're damaging our
*  relationship because now I can't listen to you because now I think you're full
*  of shit yeah that's not good remember remember when we were in st. Paul and in
*  the arena and I said what's up st. Louis that was rough oh my god you barely
*  recovered from that one I thought I was gonna get burned alive after the show
*  they got mad and I opened it up I was the first one on stage I was like so
*  excited like what's up dead silence and I'm like that's that's not how this
*  works oh no yeah oh but then I recovered thank God I think I've done that before
*  I think I called Minneapolis Michigan once yeah I retired saying what's up
*  wherever I'm like I'll just get into it well there's some places that demand
*  respect like if you go to New York and you call it Philly your shows over yeah
*  what's up Philly what they would just that's a mistake you can't make some
*  mistakes you can't make but if you call st. Paul st. Louis you're like oh my god
*  I'm a fucking idiot like a couple minutes later if you have some good jokes
*  they'll forget yeah New York will never forgive you if you call it Philadelphia
*  you call New York Philadelphia or if you call Philadelphia New York they'll kick
*  your ass wouldn't you know the difference between Philly and New York not
*  if you're drunk you don't drink I don't stop with the booze and everything else
*  um I stopped everything the day after Halloween of 2015 it was a rough
*  Halloween yeah not one of my best moments so 2000 you were 19 then I was
*  19 I think I was 20 mm-hmm yeah so right around that yeah cuz I yeah I um I woke
*  up half naked on my dad's couch and I was like this is not the way I want to
*  be this is not a pretty sight were you out all night or yeah and I was like I
*  was moving to LA November 1st 2015 and I was like okay I still want to go out
*  for Halloween but I like need to be respectful no no hard alcohol just like
*  a couple beers get your shit together don't be a piece of shit blacked out
*  amazing woke up half naked so whenever people like how long have you lived in LA
*  I'm like four years seven months you know whatever days right you can get it
*  down to the alcox anonymous Jim Norton's the same way Norton stopped when he was
*  19 oh really yep yep he realized he's like I I'm a fucking mess and I can't
*  do this and I thought when I started comedy I was like I was like everyone
*  who is successful drinks like it's just part of it like you have to be boozing
*  and schmoozing and like having a good time after the show and like partying it
*  up and have this like rock star and then I realized that there were so many
*  successful comedians who don't drink and I was like okay maybe this is like
*  possible yeah it's very possible yeah Hicks did his best work after he cleaned
*  up yeah he didn't you know didn't do anything yeah when he was like in his 30
*  I think he quit like I like 30 or something like that but then whatever he
*  had done caught up to him already but he smoked a lot of cigarettes just as bad
*  my friend yeah he's your favorite right here's your favorite yeah no no he's not
*  my favorite he's not the funniest he was a great mind and I think he had really
*  interesting thoughts and I think that his comedy was very revolutionary in
*  that it changed the way people thought about doing comedy like because you
*  could do comedy and talk about important issues you could talk about complex
*  things yeah and inspired me to talk about more complex things but Kinnison
*  but you didn't start out talking about complex things did you no okay thank God
*  because I'm like my ass whatever my jokes are you know the dumb shit and I'm
*  always like I hope I'm I mean I don't mind if I keep talking about whatever
*  like dumb shit I just wanted to be like a little bit more elevated well some
*  people talk about dumb shit for ever and it's great yeah it doesn't you don't
*  there's no rules it just has to be funny I used to be so insecure you know about
*  you know my dumb jokes which I think are funny but they're you know the car
*  it's not like I'm breaking boundaries or like opening people's minds to you know
*  new problems the people that want to do that all suck the people that want to
*  break boundaries yeah I want to open people's minds like they're almost
*  always annoying yeah like I think the jokes should be well there's two things
*  that should be possible right first of all what you're saying for the people in
*  the audience should be entertaining should be interesting that was one of
*  the things that Hicks said like just try to be try to be interesting he had
*  like a see if you can find this he had like a rules to comedy thing that he
*  wrote that's very insightful it's really interesting I mean you think about the
*  guy died I think he was only like 33 when he died yeah he was just really
*  fucking smart yeah you know we're just really smart and also started comedy
*  really young so here it is Bill Hicks principles of comedy if you can be
*  yourself on stage nobody else can be you and you have the law of supply and
*  demand covered you're the act is something you fall back on if you can't
*  think of anything else to say number three only what only do what you think
*  is funny never just what you think they will like even though it's not that funny
*  to you number four never ask them is this funny you tell them this is funny
*  number five you are not married to any of this shit if something happens taking
*  off on a tangent never go back and finish a bit just move on number six
*  never ask the audience how you doing people who do that can't think of an
*  opening line they came to see you tell them how they're doing asking that
*  stupid question up front just digs a hole this is the most common mistake I
*  like how he writes that in all caps this is the most common mistake with a well
*  not all caps frontward first letter caps the most common mistake made by
*  performers I want to leave as soon as they say that number seven right what
*  entertains you if you can't be funny be interesting that's what I was talking
*  about you haven't lost the crowd have something to say and then do it in a
*  funny way number eight I close my eyes and walk out there and that's where I
*  start honest number nine listen to what you are saying ask yourself why am I
*  saying it and is it necessary this were filter all your material and cut the
*  unnecessary words economy of words you're super into that economy of words
*  everything it's everything with jokes number ten played to the top of the
*  intelligence the room there aren't any bad crowds just wrong choices that's not
*  true yeah that's just not true there are definitely bad crowds number 11 remember
*  this is the hardest thing there is to do that's not true being a soldier way
*  fucking harder if you can do this you can do anything nope you can't tell
*  people jokes and then do brain surgery I can't do shit yeah that's not true I'm
*  useless number 12 I love my cracker roots get to know your family be friends
*  with them well that's not the worst advice but all the thing that is a
*  problem with any of that stuff is this is how you do it the beautiful thing
*  about comedy is there is no this is how you do it yeah like there's Mitch
*  those are two all-time greats there's Richard Pryor and there's Louis CK
*  there's Dave Chappelle and there's emo Phillips there's Bobcat Goldwade and
*  there's fucking you know I mean this that you can do that all day I think that
*  just goes back to like just be who you are on stage yes yes but also do what
*  you feel like doing like Gaffigan likes to do his kind of comedy yeah right if
*  all of a sudden Gaffigan had to do like you know someone else's act like Bobby
*  Lee or something like that like it wouldn't be it's not what he's interested
*  in you know you find what you like to do it's like some people are country music
*  stars some people are rappers you know like everyone's got their own thing
*  and that's the thing with like comedy is I feel like when you're starting out it
*  can feel so like competitive or like should I be doing what this person's
*  doing because they're doing things or whatever but I I feel like I have to look
*  at it like music it's like oh I like a rapper and I also like this like corny
*  pop musician they're in totally different lanes they're not competing
*  against each other they're not looking at each other being like why are they
*  doing that they're doing their own thing and I can appreciate both artists or
*  both songs or whatever you know what I mean I do know you mean some people can't
*  and some comics can't some comics decide that they don't like what you do
*  so you shouldn't be doing it they get angry you know you shouldn't be talking
*  about sex you should be talking about you know like whatever absurd things
*  yeah but that's like because comedy is if you go to a comedy club it's just a
*  comedy club but nobody goes to a music club and doesn't know what kind of band
*  is playing if you go to see rock and roll and all of a sudden a folk singer
*  shows up you get upset yeah like there's no other venue like that where like
*  someone will go on stage and they're Metallica and then right afterwards would
*  be like Sarah McLaughlin yeah that's a weird combination but in comedy that's
*  a combination that exists all the time you will see weird combinations like
*  that all the time where if you're on a ten person show like at the store where
*  ten people are doing 15 minute sets you are likely to see the full spectrum of
*  comedy yeah all kinds of weird shit that's why I like the original room so
*  much because it goes until you know two in the morning sometimes longer and you
*  get to see the weirdest stuff and yeah well that's where I saw Laura Laura
*  Beats yeah I mean and I became a giant fan of hers and I put the post on my
*  Instagram because me and Chrysler we did a show this big-ass sold-out show in the
*  main room and then Bert and I sat down in the back of the room and Laura was
*  on stage and there was like maybe I mean 15 people or something something like
*  that a small-ass crowd by the time she was off stage the crowd had doubled
*  yeah because they were coming in to sit down to listen to her and that doesn't
*  seem like a lot you know it was only 30 people but that's a big jump yeah and
*  for the OR at like whatever time that was she's so talented she's so funny and
*  just so like and it's like what he was saying she's herself yeah she knows how
*  to do it and she works so hard like her and I talked about writing and she
*  showed me her notebook first of all everything is like there's like a line
*  and then a space like she's like leaves a whole line bare and then the next
*  base my oh you're fucking organized as fuck yeah she's like yes I'm serious I
*  have a friend who her notes are color-coded she has it like color-coded
*  jokes that like really work jokes that need some work on them brand-new jokes
*  and then like certain parts of the joke or color-coded differently and I'm like
*  my brain does not work like that did she use highlights or she's tab she she does
*  it on her computer and phone yeah and then like when she's doing a show I
*  think she just like transfers what she wants to do into the notebook
*  interesting yeah well everybody's got their own interesting way of doing it
*  Ron Funch said something really interesting I heard I was like right
*  Ron was like right what you love you hate and then what you fear I was like
*  oh and I texted him after the podcast I go I ask that question all the time like
*  what's your process rarely do I get an answer that makes me go oh I'm gonna
*  implement that and so I told him that I mean I know it's probably a standard
*  writing exercise but I wasn't aware of it yeah it's probably just a great way
*  to really figure out your perspective on things and figure out your like point of
*  view and the angle that you want to take for a bit it seems like the perfect combination
*  because you always want to combine those three things yeah what scares the fuck
*  out of me what I love and what I hate yeah those things are awesome together
*  that really is comedy it's a very smart way to write I was like that that made a
*  big difference yeah I just can't wait till it fucking opens up again I know I
*  feel like I'm in retirement I'm like do I go to Palm Springs and well saying
*  people like you you're in the middle of your development this is when the party's
*  happening this is when everything's rocking and rolling and you get shut
*  down right I was saying the Chappelle Lacey the same thing like here you are
*  in the middle everything's starting to rock and roll and kicking up and you
*  starting to do sets and it's picking up and it's picking up and it's picking up and all
*  sudden boom I know I was I did my first headlining show and then I was on my way
*  to do my second headlining weekend in Denver at Comedy Works and then the day
*  that I got there things got really crazy and they were talking about the LA
*  lockdown and I was like I don't know what that means like I can't do the rest of
*  the shows here so then I flew home canceled the rest of the shows oh you
*  were worried that they were gonna lock down where you can't fly yeah I think I
*  texted you I was like I don't know what to do like I'm already here I feel bad
*  cancelling like I don't know it's one of those things where where it was it was
*  really obvious that everything was gonna cancel yeah we were at the store and I
*  was supposed to do the main room and I think I was doing the main room I think
*  it was more than one show it might have been too nice yeah I was supposed to host yeah and
*  then they called me up and they said hey the state is putting up they're making a
*  limitation so you can only have 200 people in a room and obviously the main
*  room is bigger than that so we're gonna shut the shows down I'm like yeah it's
*  probably a good idea and like do you would you rather do the OR we'll move
*  your show to the OR move as many people there as you can and I'm like I don't
*  know if we should do shows yeah I was like what do we do what if we all get
*  sick yeah you know and that was in the early days when no one knew what it was
*  and what's gonna happen to us and I was in Vegas I think was like first week of
*  March that was the last time we had a Vegas show with a live audience and it
*  was this packed T-Mobile arena and I remember thinking like this feels weird
*  like people were on the plane some had masks some didn't this guy wanted to
*  shake my hand and I was like I'll shake your hand like you sure I'm like yeah
*  I'm still shaking hands it's like March 7th or something yeah crazy yeah yeah
*  we are I think it's been like so unorganized with how to handle it and
*  that's why I think there's so much like resistance towards doing things now
*  it's like they didn't know no one knew yeah it's I was saying this on the
*  podcast the other day when you become a governor you don't become a governor
*  because you pass a bunch of tests that show that you accurately know how to
*  handle each and every situation yeah you become a governor because you're popular
*  you win a popularity contest you back the right bills you say the right things
*  you got the best hair and people like I like them let's see if he could run shit
*  and then something like this happens and you realize like oh these
*  motherfuckers they don't know what they're doing yeah this is just guesswork
*  and like we're going on science no you're not yeah stop saying that you're
*  not going on side because if you were you'd be telling people to take vitamin
*  D you'd be telling people to take zinc you'd be telling people large doses of
*  vitamin C be handing that shit out you'd be on every corner people be able to get
*  vitamin D vitamin C and zinc you pass it out you know you don't know what you're
*  doing is that the magic that's a big combination vitamin D vitamin C and zinc
*  but the virus apparently has a very difficult time replicating in your system
*  when you have all those things and this is all they don't know why they don't
*  exactly know what's the what the deal is but there's some direct evidence that
*  points to that including a bunch of studies that have been done on people
*  that are in the ICU or more than 80% of them the ICU have low levels of vitamin
*  D insufficient levels of vitamin D only 4% have sufficient love is vitamin D the
*  yes that's one that we have a real problem with I've been going to the beach a lot
*  well that's good you need to take it to though unfortunately because we're really
*  supposed to be outside all day these all this house shit that's not really I
*  nature doesn't know what we're doing yeah nature's like why you bitches
*  where's your son yeah like we're designed to get son all the time I always
*  think about your joke you know when there's certain people I've told you
*  this before but there's certain jokes that just always stand out to you like
*  you always just kind of like think about them the joke about uh about houses and
*  how underwater there's no houses there's nowhere to hide oh yeah yeah yeah that's
*  the most dangerous neighborhood yeah the world is the ocean yeah because there's
*  no indoors but it's so true it's like houses are such a weird concept like
*  obviously they make sense but like it is a weird concept to be like this is my
*  safe space don't enter there's locks on the door at my own bedroom in my house
*  so the people in my house can't come in well that's why human beings have
*  figured out a way to manipulate the entire world whereas whereas people in
*  the ocean like dolphins ocean people they never figured it out they have no
*  they never rest yeah there was a shark octopus ah there was just running away
*  from shit yeah they never have a chance to sit down close the door and go what
*  the fuck am I doing with my life like that's what you have when you have a
*  living room and a gun you can shut the door and you feel a little bit safe and
*  you can start thinking about things like people had to develop weapons and they
*  had to develop housing yeah they had to develop shelter they had to figure out
*  where to stockpile food and that's that's how we figured out how to become
*  human yeah but until then we were basically like the smartest animals we
*  are the animals that figured out how to use tools and now we're just dumb now
*  we're just soft jelly little fucking bags of water I don't drink enough water
*  why not I don't know it's free I know drink it I'm gonna just make a deal with
*  your mom you drink water I'll stop smoking I mean she's gonna listen to
*  this episode so will she oh my god yeah she's jazzed well your mom's a very nice
*  lady I know I met your mom she wanted to say thank you I love her she's great
*  she's sweet stop smoking lady yeah Jennifer while I'm smoking weed stop
*  smoking yeah Jennifer Jenny get it together both of my parents work
*  together I think it's so funny they've been divorced since I was like five or
*  six and they have the same job that's funny every once in a while they'll work
*  together and send a selfie to me and my sisters it was something that I tweeted
*  today that says marijuana stops people from getting COVID that can't be real
*  it was going around early I'll see if it's the same thing that was happening
*  I bet Tommy Chong wrote under a pen name that's probably fake so when do you
*  decide to pull out the real cancer-causing cigarette and leave the
*  jewel alone me yeah sometimes you know it all no sometimes you smoke cigarettes May 18th 2020
*  new Canadian study reportedly says marijuana may prevent the coronavirus
*  aha they had like one strain of a sativa I believe I remember reading this back
*  that like might have some I don't know if I believe it's like let's let's study
*  this though please study it because does this is probably dumb but does when you
*  smoke anything marijuana cigarettes whatever does that go into your blood
*  stream or just your lungs it goes into your bloodstream from your lungs yeah
*  strong object update strong objection to the believe treatment has been extended
*  to the source for a dr. Kovaluk's report what who wrote this actually posted in
*  the source blog magazine okay I'm right but strong objection like look at that
*  but we get the post that says at the bottom again go back to the bottom part
*  strong objection to the believe treatment has been extended to the
*  source for dr. Kovaluk's but that doesn't mean anything I just say shabby
*  Allah at the bottom about the author that's the author's name I guess well
*  it says about the author shabby Allah that's what she's talking about I know
*  we're talking about different things but it's a strong objection to the believe
*  treatment has been extended to the source for dr. Kovaluk's work but a
*  strong objection what was the objection and who is it from and like why why would
*  you just that one sentence is like a weird sentence yeah isn't it weird to
*  put that at the end of a thing strong objection to the pretty much saying like
*  this is not real well it's not saying that though it's saying someone strong
*  objection to the believe treatment has been extended that's what it's saying so
*  someone objected but they're not saying who objected they're not saying what
*  they said is that kind of like nine out of ten doctors recommend this and
*  there's that one doctor who's like Colgate not for me that's maybe who he
*  is it's dr. Colgate okay Jamie's googling it I mean just turn on the fan
*  I will this posting this was it was it got posted like clickbait oh came out so
*  that's like people were like oh okay yeah the weed heads everyone wants weed to be
*  the fucking of course they do but you think is that you think that's real no
*  think it's real no I don't know it doesn't sound right um can you turn the
*  fan on please we have a fan that sucks all the smoke ready here goes we thought
*  of everything I know just sucks it out you really have this all down to a
*  science how many years has it been since you first started 11 11 yeah I love
*  doing this playing the game of how old was I you're a baby I was a baby yeah I
*  think I was like yeah yeah weird no tick-tock back then though huh what a
*  boring you could have been a tick-tock superstar maybe you would have got
*  started and that was special talkers because some people who are just
*  professional tick-tockers they actually make a living oh yeah talking oh yeah a
*  good living too dancing yeah just fucking tick-tock yeah it's all the rage
*  so what happens how do you get money uh you I think you reach enough followers
*  and likes where companies start coming in and being like we can profit off of
*  putting something in your video and making money off of you and then
*  apparently you know they have enough talent to be in like Super Bowl
*  commercials and whatever so you I really like tick-tock I know you do I can tell
*  oh my god this guy's 79 million girl it's the top girl in there who is it oh
*  you got you got with skin like that's Charlie D'Amelio that's seven months
*  something like that within seven months you have seven she's like 16 15 16 her
*  sister has a bunch of followers in our YouTube channel they have a makeup line
*  dude they went first of all I apologize for calling her a dude because all I saw
*  was the number I don't know why I assumed it was a guy probably cuz I'm
*  sexist but that uh that one in the beginning that first video that you just
*  played the first one to the left where she's tick-tocking where she's dancing
*  and moving like in the future right if you were watching a movie where that was
*  made in like the 1980s about how fucked up the world would be in 2020 yeah and
*  you this was like something that just millions and millions and millions of
*  people would be into just see yeah we'll do this but here's the thing with tick
*  tock sure everyone knows about the dancing in the lip singing and whatever
*  but the thing that I like about tick-tock is that that your main feed is
*  based on videos you like so if you're not liking dance videos you're not gonna
*  see dance videos on your feed and it's not based on people you follow
*  I am and how little I know about tick-tock no I thought it was all people doing this no I
*  finally get to teach Joe something you haven't seen Christina position is
*  curations no she has a whole different very like version of what tick-tock I'm
*  gonna hurt tick-tock algorithm scares the shit out of me what does she do on
*  tick-tock she doesn't she has a tick-tock she posts a lot of like YMH
*  clips on there and stuff but she posts what her feed looks like on her stories
*  on Instagram and it'll be like the most country like bumpkin type of people no
*  teeth like kissing their brothers and sisters like it's wild is that because
*  of stuff she posts or it's because of the stuff that she likes I think she
*  likes that weird like deep like southern yeah part of tick-tock which that's
*  funny well they love absurd shit oh I know your mom's house is such a good
*  podcast it's so good it's the two of them together you got to literally have
*  the best stand-up comedians on earth that happen to be married to each other
*  and one of the only arguments other than like there's a few other art like Moshe
*  Kasher and Natasha Ligero that is a great example of two really talented
*  really funny really smart people that it actually works yeah as a marriage yeah
*  but you don't get too many of those you get like Rich Voss and Bonnie McFarlane
*  that's a good example both fucking hilarious both really smart don't you
*  just want to like spy on them I always want to like go to their house and be
*  like what do you guys do when you're not like they're just funny I know
*  they're funny with each other too they their podcast I don't know if they still
*  do it are they still doing that podcast they did it wasn't it was on serious I'm
*  calling it a podcast but it was on satellite radio I remember stopping in
*  the parking lot once at Disneyland and listening to it I had to go inside I
*  think I go I had to go get something from the car my wife hates me is it still
*  on is it on sorry so disjointed folks is a podcast this is it's on the riot
*  cast network which I think the newest episode came out last month so is it on
*  iTunes and all that stuff too but anyway I remember parking in my car and not and
*  just the I just sat in the car for five minutes listening to how the story
*  finished out yeah is it two of them together like rich is like one of the
*  best guys ever at taking a joke he's like when on the Opie and Anthony show
*  like he was fantastic at going with it and taking a joke and then when they
*  would fuck with each other like rich Voss comes from this old-school New York
*  City stand-up world where there's always some shit going on in the crowd there's
*  always some people that are causing a ruckus there's always and he's just a
*  master at handling shit like that just so relaxed under pressure and like work
*  he's a rich Voss a master crowd and like big Jay Okerson masterful outside of
*  stand-up like just jokes yeah who fell off the stage he got yanked off the
*  stage what happened that he was like talking shit to some girl like a girl in
*  the crowd and that was the boyfriend he got pissed like fuck that's what happened
*  that's what I read I mean I already okay I think so dude that looked horrible
*  he's a funny fucking dude yeah big Jay is very funny his his stand-up comedy
*  album is excellent it's really funny yeah that's like one of those skills
*  that I'm like he's a great storyteller too you know so oh that's funny thank
*  you all well wishes as you can see I'm all good mad chillin oh my god he's
*  funny those guys all those Legion of Skanks guys they are they're doing like
*  comedy for savages oh yeah only savages yeah just even the name Legion of Skanks
*  you know it's a dirty crowd but it's like they're embracing it I have not I
*  was supposed to but then Corona hit lots of smells lots of smells lots of smells
*  that's what stands out to me damn comedy and I went once when it was in New York
*  I did some shows and it was like they did it like in the dead heat of summer
*  so everyone's sweating everyone has hair everywhere and it was just the smelliest
*  event but the most fun you know their fans are like so into it and they're
*  like so down for a good time I think that's why I like the rave crews
*  because everyone's just so down well it's also people that are just shirking
*  all responsibility this is it and just having fun okay so here Jay's on stage
*  the guy kick him off the stage looks like that's I think that was Louis
*  Jay Gomez like watching oh the guy grabbed his leg so there's a guy
*  grabbing his leg and pull off the stage oh Jesus you can get really hurt like
*  that yeah that's fucked oh my god I don't know what he said to the dude but
*  there's no there's no excuse for that sir have you ever been beat up performing
*  no I have not yeah no it's always possible do you kind of like almost not
*  when you're performing but do you almost like want a fight to initiate so you can
*  like prove your skills no no I do no no I don't want anybody get hurt oh my gosh
*  what have fun I almost got into a fight at the park I started skating during
*  lockdown skateboarding yeah and you know I've gotten better are you shredding I'm
*  shredding I'm fucking ripping it up is that a section I do put it on take
*  yeah none of my videos go viral I'm too old maybe I was skating and dancing at
*  the same time it would work it's like age on tik-tok is like there's there's a
*  certain age I would imagine where it gets cool again like when you're 90
*  year old grandma's on tick-tock like that's cool that's my feed there's like
*  90 year old grandma's who they're like grandkids are telling them what to do
*  and it's but like guys my age 53 year old guys tick-tock dancing they're on
*  there and it's frightening yeah they're doing this stuff yes now where did this
*  come from where this this tick-tocky movement like this is honestly it's the
*  dumbest because there's like that girl Charlie who has so many fans she like is
*  a dancer like she grew up dancing so she knows how to dance but tick-tock like
*  warps your brain into doing the most like bare minimum type of dances it'll
*  be like they'll they'll do a song and in the song it'll say like my heart beats
*  and then the dance is like you're pretty much doing like interpretive dance
*  and then making it a trend you know there it's not like skilled dancing where
*  you're like wow it's just like who would have ever thought that that
*  interpretive dance like what like I've got an app I want to put on the app
*  store I guys I'm telling you this is gonna be huge well what is it it's
*  interpretive dance yeah get the fuck out of my office why do you keep bringing
*  these morons in here and there's no one wants to do interpretive dance there's a
*  My heart beats.
*  And then this is what I don't like about TikTok is that there's these young
*  everyone's on it and there's young people there's old people but like
*  there'll be songs that are like yeah suck my dick in blah blah blah and then
*  they dance to that is like you're putting your hand above where a dick
*  would be and then you're doing like a bouncing motion and there's like 13
*  doing this and I'm just like ah there's there's creepy people and I want to like
*  I want to stop it but you can't and I've also been like you know I've been a
*  middle schooler on weird websites where there's like creepy dudes like there's
*  this website called Omegle and you can talk to complete strangers it's kind of
*  like chat roulette and I was on that when I was in middle school and like now
*  that I'm an adult I'm like why was I ever on there you know who does those
*  kind of stings where they they play pretend that they're a little kid and
*  then set people up yeah set up pedophiles Shaquille O'Neal what yes
*  wait he dresses like a girl no he goes on chat rooms and pretends he's a young
*  girl like for fun no to get catch pedophiles well yeah he was telling me
*  he did that he he's like a legit sheriff's deputy yeah where is Shaquille
*  O'Neal he's like a sheriff's deputy or something I don't know if he still is
*  and he's also a DJ he's also the biggest human I've ever met in my life he's so
*  big he did fear factor with me and it was like me like I was with my dad like
*  I was like a six-year-old with his dad he's so big he's like three two one go
*  he has to have a huge boom even if it's regular size he's so big it has to be
*  ridiculous yeah he was still in the NBA that was in 2005 in Roanoke Virginia but
*  he is a resident in Georgia where he is an honorary deputy in Clayton County
*  yeah so the honorary deputy that's like being an honorary graduate student from
*  USC yes it's not totally legit he's not like you know whipping out a pistol and
*  driving down the freeway you probably have to do something yeah and I think it
*  allows you to carry a gun a lot of places you couldn't ordinarily he said
*  he's actually gonna run for sheriff but a couple years ago so like this would be
*  now he's a super nice guy he's so big though yeah like it's interesting that a
*  guy that big is actually too big for fighting because the UFC doesn't have a
*  super heavyweight weight class look at the size of him oh my god his head looks so small
*  far away does it go makes him look so that's ridiculous yeah humans come in
*  all sorts of sizes we're like dogs yeah you know that's I like going to the spa
*  like the Korean spa because you get to see everyone naked and you're like oh my
*  body's not that weird was that gentlemen's name and how tall is Yao
*  seven seven seven six somewhere in there is crazy damn seven seven from China he
*  made China big huge in the NBA and this is yeah him and the smallest guy in the
*  NBA five that guy's so cute that's crazy he's so enormous genetics are weird I'm
*  missing and it's interesting that he's Chinese like because there's a bunch of
*  really tall guys from China right there's quite a few like when did that
*  start when did dudes from China start being giant and coordinated I don't know
*  would you know what I'm saying like if you look at like specific body types
*  there's like places that you recognize as having like enormous body that's why
*  I was saying that because they're there and coordinated I added because it would
*  be going to like scouting and recruiting because you would have to there's a
*  movie shack was in called blue chips in the 90s that like you went and found the
*  guy and then which is what they do in the NBA now you can make some guy from
*  like Africa for instance who doesn't know how to play like the answer to
*  excuse me on to to cupo brothers who came from Africa went to Greece tall
*  giant skinny uncoordinated but have athletic ability way more than anybody
*  could ever do so if you can get them to shoot a little bit get them practice and
*  shooting you can be the best basketball players of all time which you're seeing
*  actually right now with one of them he's only like 24 and he is they call him the
*  Greek freak he's crazy is an insane basketball player and his little
*  brothers are now like getting recruited and put on every team interesting if
*  you find somebody deep in like wherever I don't know where they're finding
*  people in China but like there's probably some people deep in Russia or
*  who knows where yeah I wonder what that is though like what what what is it
*  about a certain group of people like when you see like people from Iceland and
*  those giant strongman competition dudes so many of them are from Iceland but
*  that makes sense to the size that do with the rock the rock is so big you
*  don't realize how ridiculous that picture is unless you've actually been
*  around the rock are you guys friends I know him Adam but you're not like what's
*  up bro I mean I hug him when I see him yeah just cuz I respect him and he's I
*  love he's tall he's enormous he's like six nine oh really he's so big oh he's a
*  cartoon you meet him you're like how are you a real yeah he's so big like he's
*  so jacked too what a crazy career trajectory listen that guy works hard he
*  works hard when you look at someone like the rock are you like I need to stop my
*  game yes always always look at that what the fuck is that look at his body that's
*  too much no no no that's the right amount six six I like scrawny little like
*  good he's so and he wears cowboy boots too or some shit he's so big but he's
*  also like insanely disciplined he's not just an enormous human being from just
*  being born big he's insanely disciplined yeah I mean you follow his
*  Instagram feed you feel really fucking lazy back at that up one back up where
*  you were we just were he was there was a grid of images oh my god yeah
*  seriously scroll down to that one where he doesn't have a shirt keep going right
*  there with want the plate what the fuck son but that's that makes me uncomfortable
*  years and years and years and years and years and years of grinding that's what
*  that is you don't get built like that like sure there's some Mexican
*  supplements involved in there and sure there's some genetics but you got to
*  work I just body like that don't get what like but why do you need that body
*  shut your mouth woman of having it oh my god you're such a girl
*  who wants to be the ultimate man look at him for what are you talking about
*  days off are you kidding me it's the ultimate man look at some fucking
*  perfect specimen for some people how dare you I'm sorry what do you end up
*  like real emo guys who cough a lot yes that's why I like we fragile boys yes
*  on scrawny men who want to be the baby spoon I want to be mama's spoon let me
*  warm you up guys who are always cold yeah I think I'm sick check my forehead
*  that's serious oh my god yeah yeah meanwhile look at him fucking build on
*  that man that's a man that's a specimen mmm I get it you're in the tick tockers
*  yeah I mean it's a crazy thing to be like insanely dedicated to and it's also
*  yeah one of them in the amount of effort that guy has to put out to keep his body
*  looking like that the efforts insane if you ever worked out you realize like to
*  just to maintain that all the time like that the way he does yeah that's insane
*  can I go pure does that kill the vibe no no no I gotta this is a tick tock
*  conspiracy thing I like read about I'd like to pass it by you and let you know
*  if you think it's like okay if this makes sense because there's a lot of
*  like kids on there they figure out how that algorithm works to themselves get
*  bigger on it or whatnot so they say that if you start a new account one of the
*  first things they'll do with one of your first couple posts they'll almost make
*  it go viral so those I don't know how that they send it out to more people or
*  whatnot but you have a video that then baits you back in so they get whereas
*  most people know most people have not had the chance to go viral or had their
*  15 seconds of fame online so they'll give it to you like a little drug dealer
*  and give you that dopamine so now you come back and keep trying to do it again
*  and trying and trying and trying right and it worked I mean it may or may not
*  have worked but that makes sense I mean they're trying to rope you in the best
*  way to rope you in is give you some success right
*  but no one you know that well don't you think that in a way well I guess it's
*  not really comparable I was talking about the Apple algorithm they use for
*  podcasts where the new it's probably similar a little bit good way you first
*  started yeah they'll think you'll just you up to the top so you can like um we
*  have the most successful podcast we just started that's and that's amazing yeah
*  let's keep at this thing yes and then once the algorithm it's a weird algorithm
*  like it tricks you because if you have a new podcast what are the what are the
*  specifics do we know the specifics no one knows so it's just guessing guessing
*  for sure that's interesting to figure out like this actually work it's funny
*  how people like like Apple and and also things like Netflix like Netflix you
*  never you never have any idea what's like what's numb what the numbers are
*  what number of people are viewing things it doesn't say it like a YouTube clip
*  does yeah you have to kind of guess they know but they don't tell anybody but
*  it's kind of the same thing in a way I mean I've seen people say like the NBA
*  ratings are way down right now and it's well that these are almost preseason
*  games a lot of people watch the last two games of the regular season anyway
*  mm-hmm all the games have already been figured out next week when the playoffs
*  start then check the ratings and see where they're at but it's just it's
*  interesting to me when you have no idea what the algorithm is whether it's the
*  iTunes podcast algorithm or Netflix's algorithm you really don't know you
*  don't they know when we were kids we thought TRL was people calling and
*  voting to make the most popular video on MTV every day like that wasn't that
*  wasn't happening dude how crazy was Rob Lowe saying that he was on the worst show on
*  television meaning it was the the least rated show on television it was 19
*  million people watched it yeah that's because there wasn't any
*  TikToks back then but how bonkers is that yeah and that was what is that the
*  80s yeah yeah I think 19 million now you'd be for sure the biggest hit on any
*  TV well we decided right didn't we look at it we found NCIS is like number one
*  and that has like 15 million crazy which is sounds like an enormous number yeah
*  the fact that 19 million which the was the worst rated show would be the biggest
*  highly most highly rated show now yeah that's because there's so many different
*  ways to watch so much content speaking of content don't you have a podcast I do
*  have a podcast that segue thank you professional yeah I have a podcast
*  called resting bitch but I made the mistake I didn't know I just like went
*  into it I'm like I have a resting bitch face have a resting bitch voice like and
*  I'm gonna be doing it on a couch and I look like I'm resting bitch you know
*  right and oh look at that Jimmy you're so good he's the best he's the best so
*  yeah I have that pot I'll remember when I used to do shows
*  Annie practically Annie assaulted me on this episode she tried to eat me out I
*  love her me too she's so funny she's awesome and that they're doing a
*  comic-story documentary I gotta see a clip with her in it I'm nervous I'm
*  supposed to be in that we'll see I'm nervous but um yeah I do that podcast
*  from my producer Anthony's house and yeah it's fun that's awesome yeah but
*  because it has the word bitch in the title it doesn't pop up right away
*  because they try and like put yeah I made the mistake whatever next podcast
*  the alley mccoskey experience so did they did they censor that I don't think
*  they censor I just think like on YouTube it's not gonna be like top of the
*  recommended or something because the word bitch yeah but also because it's
*  not like it's the most poppin thing but it's definitely a little bit hidden not
*  shadow band but you can just call it resting be yeah resting be pod or just
*  call it your fucking name kid that's the easiest way because if you I think like
*  I like names of shows that are interesting but if I want to see the
*  Joey Diaz show I want to see the Joey Diaz show where's the Joey Diaz show
*  like I don't care what you call it what is it yeah it's the fucking canoe on top
*  of the house what that's the name of my show the canoe on top of the house is he
*  moving to he is moving to he's moving to New Jersey yeah I give him a year I give
*  him a year of ice and snow that's what I said about you really yeah give me a
*  year yeah I don't know I feel are you keeping your place out here yeah okay
*  yeah that's good good for now okay we'll see yeah so it's just vacant that means
*  like if someone one of your friends who is like 24 this is a weird state right
*  now it is weird I don't know what to do I keep debating I'm like do I move in
*  with my parents do I stay at my place well it's not it's never a bad thing to
*  be with other folks especially if you don't mind it and you actually enjoy
*  being around them because this is like a fucking strange time people need help
*  sometimes people are sick and they don't want to admit it and you got to go hey
*  are you okay and you got to fucking get him to the hospital as quick as you can
*  you know but what do you mean old people that get coronavirus yeah are you saying
*  my parents anybody not just you but anybody like living with your parents
*  not a bad move yeah but the problem is you have to be really responsible with
*  what you do there's a lot of kids that want to live with their parents and then
*  they want to go party like you could kill your parents like that shit is
*  happening to people there was a 21 year old kid who came home gave it to his dad
*  his dad was in the fucking ICU I would feel so guilty didn't know even know you
*  had it I had a friend I was with who tested positive and I'm like that sucks
*  because then you have to act like you have an STD or something in text or hey
*  we had a really good time last week but I have some bad news you got to get
*  tested yeah people have done that at parties they're having these influencer
*  parties and you know they just go buck wild no masks start drinking yeah there
*  was a video like apparently they have houses this is a thing like influencers
*  get houses and then they do parties and that Jamie's laughing because it's like
*  I'm learning about fire so you hit sticks you rub them you make fire it's
*  warmer I joked about the Hype house this weekend I was totally making a joke
*  yeah I don't even know I know that that's a thing but it's a thing so they
*  do it there's a bunch of people doing that now they get houses yeah they go
*  crazy my sister just had her bachelorette party but everyone got
*  tested before we stayed in the Airbnb the whole time so I think there's ways
*  of doing it that are okay yeah there's ways of doing it that are okay
*  you can't be drinking and fucking jumping on top of each other in the pool
*  and you know there's a hundred and ninety thousand of you I mean they've
*  had these they're having these fucking parties with like 200 people jammed into
*  a house and everybody's breathing each other's air where's my invite Charlie
*  D'Amelio COVID parties are a pandemic urban legend that won't go away oh but
*  that's what people trying to catch right that's yeah just so there's a
*  clarification on that well that's that's a different thing what we're talking
*  about is influencer parties where they just they don't give a fuck about the
*  rules Leonardo DiCaprio had a party on his yacht and everyone was wearing
*  cowboy hats and I'm pretty sure he stole my COVID cowboy theme at least I'm gonna
*  say that that sounds very schizophrenic and probably don't mention that in
*  public no Leo's watching he's aware of what I'm talking about these um COVID
*  parties where people are trying to catch COVID that's bullshit though right yeah
*  but these aren't remember I was telling you they're saying there's like these
*  giant LA Hollywood Hills mansion party right we start shutting down they were
*  like these were on TV they had like the cameras that are usually doing the high
*  speed chases they were like watching these well my yeah that that that thing
*  is weird because the gut the mayor rather is gonna shut down the power and
*  shut off the water to these people right there's a certain amount of house I
*  think that no one lives in they're just normally rented out for houses for
*  parties that in general and they're probably people were just like oh that
*  was like what Bill Zarian was doing right yeah he rented this big giant ass
*  house in Bel Air and he'd have these big crazy influencer parties people get real
*  mad yeah that like if you if you live in these neighborhoods and you're like a
*  regular person with like a regular life and then all sudden an influencer party
*  moves in next door all day long they're just blasting music and fucking smoking
*  weed and you're like oh no yeah well I remember Jake and Logan Paul used to
*  have a house right by the improv yes and kids would just show up at their
*  house there would be like it looked like a block party there were all these
*  teenage girls yelling out their window and all the neighbors were like we're
*  just trying to live yeah they fucked up and now that one of the brothers Jake or
*  Logan got raided his house got raided that was Jake there were guns everywhere
*  yeah well he was the guy that was at the Arizona mall yeah whoops why people
*  looting is very interesting it's not good yeah it's weird watching people just
*  steal shit and run out of stores like wow this is so weird it's just weird
*  watching yeah and then it feels very like a apocalyptic movie it does yeah
*  well it's coming it comes out in these like big bursts too like what happened
*  in Chicago these big bursts of looting and you're watching on television you're
*  like what this is such a crazy virus it's in the air but it's indicative of
*  all these people needing things and being broke as fuck man like not having
*  any work at all for months and months and months and watch the economy crumble
*  with no like you would steal too I think we would all steal if we were 20 years
*  old and fucked up and you're that that's where you live and everybody else is
*  stealing like let's do it let's fucking do it you're running that store you know
*  there's a thing that happens to people when there's a bunch of us and things go
*  sideways like chaos big chaos moments well there's always chaos but it's
*  like somewhat controlled you know the chaos is organized in a way where you
*  feel like there's no chaos and things are smooth and I think this just kind of
*  cracked it open where it's like oh we can just kind of do whatever well it's
*  the thin veneer of civilization has been exposed there's some cracks and you see
*  right through it and you saw through it during the looting in Santa Monica I was
*  watching this guy run around with a gun and he's pointing it at people and this
*  other guy was yelling at him and he's sticking the gun at him and then he
*  runs into traffic and people are honking this guy's got a gun and there's
*  just people running out of store stealing shit and I remember watching
*  that video going whoa this is Santa Monica yeah this is why you'll yeah this
*  is up if there was a movie and in the movie a disease spread that made people
*  reckless and wild and it made them they started stealing and assaulting each
*  other and carrying guns everywhere was just a disease that flew through the
*  air yeah you'd be like what a crazy movie like this is Santa Monica 2020
*  like fuck you Santa Monica it was like like someone had sprayed something in
*  the air that made people hyper aggressive reckless and crazy that's what
*  it seemed because you go into like that fight-or-flight mode you're like I don't
*  know what's gonna happen I don't know where I fit into this equation there's
*  that but I think there's also something else going on when they when they say
*  that term mob mentality yeah have you ever felt it for sure have you ever been
*  in a place where like a fight breaks out at a basketball game or something like
*  that was any place anywhere there's a large group of people and a fight breaks
*  out there's a crackling in the air like you're ready to stab somebody yeah like
*  it's nuts that's how I felt at the UFC I was like I'm taking jujitsu right now
*  sign me up that's a little different but I'm talking about like lawless shit yeah
*  the the violence that you see at the UFC is the best substitute because it's
*  completely controlled everybody has a hold of it you know there's rules is a
*  referee there's doctors it's trained fighters so many rules yes it's really
*  very it's very well set up and very important but the thing about it is that
*  is violence but it's just violence in the most controlled and safe way what
*  I'm talking about is lawless violence when shit breaks out like a scrap in a
*  parking lot when people are fighting that's when things are strange because
*  that's that feeling like fucking anything can happen someone can shoot
*  somebody somebody could run people over people generally never run people over
*  on purpose but they do when they're yelling at each other like if you're at
*  a gas station you see someone fucking run someone over on a YouTube video
*  you're like oh my god like what is happening yeah they're going sideways
*  conflict makes me so anxious I hate saying like fights or any like it just
*  makes me sweat yeah well it's danger altercations stresses me out I was at a
*  I turned into a riot where seven or eight I think 13 cars got flipped over
*  after Ohio State beat Michigan one year and we were headed to the National
*  Championship and you could feel around four o'clock when one couch was on fire
*  in the middle of the street that like we're in the Hornets nest like this
*  shit's about to go down later and it definitely did that I remember seeing
*  the SWAT team get up at the end of the street knee-knocker bullets getting
*  blasted out tear gas almost like what's been going on now this was like 18 years
*  ago but as you were sort of saying I was like actually that one time after the
*  Conor and can be fight I was in the crowd right where that was happening for
*  about three minutes it felt crazy and then like they kind of got a hold
*  everything and they're like it's fine but like that's there for a second that
*  could have been crazy it could have been really crazy that was one of those
*  moments where you know those lawless melee moments that was pretty controlled
*  as far as I didn't I wasn't that was there police around or whatever but just
*  for that little spot cuz I was I was right there and there's some drunk guy
*  next to me that was the thing about that one though it was so entertaining
*  because it was two of the best fighters in the world involved in post-fight
*  brawls right so Conor's getting beat up by these dudes are jumping over the cage
*  chaos excitement into just like hey we got overtime but no but that's what I
*  think kept people from fighting in the crowd like what they were seeing was so
*  entertaining like you don't get in a fight in the middle of a great fight yeah
*  you get in a fight when you know something happens and then you decide it
*  was just weird I said it was weird I was from I'm trying I was putting myself
*  back in the feeling of like Juan the fights over and now what's going on
*  around me this is great oh shit that's the only time I've felt that again where
*  it was just like I because when the cars were getting flipped me and my friends
*  we were not we knew better than to get in it like right but doesn't it feels
*  like something changes in the air yeah plus you could smell the tear gas that
*  day but yeah yeah but there's something about like chaos where I think it's
*  because of war I think every human being that's alive today is the descendant of
*  people who are successful in war it just seems like war has always been around
*  right and ever since the first you know really primitive primates hit each other
*  with rocks and figured out that it's a better way to do it than just biting
*  each other you know the first the first animal that figured out how to start you
*  know attacking other groups and dominate them and gain success and gain their
*  food and gain their women they just been doing that ever since yeah so we are the
*  people that survived that I think there's a switch that goes off when
*  there's like a riot when some chaos yeah like you got to be like any fucking
*  thing can happen right now and people do shit they would never do like something
*  about it's like a melee button that gets hit and like you felt it right yeah shit
*  scary then this is what we're seeing is a country like the whole country hit
*  this melee button and that's where the looting and the right I mean people are
*  way more aggressive with it I mean I'm watching people drive different people
*  just running red lights bro people run red lights sometimes like fucking five
*  runs yeah they just they just they don't want to stop they they're cutting people
*  off watch this lady just pull out of this covid test place and clip some
*  lady's car and like oh she was like frantic like it does feel like people
*  are more on edge now I think it's yeah I think like people being inside and this
*  kind of like unknown feeling is really causing people to go through like a lot
*  of mental anguish well and then we go back to the financial shit yeah like
*  they're like how do I get out of this yeah how do I get out of this yeah like
*  if it's already five months in and I know this is gonna go on until January
*  how do I get out of this yeah and it's like when things open up and I can start
*  doing shows again it's like but am I gonna be doing enough shows to like be
*  felt like am I gonna have to work at a chicken wings restaurant again I don't
*  know are there gonna be real shows anytime soon when do you think those are
*  gonna happen when it's gonna be the first show when the first real show in
*  LA do you think in January or February at the earliest yeah that's what I think
*  do you think magicians are struggling right now do you think they feel the
*  same way they're out there killing it tick-tock tick-tock means do they have
*  magicians on tick-tock probably they have they seriously anything you can
*  think of there's tick-tocks about it is there archery probably yeah
*  oh there's dude you do crazy shit there's a guy who can shoot a what's a
*  circle life-saving throws a lifesaver in the air and he can shoot it and hit it
*  what's in the air what the hell yeah cuz you want to kill a bug with your bow
*  tick-tocking tick-tock mmm yeah I think January is probably the earliest we're
*  gonna see clubs open up here yeah cuz here we are in August there's no no no
*  chance anytime soon oh archery on tick-tock half a billion views for the
*  hashtag archery so this oh that's crazy go dive deep archery's go to that one
*  right there BAM that dude's about to whack that elk no he's not it's too
*  small he's gonna let it go what do you mean it's too small that is a big animal
*  but that's a young elk you want a big old elk well you don't want to shoot the
*  young ones unless they have a an overpopulation of them and then they
*  give out what they call a spike tag cuz that's they would call that a spike elk
*  well it didn't know he was there when the elk are horny in particular which is
*  when you know the rut they scream you ever heard an elk scream mmm go to the
*  busy wild Instagram page if they make the most amazing sound or Cameron Haynes
*  Cameron Haynes has it on his page go to Cameron Haynes Instagram page and there's
*  a video of an elk standing and then screaming and as it's screaming like the
*  smoke is coming out of its mouth you know because it's the hot air and the
*  cold the cold cold winter mountain and the hot air coming out of its mouth and
*  you can see it all spraying in the air no not that one there's another one the
*  one of the far that's it right there give me some volume look at this
*  yeah look at the smoke this smoke coming out of his mouth all the steam I mean how
*  dope is that watch this that's the king of the mountain that big motherfucker is
*  the king of the mountain is that a female or a male that's a male that's a
*  bull damn see the antlers those antlers are 100% to let the bitches know and
*  to fuck up other dudes that's what they do they kill each other with those
*  things all the time yeah they run into each other and stab each other with the
*  weapons that nature has bestowed upon them they grow them out every year and
*  then they fall off so that that would fall off and then new ones would grow in
*  a couple of months yes that's real damn yeah it's the king of the mountain crazy
*  there's a there's I don't think it's on that same page I wish I could find the
*  page it was on because I forgot to bookmark it but there was a crazy video
*  of this elk running away from this pack of wolves and this pack of wolves is
*  just snapping at its legs and just running up behind it and chasing it
*  snapping at its legs and then they eventually just swarm it it's it is
*  ruthless yeah it is so wild to see that these these just giant ancestors of dogs
*  exist free in the mountains it's really fucking pretty amazing yeah so in North
*  America wolves taken out a giant elk and you could watch the video I mean I don't
*  know if they did it from a drone or what because it was up in the sky and it's
*  it's it's so ruthless is this one this is this is where the wolves are chasing
*  them but when they get one okay here yeah and they can run really good in the
*  snow because their feet are like at the end of them are webbed almost like a
*  snowshoe they have really enormous feet whereas the elk kind of sink in the
*  snow and it hinders their movement me imagine that has been playing out that
*  that war between wolves and elk that's been playing out for thousands and
*  thousands of years when did you get into like all the hunting and stuff like that
*  tooth it look at how they bite him on the legs this is how they go after him
*  they bite him on the legs yeah this is the video this is it so this is where I
*  saw it on Instagram the elk are not showing on screen because you can't yeah
*  the elk is the elk is running in the wolf pack is behind it and you could see
*  he keeps going deeper and deeper into the snow and he's stumbling and the
*  wolves just eventually get him and when they get him it's ruthless we don't have
*  to watch it wolf pack gives chase to group of elk yeah there you go there's
*  another one grizzly bear chases elk in Yellowstone Park somebody posted one
*  yesterday I wish I saw it I wish I booked more that one too but it was a
*  bison hitting another bison and making it fly through the air in crazy so these
*  people are in the road right and they're watching these bison walk across the
*  road and the bison started fucking with each other and one of them gets mad and
*  runs at the other one and launches him into the air so you're looking at a
*  two thousand plus pound animal and this other two thousand plus pound animal
*  throws it through the air with its head just makes it go flying have you ever
*  accidentally hit an animal when driving hit squirrels yes did you feel sad yeah
*  cuz the yeah here tumble inside you real well one time I ran over a bunny and I
*  was traumatized yeah that is sad Ali thanks for letting us know you didn't
*  bring Marshall I wanted to meet the dog yeah unfortunately I'm gonna go shoot
*  guns after this I'm going next week yeah we don't I think Angeles Forest okay
*  yeah I know where that is just the outdoor yeah there's a great range out
*  there yeah my friend toks has a bunch of guns have you done it before I went with
*  him once before and I cried the first time cried the first time you pull the
*  trigger in ecstasy no yeah fear cuz I was just like it was just so scary it's
*  such a powerful feeling and it really freaked me out and then I started to have
*  fun and I was like yeah got into it you went the other way yeah but it was like
*  one of those things where I'm like I'd be fine if I never did like I wasn't
*  like I have to keep doing this but if the opportunity presents itself so it
*  didn't become an obsession but you in you were entertained yeah there were
*  certain guns that I like shooting more than others that were more fun it's a
*  smart thing to learn how to do yeah unfortunately when you see the Santa
*  Monica scene you see the thin veneer of civilization pulled off and how easily
*  people can go crazy it's a bummer but it's real yeah yeah I just hope it all
*  gets better me too I feel like everyone's so negative are you eagerly
*  anticipating what's gonna happen during the election are you weirded out by
*  like the possibility that no matter who wins it could be chaos I yeah I think
*  like what you were saying it's like it's already you know we already kind of see
*  through the government and realize it's all pretty fucked regardless of whoever
*  wins no matter how good the candidate is but I also think that this has shown us
*  like we do have so much power to influence what happens it's not so much
*  who the figure is or the person wearing the suit it's more about like people
*  coming together and like making some change themselves do you sound like a
*  person who bought into all the political propaganda that they're pumping out in
*  the news right now this it's really about big businesses and special
*  interests making as much money as possible and keeping people fat and
*  stupid and they do their best to keep us uneducated yeah trapped inside our house
*  with low vitamin D and then they create viruses and then they release those
*  viruses on purpose yeah I don't think that I know I know I know but I just
*  fucking around if you didn't get it people at home yeah I don't know I just
*  I think that we do I think we're just realizing that we do have more power to
*  influence how things go sure we do yeah we have more of a voice for sure yeah
*  ever before it's it's it's very interesting I just want people hopefully
*  to use their voice in like a positive way I think that it's really easy to
*  like attack people regardless of whether it's political or not nowadays with
*  anything going on it's so easy to be like a negative voice when I think that
*  feels you feel angry you know the anger that most people have is accentuated by
*  the economic situation and the virus situation right so even if you were
*  already like an angry person you're gonna be really angry down frustrated and
*  it doesn't seem like a way out I almost like the way people are the we pay way
*  people are behaving today with all the tension and all the infighting and all
*  the chaos it's almost like this isn't it's not even their fault I really
*  almost feel that way I feel like most people are so unprepared for something
*  this stressful and anything that's really stressful like that gets you so
*  out of your head and when everybody's out of their head and no one could just
*  calm down it's not a good combination it's not good for anybody and the real
*  problem is there's not a real clear antidote for it yeah there's not a real
*  clear path out of this that's what makes me real nervous that's why I know I
*  sound so miss congeniality but I think like if people were just like nicer to
*  each other yeah it sounds so corny but not all the time it doesn't need to be
*  like phony niceness but rather than being like mean or negative or attacking
*  just don't say mean I don't know I just people have requirements and one of the
*  requirements is they have to be able to make a living yeah you know and as much
*  as I think that universal basic income like one of the things this whole
*  pandemic shit what it's shown us that it's not a bad idea to have a certain
*  amount of money that you have allocated to everybody so that they could pay
*  their bills and pay for food it seems like we should have figured that out and
*  Andrew Yang was talking about this in terms of automation but it's just as
*  important with or more important with this yeah the pandemic you don't have
*  any choices everybody has I mean it's like if automation comes and takes your
*  job maybe you could figure out another job yeah but if there's no fucking jobs
*  because no one's allowed to work then that's the best argument ever for
*  universal basic income yeah I feel like only fans is like the new trading of
*  furs it's like here's nudes can I make money you shouldn't have said that on
*  the podcast you just saved that one okay I'm putting it in the bank yeah we
*  have to fucking delete that no keep it in it's funny it's very funny people
*  yeah I need any funny leave it the way it is and then just expand upon it as a
*  bit because you're totally right it is like because I was thinking I'm like
*  okay well if comedy is dead and there's like I can either sell chicken wings
*  but like I don't know there's only so many I want to go back to trading but
*  there's only so much you can trade and like the only thing I have is my feet
*  during times of great prosperity being a ho is a choice yeah right but there's a
*  lot of reluctant hoes I'm a scared ho on the inside I'm like I'm a bad bitch I
*  listen to Meg the stallion Cardi B wet ass pussy's my anthem and then like I'll
*  talk to a guy on a dating app and I'm like do you want to go to the park and
*  like I don't know what do you want to do even though you enjoy those art forms
*  and people's expression in general you're a pretty calm person yeah that's
*  why yeah you like that music because it's fun but that's not that doesn't
*  define you know how funny was that Ben Shapiro thing oh my god
*  wet-ass pussy thing you say that's a result of a gynecological situation yeah
*  how did he say it I don't even know he like was reading them and he's like well
*  in conclusion no what s pussy is actually not that wet Ben Benny stay in
*  your lane I mean I like Ben Shapiro let me just state this I think people get
*  the wrong impression about him all the time I think he's a very nice guy he's
*  a very smart guy but he he has his blind spots like we all do and when you think
*  that wet-ass pussy is a gynecological condition mmm whoops let me tell you
*  something the mass humiliation of Ben Shapiro I like him as a human I know him
*  as a human being and that's a problem like you see someone who does like
*  performative work about politics because part of what he does is funny like he
*  has a mug that says leftist tears you know and he serves you water like when
*  Ezra Klein from Vox was on his show he drank out of a cup that said leftist
*  tears yeah and they were actually talking about it like he's like like
*  don't you think this is an it's like it I think it's funny yeah he leans into it
*  look he's good guys just not perfect not like all of us this is a thing like what
*  you want to find one thing wrong with the person and fucking hate him yeah and
*  that's just silly yeah you can still think he's a nice guy and still think
*  it's fucking silly to make fun of wet pussy totally or it's like I might not
*  like the guy but I don't need to like attack him yeah I'm telling you but he
*  does have a goofy ass little smirk well he's he's a profession look one of the
*  reasons why people love Floyd Mayweather is because he talks so much shit he talks
*  so much that he's always showing his money he's kind of trolling in a way
*  that's become such a thing in fighting and then well with him he was so good at
*  it because he was a guy who was very safety first as a boxer like incredibly
*  skillful like arguably the best boxer of all time but he didn't go after guys and
*  just engage in wars he fought very tactically and he's fighting the best
*  fighters in the world so he has to fight very cautiously sometimes that's the
*  correct way to do it but he figured out a way to get people to pay attention
*  because that generally like being the most skillful is great but you want
*  people to pay attention so you want to be like a Mike Tyson guy who knocks
*  everybody out well if you're not a Mike Tyson guy that knocks everybody out the
*  best way to get people to pay attention is make them want you to lose show them
*  all your money oh look at that watch it's a million dollars yeah this hat
*  look at these diamonds look at this and look at this jet I flew in a bitch you
*  ain't get shit yeah no and you just want to beat him up you want him to get his
*  ass kicked but meanwhile he's the best boxer ever and so he's just outboxing
*  all these people and he never gets his ass kicked it's kind of funny I mean if
*  you really pay attention to it it's kind of fun well Ben Shapiro is that's kind
*  of what he does like says things knowing it's gonna piss people off and then
*  they're paying attention to him yeah but he also says some things that make sense
*  he's very good at debate he's very good at arguing with uneducated people who
*  just like automatically subscribe to left-wing ideas he can chop those up
*  quick you don't have your your thoughts dialed in and your argument dialed in
*  but he's you know he's a person yeah it's a very nice guy I like all people
*  just people I know this is the this is the if I can you know it's fucking nice
*  for you guys you're fucking making money you're a comedian you're this you're
*  right but what Ali's saying if we just be nicer to each other is the solution I
*  think it is if there's more camaraderie and understanding and seeing that people
*  like Ben or Alex Jones all your fun friends you know they're all people
*  they're human being you know I don't yeah this is the thing it's like this is
*  the one of the real problems with cancel culture like they'll say something like
*  like oh Matt Lauer's got plenty of money you know or and make up a person who's
*  been canceled oh they're fine they got plenty of money it's you're not thinking
*  about what what hurts yeah it's material yeah what hurts is the
*  psychological aspect of whatever it is and what we're doing is we're lash we're
*  lashing out at people for mistakes and we're saying it in a way where like
*  there's no way you can get better and this is who you are forever yeah and
*  there's like a narrative that people create they assume that they know
*  things about you and want to create this story to make it look a certain way to
*  validate their point when it's like no one knows anyone entirely like you have
*  kids you don't know exactly who they are because they're their own little thing
*  you know exactly and as much as you think you know you know something about
*  someone like you just don't and I feel like everyone should be worthy of
*  redemption and and again we're talking we're not talking about crimes I'm not
*  talking about people stealing or murder or rape or chaos or stabbing or shooting
*  or not talking about that what we're talking about is public execution yeah
*  there's there's a thing that people are doing now where they just love the pile
*  on and it's because there's they're not in a good place like there's so much
*  I was watching this one pile on where this guy was oh this is from Douglas
*  Murray's book that's what it was Douglas Murray's book the madness of
*  crowds he's a brilliant man an author who is often misrepresented they often
*  misrepresent his positions on things because he takes a pragmatic non-woke but
*  he's a gay man gay man from England who's brilliant and so it's like it's
*  hard like they get real confused they run into him they're like shit yeah well
*  being gay or having something like that makes you stand out doesn't make you a
*  well they have a problem like if he has opinions on trans people or if he has
*  opinions on even on gay people even on like his his opinions are he thinks what
*  he thinks and he's smart enough to be able to express it in a way that's very
*  difficult to argue yeah and because of that people they get pissy about it I
*  remember when I was talking about like what was the initial point public
*  execution no it was before that people be shit fuck I had a point you take your
*  brain I didn't today what were you talking about right before that though
*  I'm just about fuck people deserving second chances and redemption and they
*  were all material things like you can take away someone's money or whatever
*  they have enough money they should be fine I don't know I have a terrible
*  brain beta brain I can't believe I forgot the story what is that shirt the
*  hundreds shout out to Bobby and Ben what is that Jim how dare I that's back to
*  the future oh okay from it looks like a blob in a lightning bolt let me put my
*  just about to roast I could barely see that yeah back to the future god damn
*  and I'm trying to remember the fucking story and I can't what are you drinking
*  that yellow this is the layered Hamilton turmeric superfood coffee have you had
*  any of that no you should try it okay are you into any health shit right now
*  mmm just like in terms of like eating and taking care of yourself you exercising
*  yeah well skating I've been doing that like almost every day skateboarding
*  yeah do you wear pads and shit if I'm doing if I'm trying to do something
*  crazy I will but if I'm just kind of like cruising around trying to work on
*  my ollies and shove it and whatnot I won't wear the pads but if I'm trying to
*  like drop in which I'm really afraid to do then I'll put on like the knee pads
*  wrist guards helmet I'm not trying to get a concussion are you doing crazy
*  shit like you going over the lip and like scraping the bottom of your board
*  and dropping back down in no I'm using my way look at you oh you look ferocious oh yeah like
*  you're ready to shred I am you ready to go down a railing it's so fun do you do
*  the railing shit you ever know see I was trying to drop in this guy helped me his
*  name's Chris he just like came up to me he saw me struggling and he was like
*  here let me help you but if he wasn't there I would have eaten shit looks like
*  you're about to I was about to for sure what happened there that was just me
*  posted up cross-eyed thought you were injured no so why did you decide that
*  was the thing so okay so I got back to my house had a room that was open to rent
*  one of my roommates left and and my friend was like oh I have a buddy who's
*  looking for a place so this guy comes to my house checks out the room my roommates
*  are asking him questions like what do you do for work and he's like oh like
*  skate stuff whatever he was very vague and when he was walking out to leave I
*  saw my skateboard I've had this board for like four or five years I got it from
*  supreme I like the deck I thought that I was going to be like a skater I thought
*  that everyone would fall in love with me no one did so I stopped skating and so
*  I've had it just sitting in my front yard for like four or five years and so
*  he's leaving and I see my board and I'm like can I resell this like is there any
*  value or do I just like give it to a kid like what do I do with this old board and
*  he picks it up and he looks at the deck and he's like this is my pro model board
*  like yeah and so then ever since then we've been skating together his name is
*  Donovan Piscopo he's so tight he's so nice he's so tight yeah he's so tight
*  he's so sick he fucking shreds he's so dope I remember the story this is a
*  story this really progressive left-wing person here we go was tweeting something
*  this tweet storm of like you know why does everyone have to be sexist and
*  racist and like he adds all these like super woke things and they said and just
*  sitting around eating fucking fast food and watching Netflix that's where he made
*  a mistake because then he was fat shaming and he didn't realize he was
*  fat shaming when he said that and so the people started attacking him like he
*  said everything in the most woke way possible wait what did you this is in
*  Douglas Murray's book madness of crowds and then he goes on this Twitter apology
*  stream that I think Murray said it lasted 15 tweets he's literally begging
*  for his career not to be ended well for saying that people ate junk food yeah
*  a garbage and like why does everybody have to do all these things that are
*  awful plus get fat and like why are we lazy why we stupid yes that's what he's
*  saying but he fucked up and by saying like sitting around eating garbage food
*  you're a fat shaming you don't even realize you're you're being hateful and
*  you can't there's there's no room there's no room yeah there's no room for
*  fucking around like you can't if you want to be a woke person like you could
*  get on you can get canceled at any moment because you never know when the
*  standards have shifted they've become more and more radicalized and so
*  someone's saying something that like five six years ago would be like
*  completely reasonable and make a lot of sense the fuck-up was talking about
*  people who are fat like you can't do it yeah yeah I think well and you can't
*  explain yourself there's no room to explain what you mean right or your side
*  you know no one wants to hear it people just want to be like you're wrong and
*  you're bad what's tag you're it it's a game yeah there's no room for nuance no
*  so a person like that like well listen you've really should eat healthier food
*  why are we lying why are we saying these people eating fast food why would like
*  why fast foods bad doesn't mean being fat is bad well being fat's bad it's not
*  healthy it's not good for you you can't but I have good friends who are fat it's
*  like listen people have problems yeah like I'm gonna be I know I know I'm gonna
*  hit like 32 and I'm just gonna oh yeah or you're gonna crossfit you might go
*  either way maybe but my point is it doesn't mean that fat is good for you
*  just because you love fat people it's still bad for you like if you talk to a
*  doctor I give you talk to a medical doctor you're saying yeah it's bad for
*  you yes so it's not good so like pretending it's okay like you can be
*  healthy and fat is nonsense but the thing is like if you say that you're
*  fat phobic or you're you're fat shaming or you're hurting people but it's just a
*  fact yeah it's it doesn't mean you hate these people yeah it just is what it is
*  yeah that's a problem whenever you can't say what it is like no one can hear
*  just playing pretend right so if a person says all these things you agree
*  with and then you find this one thing instead of saying Bob I'm totally with
*  you on all of that but sometimes the people that are eating fast food are
*  just poor you're like you're right you're right I should have switched that
*  that should be the end of it yeah should we give a person like when you have an
*  opinion if you put out a tweet like one of the things I see people get attacked
*  the most for is errant views in tweets but when you have a tweet and you put
*  it out there that's not your rock-solid married to position anything it's a
*  thought you're thinking out loud be thinking in a typed form which is weird
*  yeah so if you see it in a type form like if you said something fucked up to
*  me but it was just in the moment you said something you thought it was funny
*  it was fucked up that's one thing but if you write it down that's a different
*  thing totally and it's a thing we don't really understand like you see something
*  written like I know what you said but I'm gonna decide that you meant it this
*  way you can change it and switch it around and move it or you and we were
*  talking about this earlier you can even take a thing that would make sense if
*  you said it like like how about suck it bitch like if you just say that out of
*  nowhere and then but you write it down it's like what does that mean yeah
*  where's that coming from like in the moment it was hilarious but when you
*  write it down and just print it somewhere it's like what is that because
*  there's no town no context yeah no context so and we're pretending this is
*  what everybody's doing canceling people for tweets and getting angry at people
*  for things that they've said you're canceling people based on the you're
*  trying to deny nuance you're trying to deny that people shift and they grow and
*  they learn and that's the other thing it's like I feel like everyone
*  hopefully you're like trying to grow as a person and learn new things and have
*  new ideas and so it's like if I said something in 2014 it's probably not how
*  I feel about something now or I'm fucking digging my heels in yeah let me
*  tell you why I believe it yeah yeah but I think I've said this before too but I
*  think the real problem is we can't really read each other's minds we rely
*  on language yeah I don't know what you're really thinking yeah I don't know
*  what you're really thinking you can pretend you know some people are
*  slicker with their words some people are better convinced some people have their
*  game down some people manipulated enough people that they're you know like
*  salesmen and shit or strippers like people are just a really good at selling
*  things yeah they know they know what they're doing I was learning sign
*  language before coven I would go to like deaf meetups there's like that
*  meetups at Starbucks why were you doing that um my grandma was deaf and I never
*  took the time to like really learn sign language which now that I think about it
*  is kind of fucked up that's like if your grandma spoke like Italian and only
*  Italian and you're like I'm just gonna speak English and hope you figure it out
*  I would love to see roast battle with sign language oh that would be fine a
*  lot of body movements a lot of eyes big that would be a great show that's what
*  Netflix you do if they really want to be inclusive yeah there's more deaf people
*  probably than a lot of maligned people yeah what is this oh I love interpreters
*  at concerts that's such an important job when we were at the amphitheater when we
*  were at the amphitheater in the Bay Area there was an interpreter and it made me
*  so happy look how fast she's moving though she's
*  rapping yeah fast song M&M's rap god oh wow Jesus Christ look at her go sign
*  language is so fascinating to me I love it that's crazy like look how fast she's
*  moving she's talking she's ticked that Chinese yeah that's what it is the
*  Chinese government is tricking people into talking in sign language I'm on ASL
*  tick-tock what does that mean American sign language language tick-tock so
*  there's people who yeah I love it I love sign language so you tick-tock using
*  actual words I don't but I watch people who are either deaf or interpreters and
*  they make videos on sign language but you're learning how to tick-tock in
*  sign language at the same time well I kind of stopped learning sign language
*  during the pandemic is one of those things you have to stay up on like you
*  have to sign with people like yeah it's like any language or it's like if you
*  want to get fluent in it you want to be talking in it all the time and I don't
*  really have a lot of deaf friends around to speak to but it was cool going to
*  like those deaf meetups at Starbucks that is cool yeah it's an interesting
*  how much do you really understand a person based on sign language do you do
*  you feel like you're not fluent at it though right no but I I can sign decent
*  enough to have a conversation kind of yeah but I would have to tell them like
*  slow but do you think that when you get to a point like that interpreter and the
*  concert you get that good at sign language you could communicate as clearly
*  but it's the same as any language where it's like I might be like what's up
*  y'all it's lit and you might be like oh I'm older I don't understand what lit
*  means I know what that means is I just already gone away I'm bringing it back
*  tight I'm here to be off like he's tight but it's like if you go to a different
*  part like if you go to a different state sometimes the way that people speak and
*  maybe like in Texas in certain rural parts you wouldn't really understand
*  certain things that they say or how they say so it's the same with sign
*  language like you can say doctor like this or like this but if you're learning
*  and you only know this way to say it then if someone does that you're like
*  what the fuck does that mean mmm doctors touch your wrist to check your pulse
*  like that yeah yeah there's a D so doctor oh where's the D D oh wow but when
*  you go down and touch it now it's just doctor on your wrist I guess P that fell
*  over yeah would anyone there be different like not ASL because that's I
*  didn't once I learned American sign language I was like wait a second your
*  French sign language Spanish sign language yeah that's a nice language like
*  how much different is it it's very different it's very different so if you
*  went over there and you don't even know the language no oh you fucks you had the
*  one chance to make universal language I know it's so fascinating I'm like very
*  interested in like the deaf community and sign language and all of that
*  linguistics I got super high once I think it was in the tank and when I came
*  out I had this idea that alien life if it wanted to communicate with us would
*  come up with a way of like a type of language that everyone could understand
*  like a language that got right into your brain a language that instead of you
*  having to interpret what the sounds mean and turn them into words it's some new
*  kind of technology that allow like as they're making this sound as they're
*  putting out the signal it's going straight into you and you automatically
*  understand it yeah without knowing what they're without having actual Bob said
*  you guys should come to the spaceship instead of seeing you know what it means
*  without having hearing sound like you'll have to disassociate the idea of these
*  sounds meaning these words you'll just know what it means yeah the movie
*  didn't they do it like visually yeah like time doesn't matter right there's
*  no sentence it was all memes and like right then it was like they would spray
*  black ink into the sky right what do they do for length let me see what it
*  looked like again yeah there goes they splay spray black ink and it makes like
*  weird patterns and that's how they would communicate have you said make sense
*  yeah have you seen that new the trailer for tenant is that what it's called
*  I think there's a guy named Ray Kurzweil and he's this brilliant guy who wants to
*  live to be a thousand years old and he's got this series of patents that he's
*  come up with I mean he's really like a legitimately genius guy and I got a
*  chance to interview him once a way back but one of the things that we talked
*  about was he was talking about downloading consciousness into a
*  computer and they think that there's gonna come a point in time where you
*  will be eternal because you're gonna figure out a way to take whoever Alan
*  mccroft ski is and put it in a computer and download it and your material body
*  your physical body your biological body won't mean anything anymore you're gonna
*  exist as you inside this this computer inside this thing I've always thought
*  that that's probably what alien life is what alien life is is something that
*  has gotten to the point where it doesn't need a physical form anymore like
*  whatever consciousness is they figured out a way to contain it in non biological
*  systems so they take whatever you are when you're born and they but then the
*  thing is like how does that thing replicate what are they doing to make
*  it what are they doing how what are they doing to make sure the power stays on
*  like what are they doing I think keto probably squats I think life could be
*  all kinds of shapes I think life could be like there was some speculations these
*  figure out whether or not light could be a life form like there could be those
*  forms of life that or made entirely of light well everything's energy right I
*  don't know if everything's energy I don't know I thought I see a lot of
*  people really make sense just really lazy energy you know yeah we're made of
*  energy but what we think of as life we think of is like a frog yeah like an
*  Ali mccoffsky yeah but it's possible that life might be like I thought about
*  ideas like when you have an idea and then that idea gets in your head like
*  man I like that idea and then you you start working to fulfill that idea you
*  build a thing like maybe you have an idea like how to build a thing and then
*  you build a thing like that's a thing that like forced you to make it it's
*  like you had an idea that yeah bumped jumped into your brain and it's like
*  listen bitch you need to make a canoe like a canoe yeah how would I make a
*  canoe you take a long you fucking hollow out the sun you roll around side of it
*  just go down the river and then all of a sudden this idea that pops into your
*  head and you start doing all the work now you have a physical thing that
*  literally allowed itself to be born by getting this idea that invades your
*  consciousness and tricks you into making things doesn't that make you think that
*  everything's already kind of decided like you know you have free will and
*  control but to some extent everything's kind of already what's gonna happen is
*  gonna happen that's not necessarily true I think you do have free will but I
*  think you also have determinism I think this is something that people have
*  argued successfully where you you really have to take a step back and go okay
*  what do I think about a person's who a person is right now like if I meet a
*  person and I meet this woman and she's all fucked up she lies a lot and she
*  likes to do drugs and she doesn't know what she's doing in her life and she
*  cries like oh get your shit together bitch is that what you think like how
*  what what do you think when you meet a person like that do you take any
*  consideration like oh this is a person who is the granddaughter of alcoholics
*  and it all boiled down to genetics and terrible so all of her systems that came
*  online when she was two and five and six they all came online during alcoholic
*  households and people were physically abusive and you're hiding in the corner
*  of your bedroom and it's all chaos and you know my life when you're 12 like
*  when you get to that 35 year old person and they've gone through this insane
*  pattern without any intervention yeah nothing switch how much of their life
*  are they really responsible for it's a real question it's like who are you you
*  are the combination of all the things that have ever happened to you your
*  genetics all the weird shit that you inherit from your parents and you
*  inherit a lot of ideas they think even from your parents not just like learn
*  from them but actually inherit these ideas and then you do the best with what
*  you got yeah and some people's got is fucking terrible yeah do you think we're
*  living in a simulation I'm too dumb same to to take that into consideration but I
*  think it seems legitimately weird it does it seems like it changes too much
*  like reality itself changes too much yeah and things come up that seem like
*  if there was gonna be a simulation this is how it would go down like I remember
*  when I first started reading about simulation theory was right around the
*  time where Anthony wiener got busted for sending pictures of his deck I'm like
*  what are the odds yeah like that seems like it's so on the nose seems like some
*  of you really on the wiener your name was wiener you'd avoid showing people
*  your heart yeah like this is a castrate yourself no more wiener but if we're
*  gonna come up with one someday not obviously not you and me but someone
*  really smart it's gonna come up with a simulation it's gonna eventually get
*  good enough where you can't tell that you're in a simulation that's what's
*  fucked up is it if it isn't here it's coming yeah this took me a long time
*  like I had a conversation with this guy Nick Bahlstrom who's a brilliant guy who
*  is a big proponent of this concept and he was explaining it through like
*  probability theory I was a little too dumb to understand what you're saying
*  but basically if you do if if it's possible that someday someone
*  essentially I'm paraphrasing someday will have a simulation like how what are
*  the odds that this is similar it's more likely that this is a simulation than
*  not yeah you just got to pray that whoever's doing the simulation is
*  looking out for you the other possibility is that we know the
*  simulations coming that's the other possibility and that's why everybody's
*  freaked out everybody's freaked out because even though it's not here it's
*  inevitable if you follow the pattern of innovation if you go from pioneers to
*  people who live in cities to cell phones and internet and fucking Space Force and
*  you just keep going eventually you get to a point where someone figures out how
*  to make an artificial version of life whether it's Ray Kurzweil's thing or it
*  downloads you in your computer or there's a thing you sit and connect to
*  yeah some someone's gonna come up with something you think we know that we're
*  in the simulation when it happens or it's just like you don't want that yeah
*  no you want something where it's crazy yeah you don't even know you're in it
*  yeah my god am I in the simulation that's the best simulation the best
*  simulation is you you have no idea oh yeah you're locked completely into it so
*  that's where our problem lies we don't know if that's actually going on right
*  now like for Trump if somebody brought Trump aside like sat Trump aside said
*  mr. Trump all of this seems highly unlikely doesn't it well here's why yeah
*  you are in a simulation this simulation was started 78 years ago and this is the
*  pattern it plays out you you're you're given a large amount of money to start
*  your own business yeah you're gonna put your name on everything you're gonna be
*  the best the best the best but you have crazy hair but that's okay you just
*  fucking spray it down you're good you have a few flaws in your life people are
*  mad at you though but you're gonna be the best you're gonna have the best
*  things the biggest you have the business you know everything's gonna be amazing
*  and then you come up to him and like you wake him up and you say listen but this
*  seems crazy it seems crazy because it is and you settled upon a very bizarre
*  pattern in your simulation and this is how it came out and everyone else is
*  mad at you but they just don't understand this wasn't your fault you
*  didn't mean to but then you think of all the things that we counted before like
*  poverty abuse drug addict parents all the different things that make a person
*  who they are right those are really kind of like factors in if you had a game
*  like if you were playing some sort of a large-scale role-playing game you're
*  like what is my character gonna be like oh your character is a barbarian you're
*  in the matrix that's what you're showing me you're describing like when Morpheus
*  talks to Neo he's like hey what do you what do you think but it is a sent
*  yeah it is like that and it is essentially what it will be if we if we're
*  staying this human form essentially someone's gonna figure out a way to put
*  a helmet on you or put a fucking spike in the back your head that like locks
*  your central nervous system into this gigantic computer that starts sending
*  signals to your brain and tricks your brain to think and it's riding on a
*  horse through the fucking Saudi Arabian desert that's gonna come yeah just
*  whether or not it's here yet it's gonna come they're gonna keep making things if
*  we don't blow each other up there's gonna be a cell phone that lets you see
*  God you're gonna you're gonna like call God yeah God's gonna be in front of you
*  hugging you giving you love isn't that what psychedelics are kind of like yeah
*  yeah well that could be what we're trying to recreate what we're trying to get to
*  it could be like a state that's similar to what exists already in nature like
*  maybe they're interconnected in some sort of a way like maybe someone will
*  figure out maybe someone who is anti-drug will figure out a way to
*  recreate psychedelic experiences using only technology that interfaces with
*  your brain and turns all those chemicals on but don't you think we're capable of
*  doing that ourselves because we're part of nature in a way like we're all
*  connected to the universe in some way and so if we just focused on like not to
*  sound like Russell Brand but like if we all just like took time to like meditate
*  and like get in contact with ourselves and like realize that we're all
*  connected in a strange web that we could potentially have that like well
*  that would definitely help and this is the other thing about people that are
*  like angry all the time or people that are lashing out at people all the time
*  that energy that you put out is it's not a one-way thing that it comes back at
*  you totally and it also makes you feel a certain way so it's it poisons you as
*  well well and it poisons the other people you know if I if I go and attack
*  you and I'm like Joe you fucking whatever you suck blah blah blah like and
*  I'm attacking you then there's gonna be I mean I know you're like tough and
*  whatever but like you know there's still a part of that energy the negative
*  energy that's gonna go into you and go maybe for a second I don't know how long
*  but depending on how weak or strong willed or minded you are you're gonna
*  attach part of that to yourself and be like maybe I am bad and for sure I'll
*  just lean into that some people do some people definitely lean in if you call
*  them an asshole they just become more of an asshole I think that might be the
*  case with Trump I think if you look at who he was before he became president
*  and like how antagonistic he is like now that he is president I mean there was
*  some of that before like when you get mad at Rosie O'Donnell or someone and
*  insult people but it seems like now it's like way more prevalent in his behavior
*  yeah I think a lot of that is probably connected to the fact so many people
*  fucking hate him and they're criticizing him like his last days if you think
*  about who he is right he's 75 years old or something like that right he's
*  so hot how old is he somebody must think he's hot for sure for sure for sure
*  how old is he just turned 74 do you think Melania thinks he's hot no she does what she's got
*  what she's got but he's 74 years old you know that's um such a weird age to have
*  a president but it but it makes sense because then you learn a lot from life
*  what I was gonna say is you generally you don't live to be much older than 90
*  most people that's so the last years before that he's in rap songs everybody
*  is like he's got his own show on NBC you're fired yeah everybody loves when he
*  does that I love when he fires people I love when he's mean he was the hero he
*  was like this guy who was like this badass businessman that had his name on
*  everything and now all sudden everybody hates him but it's like what do you want
*  what do you really want because if you want to be the top guy you want to be
*  the the president of the United States you want to be that one person that
*  dictates policy could literally change the way our society functions you have
*  this weird power or if your friends go to jail you could exonerate them Ali I'm
*  gonna let you out I'm gonna give you a presidential pardon we still have
*  presidential pardon crazy like a person could just decide they're the president
*  so they get to do it like we let this medieval shit exist in 2020 we could
*  just decide don't do much a lot with it really oh yes they do they pardon
*  hundreds of people there's so many people in jail who don't need to be
*  that's true yeah well that's where people like the Innocence Project and
*  these guys on my show yeah yeah did you ever get into cereal that podcast about
*  Anon Syed? Anon? Serial? It was like a super popular podcast about this girl who was
*  murdered and they put her boyfriend in jail but the story it's like the podcast
*  is them going into the story and all the details and and it's just interesting
*  hearing about. She was innocent? I don't know that's up to the audience to decide.
*  That's again. But he was like he was 17 so I don't know part of me wants to be
*  I'm very naive and young and somewhat dumb for the most part and so there's
*  part of me that's like but if he did do it if he did murder his ex-girlfriend
*  and he was 17 and he's in jail for life no option of parole at this point and
*  it's like don't I feel like prison system should be able to have like a
*  rehabilitation process so that way someone like him who might not be a guy
*  if even if he did it he's not gonna do it again it's like do you know what I
*  mean let me take a breath. What are you trying to say? If you go to jail for
*  murder but you're not the type of person who's like you're not like a serial
*  murderer you're just like he was in high school maybe he was misguided by his
*  friend he didn't know what to do ex-girlfriend yeah. But did he? I don't know. So there's two things
*  possible one I think if you kill your girlfriend I think you forfeit your life.
*  Sure. Because if we don't have unbelievably strict rules like that yeah
*  you're gonna have people doing that more often yeah there's there is something
*  that is a there's something that influences people to be good and most of
*  it is being a good person is like feels good but part of it is punishment yeah
*  part of his punitive stuff you can't think for life but here's the thing
*  there's you don't let me finish my sentence because this is what the most
*  important part we'd have to know for sure you did it and I don't think they
*  do that now so that that's one of the real problems we have and then once you
*  get into the system even if they know you're innocent it takes months sometimes
*  before you get out right even if you have an appeal like there's a lot going
*  on there and that's kind of the thing it's like the thing it's like you I
*  think that if you take someone's life like that you forfeit your life but how
*  do I know you did it exactly how do I absolutely know you did it because I
*  definitely know that people are in jail for shit they didn't do yeah until you
*  have a completely just non biased justice system that it that isn't
*  pressured by you know different attorneys or different prosecuting
*  attorneys or or governors or anybody you just have this like magical fucking
*  super intelligent group of humans that know exactly the right choice and how to
*  punish someone we don't have that yeah so the death penalty and all that shit
*  it's like yeah in theory I think you should kill people that kill people yeah
*  and in theory we want we don't want the world to be filled with serial killers
*  we don't want someone who thinks it's cool to go to a park and shoot kids to
*  stay alive in theory I'm with you the problem is when we don't know now if we
*  do know for sure this person did it like this video of them doing it but even
*  video now it's like fuck yeah when is that gonna be unreliable yeah but the
*  thing is like with this guy there wasn't enough I personally think there wasn't
*  enough evidence to say 100% without a doubt he was guilty he should be in jail
*  for life and then it's like okay so what if they proved that he is innocent but
*  he's been in jail since he was 17 years old he's been in prison since he was 17
*  I think this case was in like 2000 early 2000s maybe 2003 and so now he's
*  only known his life as someone who's been in the prison system and maybe for
*  something he didn't do yeah and so if he gets out how is he supposed to be how
*  is he supposed to know what to do and be a productive member of society the the
*  event that led to the case happened in 1999 oh my god yeah that's where it's
*  horrific if someone's innocent that's where it's horrific and again I go back
*  to this again but this we gotta be able to read each other's minds that's what
*  they're gonna say you know how they're doing contact tracing with yeah we need
*  to know who you've contacted Ali Ali if you've contacted someone is positive we
*  need to know and if you haven't you should be able to go in any restaurant
*  you want just have your app ready and where your wristband and this is what
*  we're probably gonna do with that too but then isn't that like Ali you can't
*  commit crime if I could read your mind right and you don't want to commit
*  crime do you know then let me read your mind just put the helmet on we'll all
*  read each other's minds and no one ever goes to jail unjustly if your own
*  privacy is more important than all these people that are doing life in prison for
*  shit they didn't do what because you want that people read your mind and
*  find out that you masturbate to fucking feet that's my thing I told you not to
*  say that on the podcast dirty feet too I like hangnails and clay I just we're
*  gonna do that's what's like the way it's a slippery slope to contact tracing
*  because you want to keep people safe it's gonna be you want don't you want no
*  crime to exist you want no people to be unjustly punished then let us read your
*  mind we're gonna just read each other's minds I think the separation between
*  each other's thoughts like that we enjoy now where you can deceive each other and
*  you can you know you could spin a yarn or be a good salesperson that shits
*  going out the window that's like blockbuster video that's gonna be a
*  useless thing crazy that's what I think okay but I'm dumb I might be wrong same
*  I might be wrong so let's wrap this up now we when when we do get a comedy club
*  set up in Texas you must come I'm so down with your presence I think we'll
*  start looking around the spring oh when hopefully this shit bowls over yeah I'm
*  so happy for you I'm happy for you I'm bummed you're leaving not that I really
*  see you that often I'll be here I'll be there yeah moving around once it can
*  move around a little bit I'll be moving around okay I'm still always gonna come
*  to the store sweet all right my friend thanks for having me on my pleasure tell
*  everybody your Instagram my Instagram's not Ali Mack and OTA li m a C my podcast
