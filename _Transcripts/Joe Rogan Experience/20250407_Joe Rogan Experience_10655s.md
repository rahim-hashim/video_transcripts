# Joe Rogan Experience #2301 - Ben Lamm
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [April 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0)
*  Joe Rogan podcast, checking in. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=0.0s)]
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4.12s)]
*  Shrain by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5.12s)]
*  What's up, Ben? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  Hey, thanks so much for having me. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  Very nice to meet you, man. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=16.2s)]
*  So why don't you, instead of me, explain to people what you do? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=17.2s)]
*  So I'm the CEO and co-founder of a company called Colossal Biosciences. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=22.88s)]
*  We're the world's first de-extinction and species preservation company. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=27.88s)]
*  Yeah, and that is a wild thing. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  This is essentially, literally wild. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=35.48s)]
*  This is essentially real life Jurassic Park. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=37.92s)]
*  Yeah, we get to the Jurassic Park occasionally. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=41.239999999999995s)]
*  Believe it or not, we get that. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=43.48s)]
*  Of course. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=45.72s)]
*  I got to drop my hydrogen tablet in here. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=46.72s)]
*  Oh, you do those? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=48.2s)]
*  The Gary Breck ones, right? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=49.2s)]
*  I'm all in. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=50.2s)]
*  Those are great. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=51.2s)]
*  Yeah, I love those. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=52.2s)]
*  I just didn't want you to think we were going a different direction. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=53.2s)]
*  How did you get started even thinking about doing something like this? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=55.52s)]
*  So I kind of fell into it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=59.56s)]
*  I didn't plan, I didn't wake up and say, I saw Jurassic Park. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=60.96s)]
*  I'm super stoked. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=63.800000000000004s)]
*  I love animals. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=64.8s)]
*  I want to go work on this. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=65.8s)]
*  I'm just a weirdly curious person. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=67.12s)]
*  So there's this guy named George Church. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=69.16s)]
*  If you don't know George, you should look him up. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=71.2s)]
*  He's the father of synthetic biologies at Harvard University. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=72.80000000000001s)]
*  He's six foot seven with narcolepsy. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=76.36s)]
*  He's just the best, right? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=78.32000000000001s)]
*  So if you ever had him on, he may fall asleep during the podcast, but he's just, he's the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=79.4s)]
*  absolute best. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=83.2s)]
*  He's a genius. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=84.2s)]
*  And I thought my background's in software and just building teams of people that are [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=85.88000000000001s)]
*  smarter than me, right? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=88.44s)]
*  And so I was interested in synthetic biology, this idea that we could engineer life and [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=90.0s)]
*  that we could use AI and compute to make it even better. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=95.36s)]
*  How do we do directed evolution and how that can apply to crops and animals and all kinds [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=98.04s)]
*  of stuff? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  So I get on the phone with George and I ask him my questions. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=103.80000000000001s)]
*  He answers them in like six seconds because he's a genius. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=105.76s)]
*  And then I start asking about all the other weird stuff that's coming out of his lab. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=108.88s)]
*  And in that process, he's like, you know, I've also been working on mammoths and other [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=112.52s)]
*  things. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=115.92s)]
*  I was like, wait, wait, what? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=116.92s)]
*  And I was like, if you had one project, what is it? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=117.92s)]
*  This mammoth project? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=119.96s)]
*  And then he went down this whole path about how he'd bring back mammoths, reintroduce [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=121.16s)]
*  them in the Arctic, help the ecosystem, use those technologies for conservation, use those [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=124.68s)]
*  technologies for human health care. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  And I kind of thought it was a fucking joke. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=131.0s)]
*  I literally thought that like the smartest man I've ever met and been on the phone with [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=132.36s)]
*  was a joke. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=137.0s)]
*  Well, then I stayed up all night just Googling George and there was this weird mammoth throughline, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=138.0s)]
*  whether it was in 60 minutes or, you know, Stephen Colbert or whatever he's in, there [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=142.23999999999998s)]
*  was this weird mammoth throughline where he was just obsessed with these mammoths and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=145.76s)]
*  everyone kind of wanted him to do this. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  So I called him back the next day. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=151.56s)]
*  Seven days later, I'm in his lab and we were off to the races on, OK, we're going to try [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=153.23999999999998s)]
*  to go build a company to bring back sing species. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  So how do you decide what to start with? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=159.83999999999997s)]
*  So we started with the mammoth first, right? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=162.48s)]
*  Because George, you know, had been working on it for eight years. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=164.39999999999998s)]
*  We needed his core technologies. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=167.56s)]
*  We thought that there was a huge application to elephant conservation. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=169.84s)]
*  There was some ecological modeling that had been done to show that the reintroduction [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=173.16s)]
*  of mammoths back into the wild could actually have a net benefit to the ecosystem. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=176.52s)]
*  And so that was an easy place to start. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=182.52s)]
*  After we launched the company, it went crazy viral. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=184.84s)]
*  And all these other folks from de-extinction research started calling us, like folks from [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=187.0s)]
*  like the thylacine or Tasmanian tiger, which looks like a mythical creature. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=190.72s)]
*  It's awesome. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=194.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=195.32s)]
*  The best ship here with the dodo. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=196.32s)]
*  And then we just started calling us and then we just started expanding our entire set. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=197.76s)]
*  So how does one do this? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=202.32s)]
*  It's like, let's before we get to what you showed me earlier, which is fucking amazing. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=204.6s)]
*  Before that, how does one do this? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=209.92s)]
*  Like from what I understand, you have to take the gene of an Indian elephant, which is the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=211.84s)]
*  closest thing to a mammoth. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=217.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=218.68s)]
*  Let me walk through the whole process. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=219.68s)]
*  So first, you have to find ancient DNA, which is pretty shitty on a good day. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=220.68s)]
*  So the minute we take DNA out of our bodies or out of anything, it starts to degrade at [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=225.36s)]
*  an insanely rapid rate. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=229.32000000000002s)]
*  So we definitely need to find a lot of samples. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=231.04000000000002s)]
*  So we actually have about 109 mammoth samples ranging from 3000 years old to 1.2 million [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  years old, which is awesome. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=240.56s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=241.56s)]
*  But it's also fragment. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=242.56s)]
*  It's like a shitty jigsaw puzzle that you don't know what the box is and someone's stolen [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=243.56s)]
*  part of the puzzle. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=247.28000000000003s)]
*  And then, oh, by the way, people have taken other puzzle pieces and put them in there. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=248.36s)]
*  So there's all kinds of problems with that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=251.56s)]
*  So this is really an AI and compute problem. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=253.28s)]
*  It's not as much a human problem. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=256.16s)]
*  So you have to get a lot of samples first. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=257.96s)]
*  And then you have to start mapping them to their closest living relative. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=260.0s)]
*  And genotyping allows us to understand that that's Asian elephants, right? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=263.64s)]
*  So Asian elephants are 99.6% the same as mammoths. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=267.48s)]
*  They're actually closer related to mammoths than they are to African elephants. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=271.04s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=275.52s)]
*  Yeah, which always blows people mind. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=276.52s)]
*  That and the fact that mammoths were alive when we were building the pyramids or aliens [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=277.52s)]
*  or whoever was building pyramids. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=280.86s)]
*  Literally, humans were building the pyramids while mammoths existed. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  And sometimes that blows people's mind because they always think of them as in this weird [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=286.88s)]
*  prehistoric 65 million years old dinosaur. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=291.56s)]
*  When did they go extinct? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=295.04s)]
*  So the last one went extinct about 4,000 years ago on Wrangel Island. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=296.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=300.92s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=301.92s)]
*  So they were around for a long time. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=302.92s)]
*  4,000 years ago? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=303.92s)]
*  I know. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=304.92s)]
*  They weren't. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=305.92s)]
*  Now, they appeared about two and a half million years ago, as far as we understand. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=306.92s)]
*  They were mostly a Pleistocene species. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=309.88s)]
*  But as we moved into the Holocene and kind of the period that we're in right now, they [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=312.4s)]
*  existed. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=317.12s)]
*  They existed all the way up until they had this like small genetic bottleneck on Wrangel [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=318.12s)]
*  Island. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=321.67999999999995s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=322.67999999999995s)]
*  Where's Wrangel Island? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=323.67999999999995s)]
*  It's northeast of Siberia. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=324.67999999999995s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=327.28s)]
*  And they just, was it a small island? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=328.84s)]
*  They just ran out of resources there? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=331.59999999999997s)]
*  Like what happened? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=333.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, there's a couple of different theories, right? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=334.15999999999997s)]
*  with Wrangel Island is that they actually, there's lots of inbreeding. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=337.0s)]
*  So there's lots of like genetic bottleneck which happened because there's not a different [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=342.38s)]
*  species there. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=345.8s)]
*  How large is Wrangel Island? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=346.8s)]
*  I'm not quite sure. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=347.8s)]
*  Can you give me a photo again, Jamie? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=349.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=351.4s)]
*  And so essentially though, Wrangel Island and then there's another island called St. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=352.4s)]
*  Paul Island, which is also between Alaska and Russia, also is where they were. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=358.28s)]
*  Those were kind of the last two places that we know mammoths existed today. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=363.68s)]
*  And they died out 4,000 years ago. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=368.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=369.44s)]
*  And now some actually, there is actually another working hypothesis that they actually ran out [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=370.44s)]
*  of water. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=375.24s)]
*  They ran out of access to fresh water on the island. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=376.24s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=378.2s)]
*  So some combination of genetic bottleneck and that occurred. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=379.2s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=382.6s)]
*  4,000 years is so recent. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=383.6s)]
*  I know. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=385.64s)]
*  It's crazy recent, right? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=386.64s)]
*  Jamie, can you please pull up a photo of an Asian elephant versus a African elephant? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=387.64s)]
*  I mean, they're actually mammoths because there's a, you know, mammoths themselves, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=393.64s)]
*  yeah. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=400.03999999999996s)]
*  Mammoths themselves are closely related to the Asian elephant. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=401.71999999999997s)]
*  Which is on the left? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=403.8s)]
*  Yeah, which is on the left. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=404.8s)]
*  So they have that dome cranium. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=405.8s)]
*  They have the small ears. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=407.36s)]
*  They have a little bit of a hump structure. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=408.36s)]
*  You know, mammoths because they had these massive, massive tusks, right? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=411.36s)]
*  And you know, you've talked to lots of folks in kind of the mammoth world. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=414.88s)]
*  They actually, you know, move their heads quite slowly. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=419.03999999999996s)]
*  They had to, you know, they had to have this entire ridge of extra muscle in order to do [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=421.52000000000004s)]
*  that. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=426.72s)]
*  But one of the things that's awesome also about the Asian elephants is some Asian elephants, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=427.72s)]
*  some of the ones that are born actually have, they look, they're not mammoth like, but they [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=433.0s)]
*  have a lot of fur on them and they kind of lose it over time. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=436.68s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=439.20000000000005s)]
*  So are those the ones that you would find like in Thailand? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=440.20000000000005s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=442.56s)]
*  And Thailand and then parts of, different parts of India and the Indian subcontinent. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=443.68s)]
*  I actually rode one of those once with my family. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=448.68s)]
*  I don't recommend it. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=451.08s)]
*  Did you go to one of those places that you like take care of them? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=452.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=455.32s)]
*  You have to like get a relationship with them. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=456.32s)]
*  So you feed them sugar cane and you wash them and you know, you play nice with them for [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=458.15999999999997s)]
*  like a while, a couple of hours. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=463.0s)]
*  It was like at least an hour. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=465.24s)]
*  You're just hanging out with them, petting them. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=466.24s)]
*  And then once they decide you're cool, they let you ride them. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=468.76s)]
*  But my whole family rode them and I was like totally opposed to it. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=473.24s)]
*  I was like, I'm doing it just because you guys want to do it. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=477.28000000000003s)]
*  I would just want to feed them. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=479.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=480.88s)]
*  I just want to hang out with them. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=481.88s)]
*  They just felt weird. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=482.88s)]
*  My daughter fell off, I think twice. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=483.88s)]
*  One of my youngest daughter fell off once at least. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=486.6s)]
*  And I was like, do we know that this elephant wants us riding? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=489.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=492.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=493.48s)]
*  It's kind of a weird thing. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=494.48s)]
*  It's a weird thing, right? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=495.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=496.48s)]
*  And then afterwards you get in the water and you wash them and everything. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=497.48s)]
*  And I just kind of hung out with them. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=500.04s)]
*  I'd be cool. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=501.52s)]
*  They're very sweet. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=502.52s)]
*  I don't think I want to ride one. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=503.52s)]
*  I like being around them, feeding them. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=505.36s)]
*  I think there's a video on my Instagram of it. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=507.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, there definitely is because she was eating a log. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=510.04s)]
*  I was like, why are you eating a log? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=512.6800000000001s)]
*  It's just weird. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=515.52s)]
*  They're so enormous, but they're really peaceful and chill. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=517.6800000000001s)]
*  And incredibly smart. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=522.76s)]
*  And they have incredible pack dynamics, right? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=523.76s)]
*  So they live in a herd. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=526.08s)]
*  They've even had all these different examples where they also adopt other animals. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=527.72s)]
*  I don't know if you've seen any of these videos. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=530.72s)]
*  Oh yeah, so here it is. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=532.32s)]
*  This is a few years ago in Thailand. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=533.6800000000001s)]
*  And this is an Asian elephant just chilling with this elephant. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=536.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, 2018. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=541.6800000000001s)]
*  Okay, there it is. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=544.12s)]
*  It was really cool. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=546.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's awesome. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=547.88s)]
*  It's just cool to be around them. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=548.88s)]
*  They're just a fascinating animal. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=551.36s)]
*  Just the biodiversity of Earth, the fact that that thing exists. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=552.9200000000001s)]
*  This enormous thing with this robotic potential. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=558.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=561.48s)]
*  As long as you're cool to them, they're cool to you. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=562.64s)]
*  Yeah, they sense it, right? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=565.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=566.0s)]
*  I mean, we see that nature with a lot of animals, right? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=567.0s)]
*  If you sense it and they don't feel like they're being backed into a corner or fearful, then [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=568.5600000000001s)]
*  they're not going to be around that. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=573.36s)]
*  So some of our animals have been around and they're starting to get quite large, which [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=574.52s)]
*  I'm sure we'll talk about at some point. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=578.04s)]
*  That yeah, at some point though, you're still kind of like they are wild animals. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=580.5600000000001s)]
*  So you have to maintain some level of healthy distance. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=583.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=586.5600000000001s)]
*  So let's just get right to it. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=587.5600000000001s)]
*  Wait, wait. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=588.9200000000001s)]
*  You want to finish the process? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=589.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, please. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=590.9200000000001s)]
*  Okay, so we have the ancient genome, so you have to collect and assemble. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=592.36s)]
*  And that's a lot of people just think of us in the lab, like just a bunch of people in [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=596.5999999999999s)]
*  the lab. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=600.1999999999999s)]
*  But that's like some Indiana Jones shit. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=601.1999999999999s)]
*  Like we're literally going into the permafrost and like collecting dead samples from the permafrost, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=603.04s)]
*  which you've had, you know, John Reeves on here. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=608.36s)]
*  It's disgusting. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=610.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=611.64s)]
*  It smells like death. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=612.64s)]
*  It literally makes it is death. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=613.64s)]
*  It's just over time piled up death. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=615.9s)]
*  Have you visited, John? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=618.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=619.16s)]
*  Yeah, I visited, John. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=620.16s)]
*  Yeah, I went to the Boneyard. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=621.4s)]
*  What's it like there? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=622.4s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=623.4s)]
*  It's exactly what you'd expect. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=624.4s)]
*  I didn't know, John. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=625.64s)]
*  So I'm on the board of trustees of the Explorers Club. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=627.36s)]
*  So we take these expeditions. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=629.38s)]
*  We did an expedition to Alaska to do mammoth retrieval. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=630.38s)]
*  And then we're also doing some cultural studies with some of the indigenous people groups [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=633.86s)]
*  around mammoths. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=638.4599999999999s)]
*  Like, do you want mammoths back? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=639.4599999999999s)]
*  Is this a good idea? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=640.4599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=641.4599999999999s)]
*  Because we try to be pretty inclusive. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=642.4599999999999s)]
*  And they're like, oh, we got to meet the biggest landowner in Alaska, John. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=643.4599999999999s)]
*  Okay, great. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=646.56s)]
*  I'm excited. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=647.56s)]
*  So go meet him. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=648.56s)]
*  So we pull up. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=649.9599999999999s)]
*  He's in a different car. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=650.9599999999999s)]
*  And he's like, and I think he wanted us to follow him. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=651.9599999999999s)]
*  He's like, get in. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=654.0s)]
*  I was like, okay. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=655.0s)]
*  And he's a big dude. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=656.0s)]
*  I'm not that big of a dude, right? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=659.0s)]
*  Especially after Gary Breck has been working on him. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=661.0s)]
*  I'm a smaller dude, right? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=663.8s)]
*  And so like, I literally get in. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=664.8s)]
*  I get in the car. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=668.04s)]
*  There's a bunch of stickers. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=669.04s)]
*  And there's one that has butterflies on it that says, give zero fucks. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=670.04s)]
*  And I was like, and then there's, and he's like, just move the gun over. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=674.3599999999999s)]
*  So I move the gun over and he goes, listen. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=676.8399999999999s)]
*  And this is the first words out of his mouth to me. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=679.12s)]
*  If I stop short, you hand me that gun. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=681.36s)]
*  And I was like, I didn't even ask a follow up question because like, what do you do when [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=683.68s)]
*  you get in the car with John and he says, you hand me that gun. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=687.2s)]
*  If I stop quick and I say, hand me that gun, you hand me that gun. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=690.04s)]
*  I was like, that's awesome. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=692.28s)]
*  He showed me around the book. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=693.88s)]
*  What kind of gun was it? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=694.88s)]
*  It was just some type of rifle. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=695.88s)]
*  So it was Grizzlies. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=697.36s)]
*  I assume it was for Grizzlies. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=698.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=699.84s)]
*  Or bears or something large. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=700.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=702.2s)]
*  But then he showed me around the boneyard and showed me his collection. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=703.2s)]
*  And he was completely, I mean, he didn't know us from anybody. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=706.9599999999999s)]
*  He just opened up everything to us. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=709.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=711.8s)]
*  And he's like, let me show you all this. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=712.8s)]
*  Showed us his skull. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=713.8s)]
*  He actually has a warehouse. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=714.8s)]
*  I don't know if he ever discloses where it is, but he has a warehouse where he has some [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=715.8s)]
*  of the greatest specimens ever. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=718.88s)]
*  So it's cool. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=721.28s)]
*  You should go. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=722.28s)]
*  It's cool. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=723.28s)]
*  I do want to go. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=724.28s)]
*  He's an amazing guy. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=725.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=726.28s)]
*  And he's a cool guy. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=727.28s)]
*  And then, you know, being in the mammoth researcher business, we're like, oh, we'd love to, we'd [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=728.28s)]
*  love to, you know, take use of your samples. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=731.88s)]
*  Can we take them? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=733.36s)]
*  And he's like, no. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=734.36s)]
*  And he was very honest. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=735.36s)]
*  And that's like before your podcast with him. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=736.44s)]
*  We kind of learned that story. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=739.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=740.04s)]
*  And so that's what sucks is how like some people can ruin it for everybody. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=741.04s)]
*  You know, because he's outside of Fairbanks. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=743.88s)]
*  It's not the easiest place to build a, you know, biocontainment level three lab. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=746.4s)]
*  But he's like, but he is always like, you build a lab here, you can use whatever you [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=751.72s)]
*  want. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=754.76s)]
*  But he's like, the bones stay here. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=755.76s)]
*  So he is very consistent with his messaging. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=756.76s)]
*  Well, you know, the whole deal with the Museum of Natural History. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=759.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=762.6800000000001s)]
*  And I totally believe it. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=763.6800000000001s)]
*  I totally believe. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=765.08s)]
*  They found these bones in the East River exactly where they told them to drop it off. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=766.8000000000001s)]
*  They have step bison fragments. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=771.08s)]
*  Yeah, I've seen it. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=772.88s)]
*  Woolly mammoth fragments. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=774.2800000000001s)]
*  So they know that they're there. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=775.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=776.44s)]
*  And well, I mean, you've built a relationship with John. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=777.44s)]
*  He's just a normal, no bullshit kind of guy. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=779.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=782.0s)]
*  He's like, you stole this stuff, give it back. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=783.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=784.5600000000001s)]
*  Or he's also like, hey, if you want to come work on it, come on. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=785.5600000000001s)]
*  Like he's very collaborative. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=788.12s)]
*  It's also, it's like, what do you guys have? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=789.12s)]
*  Like why are you keeping that shit in a basement? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=791.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=793.8000000000001s)]
*  What is that? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=794.8000000000001s)]
*  You know, outside of the expeditions of collecting ancient DNA, DNA, when we do work, we also [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=796.52s)]
*  work with museums. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=801.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=802.16s)]
*  And so we go to like the catacombs of the museums. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=803.16s)]
*  And it's exactly what you think of as like the Vatican archives. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=804.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=807.4799999999999s)]
*  You go down to like sub basement four of the Smithsonian and it's just rows and rows and [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=808.4799999999999s)]
*  rows of taxidermy animals that you've never seen. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=813.3599999999999s)]
*  It's got like little drawers and boxes and they're like, oh, this is giant sloth poop. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=816.02s)]
*  And I was like, I didn't know there was giant sloth poop. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=821.1999999999999s)]
*  They're like, yes. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=823.0799999999999s)]
*  And we think there's DNA. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=824.0799999999999s)]
*  Well, this is like, you know, the card catalog of like all speed of all like dead species, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=825.36s)]
*  but it's not on display for the public. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=830.9200000000001s)]
*  It's just in a basement. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=832.2800000000001s)]
*  And is it extensively archived? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=834.1600000000001s)]
*  They know where everything is or is there some stuff down there? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=836.62s)]
*  I mean, I wouldn't say that they are the at least any museum they have. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=839.0s)]
*  I think they have a lot more than they know. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=844.0400000000001s)]
*  I don't see it in like massive computer systems because we asked for inventory lists and you [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=845.64s)]
*  know, like what's the shopping list? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=849.0400000000001s)]
*  It's been over a hundred years they've been doing this. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=851.48s)]
*  So people have come and gone. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=853.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=855.6s)]
*  And they'll pull out drawers that have like Darwin's name on it and stuff like that. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=856.6s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=859.2800000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's how we did the thylacine. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=860.2800000000001s)]
*  We actually found in a cup about this size, we actually found what's called, we call it [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=861.2800000000001s)]
*  the miracle pup where they shot the mother. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=865.76s)]
*  They took the three Joey's, the babies, killed the three pups and they put one of them in [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=868.6800000000001s)]
*  formaldehyde and we got a 98% complete genome from the first sample of that pup. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=872.9200000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=878.64s)]
*  But they didn't even know they had it. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=879.64s)]
*  They also on the thylacine, which I'm sure we'll talk about more later. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=880.64s)]
*  They also found a head in a bucket. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=885.68s)]
*  They didn't even, it was the mom's head. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=887.68s)]
*  So we actually knew we could actually look at the genetic relation between the two and [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=888.96s)]
*  they actually found, they didn't know they had the head in the bucket. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=892.92s)]
*  They just had a head in a bucket. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=895.76s)]
*  They opened it up as marked thylacine. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=897.08s)]
*  They opened it up and there was a full thylacine skull in there. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=898.52s)]
*  There's pictures of it online and everything. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=901.64s)]
*  And we use that to get to a 99.9% complete genome because we also had the ancestry of [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=903.52s)]
*  the two, of the pup and mother. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=909.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=911.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=912.88s)]
*  Probably treasure troves in some of these museums that aren't being fully utilized. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=914.0s)]
*  So if you have 98% or you have 99%, what's the process of going from that? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=918.76s)]
*  So here's the head in the bucket. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=925.68s)]
*  So Andrew Pasch, who leads our, in partnership with the University of Melbourne, leads our [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=929.2s)]
*  thylacine work. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=934.4s)]
*  And yeah, that's the head in the bucket. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=935.92s)]
*  I mean, there's soft tissue, there's teeth, there's petrous bones, which we'll talk about [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=937.08s)]
*  at some point. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=940.8s)]
*  Do you buy into any of these sightings? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=941.8s)]
*  No, I did. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=943.4399999999999s)]
*  So Andrew Pasch for years, he's been working on it for 15 years. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=944.68s)]
*  He's amazing. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=948.16s)]
*  He's awesome. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=949.16s)]
*  He's been working on it like a shoestring budget. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=950.3199999999999s)]
*  And that's part of the problem with de-extinction is nobody's put real capital into it until [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=952.4399999999999s)]
*  now. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=956.24s)]
*  And he's been working on it for 15 years and he's had people send him, you know, poop, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=957.24s)]
*  clippings from, you know, hair and all this stuff over the years. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=962.56s)]
*  So he just sent it to him and then he loves the thylacine so much he just sequences it [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=965.6s)]
*  and he's like, no, it's a dog. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=969.56s)]
*  You sent me more dog shit. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=971.1999999999999s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=972.24s)]
*  I mean, it's demoralizing. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=973.24s)]
*  But like when I got into thylacine, you know, we met Andrew, we did a partnership with him. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=975.0400000000001s)]
*  We actually made the largest investment in marsupial research more than the Australian [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=979.1600000000001s)]
*  government. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=982.6s)]
*  We made the largest investment in research for marsupial development of anyone. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=983.6s)]
*  So we do this. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=987.08s)]
*  And then you get into the myth of it, right? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=988.08s)]
*  So you start reading it, right? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=990.5200000000001s)]
*  You start reading, I start reading all the books on the thylacine. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=991.5200000000001s)]
*  I want to be at, I get obsessive about projects. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=993.48s)]
*  And so I'm pretty obsessive about extinction right now. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=996.38s)]
*  And so got super deep in it. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=999.3199999999999s)]
*  And then I started calling Pascals like, hey, I've been watching these YouTube videos and [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1001.2s)]
*  I kind of think they're still there. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1005.4399999999999s)]
*  And Pascals like, no, no, stop it. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1006.76s)]
*  Don't go down that rabbit hole. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1009.26s)]
*  So I don't believe. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1010.76s)]
*  But why did he say that? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1011.76s)]
*  Well, because he's been testing for the last 15 years all over Tasmania, right? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1013.24s)]
*  So not just southern Australia, but all over Tasmania. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1017.0s)]
*  So samples, poop, samples, everything using camera traps and nobody's I think they officially [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1019.36s)]
*  say that the thylacine went extinct in 1936, but probably into the late 40s and early 50s, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1026.2s)]
*  they still existed. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1033.2s)]
*  But I mean, I think you I think it's very unlikely that one still exists. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1034.2s)]
*  It'd make our lives a lot easier for us really believes it. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1038.32s)]
*  He does. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1040.98s)]
*  He thinks they're in Papua New Guinea. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1041.98s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1042.98s)]
*  And because of sightings. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1043.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1045.32s)]
*  He said he thinks in the western part of Papua New Guinea in the mountains, also incredibly [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1046.32s)]
*  remote. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1050.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1051.92s)]
*  Very difficult. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1052.92s)]
*  The operation of that topography separates the Papua New Guinea singing dogs, which could [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1054.3200000000002s)]
*  be competitive for them for predator prey from where the thylacine sightings were. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1060.16s)]
*  Singing dog. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1065.04s)]
*  It's just another large canid that has a unique howl. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1066.8400000000001s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1069.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1070.5600000000002s)]
*  So this is still exists. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1071.5600000000002s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure Jamie can find a video. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1072.5600000000002s)]
*  I want to hear that. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1074.48s)]
*  I never heard of this. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1075.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1076.48s)]
*  Singing dog. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1077.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1078.48s)]
*  Wow. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1079.48s)]
*  Papua New Guinea singing dog. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1080.48s)]
*  There's a this is not just theoretical. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1082.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1084.08s)]
*  So this is what's going to get crazy. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1085.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's going to get weird. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1086.44s)]
*  This podcast is going to blow your fucking mind. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1087.76s)]
*  Go ahead, Jamie. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1090.16s)]
*  Opera singers. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1093.16s)]
*  That's what these rare animals have a knack for holding a tune even to an exact key. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1094.16s)]
*  Opera singers. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1100.16s)]
*  Oh, they're so cute. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1103.16s)]
*  Yeah, they're so cute. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1105.68s)]
*  Do people keep them as pets? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1107.28s)]
*  That looks like a dog talk. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1108.28s)]
*  Yeah, it looks like a dog. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1109.28s)]
*  That looks like a dog that their wild their wild dogs in Papua New Guinea. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1111.08s)]
*  But I'm sure people have domesticated them. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1114.48s)]
*  Wow. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1116.8799999999999s)]
*  Pretty fucking cool dogs and hanging out with a fox. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1117.8799999999999s)]
*  So once you have enough of that DNA right from all these different samples and you can [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1121.2s)]
*  assemble it, you then have to build comparative genomic models to its closest living relatives [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1125.16s)]
*  in the case of the mammoth, the Asian elephant. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1129.92s)]
*  But I'm from software. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1132.6399999999999s)]
*  So I just assume there's like the Google cloud of DNA. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1134.36s)]
*  We've all done 23andMe before it went bankrupt. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1138.8s)]
*  So we should assume that I assume that the government or someone backed up and had kind [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1141.12s)]
*  of like the 23andMe of all species. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1146.08s)]
*  That doesn't exist. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1148.52s)]
*  Wow. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1149.52s)]
*  Which is insane. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1150.52s)]
*  So there's like there's no back. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1151.52s)]
*  There's no like Noah's Ark bio vault for life, like kind of like the seed vaults. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1152.72s)]
*  That doesn't exist. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1157.24s)]
*  And so we're actually petitioning the US government to help put a massive project together to [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1158.24s)]
*  help bio bank. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1162.28s)]
*  It's starting with just American megafauna and keystone species. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1163.28s)]
*  So that doesn't exist at all. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1166.96s)]
*  And so so then you so then colossal to go out and go build the reference genomes for [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1168.08s)]
*  all the species like the closest living relatives for all the species that we're working on. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1172.72s)]
*  So this is the question. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1176.56s)]
*  If you have say let's go to what wooly mammoth. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1177.56s)]
*  So if you have wooly mammoth, you have 99 percent. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1180.1200000000001s)]
*  How do you bridge that gap? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1183.1200000000001s)]
*  How do you create that synthetic biology? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1185.44s)]
*  So you never have to get to 100 percent, right? [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1187.8400000000001s)]
*  You need to get to probably fedic biology, synthetic biology. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1189.8400000000001s)]
*  That's where you are using all of these different genetic tools. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1193.12s)]
*  Probably heard of CRISPR, all these other things, genetics, you know, which is it knockout. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1197.0s)]
*  It breaks the DNA. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1201.12s)]
*  It's not always the best tool. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1202.12s)]
*  We can now actually make individual edits to when you think of the DNA double helix, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1203.8s)]
*  right, in those rungs of the ladder. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1209.72s)]
*  Those individuals are called nucleotides. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1212.04s)]
*  We can change the letters like that's how precise we can be. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1213.6999999999998s)]
*  We can say at spot, you know, four million eight, I need to change that letter. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1216.46s)]
*  And so you change that letter. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1220.72s)]
*  And then other times you actually synthesize big blocks of DNA. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1222.36s)]
*  So when you notice that in the mammoth and in the Asian elephant, there's a difference. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1226.4799999999998s)]
*  And if it's in these certain like protein coding regions in all these different regions [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1231.3999999999999s)]
*  of the genome that drive phenotypes or physical attributes like, you know, curved tusks, dome [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1235.8s)]
*  cranium, small ears, the subcutaneous fat layer, and then hair and coat color, you can [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1241.4799999999998s)]
*  actually then engineer that into the Asian elephant, right? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1247.6s)]
*  Because you're only looking you're only really looking at that point four percent difference, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1250.0s)]
*  right? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1253.32s)]
*  It's still a lot of numbers, but you're only looking at that. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1254.32s)]
*  And so the better you can be at software, and the better you can be using AI and computer [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1256.04s)]
*  models, the less edits you have to make, right? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1260.68s)]
*  Because you're really just trying to target those core phenotypes. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1262.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1265.32s)]
*  Are there specific genes that regulate size because they're larger than it's a it's a [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1266.32s)]
*  con. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1269.76s)]
*  So mammoths were about the same size. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1270.76s)]
*  They're a little bit bigger than Asian elephants, a little bit smaller than African elephants. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1271.76s)]
*  So there were 11, you know, everyone argues over the definition of speciation because [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1275.76s)]
*  it's a stupid concept that humans made, not nature made. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1280.4799999999998s)]
*  And so there are 11 different types of mammoths out there that evolved in different in different [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1283.6s)]
*  ways and some of them were larger. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1288.28s)]
*  But the woolly mammoth, the one that we were pursuing that has that woolly phenotype, it [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1289.52s)]
*  was about the size of a Asian elephant. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1295.1999999999998s)]
*  And but to your question on size, it's actually a cluster of genes. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1298.6799999999998s)]
*  We're finding more and more about how different genes also map across all species as well. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1302.38s)]
*  And so there's specific characteristics that these animals have, one of them being the [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1309.3000000000002s)]
*  big furry coats that you guys, what did you do with mice? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1313.8600000000001s)]
*  We made woolly mice. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1319.44s)]
*  See, we can find that. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1320.44s)]
*  The only the only like unintended consequences was they were cute as fuck. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1323.5800000000002s)]
*  People lost their minds, right? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1328.2600000000002s)]
*  We're there's there's I was I was on the phone recently with it, you know, moderately aggressive [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1329.7s)]
*  journalist and and it was going quite poorly as some calls moderately aggressive. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1336.94s)]
*  They were being aggressive in what way? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1341.74s)]
*  Some people, some people. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1343.62s)]
*  Yeah, they look cute. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1345.1s)]
*  My daughter actually found this online and wants one. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1349.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1351.3s)]
*  So we get that a lot from once a week. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1352.3s)]
*  So every week, every week, I don't have my laptop. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1354.06s)]
*  You. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1357.6599999999999s)]
*  But every week. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1358.6599999999999s)]
*  Oh, my God, they're adorable. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1359.6599999999999s)]
*  So this so these woolly mice aren't just adorable. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1361.4599999999998s)]
*  We basically said, look, what are the core genes that drive the hair phenotype or physical [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1364.5s)]
*  attribute of a of a mammoth from an Asian elephant to a mammoth? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1369.74s)]
*  And then because we want to do this in the most ethical way as possible, there's about [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1374.5s)]
*  two hundred million years of genetic divergence between mice and elephants. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1377.62s)]
*  We didn't just want to ram mammoth DNA in there and see what happens. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1381.34s)]
*  So we look for the mouse equivalent, right? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1385.02s)]
*  So we look for like all of us have similar genes. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1386.68s)]
*  And so we can try to look for those genes and then edit those genes with the data we [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1389.68s)]
*  got from the mammoth so that we're then not just putting random genes in there that could [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1393.68s)]
*  either hurt the animal or kill them. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1398.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1399.96s)]
*  Or they may not even be compatible with life. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1400.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1401.96s)]
*  So we try to be really, really thoughtful about the woolly mice went like it went insane. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1402.96s)]
*  There's people that are like making T-shirts a meme coin. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1407.64s)]
*  And so we made thirty six mice. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1411.0s)]
*  They're all they're all healthy. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1413.2800000000002s)]
*  There's thirty six mice that we made. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1414.78s)]
*  And what was crazy about it is we're excited about it because it shows that the end to [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1417.3s)]
*  end process of taking data from an ancient DNA, comparing it to a living animal, making [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1421.3999999999999s)]
*  those changes, doing it with a hundred percent efficiency. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1428.22s)]
*  And that's really important and really hard. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1431.6s)]
*  So we did it with a hundred percent efficiency. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1433.42s)]
*  Yeah, that's the difference. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1435.3799999999999s)]
*  Well, so the one of them, if it was in a trap, you'd be so sad. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1436.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1440.18s)]
*  If he was in a trap, oh, we could we could. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1441.9s)]
*  Isn't that funny? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1444.54s)]
*  Just a little bit of fur. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1445.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1446.54s)]
*  Makes you love them. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1447.54s)]
*  And that's the color that we think most mammoths were. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1448.54s)]
*  So they were like a blonde. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1449.54s)]
*  They were like they were like a golden brown color, right? [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1451.14s)]
*  Because when we pull them out of the permafrost, they've been sitting in mud for quite some [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1454.02s)]
*  time. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1457.14s)]
*  But if you see very fresh mammoths like from Siberia and whatnot, like in Yakuts and other [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1458.14s)]
*  places in northern Siberia that they actually have pretty, pretty well preserved mammoths. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1462.94s)]
*  They actually have kind of a dirty blonde meat, gold meats, brown fur. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1467.02s)]
*  Wow. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1472.98s)]
*  So we did that. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1473.98s)]
*  And now there's people that are making T-shirts that aren't us and pillows are like legalized [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1474.98s)]
*  wooly mice. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1479.94s)]
*  I'm like, they're not illegal. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1480.94s)]
*  And then a meme account for the guy that did the like the crisper babies, you know, that [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1481.94s)]
*  went in trouble for, you know, making edited babies in China. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1486.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1489.74s)]
*  A meme account. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1490.74s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1491.74s)]
*  So that's mammoth fur. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1492.74s)]
*  So the guy that made that account, though, actually said on on X that that these are [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1494.46s)]
*  a bio weapon in that colossal made a bio. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1498.42s)]
*  So the the weirdness of the wooly mouse went crazy viral. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1501.38s)]
*  What we were trying to show is that we used our multi multiplex editing tools, meaning [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1504.5s)]
*  that we edited all of those genes at the same time. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1509.3s)]
*  Most people edit one gene, let that mouse live from the second lineage. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1512.18s)]
*  They'll do one more gene, let that mouse live, and then they'll stack those edits over multiple [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1516.82s)]
*  generations. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1521.22s)]
*  So we've developed a system so that we can deliver all of those edits at one time all [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1522.7s)]
*  over the genome, get exactly what we want. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1526.1000000000001s)]
*  And then we have this what's called monoclonal screening where we're screening the cells [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1528.9s)]
*  at the end, sequencing all the cells, which is expensive and sounds like overkill. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1532.14s)]
*  But then we know that none of them have unintended consequences or off target effects in the [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1537.58s)]
*  genome so that we know the mice that we then do cloning with. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1541.8600000000001s)]
*  We know that they'll be healthy. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1545.16s)]
*  And so we try to spend a lot of time on that because we're certified by American Humane [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1546.5s)]
*  Society, it's the oldest humane organization in the world. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1551.74s)]
*  And if you've seen the film that's like no animals were harmed in the making of this [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1554.74s)]
*  film, that's those guys. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1558.02s)]
*  So we've ended up, so we really care about kind of not just the de-extinction efforts, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1559.58s)]
*  the genome engineering efforts, but ensuring that the animals are healthy when they come [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1565.6200000000001s)]
*  out. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1569.26s)]
*  And so the wooly mouse was a really interesting proof of concept. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1570.26s)]
*  It shows that the edits that we are working on are working right and we're getting exactly [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1572.98s)]
*  what we predicted. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1577.42s)]
*  Is there any plans to sell those? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1578.42s)]
*  No, everyone keeps asking us that. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1579.42s)]
*  You know what? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1581.3999999999999s)]
*  Museums actually are now calling us saying, and zoos are calling us saying, can we display [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1582.3999999999999s)]
*  the wooly mice? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1586.96s)]
*  They're like, it'll drive so much value. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1587.96s)]
*  It'll teach people about genetics and whatnot. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1589.1599999999999s)]
*  So it's not our business model to sell our animals or to sell wooly mice, but it's kind [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1591.74s)]
*  of gone crazy. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1599.0s)]
*  Is it dangerous though to leave these mice in the hands of someone even at a zoo who [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1600.0s)]
*  decides I want more of these? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1605.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, if we ever put them, I think more likely we'd put them in a museum that needs to be [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1608.08s)]
*  free like the Smithsonian or something like that from an education perspective versus [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1614.0s)]
*  something that's more attraction based. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1617.08s)]
*  I think we do it more in the case of a museum. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1618.56s)]
*  Do you plan on keeping this batch alive? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1620.4s)]
*  Yeah, they're going to live out their normal lives. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1623.16s)]
*  But you're not going to make new ones? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1625.08s)]
*  We may make new ones. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1627.2s)]
*  What if they breed? [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1628.2s)]
*  These won't, they're all separated. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1629.2s)]
*  They're all separated by sex. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1630.2s)]
*  So we're not going to have like a Jurassic Park moment where they change. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1631.2s)]
*  They're all separated by sex. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1635.48s)]
*  But if Jamie finds a picture of their habitats, they actually live, they live a couple years, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1636.76s)]
*  but they don't live like traditional lab mice that live in like a small little cage and [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1642.62s)]
*  all on top of each other. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1647.16s)]
*  They actually live in pretty sweet digs that we made for them. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1649.52s)]
*  They're all, yeah, like we spared no expense. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1653.04s)]
*  Cool little house. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1657.32s)]
*  Yeah, and they're big and we put fun stuff in them to play with like this. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1658.32s)]
*  And what's been crazy is we only named two of them and we named them Chip and Dale because [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1663.0s)]
*  people were asking what the names were and I was like, Chip is the only thing that I [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1668.4s)]
*  could think of at the moment. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1671.2s)]
*  And now even on X people are like, we need pictures of Chip. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1672.68s)]
*  Where is Chip? [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1675.68s)]
*  We've only seen pictures of Dale. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1676.68s)]
*  And there's like these incredible internet sleuths that are like, that's not Chip, that's [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1677.86s)]
*  Dale. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1682.04s)]
*  We need a picture of Chip. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1683.04s)]
*  You can get involved. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1684.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1685.04s)]
*  So we've just, yeah. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1686.04s)]
*  Don't get involved with those people. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1687.04s)]
*  We've not leaned in. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1688.04s)]
*  You cannot. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1689.04s)]
*  We're excited. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1690.08s)]
*  They're excited, but we just can't. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1691.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1692.08s)]
*  We're busy. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1693.08s)]
*  So this is a new thing. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1694.08s)]
*  The wooly mouse is a new thing. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1696.12s)]
*  Is there any talk about doing other kind of new things? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1698.2s)]
*  So it's more of a proof of technology. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1701.8799999999999s)]
*  I think that the mouse model, because it's a 20 day gestation versus 22 months in elephants, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1704.48s)]
*  it's a great way to test phenotypes because with a mammoth, you have three ways to test [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1710.0s)]
*  if you got the edits right. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1715.08s)]
*  One, you can do molecular tests. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1716.6s)]
*  You can do DNA sequencing to see if it worked. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1718.12s)]
*  Two, I guess there's four. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1720.9199999999998s)]
*  Two, you could grow a mammoth and see if it looks like it, but that's a lot of work in [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1722.84s)]
*  22 months, like a lot of gestational time, a lot of money. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1726.4399999999998s)]
*  I think there's a lot of risk in that. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1730.9199999999998s)]
*  The third, and this is a little weird, we created what's called induced pluripotent [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1732.08s)]
*  stem cells. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1735.8799999999999s)]
*  So we created cells that you can then turn into any type of tissue. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1736.8799999999999s)]
*  So we actually do have mammoth hair follicles growing in a lab. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1740.24s)]
*  So we have hair growing in petri dishes in the lab, which is pretty cool. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1743.4s)]
*  If you come see the lab, you'll get the whole wooly wonka toro, which is pretty cool. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1747.24s)]
*  And then the fourth way is mice, right? [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1751.76s)]
*  Because it's like if we can then engineer them into mice, we can see immediately within [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1753.96s)]
*  20 days if the edits were working, if there were any unintended consequences that would [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1758.2800000000002s)]
*  be detrimental to the animal. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1762.72s)]
*  So we'll probably make more iterations of the wooly mice. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1764.72s)]
*  The thylacine's closest living relative is the fat-tailed dunnart, which is a mouse-sized [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1767.6000000000001s)]
*  marsupial. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1771.44s)]
*  It actually gestates in 13 and a half days versus 20 days. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1772.8s)]
*  So there's no reason to do it in mice when you can do it immediately in the model species. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1775.92s)]
*  Wow. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1780.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1781.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1782.04s)]
*  So how did you make the decision to do what you ultimately did, what you showed me before [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1783.04s)]
*  the show? [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1787.72s)]
*  So we're working on the mammoth, the Tasmanian tiger, and the dodo for different reasons. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1789.4s)]
*  We work with a lot of different private landowners, governments, and indigenous people groups. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1793.68s)]
*  And a project that we announced through our Colossal Foundation about two and a half years [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1797.48s)]
*  ago is doing a population genomics map. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1802.66s)]
*  We talked about biobanking a little bit. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1805.6200000000001s)]
*  So we want to understand from the bison that are still here in America, what's genetic [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1807.3400000000001s)]
*  diversity? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1811.18s)]
*  What's been lost? [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1812.18s)]
*  What's the number of inbreeding? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1813.5800000000002s)]
*  So we go through this whole process to try to understand, and then we were giving a report [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1814.9s)]
*  back to MHA Nation. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1819.14s)]
*  Chairman Fox, it's one of the largest indigenous people groups in the United States, one of [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1820.46s)]
*  the largest tribes based in North Dakota. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1824.02s)]
*  So we're giving them a report out on this. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1826.3200000000002s)]
*  We went to their nation, wanted to share this, and then we're curious. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1828.48s)]
*  So we said, what other projects would you work on that we could do that's helpful outside [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1832.06s)]
*  of helping bison? [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1837.3s)]
*  And they said that we needed help with wolf conservation. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1838.78s)]
*  They brought up that. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1841.86s)]
*  They said that we needed help with more bison conservation. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1842.86s)]
*  They said if we do stuff around eagles and fish. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1845.54s)]
*  And so we kind of got that feedback. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1848.84s)]
*  And when Chairman Fox is walking me through their cultural heritage museum, he actually [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1850.66s)]
*  stopped on this incredible picture of a white wolf. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1856.98s)]
*  And he said, you know, that's the great wolf. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1860.26s)]
*  And he talked about the ancestral knowledge that was passed down and that's been lost [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1862.62s)]
*  and how many people believed that it could have even been a dire wolf. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1866.26s)]
*  And I was like, from Game of Thrones, that's cool. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1870.98s)]
*  I love the show. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1872.7s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1873.7s)]
*  So he did that. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1874.7s)]
*  We talked about that. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1875.7s)]
*  And then, you know, three months later, I was in North Carolina and understanding that [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1876.7s)]
*  for a completely different meeting around financing. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1882.26s)]
*  And in that meeting, the Red Wolf program came up. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1884.82s)]
*  I don't know if you know anything about the Red Wolf, but it's kind of a disaster. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1887.6599999999999s)]
*  You know, it's the only endemic wolf to America. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1890.6999999999998s)]
*  It's only endemic to America. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1893.26s)]
*  It's a red wolf. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1894.4199999999998s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1895.6999999999998s)]
*  And there's like 15 left in the wild with massive loss of genetic diversity, massive [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1897.06s)]
*  bottleneck. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1903.86s)]
*  And I was like, wait, we're supposed to be this country of innovation. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1904.86s)]
*  We can't save our own. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1907.3s)]
*  When you think of like the American West, right, you think of wolves, you think of like, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1908.76s)]
*  you know, eagle soaring, you think of like trout bears catching trout. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1913.1s)]
*  You think of bison. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1916.9s)]
*  The thought that we could lose one of these amazing icons, like we're like, we have to [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1918.42s)]
*  do something about this. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1922.94s)]
*  We have to figure something out. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1923.94s)]
*  And so we put that kind of on the list. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1924.94s)]
*  And then in a weird series of events, we've had all of these kids over the last three [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1927.38s)]
*  years sent in teachers and parents sending us pictures of woolly mammoths or dodos or [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1931.54s)]
*  thylacines. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1936.02s)]
*  Like we get like boxes of this every single week, which is pretty cool. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1937.02s)]
*  So we're going to make a colossal kids corner at our new labs. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1940.46s)]
*  And in that, we've had all this some Hollywood talent like, you know, Tom Brady, others that [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1944.86s)]
*  have invested in the business. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1949.02s)]
*  They're just excited about it. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1950.02s)]
*  Most of them learned about it through their kids, kind of like with the wooly mouse with [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1951.54s)]
*  you. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1954.58s)]
*  And so everyone's excited about it. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1955.58s)]
*  And then we talked again to MHA Nation. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1956.74s)]
*  They brought up the direwolf again. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1959.18s)]
*  And so we thought maybe there was an opportunity to bring back an American species because [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1960.94s)]
*  direwolves were only found in the U.S. a little in North America, but predominantly in the [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1966.0s)]
*  United States, coastal United States. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1970.3799999999999s)]
*  And we thought if we could do something that could bring back the direwolf, also help wolf [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1974.54s)]
*  conservation and bring people from like sci-fi fantasy and kids more into science and into [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1979.5s)]
*  the conversation around conservation. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1986.1399999999999s)]
*  We thought it was a cool idea, but we had no idea if we could pull it off. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1988.4199999999998s)]
*  Is there dead direwolves that were trapped in permafrost or? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1992.4199999999998s)]
*  No, most are most of the direwolf skulls out there. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=1997.62s)]
*  There's thousands of them in La Brea tar fritz. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2001.4199999999998s)]
*  So if you go there, they have this beautiful wall. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2003.02s)]
*  But because of heat and acid acidification, there isn't anything that's protected. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2005.42s)]
*  Like, there's nothing you can get from that. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2010.46s)]
*  But about six years ago, a group, including Bess Shapiro, our chief science officer, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2012.3s)]
*  sequenced a tooth that was found in a cave, just a single tooth. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2018.46s)]
*  Right. And in that tooth, they actually found a they actually got point one five X or [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2021.46s)]
*  coverage of the genome. So they got about 15 percent of the genome. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2028.42s)]
*  But that's not really enough. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2031.54s)]
*  You need to get up to about 10 X, meaning that you can read the entire genome about [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2032.74s)]
*  10 different times so that even if there are gaps, you under stuff, understand enough [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2036.5s)]
*  of the core kind of coding regions that you could bring back that animal or this done [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2041.26s)]
*  by AI and software. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2046.06s)]
*  Yeah. So we we built part of our business model is building technologies to solve these [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2048.1s)]
*  really complicated problems. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2053.18s)]
*  They're much harder to solve than just solving them for existing species, open [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2054.3s)]
*  sourcing that for conservation for free. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2058.82s)]
*  But then also taking those technologies that we can monetize for humans and spinning them [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2060.62s)]
*  out. So our first computational analysis company was called FormBio, and we actually spun [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2063.7400000000002s)]
*  it out of the business. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2067.9s)]
*  So you have this tooth, you have one point five. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2068.9s)]
*  Yeah, one point five, so 15 percent of the genome. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2072.2200000000003s)]
*  OK. And so I went to Beth, who was only an adviser at the time, and said, could you [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2074.78s)]
*  resample the tooth? And she's like, it's like, you know, half an inch long. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2079.26s)]
*  She's like, it's destructive sampling like it's going to ruin us. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2082.58s)]
*  Well, could we scour the other museums and see if it's even possible? [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2085.06s)]
*  So we lucked out in that to 13000 years old. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2089.2599999999998s)]
*  The skull itself is 72, 73 thousand years old. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2092.62s)]
*  Not exactly sure. But it was found in a riverbed and it wasn't found in a riverbed at [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2096.22s)]
*  the mouth of a cave. So it wasn't found like in in the permafrost. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2101.62s)]
*  It also wasn't found in like heat and acidification. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2105.18s)]
*  So there's a bone in all of us called the petrous bone, which is insanely dense and [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2108.46s)]
*  it doesn't change a lot from after you're born. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2114.34s)]
*  It's a great DNA storage, better than teeth, better than anything. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2116.58s)]
*  It's on the it's like in the inner ear, kind of head area. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2119.7400000000002s)]
*  And so we got permission from the museum to very carefully drill into the back of [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2123.34s)]
*  the underside of the skull and remove the petrous bone to see if we could get DNA. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2130.6200000000003s)]
*  And we got really lucky between resampling the first and the end in the skull. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2135.54s)]
*  We ended up getting about 13 to 14 X coverage. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2140.86s)]
*  So that's more than we needed to potentially bring back the direwolves. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2143.1000000000004s)]
*  And then what you do? [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2146.82s)]
*  Well, and then we got a knock on the door. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2149.1000000000004s)]
*  I know. So we took that DNA. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2152.06s)]
*  Can I ask you before we even start with this? [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2154.78s)]
*  Yeah. The aggressive reporters are is it you're playing God? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2156.26s)]
*  We have the right to do this. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2162.1800000000003s)]
*  So it's been a journey. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2163.94s)]
*  OK, so the journey that we've had is when we started the business, we didn't have any [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2165.38s)]
*  scientists and we just didn't write. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2169.38s)]
*  They're like, this is tech bros wanting to see cool animals. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2171.06s)]
*  And oh, they've only got 16 million dollars in funding and they don't have any scientists. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2174.7s)]
*  Ha ha. So that was that was phase one. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2177.9s)]
*  And then we're like, oh, well, you know, as an entrepreneur, my job is to hire much [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2180.06s)]
*  smarter people than me. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2183.82s)]
*  You smoke cigars? I do not. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2185.26s)]
*  Gary's got me on quite a kick. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2187.42s)]
*  So health kick. Yeah. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2189.14s)]
*  So I mean, cigars aren't bad for you. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2190.46s)]
*  Well, I'm not saying they're bad for you. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2192.62s)]
*  I'm just saying that I allegedly. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2193.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I don't care. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2195.62s)]
*  So this is the last of the things that I partake in that are probably bad for you. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2197.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. But you got to do what you got to do. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2202.34s)]
*  Everyone's got their vice. I like a little cigar. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2204.5s)]
*  So my question, if I was going to grill you, if I was a reporter, I'd be like, what [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2206.6200000000003s)]
*  right do you have to invade the natural process of nature and to inject your curiosity [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2211.94s)]
*  and your ability to create new life? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2219.5800000000004s)]
*  I think that we've become the apex part around this planet and we inject our [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2221.86s)]
*  curiosity and choices every day that we overpitched the ocean. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2227.78s)]
*  We overhunt something in the case of the thylacine. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2231.1400000000003s)]
*  The Australian government put a bounty on its head and killed it off. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2234.1s)]
*  Right. And every time we cut down the rainforest, every time we drink [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2238.1s)]
*  hydrogenated water, we are playing God on some level. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2241.62s)]
*  Right. We are we are we are humans are very good at changing the natural flow of things. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2244.94s)]
*  Now, the good news is, is that there's been a lot of work around ecology and [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2251.2200000000003s)]
*  understanding what the impacts to rewilding can be. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2255.58s)]
*  And so it's been really, really helpful for us to understand, you know, you know, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2259.2200000000003s)]
*  one of the most successful rewilding programs of all times was reintroducing of [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2264.42s)]
*  14 or 15 wolves back in the Yellowstone. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2268.58s)]
*  Right. And looking at how the ecology of the system completely changed, like it [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2271.14s)]
*  changed the shape of rivers, you know, because the elk population were just, you [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2275.58s)]
*  know, they're getting fat, they're getting lazy. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2279.6600000000003s)]
*  They weren't migrating. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2281.38s)]
*  The sick and the old in the week weren't getting killed off. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2282.58s)]
*  They were spreading disease. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2285.54s)]
*  They're eating all of the willows and everything along the banks. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2287.02s)]
*  So therefore, the beavers went away. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2289.86s)]
*  Beavers are like the most super, you know, climate impact animals that probably [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2291.58s)]
*  exist because they make wetlands, they make they cause the rivers and ponds to [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2296.42s)]
*  get deeper. So it allows different types of fish and different types of animals. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2301.1800000000003s)]
*  So you have this thing called tropic downgrading. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2304.58s)]
*  You have this tropic cascading effect when you reintroduce these species. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2306.9s)]
*  That documentary is fascinating. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2310.46s)]
*  It's so fascinating how wolves change rivers. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2311.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2313.6200000000003s)]
*  I know people that lived in Montana before the wolf reintroduction. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2314.42s)]
*  And a lot of people don't like that the wolves are there. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2319.02s)]
*  And but most of them are elk hunters that were used to something that's just [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2322.1800000000003s)]
*  outrageously overpopulated. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2325.42s)]
*  That's the reality of it. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2327.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2328.7000000000003s)]
*  But they were telling me that there was they had so many elk that were living. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2329.14s)]
*  They had such a large population versus the actual resources that were available. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2334.98s)]
*  They had all these crazy hunts that were available over the counter. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2340.46s)]
*  You can hunt cows in the snow. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2344.14s)]
*  So in the middle of the winter where they can't move good, you just pick them off [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2346.66s)]
*  in the snow because they were just trying to cull the population. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2350.5s)]
*  They were trying to diminish them. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2353.7400000000002s)]
*  And that's and that's not good for the population. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2355.02s)]
*  No, it's not good for the ecosystem. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2357.1s)]
*  It's not good for the elk population itself. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2358.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2360.34s)]
*  I have a good friend who lives in Colorado. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2361.62s)]
*  He has a ranch in Colorado. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2363.78s)]
*  And we were at his place approximately two weeks after they reintroduced wolves. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2365.34s)]
*  They actually reintroduced wolves on his property. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2371.3s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2374.1400000000003s)]
*  And he didn't know it was going to happen before it happened. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2375.42s)]
*  And all the people around there are ranchers. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2378.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2379.94s)]
*  So already these five wolves that they've reintroduced, he said, killed over a dozen [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2380.38s)]
*  cows and calves. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2385.78s)]
*  So the problem is they've killed elk as well. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2387.46s)]
*  In fact, I took a photo of an elk leg that we found on the ground that the wolves had [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2389.9s)]
*  killed. I'm not a big fan of people getting to vote on whether or not you should do [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2394.34s)]
*  something with wildlife. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2399.7000000000003s)]
*  I'm a big fan on having real wildlife biologists assess situations. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2400.98s)]
*  And in the case of Colorado, Colorado obviously border borders Wyoming and Wyoming has [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2406.82s)]
*  wolves. Wolves were making their way into Colorado already, and they are protected. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2411.46s)]
*  The problem with reintroducing them is you're essentially asking a wolf that doesn't [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2417.3s)]
*  know the territory to start killing things in that territory. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2421.46s)]
*  Or to stop at an imaginary border it doesn't exist. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2423.9s)]
*  There's no borders. They go hundreds and hundreds of miles. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2427.02s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2429.1s)]
*  The idea that you're doing this and you're doing this where there's ranches is crazy. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2429.38s)]
*  And in Colorado, particularly stupid because the first batch were literally animals that [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2434.26s)]
*  they had captured because they were killing wildlife. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2440.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2442.5s)]
*  So they moved them from Oregon to Colorado where they started killing wildlife. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2442.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2449.1800000000003s)]
*  They're killing, excuse me, I'm saying wildlife. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2449.62s)]
*  What I really meant to say was animals, agriculture. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2451.66s)]
*  They're killing domesticated cows. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2455.66s)]
*  They're killing these calves and they're having a real fucking problem with that. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2458.62s)]
*  And it is something that needs to be continually monitored that shouldn't just be on [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2464.9s)]
*  some random vote of how you feel about it, right? [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2470.14s)]
*  Like, you just can't let people vote on that. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2472.82s)]
*  Too many people live in these high population areas. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2475.58s)]
*  I couldn't agree more. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2477.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2478.98s)]
*  And so like we as humanity, like if you look at the third leading cause of death of [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2479.14s)]
*  elephants, it's human elephant conflict. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2485.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2487.22s)]
*  Like we have to we have to figure these things out. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2487.5s)]
*  We we also we don't want degraded ecosystems. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2489.62s)]
*  We don't lose species. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2492.18s)]
*  We have to be you have to do this in a very thoughtful and measured way. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2493.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2496.58s)]
*  Like with Yellowstone, they're like, this is big enough ecological preserve. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2497.14s)]
*  We're tagging the animals. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2500.3799999999997s)]
*  We're going to walk and measure it. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2501.9s)]
*  I don't think that it's safe or smart to put any, you know, not just predators, but also [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2503.1s)]
*  like large herbivores in these heavy population dense areas. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2508.86s)]
*  We can just we just we have to understand that some of these areas not are lost, but [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2512.1800000000003s)]
*  have already been changed for a different reason. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2517.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2519.9s)]
*  And they've achieved homo stasis, homeostasis. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2520.38s)]
*  They've achieved a balance. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2523.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2524.86s)]
*  Which is the big issue with Colorado right now. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2525.1800000000003s)]
*  And it's going to be the big issue whenever you reintroduce an animal that used to be [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2527.82s)]
*  there and is no longer there. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2531.02s)]
*  And I think in the case of Montana, I think you're right. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2532.3s)]
*  And I think there is an argument that maybe the wolves being there is better. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2536.46s)]
*  Obviously not if you're a rancher. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2541.42s)]
*  Well, the Colorado. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2542.62s)]
*  So the Colorado stuff is completely going to destroy all of the stats. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2543.7400000000002s)]
*  So pre Colorado. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2547.1800000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2548.7000000000003s)]
*  So I'm talking about reintroduction into Montana, reintroduction into parts of Canada, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2549.02s)]
*  reintroduction into Yellowstone, the Red Wolf, which is a very small population in [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2554.3s)]
*  North Carolina. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2559.06s)]
*  There's been less than five confirmed fatalities in all of North America in the last [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2560.1s)]
*  hundred years. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2565.1400000000003s)]
*  You mean humans? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2566.2599999999998s)]
*  Humans. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2566.8599999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2567.3799999999997s)]
*  And most of them in Alaska. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2567.66s)]
*  Most of them in Alaska or in Canada. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2569.06s)]
*  And then it's before Colorado. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2571.4599999999996s)]
*  So not saying with I don't know if the data has I don't think it has the latest from [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2575.8199999999997s)]
*  Colorado, but it represents point zero two percent of deaths associated with [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2579.1s)]
*  wolves and cattle and livestock. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2586.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2588.5s)]
*  And all livestock, not just cattle. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2588.7s)]
*  And so the problem is when you go out there and you have a maintained balance that [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2590.14s)]
*  people can understand and governments actually give subsidies to the ranchers when they [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2594.2599999999998s)]
*  get killed by when they get killed by the by wolves. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2597.8599999999997s)]
*  So that I think that is a good program because you have to be fair to the people that are [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2602.02s)]
*  actually ranching. But the problem is when you're not as thoughtful with a rewilding [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2605.3399999999997s)]
*  program and you don't and you're not as measured as like what they did in Yellowstone and [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2609.18s)]
*  they start encroaching in these areas, then the stats are going to go crazy. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2613.3799999999997s)]
*  And when the stats goes crazy, then you're going to start looking to the animals that are [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2616.4599999999996s)]
*  the problem. But it's not the animals that are the problem. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2620.5s)]
*  It was the decision that we gave that power to the masses that were really not informed [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2622.74s)]
*  to make that decision. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2626.5s)]
*  Exactly. The problem is people just have these ideas like wolves are beautiful. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2627.06s)]
*  They're amazing. We all love wolves. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2631.58s)]
*  It's an incredible animal. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2633.46s)]
*  So happy it exists. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2634.5s)]
*  Don't put it near where there's a ranch. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2635.98s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2637.74s)]
*  You can't vote on that if you live in Denver. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2638.02s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2639.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. If it doesn't affect your livelihood, it doesn't affect your the risk to your [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2640.38s)]
*  animals or your family. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2644.54s)]
*  Yeah. You have to be mindful of that. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2645.46s)]
*  There's also the getting a very skewed perspective because the governor is really [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2646.66s)]
*  interested in it and his husband is really interested in it. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2650.02s)]
*  His husband apparently is the one who really wanted it to happen. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2652.5s)]
*  And you know, you have a mandate. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2655.66s)]
*  So you have to get wolves out by a certain time. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2657.7400000000002s)]
*  And when you're doing it, the only wolves available are wolves that kill livestock. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2660.7s)]
*  So you're like, fuck it. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2664.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's just not. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2665.46s)]
*  It's just it's you have in the a lot of the so the project that we'll probably [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2666.42s)]
*  eventually talk about is we brought in a lot of the teams. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2672.1s)]
*  So many people that have been on your show that know how to do the rewilding the [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2676.58s)]
*  right way over time. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2682.18s)]
*  OK, so this is what we'll just get to it. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2683.62s)]
*  You made a fucking dire wolf. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2685.3s)]
*  I didn't. Our team, our incredible team made three dire wolves so far. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2687.74s)]
*  Let's see the photos. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2694.14s)]
*  Jamie bust out some photos. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2695.34s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, prepare yourself because this is truly fucking crazy. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2697.02s)]
*  Yeah. That's the pop. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2701.42s)]
*  Yeah. So this is so that's actually Romulus as so we have two boys, Romulus [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2702.62s)]
*  and Remus founders from and then and then we have Khaleesi, who's the new girl. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2707.9s)]
*  So this is Romulus and Remus. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2713.5s)]
*  So funny, funny story about this. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2715.74s)]
*  So Peter Jackson from Lord of the Rings, Jamie, Peter Jackson from Lord of the [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2717.7s)]
*  Rings was actually one of our investors. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2723.66s)]
*  And he has this huge museum in Wellington that he's building for all these movie [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2727.58s)]
*  props. And he's like, we're I was sitting in Peter's house with he and his his [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2731.26s)]
*  partner, Fran. And I was like, you know, I showed him the video of them howling. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2735.94s)]
*  He started tearing up. He goes, this is the first time I've heard a dire wolf or [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2741.2200000000003s)]
*  anyone's heard a dire wolf in 10,000 years started. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2743.86s)]
*  Well, he like he like physically, emotionally got chills and started crying. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2745.42s)]
*  And then he's like, well, you know, I do have the throne. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2749.7000000000003s)]
*  I was like, what do you mean? He goes, I bought the throne last week at auction [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2752.5400000000004s)]
*  at a private auction for black sotheby's or someone. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2755.1400000000003s)]
*  Right. And so so he did. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2757.3s)]
*  And it just happened to be where the wolves were doing their vet checkup. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2759.1s)]
*  Like talk about cosmic coincidence. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2762.7799999999997s)]
*  Incredible. Right. And so, you know, what you don't see in this photo is you don't [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2764.74s)]
*  see the fact that we have American Humane Society there with three veterinary [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2769.18s)]
*  people. We had six people from our animal care. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2772.9s)]
*  When you say checkup, you don't vaccinate these little guys, do you? [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2776.22s)]
*  They do get they because of viruses from that they can get from the soil at at [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2779.02s)]
*  eight weeks. They do get basic virus. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2786.14s)]
*  They do get basic vaccines. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2788.42s)]
*  Are we concerned about that? [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2790.34s)]
*  I mean, you have this animal that you're just. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2791.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. So these are staying on, you know, like these are not going back into the [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2793.7799999999997s)]
*  wild. Right. Not yet. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2796.86s)]
*  Right now, they're on a 2000 acre secure expansive ecological preserve with [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2798.42s)]
*  24 seven care. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2803.42s)]
*  We have an animal hospital that we built. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2804.86s)]
*  People are like, you guys raise so much money. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2807.1s)]
*  And I was like, well, because we didn't just spend it on the labs, you have to [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2808.86s)]
*  spend it on the animal care, the facilities. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2812.38s)]
*  Yeah. Let's see the photo of the actual grown ones because they're fucking nuts. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2814.82s)]
*  Yeah. So this is Ramos and Remus playing in the snow on the preserve when they [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2822.38s)]
*  are three months old. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2827.5400000000004s)]
*  So three months. How big are they? [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2830.86s)]
*  Three months. They were north of 45 pounds. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2832.9s)]
*  Wow. So look at that face. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2835.78s)]
*  God, they're so they just get they just get as they've aged. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2838.94s)]
*  They've just got more and more beautiful. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2842.46s)]
*  So let's go to the adults because the adults have crazy characteristics that you [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2844.5s)]
*  were saying that you didn't even know that we didn't know. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2848.98s)]
*  Right. And so we we we we ended up taking getting a is this a full grown one? [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2851.38s)]
*  There's still five months old. So there are 80 pounds at five months. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2857.7000000000003s)]
*  So wolves typically grow 12 to 14 months. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2860.0200000000004s)]
*  So they're not full grown yet. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2863.5400000000004s)]
*  Wow. And how big is it already? [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2865.1000000000004s)]
*  80 pounds, about five and a half feet in the main. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2866.94s)]
*  Yeah. And so a couple of things about the wolves. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2871.94s)]
*  Jamie, if you go back. Yeah. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2873.94s)]
*  So we didn't know this. Right. We knew that they were a Pleistocene wolf. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2875.38s)]
*  We knew that they existed and went extinct about 12000 years ago [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2878.54s)]
*  when a lot of megafauna went extinct, like the during kind of that younger [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2883.26s)]
*  dry period, that younger dry kind of cooling period. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2886.54s)]
*  They went they went extinct as well. Right. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2890.7400000000002s)]
*  And we knew all we know, because all we have is we don't frozen dire wolves [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2893.46s)]
*  or frozen samples. We literally just know from skeletal remains that they were [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2897.26s)]
*  20 to 25 percent larger. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2901.7799999999997s)]
*  They were stockier. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2903.98s)]
*  They probably weren't as fast based on kind of their their body weight [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2905.46s)]
*  as a normal wolf would be. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2908.3399999999997s)]
*  But we knew that they had thicker skulls, a larger cranium and what not. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2910.66s)]
*  And we assumed that they're there. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2915.02s)]
*  And we did find this out in the genome, which is pretty cool that they are white [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2916.7s)]
*  because there's like this misconception for a while that they were red [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2919.06s)]
*  because some scientists wanted to make a paper and assume that they are red. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2921.8199999999997s)]
*  So they get their paper. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2925.8199999999997s)]
*  Doesn't it make sense for natural selection? [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2926.58s)]
*  Yeah. They're an Arctic hunting animal. Yeah. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2928.4199999999996s)]
*  And they have this beautiful we didn't know that they have this beautiful [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2930.74s)]
*  like Maine like quality to them. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2932.8599999999997s)]
*  And when they're babies, you saw a couple of pictures, their fur [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2934.4199999999996s)]
*  almost feels like polar bears. It's crazy. Wow. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2937.3799999999997s)]
*  It's so it's like polar bears and it's hollow or is it? [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2939.74s)]
*  Yeah, it's not. It's it's like typical wolves, but it's incredibly thick. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2942.54s)]
*  It grows in kind of these these clumps. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2946.54s)]
*  But then as they've as they've grown in, they've started to get this [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2948.98s)]
*  kind of like Maine to them, which is the females as well. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2952.46s)]
*  Well, the female, she's only six weeks old, so it's two. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2955.46s)]
*  Oh, so you keep going through a couple other photos. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2957.54s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, they are just they're just beautiful. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2960.66s)]
*  And I mean, it's funny. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2963.2999999999997s)]
*  Someone actually said they on our team was like, they almost look like [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2964.74s)]
*  Shetland pony wolves at some point, right? Right. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2967.62s)]
*  There's something there's so stocky. They're stocky. They're thicker. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2970.42s)]
*  They are I mean, they're absolutely beautiful. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2975.46s)]
*  That so this is Khaleesi. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2979.22s)]
*  So he looks like a baby and we nailed it. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2980.74s)]
*  We we we named her. Can we hear it? [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2984.3799999999997s)]
*  Let me hear. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2987.2999999999997s)]
*  We named Khaleesi for George R.R. Martin, obviously, obviously. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2991.3799999999997s)]
*  Who's an investor in Colossal? Oh, wow. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=2995.3399999999997s)]
*  Oh. Nature's cute little murderers. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3000.58s)]
*  Well, everything in nature murders something, right? [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3010.06s)]
*  Yeah, like we were. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3011.8599999999997s)]
*  Well, cows murder grass. Yeah. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3013.1s)]
*  And people are now saying you can hear grass and other plants like scream. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3015.46s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, they scream. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3018.14s)]
*  So I guess I guess we all are bad. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3020.1s)]
*  Life eats life. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3022.74s)]
*  This is this is I mean, that's the reason why plants [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3023.7s)]
*  have chemicals to dissuade us from eating them. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3027.14s)]
*  What are they eating there? [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3029.74s)]
*  So they love to chew on horns in this state. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3030.98s)]
*  So we have a different phases of we built a hundred and forty five page animal guide. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3034.14s)]
*  These are actually different horns from different elk and other species [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3038.74s)]
*  that we're putting out there. And they chew on like they just love like a dog does. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3042.86s)]
*  Like a dog does. Right. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3046.2999999999997s)]
*  So are you letting these animals kill things or are you feeding? [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3047.22s)]
*  So we're feeding them still. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3050.3s)]
*  So they had a combination of bison meat, horse meat and do you plan on letting them kill things? [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3051.34s)]
*  So we're just about to introduce carcasses to them. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3056.78s)]
*  So giving them part of a carcass, letting them feed, building in that [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3058.86s)]
*  that dynamic between the two brothers for now. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3062.62s)]
*  And then and they are starting to exhibit some hunting behavior. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3065.42s)]
*  Are you going to let them hunt? [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3069.54s)]
*  I mean, they're on it. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3071.02s)]
*  They are on a seemingly wild 2000 acre preserve with just them. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3071.82s)]
*  So they do have the ability to hunt on that preserve. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3076.1s)]
*  But they're not doing it yet. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3079.22s)]
*  They're starting to exhibit that the original kind of the the first inklings [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3080.34s)]
*  that that it will trend toward that. But we want them to live. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3084.46s)]
*  We want them and we're going to probably make two or three more. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3087.06s)]
*  We want a solid little social pack that we can monitor, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3089.26s)]
*  that can live a seemingly wild life, that we can understand more about them. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3092.78s)]
*  Wow. That's cool. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3095.94s)]
*  But the other thing that's that's equally cool to it, going back to the Red Bull story. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3097.26s)]
*  Can you which is crazy to me that you have reignited these ten thousand year old [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3102.3s)]
*  hunting genes? Yeah. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3106.94s)]
*  That they're starting including size, including size. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3108.42s)]
*  We understand more about like we, you know, we looked at what genes [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3110.54s)]
*  made really a dire wolf, a dire wolf, like what was separated. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3114.98s)]
*  And the beautiful thing for us is that we had a 13000 year old tooth [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3117.38s)]
*  and a 73000 year old skull. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3120.26s)]
*  So we could actually understand the genetic distance [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3121.86s)]
*  with that much genetic distance between them. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3125.98s)]
*  We could actually understand, you know, what truly was fixed [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3127.9s)]
*  and conserved in the dire wolf genome and what was it just population? [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3132.46s)]
*  Right. If there's if you and I are 50000 years apart, [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3136.02s)]
*  you know, there's a lot of different mutations in that time period. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3139.06s)]
*  But if we can then really say, OK, you know, what made Ben Ben and what made Joe Joe? [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3141.8199999999997s)]
*  Oh, here's the overlaps. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3145.2599999999998s)]
*  It allowed us to really understand that. Wow. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3146.66s)]
*  And it's just fascinating that the behavior characteristics are kind of baked [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3149.2999999999997s)]
*  into the big day. Yeah. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3152.42s)]
*  And they just were dormant for 10000 years. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3153.66s)]
*  And now these things are waking up. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3155.98s)]
*  And so I was I was like so I was in, you know, because I bottle fed Romulus [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3157.2999999999997s)]
*  and Romulus is partly raised with me. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3162.8599999999997s)]
*  I could go out to the preserve. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3165.26s)]
*  I check on him quite quite frequently. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3166.26s)]
*  It's in the northern United States where we don't say where it is. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3168.5400000000004s)]
*  But mainly because we're not just the animals health, but for human health. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3171.1000000000004s)]
*  We ever since we launched the wooly mouse, we've had [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3175.78s)]
*  very excited people just show up at our labs are not open to the public. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3179.0200000000004s)]
*  And we've had lots of people just show up wanting to see the mice. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3183.0600000000004s)]
*  And so showing people too much of the preserve, we're always very, very nervous. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3186.2200000000003s)]
*  We scrub all the videos and want to ensure that no one can pick it out. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3190.7000000000003s)]
*  Right. We assume people will be moderately excited. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3193.62s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Oh, the Internet sleuths will try to find you. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3196.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. So we've we've done. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3200.22s)]
*  I'm not trying to challenge them, but we've been we've done everything we can to protect it. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3202.1s)]
*  Yeah, I understand. I mean, you have to. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3205.8599999999997s)]
*  Some dude from Saudi Arabia wants a wolf. Yeah. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3208.46s)]
*  Somebody wants a dire wolf. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3211.66s)]
*  We already get a lot to come over. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3213.38s)]
*  We already get a lot of weird calls. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3215.06s)]
*  But the oh, I bet you the other thing, though, someone with deep pockets. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3216.8599999999997s)]
*  Oh, we get we make me a dire wolf, my friend. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3220.18s)]
*  We have everything. They have every collection. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3223.5s)]
*  We get a lot of weird calls. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3227.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. From people that are like those people that have private zoos. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3228.58s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3231.7400000000002s)]
*  Enormous in like in India. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3232.82s)]
*  They have that family has like the largest private zoo and preserve. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3235.58s)]
*  It's just so wild. It's so crazy. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3240.34s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you know, Texas is history with animals, right? [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3242.26s)]
*  Yeah. There's more tigers in captivity and private collections in Texas [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3245.46s)]
*  than in the wild than in the wild of the world. Yeah. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3248.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. But I was I was in the I was in. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3252.2200000000003s)]
*  So we have the 2000 acres. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3255.82s)]
*  We have a subsection of it that's about six and a half acres. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3258.06s)]
*  We have an animal hospital, a storm rescue shelter. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3261.1400000000003s)]
*  We have a couple of natural dens that we've built for them, [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3263.94s)]
*  as well as an animal husbandry area. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3267.2200000000003s)]
*  So that that way, when we want to take photos of them or videos [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3270.1000000000004s)]
*  and do blood tests, they're in a seemingly more contained area. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3272.82s)]
*  And it's funny, two weeks ago, I was up there [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3276.42s)]
*  and I was actually sitting on those logs and one of those pictures [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3280.3s)]
*  and Remus came Romulus, who I spent the most amount of time with. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3282.78s)]
*  Remus came up, came pretty close, and I was able to touch him again. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3286.94s)]
*  But I thought at that moment, and he kind of skittished away. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3291.7400000000002s)]
*  I was like, that's the last time I'm touching Remus. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3294.26s)]
*  Like, what am I doing? And I mean, I don't mean wrong. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3296.6200000000003s)]
*  I had our animal. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3298.54s)]
*  Yeah, what I have animal care teams there and everything. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3299.6200000000003s)]
*  And they have been some there's some level of habituation [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3302.02s)]
*  between the care team. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3305.1400000000003s)]
*  They really know and love the care team. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3306.5800000000004s)]
*  But they're still wild animals, right? [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3307.7400000000002s)]
*  And so they probably hunted humans. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3309.38s)]
*  Yeah, I don't I don't I don't we don't know. Right. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3311.94s)]
*  But the rise of kind of going back to their extinction, the rise of the change [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3314.46s)]
*  in kind of this younger, driest period and the change, the massive, I know [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3319.9s)]
*  the some of the stuff that there's like several different prevailing theories, [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3324.86s)]
*  one of which is human predation, right? [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3328.9s)]
*  That like the rise of humans led to the extinction of the megafauna. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3330.5s)]
*  That's kind of, you know, I think I think the answer is probably a combination. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3334.1400000000003s)]
*  Could have there been an astrological event? [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3338.3s)]
*  There's starting to be more and more data around that. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3341.1400000000003s)]
*  I'm sure you've seen Randall Carlson talk about. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3344.5s)]
*  I've seen Randall Carlson talk about it. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3346.46s)]
*  Graham Hancock talk about it. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3347.78s)]
*  And they just got the whole beat out of them. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3349.26s)]
*  Yeah, but not anymore. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3351.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Now, I'm sorry. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3352.86s)]
*  Impact theory is well-respected. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3354.1800000000003s)]
*  It's yeah. And it happened. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3356.06s)]
*  Yeah. And it definitely also happened in kind of a regional sense, right? [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3357.54s)]
*  Because you see different which, yeah, which also tracks to the theory. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3360.86s)]
*  Right. So not only do you have these different layers [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3364.34s)]
*  that you can prove from a sedimentation perspective, but, you know, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3366.7s)]
*  there was also a massive glacial lake [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3370.22s)]
*  and and and some of the glaciers that rapidly liquefied. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3374.18s)]
*  They didn't dump in the ocean that also changed ocean patterns. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3378.4199999999996s)]
*  So you went from a period, you know, in the that that kind of transition [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3381.22s)]
*  from Pleistocene to Holocene. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3385.4199999999996s)]
*  There was this period of insanely accelerated cooling. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3387.1s)]
*  Do you know how Randall came up with that idea before it was brought to? [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3391.1s)]
*  Like his idea is that it was an instantaneous [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3395.58s)]
*  melting of these caps, some sort of immense cosmic event [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3399.3s)]
*  and millions and millions of trillions of gallons of water at an insane rate. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3405.2200000000003s)]
*  Ran through the land and just carved deep gouges into the earth. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3411.06s)]
*  He was on acid. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3415.42s)]
*  He was on acid. And this idea came to him. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3416.86s)]
*  So he was looking out over a ridge. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3418.86s)]
*  He was looking at this enormous gorge. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3421.1800000000003s)]
*  And he realized the gorge was formed by water rushing at an insane rate of speed. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3423.3s)]
*  And then he started noticing that there's these huge boulders [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3428.82s)]
*  that are just out in the middle of nowhere that were just moved [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3433.46s)]
*  by this immense amount of water. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3435.94s)]
*  And then the way the ground, the features of the ground [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3437.6600000000003s)]
*  looks like the features that you see on sandy beaches when the tide rolls in and out. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3442.26s)]
*  And it's like this is great. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3448.1800000000003s)]
*  And it all tracks, it tracks all over the world. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3449.82s)]
*  It's like it's like those it reminds me of those stories where they show people [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3453.02s)]
*  like the side of the Sphinx and they're like, oh, man, that's a lot of water erosion. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3455.9s)]
*  And then they like flip the photo and then you see the head of things like [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3459.94s)]
*  that's not water erosion. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3462.98s)]
*  It's Dr. Robert Chuck from Boston University. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3464.38s)]
*  He I've interviewed him. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3466.7000000000003s)]
*  He was the first guy to propose this. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3467.98s)]
*  He's like, this is thousands of years of rainfall. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3470.6200000000003s)]
*  And we know that the last time there was rainfall like that [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3473.58s)]
*  in the Nile Valley was nine thousand years ago. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3475.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. So the whole thing is really screwy in terms of like, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3478.1s)]
*  what is the timeline that this stuff was actually built? [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3481.1s)]
*  And are we just assuming because we've decided that it's 2500 BC, [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3483.46s)]
*  that that's it forever and no one wants to let that go? [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3488.46s)]
*  Well, that that I'm not a scientist, but that's and I don't come from academia. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3491.5s)]
*  I'm just an entrepreneur that knows how to build teams of smarter people than me. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3495.66s)]
*  And I find cool shit interesting and I try to work on it. Right. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3498.86s)]
*  And what's crazy to me is the academic system, you know, once again, [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3501.62s)]
*  non-academic, I'm sure I'll get crucified for this, but I don't read the comments. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3507.06s)]
*  Don't read the comments. I don't read the comments. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3510.1s)]
*  I don't trust me. I don't read the comments. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3512.18s)]
*  Good for you. I sleep quite well. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3513.86s)]
*  The but but, you know, the academics, we have 95 of the top [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3516.3399999999997s)]
*  scientific advisors in the world, Nobel laureates and whatnot. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3520.5s)]
*  We've got we fund 17 academic universities, right. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3523.9s)]
*  All over the world. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3526.9s)]
*  We fund 40 postdocs, right. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3528.06s)]
*  All over the world. Right. And they're they're doing this. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3530.94s)]
*  We're very integrated with different ideas from from academia and these scholars. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3532.8199999999997s)]
*  And our top people that were at Colossal came from academia. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3536.86s)]
*  So I think we try to be very academic friendly, but they live in this world, [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3539.5s)]
*  this super kind of like fortune and glory world where it's like [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3543.1800000000003s)]
*  it's a popularity contest if someone has a paper [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3547.5400000000004s)]
*  because their entire motivation is publish or perish. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3550.5400000000004s)]
*  So one of the other things that people bitch about is they're like, [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3553.5400000000004s)]
*  you guys don't write scientific papers for every single thing you're using. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3555.9s)]
*  We're not an academic university. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3559.26s)]
*  We're not. I don't have to write a paper on anything ever. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3560.7400000000002s)]
*  We do a couple here and there because we want to share our knowledge [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3563.6600000000003s)]
*  with with the community. Right. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3566.1400000000003s)]
*  But we get this feedback of like if we wrote a scientific paper [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3567.86s)]
*  for every single thing that we did that went through peer review, like [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3570.38s)]
*  we would have 3000 scientific papers and no mammoths ever. Right. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3573.86s)]
*  Because we just be sitting around writing fucking papers all day long. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3577.3s)]
*  This is interesting because they want to impose their idea [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3579.2200000000003s)]
*  of what you're supposed to and not supposed to do. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3581.78s)]
*  Well, they want to impose your their idea that they've already established [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3584.86s)]
*  in any change to that establishment. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3588.1800000000003s)]
*  So so in addition, the public 95 scientific advisors [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3590.02s)]
*  and these are some of the top women in the world, right. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3592.82s)]
*  That form fall in all sides of the political spectrum, all side [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3595.4199999999996s)]
*  to every single spectrum out there. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3598.9399999999996s)]
*  They we have another probably 40 advisors. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3601.02s)]
*  They're like, we love you. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3604.7s)]
*  We just you can't say anything because if I submit it, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3606.3399999999997s)]
*  we know these other people don't like me. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3608.9399999999996s)]
*  If I submit a paper there and we totally agree with you and we'll help you. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3610.2599999999998s)]
*  But we submit a paper. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3613.1s)]
*  They judge my paper. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3614.3799999999997s)]
*  It gets rejected. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3615.58s)]
*  Then I don't get my grant. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3616.5s)]
*  So then I can't continue my research. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3617.4599999999996s)]
*  I have to fire my postdocs. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3618.66s)]
*  So it's a complete scam of a system. Right. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3619.98s)]
*  And so we went through this phase where it's like [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3622.1s)]
*  we didn't have enough scientists. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3624.7s)]
*  We didn't have labs. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3625.98s)]
*  We didn't have money. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3626.8599999999997s)]
*  We weren't doing anything for conservation. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3627.8199999999997s)]
*  So we went through this whole like philosophical perspective [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3629.62s)]
*  of these like these all these things that people threw about throughout us [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3632.74s)]
*  from the scientific community. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3636.4199999999996s)]
*  And some of our biggest people that hate us are people that we denied their funding. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3637.54s)]
*  Of course. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3640.9399999999996s)]
*  Well, the problem is not the scientific community. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3641.9399999999996s)]
*  The problem is weak men. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3645.2599999999998s)]
*  It's this this what you see in these these squabbles, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3647.46s)]
*  these like ultra personal squabbles where like [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3652.7s)]
*  horrible vitriolic statements made about people. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3655.66s)]
*  They're just not happy people. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3660.14s)]
*  Exactly. It's the same problem with all of life. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3661.4199999999996s)]
*  It's these bitchy little people, these bitchy little monsters. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3664.8199999999997s)]
*  And they have taken over something that's incredibly important. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3669.5s)]
*  And their work, their work, these bitchy little people, [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3673.18s)]
*  their work is incredibly important. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3675.62s)]
*  Yes. But at the core of their being, they're a bitchy little person. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3677.3399999999997s)]
*  And they can. And that's why. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3681.54s)]
*  And that is why we don't have flying cars. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3682.54s)]
*  We don't have Mammoth. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3684.5s)]
*  And until Elon, we were not going to live on Mars. Right. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3685.58s)]
*  And so like we didn't have like I think it takes time. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3687.74s)]
*  Yeah. But it doesn't come. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3690.98s)]
*  But also academia is really focused on point solutions, not full systems. Right. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3692.5s)]
*  So if you want to go to Mars or you want to bring back a mammoth, [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3696.2599999999998s)]
*  you have to design the entire system and you have to innovate across everything. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3698.18s)]
*  Whereas in academia, you're you're only incentivized [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3702.1s)]
*  to get that piece of paper and get that approved. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3705.38s)]
*  Well, it's also you're you're dealing with grants [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3707.66s)]
*  and enormous amounts of money that gets donated and given to these institutions. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3710.94s)]
*  Along with a whole ideology, [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3717.9s)]
*  like it's not just as simple as let's follow data. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3721.3s)]
*  It's all got to be attached to this very left leaning, [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3725.74s)]
*  almost preposterous in some aspects ideology. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3730.54s)]
*  And everyone has to say things as a fucking scientist. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3733.38s)]
*  That you know is not true. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3737.66s)]
*  You should just follow the scientific method. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3739.54s)]
*  I'm not saying it, but we should just. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3740.9s)]
*  And guess what? When new data shows up that, you know, changes your old data, [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3742.26s)]
*  you shouldn't get mad about that. You should celebrate it. Exactly. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3747.1s)]
*  Well, also, you have to look at all data, you know, like I don't want to get into this. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3749.3s)]
*  But if you you have academics [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3752.86s)]
*  who are legitimate scientists and have published papers [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3756.18s)]
*  who are telling you that a man can be a woman, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3760.7400000000002s)]
*  and which is fine in terms of like who you are. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3763.26s)]
*  But now when you're having them compete with women in sports, [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3766.38s)]
*  you've entered into nonsense land and you're the person we're counting on [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3769.02s)]
*  to be the most intelligent person on the subject. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3773.78s)]
*  You're trapped by an ideology [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3776.3s)]
*  that you're now ignoring biology in favor of sociology. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3779.86s)]
*  I just wish we could get philosophy. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3784.62s)]
*  We separate like philosophical perspectives from science. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3787.1s)]
*  We do one of the things that we fight about all the time, you know, because [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3789.78s)]
*  it's like once we got the scientists and once we got the money [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3793.8599999999997s)]
*  and once we prove that we are the most advanced, you know, [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3796.7s)]
*  synthetic biology company in the world, once in QTEL, which is a [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3799.8199999999997s)]
*  the funding arm of the CIA and other governments [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3804.02s)]
*  started investing in colossal because of our technologies. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3806.3799999999997s)]
*  And once we started proof points, the last arguments that we have [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3809.74s)]
*  against some of those scientists are philosophical. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3812.9s)]
*  It's right. It's not a mammoth. Right. It's not a direwolf. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3815.22s)]
*  And it's like this concept of speciation is a human construct [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3817.46s)]
*  that we are trying to impose on nature that flows more like a river than a rock. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3821.3799999999997s)]
*  So are they saying that it's not because it didn't come straight from nature. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3825.2999999999997s)]
*  It's something that you've recreated by piecing this together with that. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3829.06s)]
*  Like, what are the genes that you had to use to create a direwolf? [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3832.8599999999997s)]
*  We didn't totally explain this. Yeah. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3836.22s)]
*  So you have CRISPR, you have these gene editing tools, [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3837.8199999999997s)]
*  you have a good sample of DNA. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3840.4599999999996s)]
*  How do you turn that into a wolf? [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3843.54s)]
*  So you map them next to it. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3845.4199999999996s)]
*  And there was a study that came out about [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3847.2599999999998s)]
*  and once again, this goes back to the status quo of scientists, of academic scientists. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3850.06s)]
*  There was a paper that came out a few years ago [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3854.7799999999997s)]
*  because they didn't have much data. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3857.9s)]
*  They said that direwolves were close related, weren't closer related to wolves. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3859.58s)]
*  They were close related to jackals. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3864.02s)]
*  And that's because at the time, they only had point one five percent of the genome. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3865.54s)]
*  They just didn't have all the data. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3869.58s)]
*  There's not a negative. They just didn't have all the data. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3870.54s)]
*  Now we know that they actually were close related to wolves [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3872.38s)]
*  because we have more data. Which wolves? [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3874.66s)]
*  Gray wolves or the precursor to gray wolves. Right. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3876.94s)]
*  So so they were closer to to to the wolf ancestry line [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3879.62s)]
*  and kind of the broader canid group and family group. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3883.7s)]
*  And so what we found is once you do that, we start looking at all these genes [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3886.2599999999998s)]
*  and we start to understand what the difference is. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3890.3399999999997s)]
*  And we start to see that in certain parts of the genome that are responsible for size, [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3892.06s)]
*  for muscle, for craniofacial, that there's differences. Right. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3897.02s)]
*  So we can start to map and say, OK, where are the differences between gray wolves [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3899.8599999999997s)]
*  and where are the differences between gray wolves and direwolves? [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3903.66s)]
*  And then with those, we have a lot of different tools that we can then go use. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3905.7799999999997s)]
*  To make those changes from the direwolves in a gray wolf cell line. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3909.58s)]
*  And so and then once you do that process, we didn't talk about this earlier. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3913.38s)]
*  You do the same process called somatic cell nuclear transfer, [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3916.94s)]
*  which is effectively cloning, where you take the nucleus of one cell. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3920.06s)]
*  You put that into another egg cell. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3924.66s)]
*  And then you take that embryo and you insert it into a surrogate. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3927.62s)]
*  And is this a 100 percent direwolf or is this a new thing? [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3931.7000000000003s)]
*  So this is so this goes into the philosophical thing. Right. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3936.38s)]
*  So if you look at speciation, right, there's basically the scientists [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3939.02s)]
*  don't agree on how you classify a species. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3942.5s)]
*  So you've got certain people that will say, well, if a species [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3944.34s)]
*  is dictated by something that can't breed, that's literally a definition. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3948.1s)]
*  Like if this animal can't read with this animal, then that's its own species. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3951.14s)]
*  Then you have other people. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3954.86s)]
*  You have the paleontologist and some of them love us like Kenneth Lacovara, [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3956.14s)]
*  who's arguably the number one paleontologist in the world that loves us. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3959.98s)]
*  But then you have other paleontologists who just hate us. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3962.42s)]
*  And they do it based solely on tooth morphology, because they argue [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3964.58s)]
*  that's the only thing that is going to be persistent over time. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3967.26s)]
*  And I asked a paleontologist recently that hates us. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3969.98s)]
*  I said, if I made a mammoth with like that was giant with like [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3973.0600000000004s)]
*  pink, curly fur and it had the right tooth morphology, [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3977.26s)]
*  you're saying that based on your scientific papers, that you would say [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3981.1000000000004s)]
*  that's a mammoth. And she's like. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3984.3s)]
*  Yes, but that doesn't matter. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3987.3s)]
*  And I'm like, well, it's so so. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3988.5800000000004s)]
*  But then you have to hate you guys. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3990.38s)]
*  Because why does anyone, you know, anytime you do anything in this world now, [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3992.1000000000004s)]
*  that's like moderately bold or polarizing people give you pushback? [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=3996.82s)]
*  But this is heavily bold. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4000.82s)]
*  I wouldn't say this is moderately bold. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4002.34s)]
*  You made three fucking direwolves. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4003.82s)]
*  That's not moderately bold. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4005.94s)]
*  It's really kind of one of the craziest things that a human being's ever done. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4007.86s)]
*  It's definitely in the realm. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4010.78s)]
*  This is right up there with inventing the Internet. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4012.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. So when you see it well, and we have more stuff to come that. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4014.5s)]
*  Yeah, I know. I think equally interesting. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4017.82s)]
*  There's people out there. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4021.46s)]
*  Did you worry that someone is going to get, you know, [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4022.38s)]
*  because this falls into religious realms? [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4026.1800000000003s)]
*  Well, it's there's philosophical and religious. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4030.94s)]
*  And so like back on speciation, you know, polar bears and brown bears [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4033.46s)]
*  are two different species. Right. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4037.1800000000003s)]
*  But they may produce five offspring all the time. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4038.46s)]
*  And a bear expert will tell you that a polar bear is just a coal aquatic [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4040.7000000000003s)]
*  adapted, cold adapted bear. Right. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4045.1000000000004s)]
*  And so I always ask people that they're their offspring or they can have children. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4047.6600000000003s)]
*  Yes. Yes. It's not like a donkey. Yeah, exactly. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4052.26s)]
*  So there's different ways to characterize it. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4055.42s)]
*  Making a mule. Yeah. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4057.5s)]
*  But there's different ways to say something or something. Right. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4058.5s)]
*  And so, you know, we are not the same. Right. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4060.58s)]
*  If I don't know what percent you probably from 23 and me or something [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4062.9s)]
*  have some percentage Neanderthal, you don't say that you're an ad mixture [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4065.7000000000003s)]
*  or a hybrid, you just say you're human. You don't you don't really. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4069.38s)]
*  But that's a good point, though, because Neanderthal, [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4072.06s)]
*  if you want to talk about a different species just because they could [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4074.86s)]
*  breed with us, God, they're so different. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4078.06s)]
*  But that's it. But like I said, there's six different ways. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4079.7000000000003s)]
*  There's actually a species definition that's based solely on geographics. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4082.06s)]
*  And there's a funny paper out there around one species of toad [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4085.2999999999997s)]
*  that they built a road through. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4090.06s)]
*  And the same toads live on both on two sides of the street. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4091.58s)]
*  And they're different species. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4094.62s)]
*  And they're the same fucking toad. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4096.46s)]
*  Just because there's a road. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4098.0599999999995s)]
*  Just because because we as humans change. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4099.42s)]
*  It's called geographic isolation of speciation. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4102.82s)]
*  So it's just crazy. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4104.62s)]
*  And so so the only arguments that we now have is, but is it a mammoth? [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4105.82s)]
*  And it's like, well, then don't call it a mammoth. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4109.7s)]
*  You I was like, I asked people, did you see Jurassic Park? [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4110.86s)]
*  And they're like, yeah. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4113.34s)]
*  I was like, what was my draft part? [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4114.78s)]
*  What was to your quiet? [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4115.86s)]
*  What do you think? What was Jurassic Park about to you? [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4116.98s)]
*  When you see me? Yeah. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4119.7s)]
*  If you're like if you're going to take your kids to see Jurassic Park, [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4120.58s)]
*  what is the movie about dinosaurs? [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4122.62s)]
*  Is it because they took ancient DNA and they mix it with a bunch of other stuff? [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4125.179999999999s)]
*  Are they dinosaurs or are they or they genetically modified animals, GMOs, [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4129.0599999999995s)]
*  genetically modified organisms that have inserted genes [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4134.3s)]
*  from lots of different things or the dinosaurs? [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4136.78s)]
*  If they serve the ecological function, this is what's called functional extinction. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4139.139999999999s)]
*  If they serve the ecological function and they have the loss, [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4142.94s)]
*  biodiversity and phenotypes that made that animal unique, [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4145.58s)]
*  like the polar bear and a bear, they're just that animal. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4148.46s)]
*  So these goes into this starts the whole religious and philosophical debates [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4151.42s)]
*  where it's funny because the scientists who should not fall into these [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4155.78s)]
*  philosophical debates when they don't like what you're doing, [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4158.82s)]
*  that's where they go to. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4161.5s)]
*  So what was the argument? How did they present it? [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4162.62s)]
*  It's just like it's by their own definition. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4165.5s)]
*  They're like, well, it doesn't have enough DNA. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4168.5s)]
*  So I was like, so if I said, but the second dire wolf that we have, [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4170.66s)]
*  the second genome that we have from the tooth has is has less of the same DNA [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4174.5s)]
*  than the skull. Does that mean that it wasn't a dire wolf? [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4179.9s)]
*  And it just turns into an you're missing the point conversation. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4182.38s)]
*  It's like, I'm just asking questions. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4185.7s)]
*  I would like to know the point, though. What is their point? [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4186.78s)]
*  What is what is she? What is her overall argument? [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4189.14s)]
*  The general point of the people is that they want to pick one speciation [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4191.38s)]
*  definition and adhere us to that. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4195.78s)]
*  And if you do that, no animal, including our animals, will fall into one species. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4197.94s)]
*  Right. It's just people that are using the framework that they set [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4201.78s)]
*  that doesn't isn't consistent kind of against the there are based on the argument [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4206.0599999999995s)]
*  that they want to make. Interesting. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4209.82s)]
*  So species is just something. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4211.0199999999995s)]
*  It's a human construct. It's not. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4213.3s)]
*  And it's just a thing if it can breed with another thing. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4215.46s)]
*  Well, I mean, that's that is one definition. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4218.46s)]
*  There is another definition saying that it's only a species [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4220.5s)]
*  if it can't breed with another thing. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4222.9s)]
*  So if I genetically modify them to make it where they can't breed with wolves, [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4224.5s)]
*  does that mean they're now they're on? [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4227.66s)]
*  It just gets into this dumb philosophical perspective [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4229.22s)]
*  because we made up this construct. Right. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4232.34s)]
*  But as a person who studies biology, which this person is right, [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4234.66s)]
*  I kind of understand her perspective where she's like, [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4240.3s)]
*  what are you doing? Like, what are you doing? [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4244.22s)]
*  How is this group of people with a bunch of money and a bunch of eggheads? [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4246.42s)]
*  How are these geniuses allowed to get together, [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4249.66s)]
*  splice some genes up and serve up a dire wolf? [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4253.26s)]
*  I could see it from her perspective. 100 percent. Right. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4256.179999999999s)]
*  But I think that if we don't do big, bold things, it's it's important. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4258.86s)]
*  You know, one of the things we should definitely show is this is just like [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4262.78s)]
*  the guy in Jurassic Park. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4264.98s)]
*  But we should basically the same conversation. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4266.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. But but but John Henry, but John Hammond, [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4268.78s)]
*  I don't think that they were really focused on conservation [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4272.179999999999s)]
*  unless there was a subplot that, you know, didn't make it the final cut. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4274.379999999999s)]
*  No, we actually want to make an attraction. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4278.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. So if we could show the Red Wolf, I think that'd be amazing [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4279.7s)]
*  because all the technologies that we made on the path to bring back [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4282.3s)]
*  the dire wolf, we won make available the conservation. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4286.66s)]
*  Well, let's explain the Red Wolf to people, because you were saying before [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4289.1s)]
*  I didn't even know how few of them there are. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4291.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. So if you go to the one more. Yeah. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4294.14s)]
*  So this is a Red Wolf. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4298.74s)]
*  That's hope. That's the world's first cloned Red Wolf. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4300.14s)]
*  So I've actually made more Red Wolves than I've made dire wolves. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4302.78s)]
*  So I've made four Red Wolves, one female. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4305.18s)]
*  Are you just releasing these fuckers? [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4307.18s)]
*  No, no, they're they're in a they're in an ecological preserve as well. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4308.46s)]
*  And so but you're going to you're going to die when you hear [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4310.94s)]
*  what I went through on this. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4314.26s)]
*  So I found out that, you know, we try to pair every de-extinction project [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4315.34s)]
*  with a species preservation project outside of making all of our technology [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4319.26s)]
*  for free, right? [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4322.7s)]
*  Everything that we make that has an application to conservation, [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4323.86s)]
*  anyone in the world can use to help save animals. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4327.22s)]
*  They don't pay us a dime. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4329.7s)]
*  It's all open source. It's all free. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4330.7s)]
*  We have 48 conservation partners, the team that's running [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4332.7s)]
*  the Northern White Rhino project, where their exclusive genetic rescue partner. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4335.3s)]
*  It doesn't. We're working with elephants in Botswana, working elephants in Kenya. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4338.66s)]
*  So anybody can use our technologies for free, right? [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4342.46s)]
*  We're working on kitchen, a terrible fungus in Australia. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4344.860000000001s)]
*  And so so if that's not enough, I found out that, you know, [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4347.900000000001s)]
*  that there's only 15 of those [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4351.74s)]
*  Red Wolves back in the wild in North Carolina. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4355.14s)]
*  So I met with the upcoming governor. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4357.78s)]
*  Are they in other states as well? [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4359.46s)]
*  No, no. Well, we'll get to that. We'll get that. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4360.58s)]
*  So they're they're only recognized by US Fish and Wildlife there. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4362.58s)]
*  But this incredible woman from Princeton, you know, top of her field, [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4366.82s)]
*  she's one of the top wolf genesis in the world, Bridget Von Holt, [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4370.58s)]
*  identified a population of wolves in Louisiana [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4373.42s)]
*  that have a red wolf like characteristics. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4377.62s)]
*  So she started darting them, taking samples. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4379.66s)]
*  And what she found is they actually have more, quote unquote, red wolf in them [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4381.82s)]
*  than the red wolves that are being identified in in North Carolina. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4385.94s)]
*  And is it part of the problem they're breeding with coyotes? [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4390.5s)]
*  Yeah, but they've all been like these guys, like the ones in North Carolina [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4392.74s)]
*  of all inbred with coyotes. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4396.06s)]
*  All the red wolves have some coyote in them because they look like coyotes. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4397.18s)]
*  Well, because every every. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4400.620000000001s)]
*  Well, the ones in North Carolina even look more like coyotes. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4402.34s)]
*  And yeah, because the reality is every single species is what's called an admixture. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4405.02s)]
*  They're all we are. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4409.14s)]
*  Everything is inbreeding with everything on some level. Right. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4409.860000000001s)]
*  And so everything in life is an admixture. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4413.02s)]
*  Nothing goes back to the Neanderthal. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4415.700000000001s)]
*  So this binary idea that we have is silly. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4417.820000000001s)]
*  It's no it's it's a human cause construct. Right. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4420.18s)]
*  And they it's insane. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4422.820000000001s)]
*  So so I went to some folks from the last administration. Right. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4425.34s)]
*  And and I took some data with me and I said, hey, we really want to help this [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4429.700000000001s)]
*  red wolf program. We don't need any money. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4433.9400000000005s)]
*  We open source all of our technologies. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4435.620000000001s)]
*  And we've we've used a technology that's noninvasive for cloning [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4437.18s)]
*  where we actually take a vial of blood. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4441.9400000000005s)]
*  We isolate what's called endothelial progenitor cells, basically the [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4444.46s)]
*  the inner lining of your blood vessel, right, because there's no nucleus in blood cells. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4448.14s)]
*  So we catch those. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4451.860000000001s)]
*  And when we catch those, we then isolate them, we grow them and we clone from them. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4453.46s)]
*  Right. Which is amazing, because if you think about typical cloning from an animal [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4459.14s)]
*  welfare perspective, a lot of times you have to anesthetize the animal. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4462.66s)]
*  You have to take ear punches, skin biopsies. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4465.78s)]
*  It's actually pretty it's pretty invasive. Terrible process to do cloning. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4468.54s)]
*  We can simply do it. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4471.82s)]
*  Every single zoo takes blood from their animals to check certain levels and what not. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4472.82s)]
*  We give blood all the time. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4476.86s)]
*  And so it's a very noninvasive. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4478.22s)]
*  It's about as noninvasive as you can get. Right. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4479.74s)]
*  And so we found a way which we've which we're open sourcing on Tuesday [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4482.3s)]
*  is open sourcing this model of how you go clone from blood, [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4485.580000000001s)]
*  which is a game changer for biobanking, because now you don't have to go [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4490.18s)]
*  hurt an animal, take pieces of the animal, anesthetize the animal. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4494.02s)]
*  We can just take bloods and put them in freezers and be able to bring them back [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4496.54s)]
*  or clone them if there's a lack of genetic diversity using this thing. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4499.780000000001s)]
*  So I went out to Washington with my team. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4503.22s)]
*  I showed them showed them hope as a baby and little videos of [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4505.740000000001s)]
*  and you may have videos of hope, Jamie. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4509.7s)]
*  I don't know if it's in the folder. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4511.9800000000005s)]
*  It showed videos of hope. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4513.46s)]
*  And I said, hey, you know, there's there's only a handful of that. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4514.58s)]
*  We made these four walls from three different genetic lines. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4517.74s)]
*  We made these from we made these from three different genetic lines. Right. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4521.74s)]
*  So there's actually more genetic diversity in these wolves [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4525.94s)]
*  than what's alive in the population. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4529.34s)]
*  And we said we'd like for you to help protect the work [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4531.9800000000005s)]
*  that's being done in Louisiana. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4536.02s)]
*  And then how many wolves would you like us to make using that population [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4537.46s)]
*  as well as frozen samples that are dead? [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4541.22s)]
*  And we'll just give them to you. There's no cost. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4543.26s)]
*  Here was the feedback. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4545.62s)]
*  We need to spend five to six years on an internal study [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4547.7s)]
*  and spend twenty two million dollars to see if it's possible to clone wolves. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4550.94s)]
*  And I was I was blown away. I was like, oh, I'm so sorry. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4553.9800000000005s)]
*  I wasn't very clear. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4556.54s)]
*  This is a cloned wolf. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4557.66s)]
*  Like here is you can fly with me to the preserve. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4559.1s)]
*  You sign in, David, you fly me. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4561.1s)]
*  And they're like, we need to spend five to six years [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4562.94s)]
*  and 20 plus million dollars to go to go understand this, [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4566.78s)]
*  to understand the positive. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4569.98s)]
*  We'll give you all of the technology. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4571.0199999999995s)]
*  And if you tell me you want 100 wolves, I'll just make you 100 wolves. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4572.94s)]
*  And we'll even we'll even engineer in more genetic diversity for you. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4575.66s)]
*  And the response was, we'll get back to you. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4580.54s)]
*  We went to we tried to have three other meetings, no showed and canceled [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4583.259999999999s)]
*  every time when we play there. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4586.54s)]
*  I just got back from a meeting with the Department of Interior, [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4588.0199999999995s)]
*  which Fish and Wildlife roles rolls up to. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4590.78s)]
*  And they're very, very focused on, you know, innovation, not regulation, [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4592.82s)]
*  which has been pretty amazing. That's great. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4596.099999999999s)]
*  And immediately they said, we celebrate. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4598.219999999999s)]
*  Doug Burgum, the secretary of interior there who we met with said, [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4601.82s)]
*  we celebrate he's a huge conservationist, huge Teddy Roosevelt guy, [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4605.78s)]
*  member of the Explorers Club. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4608.86s)]
*  And he's like that we do not have a celebration [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4610.179999999999s)]
*  when animals come off the endangered species list. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4613.94s)]
*  Only about three percent ever come off. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4616.259999999999s)]
*  And we're really good at putting them on and we celebrate putting them on. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4617.78s)]
*  So we have to do something about this. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4620.7s)]
*  And if you're saying that we could productionize species [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4622.46s)]
*  and as long as we have the right support to rewild them, [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4625.74s)]
*  people can use your technologies for free to make more of these different species [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4628.78s)]
*  that are critically endangered while also bio banking the samples along the way. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4632.22s)]
*  He's like, why wouldn't we do this? And I was like. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4636.22s)]
*  Why about the previous folks? [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4638.94s)]
*  And they said that we need, you know, five years and 20 million that they [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4640.42s)]
*  they were to spend internally, they were going to be asked to do the feasibility. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4643.86s)]
*  So they were going to spend it internally on this. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4646.02s)]
*  And we're like, we'll just do it for free. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4648.66s)]
*  And he's like, we will completely support the initiative [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4650.42s)]
*  and we're going to help get you plugged in so you can help bio bank [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4653.54s)]
*  our species and also help us support, you know, Red Wolf conservation. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4656.42s)]
*  So when will you start reintroducing these? [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4659.86s)]
*  So we just had that meeting. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4662.06s)]
*  Solus Red Wolves from Hell. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4663.38s)]
*  You've created a lab. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4667.54s)]
*  They're going to start eating people. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4668.7s)]
*  And so we're going to get to spend with them last week. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4670.5s)]
*  Well, it's it's they're beautiful. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4673.66s)]
*  God, they're so beautiful. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4675.66s)]
*  Which is it's like why we shouldn't be afraid of innovation, right? [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4676.58s)]
*  No, but you know, the real question is, where do you stop? [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4679.42s)]
*  Yeah, because 90 what percent of all animals that have ever existed, [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4682.66s)]
*  all species are extinct. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4687.22s)]
*  Yeah. Are we going to I think you focus on the species [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4688.78s)]
*  that are critically endangered and our keystone species [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4693.1s)]
*  mean the environment needs them. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4696.5s)]
*  Right. But the ones that we drove back, but the ones that we drove to extinction. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4697.66s)]
*  Right. OK. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4701.66s)]
*  So it's debatable whether or not we drove dire wolves to extinction. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4702.66s)]
*  We don't really know what happened 10,000 years ago. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4706.1s)]
*  I'm inclined to think that when you see the death of 65 percent [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4708.3s)]
*  of North American megafauna that happened really quickly, really quickly. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4712.58s)]
*  Yeah, I'm I'm inclined to think that these scientists [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4716.34s)]
*  that believe it was an asteroid or a common impact are correct. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4719.3s)]
*  I think I think it's a I think it's most likely it's a combination. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4722.18s)]
*  We do know that when early that anthropologic effects from humans, [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4725.42s)]
*  that when early man went onto onto a landmass at scale, [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4729.42s)]
*  that that we start to see that we see that in Australia and other places. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4734.34s)]
*  But it's but to your point, it's much slower. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4737.54s)]
*  It's much, much slower. This is a different thing. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4739.54s)]
*  Yeah. Are you going to bring back saber tooth tigers? [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4741.14s)]
*  We so we get everyone seems to have their favorite animal for us to save. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4743.9800000000005s)]
*  Right. Like the I was my favorite. Yeah. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4748.06s)]
*  That was my favorite. Yeah. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4750.02s)]
*  Dire wolves. You got to come maybe at some point you see them. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4751.3s)]
*  But I want to. They're amazing. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4754.18s)]
*  I mean, they're they're they're just beautiful animals. Yeah. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4756.42s)]
*  So we they're in there. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4759.14s)]
*  So saber saber tooth tiger is a class of we put that as a class. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4762.3s)]
*  Most commonly, people think of the smile it on as the saber tooth tiger. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4766.38s)]
*  There's not to date been a really great smile on DNA. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4770.26s)]
*  There is great home of theorem DNA, which is another [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4774.22s)]
*  type of saber tooth. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4777.9800000000005s)]
*  Oh, I didn't know there was more than one type of saber tooth. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4778.9800000000005s)]
*  How many they classify them differently, you know, based on it. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4781.1s)]
*  But obviously, you've been studying this. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4784.06s)]
*  So you're thinking about doing it. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4785.54s)]
*  I'm not. I mean, we like to study ancient DNA. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4786.860000000001s)]
*  Right. Like, like, you know, one of the things where I think that, [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4790.34s)]
*  you know, John Reeves is 100 percent right is people say [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4793.3s)]
*  there were no saber tooth tigers in Alaska. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4796.740000000001s)]
*  That's just an incorrect statement. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4800.38s)]
*  There were no there were probably no smile it on there. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4801.780000000001s)]
*  But there are home of theorems, which are a saber tooth cat. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4805.14s)]
*  Yeah. He's found things that were not supposed to be. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4808.1s)]
*  I've held things in his eyes. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4810.860000000001s)]
*  I've held the dire wolf skull in his. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4813.54s)]
*  I hope he's fine with me saying that in his facility. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4817.34s)]
*  Yeah, I think he's talked about that. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4821.34s)]
*  But they found cave bear short face bears. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4823.46s)]
*  Wow. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4826.14s)]
*  Yeah. So home of theorem is still a saber tooth cat. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4826.740000000001s)]
*  But what happens is this goes back to that philosophical [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4829.42s)]
*  that philosophical perspective. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4833.34s)]
*  They think that only if you look up smile it on in comparison. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4834.9400000000005s)]
*  So this has shorter saber teeth, but still. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4838.700000000001s)]
*  Give me that CGI image of it again. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4841.34s)]
*  Jamie, the laugh. That's so fucking cool. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4843.3s)]
*  Yeah. And I don't think I don't think you should bring something like that back. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4845.9800000000005s)]
*  But if you do, I'm going to visit it. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4849.3s)]
*  I mean, I want to see that one take down a bite. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4852.26s)]
*  So there was pause. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4854.06s)]
*  There was a I mean, wait, you see the dire wolf. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4855.5s)]
*  But that would be so crazy. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4858.58s)]
*  Now, now all of a sudden, I want you to do it. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4860.46s)]
*  Now, give me another large picture of it, Jamie. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4862.9400000000005s)]
*  There's some other pictures of those. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4864.7s)]
*  So smile it on. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4866.46s)]
*  Is the one has the largest teeth. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4867.3s)]
*  It has the largest known teeth. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4868.66s)]
*  But when people think of saber tooth tiger, this is what. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4872.3s)]
*  That's a crazy is what they think of. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4876.02s)]
*  Those are crazy. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4877.42s)]
*  I wonder why nature wanted to have that. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4878.26s)]
*  I mean, probably having to pierce things like mammoth hides [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4881.139999999999s)]
*  and are quite thick. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4883.3s)]
*  It has to be right. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4884.22s)]
*  Something where you there's a genetic advantage. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4885.18s)]
*  And their jaw hinges. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4887.34s)]
*  Look at that one on the right. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4888.5s)]
*  Lower right, Jamie. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4889.5s)]
*  Below that to blow that to the right to the right. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4891.3s)]
*  Yeah, right there. Click on that. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4894.38s)]
*  Look at that man. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4895.82s)]
*  And I love because we don't you know, it's amazing. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4897.74s)]
*  We don't have the DNA from it. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4901.18s)]
*  So we have no idea what the color pattern is. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4903.0199999999995s)]
*  But you can see here, right? [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4905.62s)]
*  It's like it's got a short tail, so long tail. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4906.58s)]
*  It's got leopard. It's got stripes, right? [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4908.38s)]
*  Right. We don't even know if they had long tail. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4909.86s)]
*  I don't know if they could have been white. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4911.339999999999s)]
*  Wow. That would be wild. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4913.139999999999s)]
*  So we do have there. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4915.78s)]
*  There have been some really well preserved pups and others of in the permafrost of [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4916.82s)]
*  homeotherium. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4922.86s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4924.82s)]
*  Have you ever seen homotherium we know has that kind of coloration to it? [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4925.86s)]
*  We don't. I don't want to say we do or don't. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4929.42s)]
*  We have not done the analysis on that on the other. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4932.86s)]
*  Yeah, look at that little guy. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4935.219999999999s)]
*  We do. We do have the genome of it, though. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4936.5s)]
*  Not that we're going to work on it. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4939.06s)]
*  OK, so that has brown hair. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4940.38s)]
*  Have you seen the have you seen the American short face bear? [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4941.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing I'm probably the most scared of. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4945.58s)]
*  Yeah, you can't bring that 17 or 18 foot giant bear. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4948.860000000001s)]
*  We're not working on it. I'm just saying. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4952.62s)]
*  But somebody might. That's the problem. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4954.02s)]
*  There might be some fucking crackhead out there that's got 40 billion dollars. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4955.62s)]
*  It's out of his mind. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4959.06s)]
*  Well, I also think that like some crazy dude who's just got the resources. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4960.06s)]
*  That's that's that to me is megalodon. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4965.26s)]
*  Scary. That's a man. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4968.22s)]
*  Yeah, land megalodon. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4970.14s)]
*  Well, that's that. Yeah, that is an enormous animal. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4971.62s)]
*  And they think that's one of the animals that probably prevented people [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4973.9800000000005s)]
*  from crossing the Bering Strait more. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4976.740000000001s)]
*  I read that. Yeah. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4979.740000000001s)]
*  It's a theory, but it's a pretty good one. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4981.18s)]
*  If you knew that if you knew there was a lineage of like super, [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4983.740000000001s)]
*  you know, polar bears were out there, I would go near it. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4987.54s)]
*  And it is essentially a super polar bear, [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4990.22s)]
*  which is really scary because polar bears are terrifying and completely carnivorous. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4992.34s)]
*  And they don't care. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4996.58s)]
*  They'll just walk right up to you and kill you. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4997.46s)]
*  Oh, yeah. There's a great video of these guys that are behind a fence. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=4998.82s)]
*  Yeah. That was somebody sent to me yesterday. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5003.82s)]
*  Fuck. I'll find it. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5006.86s)]
*  I know where it is. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5008.38s)]
*  Someone sent to me yesterday of these guys that are right behind a fence [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5009.66s)]
*  where this polar bear is trying to get through the fence. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5013.74s)]
*  There's three of them. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5015.5s)]
*  And they're, you know, they're talking to like, hey, big guy, you can't come in here. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5016.82s)]
*  Hey, fella. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5021.78s)]
*  And it's just calmly walking towards like, I'm going to get in there. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5022.58s)]
*  Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5024.78s)]
*  It's it's very spooky. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5025.82s)]
*  Well, they're spooky because they don't eat anything but meat. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5028.139999999999s)]
*  So we're on the menu. Yeah. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5031.7s)]
*  All humans are on the menu. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5033.299999999999s)]
*  Anything that walks and breathes is on the menu. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5034.7s)]
*  I got it here. Where is it? [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5038.099999999999s)]
*  Shit. It'll take me a few minutes. Sorry, Jamie. Pause for a second. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5039.94s)]
*  Let me find this because it's good. OK. I just sent it to you. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5044.259999999999s)]
*  So it looks like they're in. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5047.86s)]
*  I don't know where they are. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5051.139999999999s)]
*  I think it'll say on the video. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5052.299999999999s)]
*  So these guys here, give me some volume polar bears. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5053.86s)]
*  That's an oil rig. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5057.54s)]
*  So it's probably Canada. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5060.179999999999s)]
*  Look at these guys. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5061.74s)]
*  That's sound. Yeah. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5066.66s)]
*  They're just trying to eat you. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5070.42s)]
*  Look at this. Two more, right? [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5073.62s)]
*  Yeah. Hey. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5075.86s)]
*  Go on. Go on. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5078.86s)]
*  Go on. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5082.34s)]
*  Try not going to work. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5084.1s)]
*  They're just trying to figure out how to get in to eat you. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5085.0599999999995s)]
*  Hey, sweetheart. Hey. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5087.78s)]
*  Sweetheart. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5091.0599999999995s)]
*  Sweetheart wants to rip your liver out. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5092.82s)]
*  Hey. Go on. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5096.18s)]
*  I bet so. Beautiful. They are beautiful. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5098.54s)]
*  It's interesting that they're the most dangerous ones [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5100.42s)]
*  because other ones we use for Coca-Cola and Klondike bars. Yeah. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5102.42s)]
*  And that wild, though, you have them just like playing around in the snow, [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5106.0599999999995s)]
*  but they're actually terrifying. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5108.5s)]
*  Yeah, you were saying the younger Gyrus is really interesting. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5109.46s)]
*  It's very, very interesting because it's a fairly new theory [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5111.7s)]
*  and explains a lot. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5115.82s)]
*  And especially when you look at the the mass extinction [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5116.94s)]
*  that did take place during that time. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5120.06s)]
*  I would love to have seen what it looked like [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5122.06s)]
*  when all those animals were around. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5125.54s)]
*  Like what what was a you know, we kind of have a sense of what [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5127.22s)]
*  because of safaris and videos, we know what it looks like when lions [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5131.3s)]
*  are interacting with wildebeest in Africa. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5134.58s)]
*  Like, what did it look like in Kansas? [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5136.54s)]
*  Like a yeah, like 15,000 years ago. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5138.66s)]
*  Yeah. Like, what was it like? [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5140.9s)]
*  You know, there's a extinct bison species that is the bison [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5142.22s)]
*  lot of France. Have you seen those guys? Yeah. Yeah. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5146.98s)]
*  They're like they're like eight foot long, Texas longhorns. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5149.22s)]
*  Crazy. On like, you know, [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5152.26s)]
*  super HGH like bison. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5154.86s)]
*  Yeah, our bison are small compared to the extinct bison. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5158.22s)]
*  Yeah. Right. Were they the largest of the North American bison? [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5161.38s)]
*  Yeah. The bison lot of France was. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5163.98s)]
*  See if we can get a photo of that. Yeah. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5166.860000000001s)]
*  They're there. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5168.7s)]
*  I didn't know about them until a few years ago. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5169.22s)]
*  Yeah. I didn't even know that was a thing. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5170.820000000001s)]
*  It's I mean, there were so many different things. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5172.7s)]
*  Giant sloths. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5175.06s)]
*  There's the saber toothed tiger, the American lion, which is. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5176.18s)]
*  There's an American cheetah. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5179.26s)]
*  Yes. The American cheetahs. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5180.38s)]
*  You know, we have we actually have a full genome of it. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5181.820000000001s)]
*  And then there was a there was also one of my favorite animals, [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5183.66s)]
*  which is kind of a weird one, probably on the list, [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5187.34s)]
*  since we're talking about dire wolves and saber toothed tigers. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5188.9800000000005s)]
*  Have you seen the stellar sea cow? [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5191.9800000000005s)]
*  No. What is that? [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5193.9400000000005s)]
*  Think of like a manatee or dugong, right? [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5195.42s)]
*  That's the size of like a large whale. What? [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5197.86s)]
*  Yeah. But the sad thing is it died. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5201.34s)]
*  It actually died off before it died off. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5203.9800000000005s)]
*  And yeah, it died off, though, within 100 years of its discovery. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5206.86s)]
*  When was that? [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5211.42s)]
*  Uh, we killed them all. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5212.46s)]
*  Huh? Yeah, we probably turned them into candles or something. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5214.66s)]
*  Yeah. Lipstick burn their fat. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5217.02s)]
*  So but it was actually really hard. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5219.62s)]
*  It's just so much more important. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5221.94s)]
*  Yeah, this Serenian to ever exist is haunted extinction [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5223.179999999999s)]
*  only 30 years after being described in the 18th century. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5227.7s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. And it was. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5231.099999999999s)]
*  And we actually have a fuck. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5232.42s)]
*  We have a full genome of this, too, which is pretty cool. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5233.78s)]
*  You can bring it back. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5235.58s)]
*  We can't just I would bring this back in heartbeat. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5236.42s)]
*  It was hugely important to the kelp forest of the Pacific Northwest. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5239.0199999999995s)]
*  It was great. It's a great. It's not scary. It's huge. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5242.5s)]
*  It's like, right. But then now the remnant of that back. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5245.179999999999s)]
*  Why wouldn't you bring back a megalodon? [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5247.7s)]
*  There is no megalodon DNA. There's none. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5249.58s)]
*  No, I will say that the CEO of the largest [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5251.62s)]
*  the president and CEO of the largest free museum in America [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5257.46s)]
*  really wants me to do the megalodon. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5263.94s)]
*  But he's like, I can never say it publicly. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5266.14s)]
*  I think he just outed him. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5269.26s)]
*  Yeah, but there's a lot of museums. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5270.7s)]
*  I could be wrong on the size. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5272.22s)]
*  Yeah, whatever. He's great, though. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5273.66s)]
*  But there is there is no DNA. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5275.18s)]
*  We have to eat a lot. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5277.099999999999s)]
*  And we already killed everything in the ocean. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5278.14s)]
*  So one of the things that's weird, interesting [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5279.78s)]
*  that we're also working on is artificial wombs at Colossal, [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5281.94s)]
*  because if you want to get to this world where you could productionize [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5284.94s)]
*  endangered species like northern white rhinos, instead of having to use [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5288.9s)]
*  surrogates for an animal welfare perspective, you know, you [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5291.62s)]
*  if you can get to the point that you can engineer genetic diversity into [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5294.34s)]
*  200 northern white rhinos, grow them in labs and bags and then work with [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5297.82s)]
*  and then you can control that population very, very well. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5302.78s)]
*  You can then reintroduce them, you know, with folks in the field [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5305.82s)]
*  that are the rewilding experts. Right. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5309.1s)]
*  And so we were really not focusing on the we kind of rely on third parties [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5311.34s)]
*  on the rewilding modeling and all of our 48 conservation partners. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5315.14s)]
*  We are really just kind of focused on the kind of the core science [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5319.1s)]
*  that supports their initiatives. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5321.660000000001s)]
*  But if if we are successful with our artificial wombs and we are quite [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5323.820000000001s)]
*  we are quite far on that project, that, you know, [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5329.22s)]
*  I would not be surprised if eventually you see a [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5333.06s)]
*  we have to get a mouse first. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5335.9800000000005s)]
*  Have you guys had these conversations where you sit down, you go, [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5337.219999999999s)]
*  how does this scale outward? [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5340.46s)]
*  What does this look like, this technology in a hundred years? [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5341.86s)]
*  Did we just fuck up? [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5344.099999999999s)]
*  No, I think I think that if you look at the birthing crisis [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5345.299999999999s)]
*  that that we're in and kind of population decline prices crisis, [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5348.62s)]
*  I think that you look at global like people having women having kids later, [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5351.86s)]
*  IVF clinics, people freezing their embryos, all of that's massively on on the [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5359.42s)]
*  on the increase. It's all going up to the right. Right. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5366.58s)]
*  And we also know that like globally, like sperm and fertility and others [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5369.139999999999s)]
*  is going down to the right. Right. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5374.259999999999s)]
*  So it's not a good look for the future of humanity in general. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5375.98s)]
*  And so I think, though, you know, especially and then we also have [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5379.66s)]
*  philosophical and you have religious, you have philosophical [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5382.94s)]
*  and then you have social social social issues, right. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5386.86s)]
*  That people have different perspectives on like having kids, having kids, [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5389.9s)]
*  same sex couples, all these things. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5394.18s)]
*  So we at Colossal have kind of made this mandate that we're not going to work [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5396.14s)]
*  on humans, right, because it's just it gets too weird. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5399.3s)]
*  We get asked the Neanderthal and the dinosaur question every fucking day. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5402.1s)]
*  So we're just not going to like bridge that gap. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5405.06s)]
*  What we'll do is spin out those technologies. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5407.5s)]
*  But I do think I do think it is harder to grow a rhino [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5409.660000000001s)]
*  in a artificial womb or exogenous development system than it is a human. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5413.700000000001s)]
*  Not not ethically or through an FDA process, [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5417.700000000001s)]
*  but it is scientifically harder to to gestate some of the animals [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5420.54s)]
*  we're trying to gestate ex utero. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5424.42s)]
*  So I do think that some of those technologies could make it [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5426.34s)]
*  eventually into the human population. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5428.42s)]
*  That's where it gets really weird, right? [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5430.38s)]
*  You could create a child with no mother or father. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5433.14s)]
*  I do think that I think it's about optionality, right? [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5435.900000000001s)]
*  I think that there are certain situations where that would be a blessing. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5438.900000000001s)]
*  You know, I just had my first kid. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5442.54s)]
*  So we, you know, we did not grow in an artificial womb. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5445.26s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean, the people that are skeptical about this stuff, [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5448.66s)]
*  this is what they point to. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5451.46s)]
*  It's like what what is involved in the creation of life? [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5452.7s)]
*  Well, it's been people having sex and then a sperm fertilizes the egg. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5456.58s)]
*  A child is born. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5462.66s)]
*  They raise the child, get some of their behavior characteristics. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5464.58s)]
*  It gets the genetics. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5468.5s)]
*  And then we integrate it into a community. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5470.14s)]
*  And there's but if you could just make life without any of that, [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5472.26s)]
*  like, what is that? [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5476.26s)]
*  That's that you where is that? [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5477.86s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5480.0199999999995s)]
*  Like, no, it's a good it's a great philosophy. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5480.82s)]
*  How much of the child's development is taking place while it's in the mother [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5482.82s)]
*  and in sharing that shared experience, the hormonal cues and what? [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5487.34s)]
*  Yes, I wouldn't have a child that way. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5492.219999999999s)]
*  Right. What if you're making a sociopath? [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5494.58s)]
*  Like, what if you're making a completely because there's no no empathy? [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5496.58s)]
*  There's no connection, no connection. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5500.42s)]
*  Yeah, people, they come out out of the gate. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5501.94s)]
*  Ted Kaczynski all fucked up. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5504.0599999999995s)]
*  Like, really? That's it. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5505.98s)]
*  It's a fair it's a fair point. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5506.98s)]
*  You know, we don't know what the process is while a baby is inside of a woman's body. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5508.339999999999s)]
*  And there's people that are working on this technology specifically for humans. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5512.66s)]
*  Like right now, we're focusing on it for extinct species and endangered animals. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5515.82s)]
*  But what I the question was, when this scales out, [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5519.82s)]
*  yeah, when you scale out 100 years from now, like, what did you just do? [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5522.78s)]
*  Well, I think I mean, my biggest thing that I think would be helpful [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5526.299999999999s)]
*  is if if we had a world where we like if Colossal gets ultimate success, [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5529.86s)]
*  I'd say that we've successfully rewilded animals back into their natural habitat. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5535.099999999999s)]
*  We've revived revitalized these mosaic ecosystems that, you know, [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5539.139999999999s)]
*  including your picture of what did the Arctic look like back in the day? [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5543.5s)]
*  Like, how do we have that? [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5547.5s)]
*  Because that was actually a crazy. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5548.38s)]
*  If you look at the work that's been done in Pleistocene Park by Sergey Nikita Zimov, [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5550.74s)]
*  they've actually shown that rewilding northern Siberia [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5554.94s)]
*  with coal tolerant megafauna actually can revitalize the ecosystem. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5558.58s)]
*  It can add more biodiversity. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5563.46s)]
*  It can actually keep the ground temperatures colder in the winter. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5565.42s)]
*  So it sequesters more carbon. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5569.58s)]
*  So I think this this idea of nature based [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5571.14s)]
*  and living with nature in a in an ecological model is something that, [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5574.3s)]
*  you know, I hope that we are successful at. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5579.38s)]
*  And I hope that, you know, colossal is also successful at, you know, [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5581.26s)]
*  removing animals from the the endangered species list. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5584.3s)]
*  So what you were talking about, you were talking about mammoths [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5587.5s)]
*  specifically, the study that showed that it would help. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5589.66s)]
*  But they've already done it with like [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5592.38s)]
*  muskox, horses and a few other species up there. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5595.02s)]
*  So they're doing it. They're doing it right now. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5597.860000000001s)]
*  There's they've been doing it for over 20 years. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5599.02s)]
*  And there was some talk about eventually doing this with mammoths [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5601.780000000001s)]
*  and then releasing those mammoths into Siberia. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5607.1s)]
*  Yeah, that was one of that was something that that Larry or that that [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5609.34s)]
*  Sergey Nikita Zimov wanted to do. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5614.62s)]
*  How long from some Russian oligarch hunts a mammoth? [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5616.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, given the geopolitics, [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5619.9400000000005s)]
*  you know, we see going back to your wolf example, [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5622.1s)]
*  we see boundaries and geopolitical lines, right? [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5625.740000000001s)]
*  The animals don't. Right. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5628.900000000001s)]
*  And so we will probably not rewild our first mammoth in Siberia for many reasons. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5630.34s)]
*  But you think you will rewild the mammoth? Yeah, I think, you know, our goal, [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5636.26s)]
*  like not to if you like if, Jamie, if you look at colossal dot com [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5640.06s)]
*  Ford slash Tasmania, for example, we actually build working groups [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5644.780000000001s)]
*  with folks around like everyone from academia to private landowners, [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5648.58s)]
*  to indigenous people, groups, governments to understand like, [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5653.0199999999995s)]
*  like we don't have a thylacine. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5657.14s)]
*  We I think we'll have a thylacine in the next eight years. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5659.0599999999995s)]
*  I really do. I think based on where we are, our current course of speed, [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5661.74s)]
*  there's 70 million years of genetic divergence between a fat tailed [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5664.7s)]
*  dunnart, which is like a mouse sized marsupial and a wolf in this. Right. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5667.82s)]
*  But we actually if you just kind of scroll through into the people. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5673.74s)]
*  So it's a wolf like marsupial. Yeah. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5676.62s)]
*  Does it actually have a pouch that it does? [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5678.82s)]
*  It actually also has a backward pouch. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5680.58s)]
*  So most most pouches, other than like the wombat are forward facing [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5682.7s)]
*  is backwards, because it was they think because it was a burrowing burrowing. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5688.14s)]
*  So that's where you were. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5692.0199999999995s)]
*  I just babies. Yeah. Like that. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5692.74s)]
*  We get them. But nature's fascinating. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5694.26s)]
*  If you scroll down a little bit further, you'll see. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5696.62s)]
*  And just like if you just do a quick scroll, you'll see that we actually [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5699.14s)]
*  have gone out and partnered with all these different groups, [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5702.82s)]
*  even though we don't have phylo scenes. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5706.22s)]
*  We have quarterly meetings in Tasmania around rewilding the thylacine with [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5707.22s)]
*  in one of the groups that we have involved in is the Logging Commission. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5712.9400000000005s)]
*  Going back to your you know, how does how do we live with nature? [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5716.860000000001s)]
*  Kind of like with your example, with the cattlemen and the ranchers. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5719.860000000001s)]
*  Well, the biggest economic driver right now in in Tasmania [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5722.06s)]
*  is actually the Logging Commission. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5726.860000000001s)]
*  So if you think that you're going to reintroduce an animal back [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5730.62s)]
*  without them or their lobbyists having a into the forest [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5733.74s)]
*  without them having a perspective, then I think that's just a naive [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5737.139999999999s)]
*  way to look at the world. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5740.86s)]
*  And so we going back like the thylacine and mammoths and others, [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5742.099999999999s)]
*  we try to build these working groups in ahead of time [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5746.179999999999s)]
*  so that people can get excited about, you know, you know, what are the challenges? [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5749.54s)]
*  What are the unintended consequences? [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5753.7s)]
*  And that's not our job to persuade them. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5755.42s)]
*  It's just our job to kind of listen to them and then figure it out. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5757.3s)]
*  And, you know, that that approach of like listening to our critics [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5760.0599999999995s)]
*  and listening and being inclusive in these communities has helped us, [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5763.54s)]
*  I think, dramatically think through what our rewilding strategies are. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5766.94s)]
*  So when you have a rewilding strategy, [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5770.34s)]
*  what experts do you bring in to have this discussion of what kind of an impact [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5772.98s)]
*  this could be? You haven't done any rewilding, which be clear to everybody. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5778.18s)]
*  Yes. They're not releasing dire wolves. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5781.1s)]
*  And the woolly mice are not getting released. Right. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5783.0199999999995s)]
*  Yes. So this is all theoretically. Yes. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5785.22s)]
*  But if you do have one, what would be the what would you look at specifically? [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5787.3s)]
*  How do you take into account all the different species? [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5792.86s)]
*  The do you take into account, like with the thylacine, [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5796.18s)]
*  particularly because it's a large predator, the amount of animals it's going to eat. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5799.0199999999995s)]
*  Right. These animals are not conditioned. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5802.62s)]
*  They haven't evolved to be around this thing. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5805.74s)]
*  It's been almost 100 years since the last one was there. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5807.82s)]
*  So on the evolve part, this is actually kind of weird. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5811.139999999999s)]
*  So you do ecological field studies. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5813.18s)]
*  So you work with ecologists, conservationists, predator experts, [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5815.38s)]
*  like people that understand predation, people that understand the land. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5820.42s)]
*  So you have to work with these kind of big working groups. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5823.3s)]
*  We have a project going on right now in central Tasmania, which is amazing. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5825.34s)]
*  And this, you know, the old school, like Looney Tunes, like like Wiley Coyote, [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5828.9400000000005s)]
*  where he's like, he like goes through a wall and there's like a whole or the Kool-Aid man. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5833.02s)]
*  Right. Well, if you had that cut out, we made a cut. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5836.3s)]
*  We made cutouts and painted them of thylacines, but also of cats and dogs [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5839.9800000000005s)]
*  and other things and wolves and other things. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5843.9800000000005s)]
*  And we put them out in your camera traps in central Tasmania. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5845.82s)]
*  And when we've reviewed the data, you'll have like a call or a wombat [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5849.419999999999s)]
*  or one of these animals kind of walking through or even a wallaby kind of walking through. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5854.419999999999s)]
*  And they'll see a cat. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5858.0199999999995s)]
*  They'll see a cat on the count. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5859.139999999999s)]
*  Look at it when they see. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5860.0599999999995s)]
*  And remember, to your point, this hundreds of this is for them is multiple generations. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5861.299999999999s)]
*  Right. Because these animals don't live hundreds of years. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5865.58s)]
*  And so when they see the cutout and shape and the coloration and size of a thylacine, [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5867.58s)]
*  they freeze and they absolutely freak out. Wow. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5873.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah. So we have we've been collecting this data for 18 months. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5876.86s)]
*  We're publishing a paper on it. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5880.0199999999995s)]
*  That is so cool. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5881.219999999999s)]
*  There's there's like generational trauma. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5882.82s)]
*  Yeah. That is baked in to their DNA to avoid a thylacine. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5885.74s)]
*  That's the only way they survive. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5890.219999999999s)]
*  I mean, without a language to pass down information, how would. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5891.82s)]
*  Yeah. You know, it makes you wonder like how much of that is in us. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5895.34s)]
*  Like what when people have a phideophobia, you know, or arachnophobia, [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5898.82s)]
*  fear of snakes and spiders. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5903.38s)]
*  Like, what is that from? [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5904.58s)]
*  Because it's crippling. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5905.9800000000005s)]
*  I've seen people that have crippling fear of spiders where it doesn't even make any sense. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5906.900000000001s)]
*  Well, they probably somebody got almost killed by a spider. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5910.9800000000005s)]
*  And that's inside of them. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5915.54s)]
*  Right. Those genes passed on. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5917.14s)]
*  And then you see, yeah, they freak out. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5919.860000000001s)]
*  And we when I was doing Fear Factor, we had if we found out that someone had a fear [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5922.62s)]
*  of spiders or fears of snakes, guess what? [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5926.820000000001s)]
*  That was on the show. That's on the show. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=5928.900000000001s)]

*  When you see something like the one that happened in Canada [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6002.38s)]
*  where the plane flipped upside down to you just like that, [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6004.86s)]

*  and I don't eat the chickens that I have. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6097.66s)]
*  I eat their eggs. Yeah. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6099.5s)]
*  But they're cute. I'm like, hey, girls. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6100.62s)]
*  What's up, ladies? Yeah. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6102.42s)]
*  I have no desire to harm them. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6103.74s)]
*  I try to protect them. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6105.38s)]
*  If I'm driving on the driveway and one of them is in the middle of the drive, [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6106.9400000000005s)]
*  I have to be very slow and let her cross. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6109.7s)]
*  And but I eat chicken. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6112.1s)]
*  Did you see that study that came out a couple weeks ago that having two eggs? [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6114.18s)]
*  I'm going to get the numbers wrong, but you have two eggs. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6119.78s)]
*  If you have at least two eggs a week, [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6122.02s)]
*  then it lowers the probability of Alzheimer's by like 47 percent. Yeah. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6124.1s)]
*  It turns out Alzheimer's connected to a lot of stuff that's information. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6128.14s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6131.9800000000005s)]
*  They're saying that Gary said it was [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6133.62s)]
*  I think it was Gary that was telling me that he thought it was like [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6137.34s)]
*  it's now becoming a more popular belief that it's diabetes type three. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6139.740000000001s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I've heard that. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6144.26s)]
*  Which is really weird to think of it that way. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6146.3s)]
*  But it's just so much. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6149.38s)]
*  I mean, obviously, you know this now because you're on a health path. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6151.22s)]
*  Yeah. You know, and you feel much better. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6154.1s)]

*  Well, I was. I was. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6160.46s)]
*  I mean, part of the reason I started colossal. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6161.7s)]
*  I mean, I told you the story about how I got with George. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6163.54s)]
*  But before that, I built a handful of different technology companies. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6166.5s)]
*  My last company was a satellite software and defense company [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6170.7s)]
*  and was building it, running it. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6173.22s)]
*  And this was in early late 2019, early 2020. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6175.54s)]
*  I had to be in Tokyo and I'd be in Shanghai. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6180.54s)]
*  So I came back. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6182.46s)]
*  I went to CES, the big consumer electronic show in Vegas. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6183.42s)]
*  Saw everyone in the world, right? [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6186.38s)]
*  That's there because it's stupid big week and a half later. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6187.66s)]
*  I'm in NASA Marshall with the director there [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6191.3s)]
*  because we're doing some work for NASA at the time of my last company. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6194.9400000000005s)]
*  And I was with one of my number two, my number two of the company. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6197.3s)]
*  This guy named Greg, who's our chief strategy officer. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6200.9800000000005s)]
*  We he was coughing. He wasn't feeling well. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6203.34s)]
*  We both were kind of feeling like shit. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6204.9400000000005s)]
*  I was like, oh, we've been on the road a lot. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6205.900000000001s)]
*  We've been drinking. We came back on a Friday. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6206.9400000000005s)]
*  On Friday night, we had we were going back on slack [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6209.820000000001s)]
*  around talking about aliens and shit. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6211.900000000001s)]
*  And then the next day, I got a call from his wife that he had a sudden cardiac event. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6213.58s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. And so that for me was a big wake up call [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6217.42s)]
*  because I got really sick during Covid. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6220.74s)]
*  Like I was on that early strain of Covid. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6222.5s)]
*  And there's definitely multiple strains. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6225.099999999999s)]
*  I don't care what anyone tells you. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6226.219999999999s)]
*  There's definitely multiple things that came out of the thing. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6227.5s)]
*  And and so I got super, super sick. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6230.34s)]
*  And, you know, I now rarely drink. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6234.139999999999s)]
*  I rarely have caffeine. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6237.3s)]
*  You know, I've kind of tried to cut out some exercise regularly [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6239.0199999999995s)]
*  and looking at all these things that people think are weird [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6242.42s)]
*  or that used to be weird or alternative, like, you know, a dry sauna, [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6244.54s)]

*  Yeah. Lifting weights on a regiment. Everything. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6255.42s)]
*  That's so important. Yeah. So important. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6257.62s)]
*  And I tell people it's not even a vanity thing. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6259.58s)]
*  Don't do it because you want big muscles. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6262.0199999999995s)]
*  Preserve your tissue. Yeah. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6263.78s)]
*  Reserve your bone mass. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6265.18s)]
*  Well, I mean, I don't want to be like I now have a nine month old son. Right. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6266.34s)]
*  And he like wants to hang out. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6269.42s)]
*  And, you know, he's going to get bigger. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6270.58s)]
*  And if I can't pick him up, that's a sad day. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6272.98s)]
*  You know, and I've kind of gotten this mindset of like, you know, [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6275.9s)]
*  I see people that are older that are in wheelchairs or can't walk. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6279.780000000001s)]
*  It's kind of a blessing to walk. It is. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6282.900000000001s)]
*  So like, why why would I squander that blessing? [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6285.26s)]
*  Why would I not like lean into it and make sure that when I'm 90, I can walk? [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6288.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's a blessing to be healthy. It's a blessing. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6292.42s)]
*  I mean, it's just we're we're so concerned about our day to day existence. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6294.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. We lose track of this big picture. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6298.9400000000005s)]
*  You have the opportunity to do something that if it wasn't possible, [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6301.740000000001s)]
*  you would wish it was possible. And that is get healthier. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6307.62s)]
*  Like if it wasn't possible, if we just existed in a state [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6310.22s)]
*  and whatever that state was, there's no medicine that could fix it. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6313.54s)]
*  There's no exercise that could fix it. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6316.06s)]
*  Diet doesn't change it. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6317.38s)]
*  This is just who you are as a being. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6318.700000000001s)]
*  And it goes away. But that's not even remotely true. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6321.02s)]
*  It's actually the opposite. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6323.900000000001s)]
*  There's there's friends that I have that are my age and they look like they're my dad. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6325.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And that's that's because they've been drinking and smoking and [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6329.860000000001s)]
*  sleeping late and fucking off their whole life and no exercise at all. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6334.54s)]
*  And your body deteriorates. Yeah. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6338.54s)]
*  And I'm not like I'm on the journey. I'm not at the end. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6340.02s)]
*  Right. It is a constant journey. I'm on the journey. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6342.900000000001s)]
*  We're all on the. But like, there's no end. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6344.860000000001s)]
*  I started working with Gary. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6346.620000000001s)]
*  Like I did. Have you seen this function test? [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6347.780000000001s)]
*  Have you done the function test? What is the function? [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6350.14s)]
*  It's like function health. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6352.1s)]
*  It's like a it's just a suit. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6353.46s)]
*  It's just all if you go to your doctor, like I do quarterly blood work. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6354.900000000001s)]
*  But then I also then do this, the function test, which is a massively [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6358.02s)]
*  all encompassing type of blood. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6362.38s)]
*  It's like two tests twice a year. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6363.82s)]
*  And so I do that test. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6365.74s)]
*  And after working with Gary for a while, [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6368.179999999999s)]
*  you know, now my my biological age or my actual age is 43. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6371.54s)]
*  My my biological age is 35. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6375.66s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6378.179999999999s)]
*  But it's just been working for a year with with Gary taking the right supplements, [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6378.9s)]
*  getting the right routine, giving myself nutrients. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6382.219999999999s)]
*  You know, I buy and you can actually taste a difference, right? [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6384.7s)]
*  If you go to a store and get a steak or chicken [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6387.54s)]
*  and even if it's like free range and all that shit, it tastes great. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6390.38s)]
*  It tastes better than like something that you buy. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6395.34s)]
*  Just that's that's terrible at a store. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6396.94s)]
*  But when you order from some of these like true, like Amish places [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6399.139999999999s)]
*  and in places that have actually like grown the food, like completely natural, [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6403.74s)]
*  that is doesn't have just a fake pre-purchased certified organic, [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6408.26s)]
*  you can taste the difference in the nutrient density. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6412.5s)]
*  It's it's insane. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6415.099999999999s)]
*  And you have a lot of wild game. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6416.3s)]
*  Yeah. So that's what I order now. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6418.139999999999s)]
*  So I order a bunch. So I do elk steaks. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6419.18s)]
*  I do I do a lot of steaks from this farm that that Gary recommended to me. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6421.1s)]
*  It's just great. Is it bison? [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6427.5s)]
*  Do they have they do have bison to have bison to? [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6428.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's Parker Pastures. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6430.700000000001s)]
*  They're just like when I have a steak from these guys, like it's been like [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6431.740000000001s)]
*  you can taste it. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6436.58s)]
*  And I've had like my brother-in-law and my father, I had friends. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6437.54s)]
*  I was like, no, we're going to try these steaks out of the freezer. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6440.66s)]
*  I was like, we're like, we're not just going to buy something. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6442.9800000000005s)]
*  It looks different. It looks different. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6444.54s)]
*  Yeah, it looks like a color. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6446.06s)]
*  You get a pink steak from the grocery store, which is fine. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6447.46s)]
*  You cook it. It tastes great. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6450.780000000001s)]
*  But if you get a grass fed grass finished steak like grass finished, [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6452.18s)]
*  100 percent, a lot of ranches out here, you know, this Texas is a great place. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6455.38s)]
*  And there's a lot of ranches out here that use regenerative agriculture. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6459.34s)]
*  And they sell the animals that they kill. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6462.1s)]
*  And it's like a dark red meat. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6465.06s)]
*  Yeah, it looks completely different. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6467.14s)]
*  But that tastes different. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6468.5s)]
*  That you want to eat more of it. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6469.740000000001s)]

*  And I also feel like I'm like my body likes this [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6474.38s)]
*  because it's getting shit that it hasn't been getting. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6477.34s)]

*  You literally feel energized. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6480.62s)]
*  You know, I've given people elk before. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6482.42s)]
*  Yeah. One of the things I say is, I do have so much energy. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6484.46s)]

*  It is. It is so great. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6489.5s)]
*  But that was in the early days of Colossal. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6491.1s)]
*  That was one of the things that we got asked by by like heads of state, [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6493.54s)]

*  like a raptor and one side of the raptor is feathered. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6584.780000000001s)]
*  And the other side is like Jurassic Park, Scaly. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6588.14s)]
*  And, you know, you look at it, you know, oh, it's just like, oh, that's a fucking [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6591.34s)]
*  it's a bird. Yeah. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6596.42s)]
*  Like now it makes sense. Like makes more sense. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6597.54s)]
*  Yeah. It's little stupid arms. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6599.5s)]
*  Like makes more sense. I mean, have you seen the Watson? [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6601.1s)]
*  No. Can we can we pull up a Watson? [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6604.38s)]
*  So this is a bird that lives today in the Amazon. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6607.02s)]
*  And it is it's called a Houghton. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6609.42s)]
*  I think so. I don't know how you spell it. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6612.22s)]
*  It's like H.O.A. T.Z. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6613.58s)]
*  E.N. or something like that. We can find it. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6616.1s)]
*  Yeah. Apparently it also smells terrible. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6617.9s)]
*  But if you click, if you type in, oh, yeah, it's the Houghton. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6620.22s)]
*  And then if you click in and find a baby picture, it's got these little creepy hands. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6624.42s)]
*  It looks like it looks like kind of like a bird like dinosaur. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6630.18s)]
*  We we did the genome on this for fun. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6633.18s)]
*  So, oh, yeah, you can see it's like it climbs. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6635.26s)]
*  So before it ever flimes, it actually climbs up everything. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6637.9s)]
*  Well, when you look at an eagle's talon, you're like, [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6640.74s)]
*  what the hell is that? [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6643.42s)]
*  And then it evolves like if you the [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6644.820000000001s)]
*  the first kind of like, quote unquote, dinosaur bird up there, [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6648.9800000000005s)]
*  it actually yeah, it crawls. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6652.820000000001s)]
*  It crawls like it doesn't fly. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6655.22s)]
*  You know, most birds just sit there with their little like wing nubs [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6657.740000000001s)]
*  and just don't do anything. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6661.18s)]
*  These guys actually climb. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6662.34s)]
*  What about terror birds? [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6664.06s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that's scary. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6665.740000000001s)]
*  That's a crazy animal. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6667.54s)]
*  Like, what the hell was that thing? [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6668.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And that was what was that? [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6670.34s)]
*  How many years ago did those things go extinct? [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6671.62s)]
*  Those were millions, millions. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6674.26s)]
*  Right. Yeah. So the oldest DNA that we have is about one point five million years old. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6675.46s)]
*  That's it. Yeah. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6679.86s)]
*  So the dinosaurs are out of the picture. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6680.74s)]
*  So you can a guy should talk to you about not that. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6682.3s)]
*  But that's interesting is Kenneth Lacovara. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6685.98s)]
*  He discovered the four largest dinosaurs of all time, including dreadnought. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6688.42s)]
*  It's which is just it's the it's the craziest thing ever. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6692.62s)]
*  And going back to that, not dreadnought us and going back to the issues that [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6695.58s)]
*  what is dreadnought us? [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6699.7s)]
*  Oh, dreadnought is amazing. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6700.9s)]
*  So I don't know if it will take that. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6702.66s)]
*  What? Imagine it did that. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6705.7s)]
*  What cool colors. Yeah. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6708.14s)]
*  Yeah. He was. So it's a planet. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6709.18s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. It's a planet. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6710.86s)]
*  It's a size of seven, seven. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6712.14s)]
*  But going back as big as a seven, 37, that's so crazy. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6714.46s)]
*  Going back to this crazy notion of museums. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6718.3s)]
*  He found it in Argentina. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6722.26s)]
*  And he like he's a may can't talk of our he's amazing. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6724.46s)]
*  He found it in Argentina, discovered the species, named the species. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6728.62s)]
*  And he brought it. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6732.94s)]
*  He brought it to New Jersey to do all the modeling and all that. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6736.099999999999s)]
*  The government changed and they yanked it back. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6740.86s)]
*  You know, the old school like the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6743.419999999999s)]
*  That's where it is. It's basically in a warehouse. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6746.54s)]
*  So it's on display for people in a museum. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6749.339999999999s)]
*  It's literally this. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6752.139999999999s)]
*  This goes back to some of these these governments in these museums. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6753.179999999999s)]
*  It's literally like not on it's in a bunch of crates in Western Argentina. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6756.379999999999s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6761.0199999999995s)]
*  And it's like the coolest thing ever. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6762.0599999999995s)]
*  This is. Yeah. So yeah, that's like of ours lab. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6764.179999999999s)]
*  And so but it's it's truly, truly amazing. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6766.62s)]
*  So with these like that's one of the things about dinosaurs and museums, right? [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6770.7s)]
*  Like a lot of them, they've created artificial bones to fill in the blanks. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6774.7s)]
*  Fill in a lot of things. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6779.82s)]
*  Sometimes they'll get like a jawbone and they're like, and here's the reconstruction. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6780.86s)]
*  Right. It's weird because you go to see it and you think you're going to see a dinosaur. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6784.5s)]
*  But it's only a percentage complete. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6788.9s)]
*  Yeah. And sometimes they're real clever and sometimes they're not. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6790.54s)]
*  Like sometimes they'll it'll be different colors for the real bone. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6794.1s)]
*  Yeah. Versus and you're like, how much of this do you have? [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6797.02s)]
*  And they're like four percent. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6799.46s)]
*  Yeah. How did you guess what it looked like? [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6800.5s)]
*  Like and a lot of the images like of like the soft tissue overlay, [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6802.38s)]
*  like when they take the bones and then they create an animal out of it. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6807.58s)]
*  Like, have you ever seen like what like rabbits look like if you take away? [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6810.18s)]
*  Yeah, they did this with like whales and stuff. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6813.74s)]
*  And they look absolutely if you look at it, they look like the scariest things ever. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6816.1s)]
*  And then you put a whale on there and you're like, oh, that's not the worst thing. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6819.62s)]
*  Yeah. For whales, you see them and you look at them and you're like, oh, they're sweet. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6822.3s)]
*  Yeah. Just chilling in the water. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6825.86s)]
*  But if you see them with the teeth and everything and just the skeleton, [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6827.9800000000005s)]
*  it looks like it looks like an alien monster. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6830.62s)]
*  Yeah, like an alien monster. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6832.62s)]
*  So I wonder what we were looking at. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6834.06s)]
*  There was a there was a one species that we don't have DNA for. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6836.38s)]
*  That would be amazing to bring back because the ecological benefit is [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6840.26s)]
*  there was a giant beaver. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6842.94s)]
*  Yeah, a giant beaver sounds amazing and stupid. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6846.0599999999995s)]
*  It's when did that thing die off? [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6849.299999999999s)]
*  I don't know. It probably have to be. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6850.82s)]
*  It would probably be in the late Pleistocene. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6853.299999999999s)]
*  One of the things I learned through Ronella is that at the [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6855.58s)]
*  founding of this country in the early days, [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6859.339999999999s)]
*  the richest man in the world was selling beaver pelts. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6861.379999999999s)]
*  Oh, really? It was the richest guy in the world. Yeah. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6864.179999999999s)]
*  Here are the Pleistocene. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6867.5s)]
*  Well, on the dinosaur bones, this beaver, giant beaver, [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6869.099999999999s)]
*  enormous bear sized beaver that lived in North America during the Pleistocene. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6872.3s)]
*  Wow. So when did these die off? What year? [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6877.38s)]
*  What was the Pleistocene officially? [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6880.780000000001s)]
*  So about 13000 years ago, it could have been the same thing. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6883.66s)]
*  Well, so it probably died off during that same American lion. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6886.54s)]
*  Yeah. And all that other stuff. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6890.780000000001s)]
*  You know, the pronghorn, you know, the whole story. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6892.3s)]
*  Yeah, that's why they're so fast. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6895.5s)]
*  Oh, for because the American lion. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6897.9800000000005s)]
*  No, American cheetah. American cheetah. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6899.66s)]
*  Like they're the last of these animal. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6901.1s)]
*  They're a bizarre animal. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6903.46s)]
*  Have you ever seen one in real life? [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6904.700000000001s)]
*  I've never seen one in real life. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6905.820000000001s)]
*  I've only seen it through binoculars. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6906.54s)]
*  I've never seen one, you know, on the ground real close. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6908.26s)]
*  I've only seen it from a few hundred yards away. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6912.02s)]
*  But when you look at images of them, they have insane eyesight. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6914.02s)]
*  They have almost 360 degree vision. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6918.14s)]
*  Their eyes are on the side of their head. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6920.58s)]
*  Yeah, I've seen the pictures. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6922.18s)]
*  And they can run 55 miles an hour. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6923.46s)]
*  That's the reason why they can run so fast is because they were getting [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6925.900000000001s)]
*  chased by cheetahs that don't exist anymore. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6928.3s)]
*  So the cheetahs died off in the younger dry ice impact or whatever happened. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6930.26s)]
*  But these pronghorn antelopes remain and they are. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6934.38s)]
*  There's nothing like them in terms of speed. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6939.38s)]
*  That's like it's really bizarre because they're a remnant of an older past [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6941.900000000001s)]
*  right where they had to be that fast to avoid the predators. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6945.1s)]
*  But the predators are gone. They remain. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6947.780000000001s)]
*  Yes. Can you think catch them now? [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6949.34s)]
*  Nothing. Once they're done, like once they're grown. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6950.700000000001s)]
*  Good fucking luck. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6954.9800000000005s)]
*  They have insane eyesight. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6956.34s)]
*  But you know one of the ways that people hunt them, they're really dumb. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6958.74s)]
*  One of the ways people hunt them is on horseback. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6961.42s)]
*  Like that dog has zero chance. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6963.74s)]
*  But the cheetah cheetahs were chasing these motherfuckers down. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6965.58s)]
*  So it's like another different kind of antelope. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6970.3s)]
*  But a super fast, they're quite a bit faster, I bet, than these antelope. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6974.139999999999s)]
*  They're crazy fast. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6978.0599999999995s)]
*  There's like nothing like them in North America. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6978.86s)]
*  It's awesome. But the vision that these things have. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6980.62s)]
*  Give me a photo of one of their heads, pronghorn eyes. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6983.42s)]
*  They're so weird looking. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6987.58s)]
*  They look archaic. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6989.06s)]
*  Like if you if you see their face, they don't look like they looks like they're [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6990.78s)]
*  from another time. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6994.9800000000005s)]
*  It's the same thing from a Star Wars movie. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6995.82s)]
*  Yeah. They look like they're from another time. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=6997.34s)]
*  Yeah. And they are. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7000.42s)]
*  They're literally on the side there. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7001.66s)]
*  Yeah. They this is what would have been so amazing to like look at what the earth [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7002.74s)]
*  looked like, you know, 12000 years ago. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7007.1s)]
*  It is cool. Like America. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7009.3s)]
*  Like to your point, when you travel and you go to these different places [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7010.94s)]
*  where you have they're truly more remote. Right. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7014.1s)]
*  And I'm not just talking about like Yellowstone, but, you know, like when you've said, [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7016.58s)]
*  like going to Kruger National Park or looking at some of these places in Africa, [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7020.1s)]
*  when you go to Central Tasmania, it's almost like a weird Disney movie. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7023.42s)]
*  Like like at dusk, you've got like echidnas running around [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7027.34s)]
*  and you've got wallabies jumping, jumping through it. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7030.78s)]
*  And they all just come through. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7033.58s)]
*  And you're like, like, it's like that scene in like Ace Ventura, right? [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7034.58s)]
*  Where he sings like everything fucking comes to him. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7038.22s)]
*  And I and like I remember the first I was like, this isn't real. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7040.42s)]
*  Like are these animatronics? [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7043.42s)]
*  There's no way there's this much life and biodiversity. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7044.58s)]
*  And it's all and it was all just like, you know, the echidnas are running. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7047.5s)]
*  The wallabies are jumping. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7050.42s)]
*  You've got like wombats, like kind of like kind of scurrying along. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7052.14s)]
*  And you're just like, there's all these weird, dumb animals that are just excited. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7056.86s)]
*  You know, they're so strange to us, right? [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7059.98s)]
*  In terms of how we think about them, because you never see them. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7061.78s)]
*  But then there's just like this insane plethora of them. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7064.14s)]
*  There are just so many. It's crazy. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7066.54s)]
*  Well, I wonder what would be different had the thylacine survived. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7068.58s)]
*  So they say that kind of the only thing is it was the only apex predator [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7072.9800000000005s)]
*  for Tasmania in lower Australia. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7076.54s)]
*  And have you seen a Tasmanian devil in person? [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7078.86s)]
*  Non-person. They're awesome. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7082.38s)]
*  They look cool as shit. They're cool as shit. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7083.86s)]
*  They're awesome. They're they eat in these little packs. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7085.9400000000005s)]
*  And the reason why they call them Tasmanian devils is because they make the weirdest. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7087.9400000000005s)]
*  I mean, they make sense. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7092.18s)]
*  If I heard the sounds that they make, if you're out in the woods, you hear that sound. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7093.38s)]
*  You're like, this is a sasquatch. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7097.26s)]
*  Yeah, they're crazy. Yeah. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7099.9800000000005s)]
*  We can hear some [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7101.22s)]
*  of the tazzy's as in their devils. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7102.820000000001s)]
*  Do you look superficial? [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7105.14s)]
*  Oh, cute face. You find them eating. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7106.820000000001s)]
*  They just sound terrible. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7109.02s)]
*  Find Tasmanian tiger noises. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7110.02s)]
*  I don't think I know what they make or excuse me, Tasmanian devil noises. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7114.62s)]
*  Sorry. Sorry. Not. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7117.900000000001s)]
*  Have you seen this video, though? I have. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7120.06s)]
*  Yeah, we can go to that in a second, too. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7121.740000000001s)]
*  I just want to hear this. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7123.46s)]
*  Look at that fucker. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7127.58s)]
*  Look at his face. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7130.7s)]
*  So cool. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7133.82s)]
*  And so they so they're they're part of the reason why they're [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7134.74s)]
*  but that isn't terrifying. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7137.219999999999s)]
*  You know, they give each other cancer. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7138.9s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7140.54s)]
*  Yeah. And many of the researchers in Tasmania in Australia think [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7141.54s)]
*  that if the thylacine was there, because this is where people give wolves [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7146.099999999999s)]
*  and thylacines and predators bad. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7149.74s)]
*  But they go after the there's an energy expenditure ratio, right? [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7151.78s)]
*  They're not just sitting there grazing. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7154.78s)]
*  They're not getting sedentary. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7156.82s)]
*  They have to go make the kill. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7158.3s)]
*  They have to decide I'm going to go kill. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7160.18s)]
*  So they kill the young. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7161.820000000001s)]
*  So they're thinning out the weakest. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7162.9400000000005s)]
*  They they kill the old and they kill the sick. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7164.58s)]
*  A an environment that has the right balance of predator and prey [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7166.58s)]
*  is a healthier ecosystem, including for those prey species. Right. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7172.18s)]
*  And all data that we've seen on the thylacine suggests that they actually ate [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7175.26s)]
*  kind of that mezzanine level of marsupials. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7180.7s)]
*  And so many people believe that the facial tumor disease would not. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7182.900000000001s)]
*  If you've seen it, I don't know if you saw it's disgusting. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7186.46s)]
*  It's really gross. Yeah. But that is what are we looking at here? [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7188.74s)]
*  Oh, feeding frenzy. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7192.54s)]
*  It's like a give me some volume. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7193.74s)]
*  It's doing it right in front of people, too. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7196.18s)]
*  It's crazy. They might be talking at times. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7197.78s)]
*  Yeah, I fed them like this. It's crazy. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7199.58s)]
*  Here they go. They're just not scared. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7201.18s)]
*  No, they are capable. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7202.86s)]
*  You just do. They're like piranhas. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7204.86s)]
*  These are Tasmanian devils, the only carnivorous marsupial [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7206.82s)]
*  that we have ever featured on camera and next to Tasmania. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7211.38s)]
*  It's so cool that they're not remotely scared of people. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7215.42s)]
*  Yeah, they don't even know you're there. It's crazy. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7221.099999999999s)]
*  So if you feed them like this, you put a piece of whose video is this, Jimmy? [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7223.42s)]
*  Coyote Peterson Brave Wilderness. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7227.78s)]
*  OK. Look at these little fuckers. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7229.219999999999s)]
*  And then they just make these sounds, but they often get into fights [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7231.74s)]
*  and that fight is when they that's when they do the transmission. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7234.3s)]
*  Oh, right. You see that fight? [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7240.74s)]
*  No, I mean like, wow. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7242.58s)]
*  But they literally scratch and bite each other. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7245.26s)]
*  And then they they transmit this. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7247.42s)]
*  It's the only transmissible cancer that we know of. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7249.66s)]
*  So then it latches onto the next face through biting. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7252.14s)]
*  And and the file. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7255.5s)]
*  And if you see an animal with a Tasmanian devil with the facial tumor disease [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7257.26s)]
*  and you see them like they can't walk well, they can't really see well. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7261.1s)]
*  Those are the animals that would be picked up at predators first. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7264.46s)]
*  And so they so there's a big movement within Tasmanian [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7267.38s)]
*  in lower Australia, Southern Australia, [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7271.1s)]
*  that if we could reintroduce a predator being the thylacine, it would eat. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7273.700000000001s)]
*  Well, I can't even look. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7277.620000000001s)]
*  Oh, God, we're looking for people listening. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7279.14s)]
*  We're looking at tumors on Tasmanian devil's faces. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7281.5s)]
*  Yeah, which is terrible. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7284.54s)]
*  Well, that was a perfect inspiration for a comic book character [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7285.740000000001s)]
*  or for a cartoon character rather. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7289.660000000001s)]
*  The Tasmanian devil is amazing. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7291.26s)]
*  I mean, they're they're like they'll be sitting there not making those sounds. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7293.1s)]
*  They start eating or they get threatened and they make those death sounds. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7296.54s)]
*  You are you are it is a terror because if you've never heard it before in person, [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7299.62s)]
*  it just catches you by surprise and it like blows you away. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7304.22s)]
*  So I was it was a pretty weird experience for someone that I'd imagine. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7307.58s)]
*  That's such a cool little animal. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7311.98s)]
*  So the idea of ultimately eventually releasing thylacines, [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7313.38s)]
*  how would that be done and what kind of study would have to be done? [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7319.58s)]
*  Because you're talking about all these animals that come out. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7323.1s)]
*  Look at all the animals that probably won't be the case if you reintroduce [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7325.22s)]
*  now, they'll start they will start thinning out and it'll separate. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7328.9800000000005s)]
*  You've a balance. Yeah, it was. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7332.26s)]
*  So they've done a lot. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7333.54s)]
*  Was this like key people of date on Australia? [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7334.66s)]
*  Most people don't know that they've introduced cats. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7337.46s)]
*  So house cats. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7340.58s)]
*  You want some water? Yeah. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7342.18s)]
*  So they're they introduce house cats like just feral house cats in Australia [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7343.02s)]
*  to combat certain species. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7348.14s)]
*  And they start decimating all the other species. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7351.14s)]
*  It's literally the worst. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7353.42s)]
*  It's literally the number one mammalian extinction [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7355.06s)]
*  rate in Australia. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7358.820000000001s)]
*  And it's because it's an invasive species. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7360.06s)]
*  Would that be a problem? [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7362.5s)]
*  That would be would there be a similar problem if you reintroduced [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7364.22s)]
*  the Tasmanian tiger? Would there be potentially [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7367.1s)]
*  would you have to reintroduce other species if they make them extinct? [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7371.18s)]
*  So the good news about the Tasmanian [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7373.860000000001s)]
*  in the southern Australia ecosystem is they're mostly intact. Right. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7378.06s)]
*  Hopefully they'd eat the cats. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7382.22s)]
*  If you talk to most people in Australia, they hate cats outside of the cats [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7383.900000000001s)]
*  that they actually own. Yeah. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7386.38s)]
*  They actually hate cats because of what they're doing to small marsupials. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7387.74s)]
*  They're actually looking at technologies like gene drives and others [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7390.58s)]
*  to get rid of to fully eradicate cats that are that are wild, non domestic cats. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7392.82s)]
*  Yeah. People hunt them. Yeah. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7396.860000000001s)]
*  People hunt them like you have. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7398.1s)]
*  I have a good buddy of mine, Adam Green Tree, and they have this magazine. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7400.38s)]
*  It's like a bow hunter magazine in Australia. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7403.26s)]
*  And he gave me a copy of it. I was reading on a plane. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7405.02s)]
*  This guy's holding up a dead cat. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7407.34s)]
*  He shot with a bow and I'm like, hey, man. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7408.82s)]
*  Yeah. What the fuck? [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7411.3s)]
*  You know, they they hold them up like trophies because it's it's a huge problem. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7412.42s)]
*  Right. It goes back to the invasive species. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7415.9400000000005s)]
*  One of the projects that we're working on with the thylacine, [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7418.06s)]
*  because we like to pair every de-extinction with the species preservation is [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7421.66s)]
*  have you ever seen a northern quoll? [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7424.9s)]
*  No, what is that northern quoll? [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7426.9s)]
*  It kind of looks like a manker, like a ferret, but way prettier. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7428.06s)]
*  It's amazing. How do you spell it? [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7431.66s)]
*  Q U O L L. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7433.38s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, I mean, they're they're absolutely beautiful. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7435.7s)]
*  They're absolutely I mean, they're beautiful. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7438.58s)]
*  But they're another type of carnivorous marsupial. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7441.18s)]
*  But, you know, a hundred years ago or so, they got we as humanity [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7443.7s)]
*  introduced cane toads. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7448.9s)]
*  Have you ever seen a cane toad? It's like the job of the I mean, it looks fucking evil. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7451.5s)]
*  Right. They're monsters. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7454.38s)]
*  And so we introduced we as humanity introduced cane toads into Australia. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7455.58s)]
*  And and they have a neurotoxin. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7461.46s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7464.54s)]
*  Most quolls and small marsupials love to eat frogs and toads. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7465.14s)]
*  And so this is actually I think about our work. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7468.7s)]
*  This actually is about our work. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7470.900000000001s)]
*  And so, you know, this is maybe actually I think this is part of our work. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7472.18s)]
*  And what what we've done is if you go back to your point about [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7476.38s)]
*  co-evolving and evolution, if you go back to southern [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7480.1s)]
*  to South America, where cane toads evolved along snakes and mice [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7484.14s)]
*  and other small mammals, they came to us all day long. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7488.74s)]
*  And they don't die of the neurotoxin. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7492.66s)]
*  They don't like completely like stroke out and die, which is what happens [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7493.860000000001s)]
*  in in northern Australia. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7497.139999999999s)]
*  And so the cane toads are they reproduce in an insane rate? [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7499.42s)]
*  They're having like thousands of babies. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7504.179999999999s)]
*  There's making more and more of them. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7505.82s)]
*  So guess what? More and more cane or more more quolls [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7506.86s)]
*  and others are eating these cantoads and dying. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7509.379999999999s)]
*  So what we did is we actually did a study where we understood [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7511.299999999999s)]
*  what are the genes in the mammals and snakes even [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7515.299999999999s)]
*  in in South America that make them cantoad toxin resistant. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7520.179999999999s)]
*  And here's what we found. This is amazing. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7524.42s)]
*  One letter in three and a half billion base pairs. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7526.78s)]
*  So one letter, a one letter change conferred had no other, [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7529.54s)]
*  you know, deterioration, had no other effects that were negative. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7533.58s)]
*  And it created a five thousand times resistance to cane toad. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7536.139999999999s)]
*  Wow. So we so because, you know, quolls are endangered [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7541.94s)]
*  and we don't want to work in endangered species first, [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7545.5s)]
*  you want to start with a more model species. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7547.099999999999s)]
*  We worked in the fat tailed dunnart, [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7549.099999999999s)]
*  which is our model species for the thylacine. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7551.7s)]
*  And and we engineered dunnarts that in dunnart cells and dunnarts [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7553.78s)]
*  that can eat cantoad tissues and have zero effect, [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7558.34s)]
*  has zero effect on them, where it would typically kill them. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7562.7s)]
*  And so now we're in the next phase of trials showing that we want to enter. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7565.099999999999s)]
*  We like to engineer in this this one edit into quolls, [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7568.3s)]
*  because if quolls would have most likely through this concept of convergent evolution, [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7572.94s)]
*  if you would have put the quoll next to the cantoad, [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7578.139999999999s)]
*  they would have co-evolved together. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7580.62s)]
*  They probably would have had that resistance already built into them through nature. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7581.94s)]
*  Wow. And so that's showing the power of this concept of genetic engineering [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7586.46s)]
*  and biotech in conservation. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7590.82s)]
*  And so then you could like make these super quolls that eat the cantoads. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7593.46s)]
*  And then not only does that help the population lower the population of cantoads, [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7597.54s)]
*  it has this and help the population of the quolls, [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7601.219999999999s)]
*  but also has a halo effect to all these other marsupials [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7603.7s)]
*  that we don't know how many are dying from eating cantoads. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7605.9s)]
*  I hope you don't have to bring in big toads to eat the quolls. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7609.74s)]
*  You know, you know, that's the same. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7614.179999999999s)]
*  Have you seen those those toads and frogs that like latch out [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7616.86s)]
*  and like they'll eat anything in front of them? Yes. Yeah, they're here. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7619.74s)]
*  I've seen it was a giant. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7622.54s)]
*  There was a giant one of those toads back in like, I don't know, thousands of years ago. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7624.139999999999s)]
*  How big was it? I don't know. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7628.7s)]
*  I've seen a 3D render of it and it like grabs like, you know, deers and stuff. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7630.0599999999995s)]
*  It's crazy. Whoa. Yeah. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7634.299999999999s)]
*  We've played videos of toads eating mice. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7635.46s)]
*  I had no idea. Yeah. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7637.86s)]
*  Before I saw those videos only a few years ago, I had no idea toads would just eat mice. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7639.62s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7643.339999999999s)]
*  So they put them in this bin with a bunch of mice. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7643.98s)]
*  And this toad is just going ham, just snatching mice and swallowing. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7646.58s)]
*  You know, just and you think that they're just sitting there docile. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7650.139999999999s)]
*  And then they just absolutely they throw their whole body. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7652.5s)]
*  Sit there. They have the creepiest dead eyes. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7654.54s)]
*  They're just machines to eat. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7657.299999999999s)]
*  Ever seen them fight with each other? That's pretty wild, too. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7659.219999999999s)]
*  They bite each other's heads and they throw each other through the air. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7661.42s)]
*  Yeah, I've seen I've seen them toss each other. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7664.54s)]
*  Imagine you're fighting with a dude and he literally bites half your torso [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7666.18s)]
*  and throws you through the air and they and they don't even look like it bothered them. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7670.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's just part of the fight. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7673.34s)]
*  That's totally like within the rule. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7676.1s)]
*  That's what creeps me out about reptiles. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7677.740000000001s)]
*  There's this lack of emotions, like at least a wolf has emotions. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7679.900000000001s)]
*  You know, it's like there's something going on there. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7684.02s)]
*  There's an intelligence. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7685.860000000001s)]
*  There's something really creepy about getting eaten by something stupid. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7687.14s)]
*  Like a crocodile. Yeah. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7690.66s)]
*  Like like a crocodile or like a toad. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7692.14s)]
*  There's a thing about crocodiles that people were suspecting, [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7694.74s)]
*  but it turns out to not be true that they would lie on their back [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7697.66s)]
*  and put their arms in the air to simulate drowning. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7702.66s)]
*  Yeah, I saw that video. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7705.78s)]
*  Apparently, that's not what they're doing. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7706.58s)]
*  Apparently, that's a normal characteristic that they do. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7708.46s)]
*  But stupid, but from a natural selection perspective, stupid people were like, [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7711.66s)]
*  I have to say, I got to save that dude. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7715.22s)]
*  And then we credit the crocodile for being super smart. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7717.3s)]
*  But in reality, just got a free meal. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7719.54s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you would think, though, if they have gotten those meals before, [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7721.26s)]
*  that that would be a learned behavior. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7725.1s)]
*  I mean, just they do have some learned behavior. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7726.66s)]
*  I have a friend, his name is Jim Shockey. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7729.66s)]
*  He's a professional hunter, and he was actually hired [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7732.18s)]
*  to go into Africa and hunt crocodiles that were killing all these people [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7734.9800000000005s)]
*  in this village. Like they're actively targeting people in this village. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7738.54s)]
*  Yeah. When he went to the village, everybody was like missing a foot [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7741.66s)]
*  or a chunk taken out of their leg. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7744.62s)]
*  And while he was there, a crocodile took a woman who was washing clothes. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7746.02s)]
*  So what they had done was they'd set up this area by the water [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7751.3s)]
*  where they had driven these stakes in the ground that would prevent [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7755.860000000001s)]
*  the crocodiles from getting in the water and getting really close to the edge, [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7759.14s)]
*  you know, because you can't see them in the water. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7763.14s)]
*  And then they just explode out and snatch you up. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7765.1s)]
*  Yeah. These fucking crocodiles went around the fence. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7767.14s)]
*  They walked around the fence and slid into the water. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7770.58s)]
*  So they figured out that these people are in this area that they can't get to. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7773.34s)]
*  So they they hunt people. Yeah, they they absolutely do. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7777.42s)]
*  And it's weird how some of those [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7780.02s)]
*  it's very strange as we start to study, because like one of the things [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7783.22s)]
*  that colossal is doing is we're studying a lot of what's called nonmodal species. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7786.5s)]
*  So we're learning a lot about weird things that we just didn't know. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7789.580000000001s)]
*  There's some things that are known like an elephant, like elephants [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7792.740000000001s)]
*  get cancer, a fraction of what they should due to an overexpression [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7795.580000000001s)]
*  of a gene called P53. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7799.26s)]
*  So there's this thing called Petos paradox where based on age and body weight, [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7801.06s)]
*  both blue whales and elephants [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7805.26s)]
*  get cancer, a fraction of what they probably should [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7808.1s)]
*  based on how old they get and what their body size is. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7811.26s)]
*  And they actually that actually makes our lives very difficult. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7814.1s)]
*  And that's why we had to create stem cells for elephants, [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7816.620000000001s)]
*  because any time we try to we had to figure out how to regulate P53, [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7819.5s)]
*  because any time you go to edit that one [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7822.740000000001s)]
*  cell, it just says looks like a mutation could be cancer kill cell. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7825.820000000001s)]
*  Right. It's like programmed in. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7829.660000000001s)]
*  So we have to be able to we have to be able to turn that down [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7831.18s)]
*  because we're in the editing phase on the Mayhoff project. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7834.22s)]
*  Right. So there's about 85 genes. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7836.06s)]
*  If you turn that down, does that make them more susceptible to cancer? [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7837.42s)]
*  And so you got to turn it back up after you make the edits. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7840.02s)]
*  So, yes. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7841.9s)]
*  So these are the things that you just that we are learning about that lady doctor, [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7843.1s)]
*  that lady scientist. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7846.9400000000005s)]
*  You guys are doing something you shouldn't be doing. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7847.9400000000005s)]
*  No, we're learning about things, right? [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7849.7s)]
*  We're learning about things. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7851.42s)]
*  I'm kidding, but I'm not kidding. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7852.38s)]
*  If I was her, I would probably have the same opinion. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7853.82s)]
*  Yeah, I'd probably say, especially if I found out you guys weren't really scientists. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7855.9800000000005s)]
*  But what are you doing? Yeah. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7859.54s)]
*  Why are you doing this? [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7861.1s)]
*  Well, I mean, the good news is about Colossal is that, you know, [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7861.9400000000005s)]
*  outside of our 17 academic partners and our 95 scientific advisors, [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7864.62s)]
*  90 percent of the company scientists, there's very few like I like I fall in the very few. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7868.5s)]
*  I'm kind of kidding about you're not scientists, but I'm not. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7872.14s)]
*  I'm not kidding about the technology getting into someone else's hands. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7874.9s)]
*  And this is where it gets weird. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7877.82s)]
*  Like China, Russia. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7879.14s)]
*  So it is it is getting weird like CRISPR and these genome [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7881.26s)]
*  engineering tools are outside of the bar. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7884.54s)]
*  They're out. It's it's like the genie of the bottle, right? [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7886.42s)]
*  It's like it's out there. You can't put it back in. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7888.9s)]
*  I think that more and more people in other countries [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7892.1s)]
*  are going to be doing things with these two, these technologies for humans. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7894.9400000000005s)]
*  That's why Colossal just said we will never do anything for humans. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7898.5s)]
*  If someone else wants to use our technologies for humans, we'll evaluate. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7901.66s)]
*  It gets so weird, right? [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7904.860000000001s)]
*  Like the China story, you can't explain to people what they did. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7906.14s)]
*  They said they were inoculating them from HIV, which is. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7909.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they actually were engineering. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7912.58s)]
*  They were engineering [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7914.82s)]
*  babies in editing their embryos [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7916.9800000000005s)]
*  to confer our resistance to HIV. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7920.660000000001s)]
*  Now, still to this day. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7923.02s)]
*  So they were cloning them and then they were genetically modifying them. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7924.860000000001s)]
*  And so they're doing lots of things that are there's a general moratorium [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7928.54s)]
*  in the world on some of these things around humans, anything [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7931.660000000001s)]
*  that's considered a germ line edit. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7933.780000000001s)]
*  So anything that could be passed on to the next generation. Right. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7935.18s)]
*  So things. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7939.9400000000005s)]
*  So if you if you if you engineer something into the genome, the fear is, [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7940.780000000001s)]
*  you know, from a germ line. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7946.38s)]
*  So all your cells in your body are somatic cells, [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7947.78s)]
*  except for your like agar sperm. Those are germ cells. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7949.82s)]
*  So anything that could be affected into the germ line [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7952.259999999999s)]
*  so that you pass it on to the next generation, that could be like, you know, [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7955.0199999999995s)]
*  Umbrella Corporation type moment. Right. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7959.58s)]
*  So we don't want that. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7961.9s)]
*  The scary thing was they didn't just do that. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7963.62s)]
*  They also edited something that would allow the child to have much higher intelligence. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7966.46s)]
*  Well, so that part's like [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7971.62s)]
*  that part's quoted under under debate. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7975.099999999999s)]
*  There's people that say that happen. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7976.98s)]
*  There's people that say it doesn't happen. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7978.62s)]
*  If you look at BGI or Beijing Genomics Institute, right, [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7980.54s)]
*  they did this thing that from an affairs perspective was brilliant. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7984.58s)]
*  From an affairs perspective is also terrifying. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7989.459999999999s)]
*  During Covid, they're like, we'll do all the testing for free. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7991.459999999999s)]
*  We'll do all this testing for you for free. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7993.98s)]
*  No worries. Just send us your data. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7995.9s)]
*  We'll do it all for you. Just want to help the world. Right. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7997.139999999999s)]
*  We'll work with the World Health Organization. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=7998.9s)]
*  Just send us all your samples from all your countries, everything. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8000.86s)]
*  And publicly, the CEO of BGI has said, which is funded by the CCP, has said [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8003.46s)]
*  that they would that they are looking at genes with humans. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8012.580000000001s)]
*  They are looking at what makes humans more intelligent. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8016.9800000000005s)]
*  They don't shy away from this. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8019.740000000001s)]
*  This is not like some, you know, conspiracy like they're like, [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8020.660000000001s)]
*  is it a Sasquatch or is it just a man in an ape suit? [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8024.42s)]
*  This is something that is very real. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8027.02s)]
*  They are openly saying we are sequencing as much as we can [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8028.580000000001s)]
*  of the world population looking for genes for intelligence. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8032.02s)]
*  And we will act on that. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8035.540000000001s)]
*  Like that's not a hidden thing. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8037.3s)]
*  So that is the problem. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8039.34s)]
*  Supposedly did with these children. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8040.5s)]
*  How old are these kids now? [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8042.660000000001s)]
*  I mean, that would have when that happened. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8044.42s)]
*  It is. Yeah. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8046.14s)]
*  So there's been like six or seven. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8047.42s)]
*  Oh, and are they already winning chess championships? [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8049.26s)]
*  Yes. I'm not. Find out. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8051.38s)]
*  Yeah. We should find out. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8052.660000000001s)]
*  These kids are probably in a lab somewhere with a headset on. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8053.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I teach them how to be psychic. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8056.580000000001s)]
*  I don't know how public it's like. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8059.02s)]
*  It was also one of those weird things that was like he's in trouble. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8060.9s)]
*  He's going to jail. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8064.7s)]
*  Yeah. And then he's like, got out in these out. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8067.46s)]
*  Yeah. All is for good. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8069.94s)]
*  Yeah. But meanwhile, if you go to jail in China, you fucking vanish forever. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8071.9s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Except for this guy. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8075.94s)]
*  This guy in iPhones until you drop dead of starvation. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8077.46s)]
*  Yeah, it is. It is. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8080.94s)]
*  It's 100 percent true. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8082.179999999999s)]
*  And so it is weird that like he got in trouble for a few months. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8083.219999999999s)]
*  Right. And he got in trouble for something. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8087.299999999999s)]
*  They probably told him to do in the first place. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8089.3s)]
*  Well, they funded his lab. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8091.14s)]
*  His lab was his lab was was funded by the. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8092.34s)]
*  And this is what we found out about. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8094.9400000000005s)]
*  I guarantee you there's some shit that they're doing somewhere [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8096.820000000001s)]
*  that we haven't found out about yet. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8100.02s)]
*  And if you were going to do something with human beings and create a super soldier, [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8102.06s)]
*  you know, we know that that's what separates us. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8105.46s)]
*  Do you know what Russia was attempting to do during World War One or World War Two? [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8107.9800000000005s)]
*  They were trying to make a chimpanzee human hybrid for. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8112.74s)]
*  Oh, I saw that. I read about that. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8115.02s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8116.7s)]
*  Chimp human hybrid for war. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8117.82s)]
*  There's been a recent publication out of Japan where they're allowing [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8119.54s)]
*  Japanese soldiers or Japanese scientists to edit [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8124.46s)]
*  human cells in embryos with mammalian genes. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8128.58s)]
*  With other mammalian genes. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8133.3s)]
*  Like what kind of genes like will I am a change in a person? [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8134.7s)]
*  No, we are not doing that. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8138.74s)]
*  People ask us if we could solve ball [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8139.7s)]
*  hair loss with woolly mammoths. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8142.74s)]
*  That would be the first thing people want. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8144.18s)]
*  Yeah. Hair loss. Next thing, bigger dicks. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8145.7s)]
*  Those are consistent. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8148.34s)]
*  You can't engineer once a person's already born. Right. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8148.94s)]
*  Well, you can't current technology with the current technology. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8152.46s)]
*  Like so. So being able to send stuff to specific gene therapies [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8155.099999999999s)]
*  and targeting of being able to deliver specifically to cells [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8158.66s)]
*  is an area that we're getting better at. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8162.26s)]
*  Like I think one of the probably the most [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8165.179999999999s)]
*  I think one of the the projects that's the furthest along [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8168.0199999999995s)]
*  is around like sickle cell anemia. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8171.46s)]
*  It's a single CRISPR knockout. Right. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8172.78s)]
*  So it's a single knockout. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8174.78s)]
*  It's not multiplex editing. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8176.259999999999s)]
*  And now it's about can you target that in all of the tissue types [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8177.9s)]
*  that are the most affected? [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8180.58s)]
*  And then over time, how do you deliver that gene therapy to everything? [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8182.0199999999995s)]
*  And you could do that to a person who's already born to someone that's already born. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8185.219999999999s)]
*  It's obviously much easier to do it at the embryo stage. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8188.58s)]
*  Could you envision a world where the gene editing technology [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8190.54s)]
*  becomes so powerful that you could do it to a person who is already fully formed? [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8194.46s)]
*  Yes. Whoa. Yeah. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8199.1s)]
*  This is what I predicted. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8201.58s)]
*  Everyone's going to look like Thor. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8202.46s)]
*  It's going to be a bunch of Chris Hemsworth and Jason Momoa's. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8203.900000000001s)]
*  And no more people look like you and me. Yeah. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8206.74s)]
*  Wait, so Chris is one of our investors. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8209.62s)]
*  And I always think we look just like each other. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8211.94s)]
*  Oh, yeah. So he invited. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8213.58s)]
*  Luke invited me to go to another planet. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8215.62s)]
*  I think a different species is. Yeah. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8218.42s)]
*  They invited me to go up to Byron Bay and go surfing with them. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8220.26s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, I'm going to take my shirt off next to you nerds. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8223.66s)]
*  That's exactly what's never going to happen. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8226.7s)]
*  And I just made up an excuse of why I couldn't go because they're like, [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8228.66s)]
*  we want to go surfing. I was like, [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8231.18s)]
*  sure you do. You want to. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8233.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not going surfing with you to measure cocks to. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8234.94s)]
*  Yeah, I was like, I'm going as far away from you as my shirt off as possible. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8237.42s)]
*  But you got to imagine if that becomes a reality, like [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8240.58s)]
*  what we're doing today just with plastic surgery. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8244.34s)]
*  Yeah. Right. Like let's take South Korea, for example. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8248.94s)]
*  Yeah. GLP one. But that's that's achievable. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8251.9s)]
*  Right. What they're what GLP ones are doing is achievable through hard work. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8255.18s)]
*  Yeah. But but like what they're doing in South Korea with eye surgery, [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8258.619999999999s)]
*  like it's ubiquitous, like so many people are getting this weird surgery [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8262.580000000002s)]
*  where they have these K-pop eyes. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8266.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah. You know, it's just it's a strange thing. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8268.02s)]
*  It's a strange thing. [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8270.220000000001s)]
*  And if that's just primitive cutting and sewing tissue artistically. [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8270.980000000001s)]
*  Right. But if people can decide what they're going to look like, [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8275.460000000001s)]
*  what their intelligence is going to be like, it's a eugenics. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8280.060000000001s)]
*  Now we're really playing. No, no, no, no. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8283.18s)]
*  That's playing God to another level. Right. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8285.300000000001s)]
*  And that's like that's this eugenics world where we know. Right. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8286.78s)]
*  Like I just had a child and, you know, typically I'd say [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8289.54s)]
*  if you go through the IVF process, which we went through, [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8293.820000000002s)]
*  you typically can test for certain types of issues like along the pregnancy. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8296.660000000002s)]
*  Right. And when they put the embryo in, they look at kind of the morphological grade. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8301.42s)]
*  Well, now there's new tests, new companies out there, one of which I use, [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8305.140000000001s)]
*  which after I used it, I was so impressed I invested in it called Orchid Health. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8308.94s)]
*  And they actually take cells from the developing [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8312.1s)]
*  neuro on the very outer derm, right, on this thing that doesn't affect [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8315.26s)]
*  the embryo development. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8318.66s)]
*  They culture those cells and then they're doing full genome sequencing. Right. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8319.9s)]
*  And so we had a handful of embryos. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8323.42s)]
*  And so not selecting they don't let you just select for like eye color [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8325.78s)]
*  or height or anything. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8329.06s)]
*  But outside of the kind of the core, you know, is there a mental issue [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8330.02s)]
*  or is it compatible with life, which is what most people test for? [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8334.26s)]
*  You can now, you know, ethically and transparently go figure out, [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8337.14s)]
*  does it have any predispositions to certain things? Right. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8341.619999999999s)]
*  So like, you know, if diabetes or cancer and types of cancers [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8344.1s)]
*  or Alzheimer's or illness in your family, you can now get a lot of that's [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8347.54s)]
*  environmental, but you can still get a distribution score to it [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8351.18s)]
*  so you can understand what are the genetic factors in that. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8353.820000000002s)]
*  So that's today. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8356.900000000001s)]
*  So that's not like 20 years in the future. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8358.18s)]
*  That's not Gattaca. That's today. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8360.580000000002s)]
*  And I mean, we did that. We did that because I have a I have a [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8363.7s)]
*  I found out during that sick period that I have a gene mutation [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8366.460000000001s)]
*  which affects the titan gene. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8369.380000000001s)]
*  And I created truncated protein. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8371.02s)]
*  So I have I am more susceptible to diseases, [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8372.580000000002s)]
*  including the first true round of Covid that was a lab leak [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8375.22s)]
*  that in that attacks my heart. Wow. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8379.58s)]
*  And so I didn't want to be able to pass that on. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8382.38s)]
*  So we screened for that. Right. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8384.06s)]
*  That's not a standard thing. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8385.22s)]
*  So but that's a today thing like, like, you know, [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8386.699999999999s)]
*  two years ago, that technology existed and is now prevalent [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8390.34s)]
*  and people are using it. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8393.58s)]
*  So you understand the technology better than most conceivably. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8394.539999999999s)]
*  What what could be done that would in the future allow people to change [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8398.699999999999s)]
*  their very shape and literally like change everything about them, [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8403.98s)]
*  change their intelligence, change everything? [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8408.38s)]
*  I think it starts with, you know, neuro enhancers. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8410.26s)]
*  And I think this is the biological perspective. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8414.14s)]
*  This is not even the computer brain interfaces merging with AI. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8417.14s)]
*  That whole world, which I think that world has a lot of traction [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8420.779999999999s)]
*  and is scarily getting a lot of traction pretty quickly. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8423.699999999999s)]
*  But I think it starts with things like health span, where it's like [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8426.66s)]
*  the very vain stuff. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8430.5s)]
*  So like, you know, skin, skin elasticity, hair, all of that eye color. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8432.14s)]
*  I think all of that is changeable and not in like there's a company right now. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8438.42s)]
*  I read the name of it that spun out of Harvard that is making [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8443.539999999999s)]
*  patches using micro needling patches that you can even feel the needles. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8447.099999999999s)]
*  Right. And delivering a custom stem cell for you that can help [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8451.539999999999s)]
*  like replace your melanocytes for hair and for skin. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8455.66s)]
*  And so so you can have 30 year old looking skin when you're 85 years old. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8459.58s)]
*  What? Yes. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8464.460000000001s)]
*  So in the same thing for hair, right. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8466.38s)]
*  The reason why our hair that's going to be real soon. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8467.9s)]
*  Yes. I mean, that's the speed of which the I think the biggest [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8470.26s)]
*  I think the two biggest barriers for health care around genetics [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8474.18s)]
*  and longevity is going to be the FDA process and not the not the technology. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8478.1s)]
*  I think it'll be a process problem. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8484.74s)]
*  We saw that with Operation Warp Drive, right? [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8486.38s)]
*  We we saw how fast things could move if people really wanted them to. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8488.38s)]
*  So I think that's number one. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8492.22s)]
*  And I think that you're going to have the ethical pushbacks on this. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8493.939999999999s)]
*  So regulatory and ethical, those are the two hurdles. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8496.66s)]
*  But right now, the technology exists. Yeah. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8499.339999999998s)]
*  Well, the other biggest thing, and this is kind of [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8501.14s)]
*  for the folks that are deep in longevity, their biggest [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8503.619999999999s)]
*  they'll tell you the biggest issue with longevity [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8506.699999999999s)]
*  is that it's not currently classified as a disease state. Right. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8508.779999999999s)]
*  It's just so they're not getting NIH funding. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8512.179999999998s)]
*  They're getting all that funding is one of the random stuff, you know, [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8514.779999999999s)]
*  but people aren't focusing on longevity. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8517.82s)]
*  That's why you've got like you've seen anything like Bob Nelson's done. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8520.1s)]
*  Bob started Archventures and he's like arguably the number one biotech [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8523.46s)]
*  in the world, and he's working on epigenetic resets or resetting [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8527.46s)]
*  your clocks at a cellular level. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8530.619999999999s)]
*  That's what Jeff Bezos and them have. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8532.42s)]
*  They're doing it. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8534.779999999999s)]
*  Altos Labs, George Church is another company called Rejuvenate Bio. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8535.34s)]
*  They're doing the same things. And they're smart. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8538.619999999999s)]
*  They did it in dogs first because people love dogs. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8540.34s)]
*  And they can also collect a lot of data that they can then apply to clinical trials. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8542.619999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I know. There's a lot of people cloning their dogs. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8546.26s)]
*  Yeah, there's people that are cloning their dogs. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8548.46s)]
*  They can do it even easier now with it with this. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8550.22s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't bring Marshall to the studio. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8552.5s)]
*  We did. We did clone one person's dog. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8555.18s)]
*  I couldn't do it. I love him too much. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8557.1s)]
*  I couldn't do it. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8560.26s)]
*  I would I would feel so weird around this fake Marshall. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8560.98s)]
*  Yeah, I wouldn't want to do that. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8563.74s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And that's how people feel about it. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8565.3s)]
*  Some dogs are unique little creatures. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8567.5s)]
*  They are their own little personalities. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8569.58s)]
*  And I know I've got two and they're amazing. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8571.06s)]
*  And, you know, I did. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8573.18s)]
*  My wife is closer to one. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8575.42s)]
*  And so I did. I did. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8578.380000000001s)]
*  It is full disclosure. I did. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8579.460000000001s)]
*  We did do a blood sample on that one. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8581.02s)]
*  Just because I don't I don't. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8582.58s)]
*  I just don't know what the meltdown could look like. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8583.82s)]
*  So but but but the other one, we haven't. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8586.42s)]
*  And so because you are that you have you have environmental factors, [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8588.220000000001s)]
*  you have personalities, we don't understand all of that. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8591.94s)]
*  But I won't say who it is, but someone that's very well known in the world. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8594.66s)]
*  When I was showing him some of our direwolf and red wolf tech, [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8600.220000000001s)]
*  his kids were devastated because his dog was dying [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8603.220000000001s)]
*  and they didn't want to they didn't want to put her in any harm. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8606.62s)]
*  They didn't want to go on these dog cloning companies and do like ear. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8609.220000000001s)]
*  They want to put it to sleep. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8612.5s)]
*  They didn't think she'd wake back up. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8613.5s)]
*  So we did a drug, a blood draw. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8614.94s)]
*  He called me over Christmas or before Christmas last year [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8617.14s)]
*  and told me that, you know, that they think the dogs got weeks, [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8621.82s)]
*  days to weeks to live. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8625.74s)]
*  Could we do it for him? [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8627.34s)]
*  And we and we and we did it for him. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8629.82s)]
*  We're not in that business. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8631.82s)]
*  That's not our business. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8632.66s)]
*  But he was just happy because his choice wasn't he didn't want this other dog [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8634.34s)]
*  or saying didn't want another dog. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8638.42s)]
*  His biggest issue was they they they couldn't let go of that dog. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8639.82s)]
*  Number one and number two. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8644.26s)]
*  But they didn't want that dog to suffer. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8645.74s)]
*  They didn't want to say for our selfish means, right. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8647.34s)]
*  You're already suffering. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8650.539999999999s)]
*  We want you to go be put to sleep and have pieces taken like Frankenstein. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8651.5s)]
*  Pieces of you. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8654.78s)]
*  And so the fact that we could just take a blood draw, the dog didn't even notice. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8655.74s)]
*  We took the blood draw. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8658.46s)]
*  I was like totally awake, just sitting right there while we did it. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8659.06s)]
*  And, you know, he was happy with that. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8661.42s)]
*  So I think these were the dogs going to be reincarnated into a higher level of existence. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8663.06s)]
*  You stop it and put it on this like. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8667.74s)]
*  Yeah. So that's not exactly our business. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8670.34s)]
*  So you know what I'm saying? [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8672.94s)]
*  I do. I think it's all we don't really exactly know what life is. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8673.94s)]
*  No, we don't. We definitely don't know life. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8677.9s)]
*  And here's one thing that his his assistant told my chief of staff. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8679.74s)]
*  He said to her, he's like, you know, it's weird. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8684.5s)]
*  I didn't think it was the same dog at all. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8686.34s)]
*  And it's definitely not the same dog. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8687.74s)]
*  He's like, he goes and sits in the same place, which isn't like it's not like in front of a window on its bed. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8689.58s)]
*  Right. I don't know the exact place, but it would always go sit in the exact same place. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8695.3s)]
*  The other dog said. So there's weird stuff. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8698.34s)]
*  We don't understand that would creep me out. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8699.82s)]
*  Because Marshall has very specific places where he sleeps. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8702.54s)]
*  And if that happens, yeah, it would creep me out. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8705.34s)]
*  Yeah. So I've had other dogs stay at my house and my older daughter's dog stay at my house. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8707.3s)]
*  And that dog didn't go to that same spot. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8711.98s)]
*  It's not like this is one spot that's warmer or cooler. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8714.42s)]
*  Yeah. Like it's the same thing. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8717.14s)]
*  I was like, my dog, Ken, he if he like gets on like he only wants to sleep on my feet. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8718.3s)]
*  If I fall asleep on the couch, he's cool. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8723.619999999999s)]
*  He won't sleep on my feet. He just wants to sleep on me. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8725.42s)]
*  And that's not comfortable for him. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8727.58s)]
*  Because I'm like kicking him and everything. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8728.619999999999s)]
*  But that's just where he wants to sleep. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8729.779999999999s)]
*  They want to be in contact. Yeah. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8730.939999999999s)]
*  My dog watches TV with me. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8732.34s)]
*  Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8733.699999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I thought we. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8735.14s)]
*  Yeah. And we didn't even teach it this. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8736.939999999999s)]
*  But but when we say security at our house, our dogs just lose it like Ken just loses his mind. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8738.42s)]
*  He just just runs to the door. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8742.58s)]
*  He runs the front door, runs the back door, for the side doors. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8744.699999999999s)]
*  Yeah. What kind of dog? [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8747.019999999999s)]
*  They're just mutts. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8748.34s)]
*  So I have Barbie and Ken. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8749.14s)]
*  They're just two little weird mutts. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8750.14s)]
*  But we named them before the movie. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8752.259999999998s)]
*  It's just a weird thing to take that dog. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8753.98s)]
*  And I think also for kids, like the thing is like kids, the loss is so devastating. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8756.9s)]
*  Yeah. But it's also good to teach them those things. [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8761.22s)]
*  Yeah. I think loss is important. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8763.699999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I think loss is important. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8765.539999999999s)]
*  I don't want to. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8766.859999999999s)]
*  You know, I only I'm new to this whole father thing. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8767.539999999999s)]
*  But, you know, I think it's important that they understand that there's real there's real things [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8770.22s)]
*  and there's consequences to decisions. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8774.779999999999s)]
*  And we're going to age and we've got a limited time. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8777.060000000001s)]
*  I think that in his lifetime, it will be massively accelerated. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8779.54s)]
*  But I think that's important. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8783.1s)]
*  And, you know, that is one of the things, though, I think having a kid, [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8784.26s)]
*  you know, and also all of these kids and parents that have been sending us pictures of mammoths [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8787.82s)]
*  and thylacines and dodos and hopefully now direwolves is something that's exciting [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8792.300000000001s)]
*  because we get these handwritten notes from kids. Right. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8797.18s)]
*  So like on our shittiest day at Colossal, when someone says whatever or whatever [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8799.380000000001s)]
*  and we get or an experiment doesn't work or whatever bad happens. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8805.099999999999s)]
*  And you look at this pile of kids photos and teachers like we have this this there's a teacher [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8808.939999999999s)]
*  named Katie from Florida who sent us a letter in and literally like like 40 pictures of mammoths. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8814.859999999999s)]
*  And in that letter, she goes, my kids won't be quiet. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8820.699999999999s)]
*  We're in this like a tension war with everything. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8823.58s)]
*  My kids won't be quiet. I start talking about Colossal. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8826.34s)]
*  I showed the wooly mouse. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8828.779999999999s)]
*  They all want to just talk about it. They just zone in. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8830.14s)]
*  Right. Because it's interesting. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8832.539999999999s)]
*  It's interesting. And kids. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8833.58s)]
*  And so I think this is a time that we can use technologies for human health care for good. [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8834.98s)]
*  We can use technologies for conservation for good. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8839.38s)]
*  And we can help ecosystem with bringing back extinct species. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8841.38s)]
*  But I think that we can also like inspire the next generation. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8844.42s)]
*  Like, don't we want to preach hope? [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8847.62s)]
*  We're on this 24 7 psycho news cycle. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8849.78s)]
*  Right. Like that wasn't around when I was a kid or when I C.S. Lewis first started talking about this. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8853.62s)]
*  Like, what what year was C.S. Lewis alive? [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8859.02s)]
*  But he had a quote about I have saved it. [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8862.06s)]
*  He had a quote about the just getting all the dire information of the world all the time sent to you all the time, [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8864.98s)]
*  which at his time back then, that was very new. [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8874.82s)]
*  That was a completely new thing. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8878.859999999999s)]
*  And this idea of these 24 hour news cycles, right? [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8881.06s)]
*  You know, like there's actually a law in the UK. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8884.06s)]
*  You'll this is this blew my mind. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8886.66s)]
*  There's a law in the UK that they cannot tell. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8888.66s)]
*  They cannot report on a piece if it has any degree of social impact that they don't tell the negative side. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8891.06s)]
*  I was like, so what happens if it's like you? [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8899.380000000001s)]
*  So if there's someone saves a kitten from a tree, you have to get the dog's perspective. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8900.58s)]
*  Like, and they're like, yes, and they're dead serious. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8904.5s)]
*  Oh, that's so ridiculous. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8907.380000000001s)]
*  So it's like as like there can be stories that are just negative and there can be stories that are just positive. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8908.7s)]
*  That's OK. [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8913.18s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're going to have very lively debate that's always going to happen with something that's so groundbreaking like what you're doing. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8914.02s)]
*  But I also think it's inevitable. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8922.02s)]
*  I think human beings have this inescapable desire for innovation. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8923.82s)]
*  Right. And it's going to apply to biology, just like it applies to electronics. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8929.82s)]
*  And you can't do anything about it. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8934.02s)]
*  You can have debates about it. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8936.26s)]
*  And we should we should have you should you know, what you guys are doing is great. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8937.9s)]
*  You've got the dire wolves fenced off. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8941.380000000001s)]
*  You're very careful. You're monitoring them. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8943.18s)]
*  It's great. It's going to happen. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8944.9s)]
*  It's going to happen. And at least you're transparent about it. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8946.9s)]
*  Yeah. Like at least this is not happening in Russia where they're making super wolves that only eat Americans. [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8949.14s)]
*  Yeah. And they and they train and they train them with DNA to only eat. [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8954.42s)]
*  But that's probably going to happen, too. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8957.66s)]
*  This is just we're going to face unique problems no matter what we do, because technology is allowing people to do things that are unprecedented, including change what it means to be an actual person. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8959.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's synthetic biology and really kind of the intersection between compute AI and synthetic biology being able to engineer genes, engineer life. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8970.46s)]
*  I think that we are at the doorstep of, you know, everyone's very, very worried about AI. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8980.66s)]
*  But I do think that synthetic biology is in that camp. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8985.3s)]
*  I think it's yes. It's like discovering fire. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8987.82s)]
*  It's the God Camp. Yeah, it's all it's all falling into the same thing. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8990.38s)]
*  And then when you add to that incredible computing power that's going to be available with quantum computing. [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8994.14s)]
*  Yeah. And then you have new technologies that are going to emerge from AI using quantum computing. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=8999.5s)]
*  And then the interface at all, like the rolling stuff and everything. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9006.06s)]
*  It's just going to get you know, we interfaces are crazy because we had that gentleman, Noah, the first guy who got it. [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9008.98s)]
*  And he said he has an aimbot in his head. [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9014.14s)]
*  So like when he plays games, he's he's got a crazy advantage because where he looks is where the cursor goes. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9016.419999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Like instantaneously. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9022.22s)]
*  So he could shoot things like he's not going to miss. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9023.82s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, we are living in a weird time. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9026.419999999998s)]
*  But it's the weirdest time. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9028.94s)]
*  It's the weirdest time that people have ever been through. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9030.34s)]
*  And we're at the door. [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9032.380000000001s)]
*  We haven't even gone into the no, no. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9034.300000000001s)]
*  That's what I say. Right. Wild. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9035.78s)]
*  That's what I say about synthetic biology. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9036.980000000001s)]
*  Right. So like, you know, the ability to like engineer drought resistant crops or a vaccine or grow or regrow our hair or, you know, make mammoths. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9038.380000000001s)]
*  That's today. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9047.300000000001s)]
*  We can't even think about what's tomorrow. [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9048.660000000002s)]
*  We spun out a company from Colossal called Breaking last year. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9050.140000000001s)]
*  And this incredible group at the Institute discovered an enzyme from the Amazon that actually breaks down any type of plastic you give it to. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9055.62s)]
*  And not making smaller plastics, not making microplastics, which are fucking terrible, but actually breaks the chemical. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9064.62s)]
*  That's why I need it breaking. [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9070.82s)]
*  It actually breaks the chemical bonds of plastic and just produces biomass as a thing. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9071.98s)]
*  Well, guess what? You know, so it takes things that have broken down never and has got it down into years. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9076.74s)]
*  We are used now computational biology and synthetic biology to engineer it. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9083.3s)]
*  So now that it's in, you know, 22 months and I think that we can get it down to two weeks. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9088.1s)]
*  And so that will be huge for the plastic problem because we can all say that we're going to change hearts and minds and use different types of plastics. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9092.939999999999s)]
*  But we still have the existing plastics here. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9098.779999999999s)]
*  We have to do something about it. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9100.74s)]
*  So so I do think there's even industrial use cases coming out of synthetic biology that like 10 years ago, someone said we give you magic my magic microbe that can you can put into that and you can just throw any of your plastics in there. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9101.619999999999s)]
*  And you can throw, you know, salads and other stuff there and it won't even touch it. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9113.1s)]
*  You know, that would have sounded like science fiction. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9117.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9119.82s)]
*  Ten years ago. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9120.1s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9120.859999999999s)]
*  And so now you said it's down to a couple of months. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9122.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's 22 months right now. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9124.66s)]
*  So we're talking about like not just like your water bottle, your water bottle. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9126.98s)]
*  But you're also talking about things that are like industrial defense plastics that are like, you know, radiation hardened and whatnot for space. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9131.38s)]
*  Like we're throwing some pretty hard stuff. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9137.779999999999s)]
*  What about those stupid fucking windmills that they have to change? [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9139.78s)]
*  They actually have a landfills for windmills and they also have a bigger negative carbon impact than they make. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9144.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9150.62s)]
*  And they don't barely make any electricity. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9150.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9152.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9152.86s)]
*  They kill livestock or they kill they kill animals, kill birds. [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9153.18s)]
*  They disrupt. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9155.66s)]
*  We they disrupt. [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9157.42s)]
*  They also disrupt migratory patterns of birds. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9158.82s)]
*  Of course they do. [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9160.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9161.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9161.82s)]
*  You can't fly into that. [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9162.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9163.18s)]
*  And they're all and they're all made with plastic and plastic polymers. [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9163.5s)]
*  And then they have to get rid of them. [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9166.26s)]
*  And then the only place to put them is in a landfill. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9167.78s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9170.740000000002s)]
*  So break. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9171.78s)]
*  So that's why we started breaking. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9172.5s)]
*  So wow. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9174.060000000001s)]
*  So these microbes would be able to break that down. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9174.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9176.900000000001s)]
*  I mean, we haven't tested on that specific, but like one of the biggest ones that we tested on was was nylon just because there's so much. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9177.1s)]
*  If you look at like what's in the ocean, a vast majority of it is nylon from just discarded fishing nets. [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9183.02s)]
*  Oh, that makes sense. [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9189.18s)]
*  So we looked at nylon as one of our first use cases and then we're doing water treatment plants and a few others. [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9190.42s)]
*  So if we get if we get the point that we could do filtration on microplastics at the treatment level, right, because all that's passing through right now, like in our drinking water and everything. [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9195.1s)]
*  That's why you have to have these massive you have to like the three layer osmosis devices and whatnot for water. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9203.94s)]
*  You've got to do Gary got me any water machine. [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9210.140000000001s)]
*  So but you have to do those types of things because the microplastics and then the chlorine and other stuff still passes through a lot of the existing materials. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9214.26s)]
*  So when you're doing this, is this something that you could release like in the ocean itself or would you have to worry then about the effect like bringing the house cats to Australia? [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9222.820000000002s)]
*  No, it dies. [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9231.54s)]
*  It only eats this like this is what they always say right before it fucks up. [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9232.62s)]
*  I don't worry about it. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9237.300000000001s)]
*  But with but with a distribution in the wild of something like that, you have to go through EPA. [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9238.26s)]
*  There's a lot of testing that you have to do. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9242.460000000001s)]
*  So you could do that testing and then conceivably dump it on the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9244.78s)]
*  So I don't know based on heat and salinity and whatnot right now, it's working in bio reactors. [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9249.66s)]
*  So I don't over promise and say we just go sprinkler and go today. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9254.460000000001s)]
*  But that's a long term goal. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9258.18s)]
*  Right. So but that's the power of you know, we used AI and computational analysis of this microbe that's found in nature. [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9259.58s)]
*  And then we said, let's supercharge it just like supercharging the calls. [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9267.34s)]
*  Right. And so but that's the process of using it outside of contained systems like a bioreactor has to be. [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9271.300000000001s)]
*  Done very thoughtfully and measure just like rewilding. [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9279.02s)]
*  Right. Like this is where some of us who get confused about like the else and stuff. [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9281.94s)]
*  They didn't just open the gate and throw some wolves in there. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9285.140000000001s)]
*  I mean, it sounds like they did more of that in Colorado. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9287.62s)]
*  But they there's typically a very thoughtful and measured process that you have to go through. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9289.78s)]
*  Right. Because there's intended consequences which you get excited about. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9294.140000000001s)]
*  But then there's a shit ton of unintended consequences if you're not careful. [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9297.82s)]
*  Yeah. Synthetic biology is that is that it's an AI level thing that we need to be worried about. [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9301.18s)]
*  And how many different nations are working on this stuff? [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9307.82s)]
*  So I think that the U.S. is by far the most advanced from a synthetic biology perspective. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9311.3s)]
*  It is a major directive of China, you know, not just sequencing and biobanking because they're biobank. [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9317.34s)]
*  We we do not have a nationalized biobanking process here. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9322.94s)]
*  That's one of the things I I was meeting in Washington about. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9326.26s)]
*  But China does. China is going like we see them in Africa where they'll make donations to a university or school and say, oh, [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9331.42s)]
*  but we're going to take blood samples from all of your animals around here. [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9337.18s)]
*  You guys are cool. Right. So they are doing this. Right. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9339.78s)]
*  So they're looking for insights in animals. They're looking for that data. [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9342.06s)]
*  They're also trying to build like today's Noah's Ark. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9344.380000000001s)]
*  And so so China is for sure. [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9347.06s)]
*  There's some countries it's harder like the European Union's harder to do anything because they they've kind of put a moratorium on GMOs or genetically modified organisms. [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9349.14s)]
*  But, you know, we've been making GMOs for a long time. [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9359.42s)]
*  Like you've ever seen a pug. Like we've just done it pretty inefficiently. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9362.300000000001s)]
*  Right. We we can be smarter and actually have a better understanding of those intended consequences now through AI and software. [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9365.220000000001s)]
*  Probably we're going to have dire wolves guarding the house. [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9371.74s)]
*  No. In a hundred years, they're not open to 100 percent. [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9374.220000000001s)]
*  They're going to get your technology. [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9377.54s)]
*  They're going to sell it and people going to be in wooly mammoth steaks while the dire wolves guard their house. [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9379.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's not the future that I that I hope for. [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9384.380000000001s)]
*  I'm more of an optimist. [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9387.18s)]
*  So I kind of believe in the general good of humanity. [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9388.300000000001s)]
*  Of course. Your company, your company is fucking the whole world up. [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9390.9s)]
*  You have to think that way. I'm just kidding. [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9393.86s)]
*  But it is weird. [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9395.66s)]
*  It's a it's a weird venture. [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9396.82s)]
*  Yeah. You're going down a very bizarre path, but it's so fascinating. [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9398.86s)]
*  I'm so glad you're doing it because it's so interesting. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9402.06s)]
*  And we're learning a lot. Right. [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9404.779999999999s)]
*  And the application of that learning could allow us to save many species. [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9405.82s)]
*  Right. Yeah. And I think that. [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9409.779999999999s)]
*  Do you think there could ever be a time? [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9411.22s)]
*  Well, there's no DNA from the dinosaurs. [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9412.82s)]
*  Right. So would it be possible that with future technology there would be some way to get around that? [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9415.1s)]
*  So so the closest you get from a dino DNA perspective is that there is ways that you can do demineralization of bones and get amino acids. [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9420.62s)]
*  So like the smallest building blocks possible, you don't know where they go. [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9432.42s)]
*  Right. I think that it's not possible to de-extinct a dinosaur. [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9435.460000000001s)]
*  I do think at some point you could use AI and software to do an ancestral state reconstruction, looking at kind of what we know about birds, what we know about reptiles and kind of where they branch. [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9439.54s)]
*  You could make one. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9448.660000000002s)]
*  I think you'd. [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9449.74s)]
*  Wasn't that one of the things they did in Jurassic Park? [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9450.78s)]
*  That's what they did. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9452.7s)]
*  A dinosaur that didn't exist before the big giant one. [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9453.1s)]
*  The their a dominus rex. [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9455.54s)]
*  Right. That was something they created. [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9458.34s)]
*  That's something they created. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9459.66s)]
*  Right. And so I think from a genome engineer, from a technology and genome engineering perspective, that is eventually possible. [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9460.9s)]
*  So they could easily make a T-Rex without. [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9468.58s)]
*  I wouldn't say easily. [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9472.02s)]
*  Yeah, but they could. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9473.22s)]
*  It's a future state. [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9474.54s)]
*  At some future state, I think we'll have like, you know, the CAD software biology where you can engineer almost anything. [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9476.1s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9481.3s)]
*  I mean, that's just where the technologies go. [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9482.019999999999s)]
*  Right. The better. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9483.939999999999s)]
*  And you said it best when you brought up quantum. [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9484.619999999999s)]
*  If quantum is only two years away every two years, I hear. [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9486.779999999999s)]
*  But eventually, when it works and works at scale and you have that coupled with, you know, where some of these companies like X.A.I. [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9489.82s)]
*  and others are taking it, I think the merger of that plus synthetic biology will allow us to do all kinds of stuff. [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9498.42s)]
*  And it will be in and look, it will be in nefarious hands. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9504.98s)]
*  Like, let's let's just be real. [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9507.78s)]
*  Be real. Nuclear weapons are in nefarious hands. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9509.220000000001s)]
*  Right. Nuclear weapons are in good guys hands. [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9511.74s)]
*  Right. And so this is nuclear weapons. [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9513.9s)]
*  And I think that you have to be just because it exists. [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9516.02s)]
*  We can't put our head in the sand and say, oh, we just can't let it be because it does exist. [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9518.58s)]
*  And I don't know if you saw this, but this was like it's like five years. [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9523.42s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9527.060000000001s)]
*  That is like seven years ago. [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9527.62s)]
*  People in China, companies in China and the government in China were using facial recognition technology to profile people of certain subset of race. [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9529.5s)]
*  Right. And they were they were doing bad things with facial. [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9539.5s)]
*  Right. Well, the San Francisco government, where a lot of where a lot of the funding came from Silicon Valley for a lot of tech startups, they said not not not at a nationwide level, but in Silicon Valley, San Francisco says we will not at all support any technology. [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9542.140000000001s)]
*  We're going to ban investing in facial recognition technology. [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9557.980000000001s)]
*  Well, that's just dumb. Right. [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9560.460000000001s)]
*  Because we now know there's things like deepfakes and all this stuff. [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9561.7s)]
*  But it's like that's setting American innovation back because someone's doing something bad with it. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9564.1s)]
*  Right. That's like saying, oh, my gosh, they have guns. [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9568.86s)]
*  We should never develop guns. [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9571.78s)]
*  Right. Like it's just it's a it's a bad philosophy when it comes to technology. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9573.060000000001s)]
*  And so, you know, I think the same way about synthetic biology. [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9576.900000000001s)]
*  The world is currently the United States is the leader in synthetic biology. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9580.18s)]
*  And we've got national treasures like George Church, my co-founder and others. [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9584.220000000001s)]
*  And I hope that we continue to be the world's leader. [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9587.94s)]
*  But I do think other countries have different ethical boundaries than we do. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9591.140000000001s)]
*  And they will experiment on kids. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9594.74s)]
*  But it's interesting also that you're a company. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9596.18s)]
*  This isn't the government. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9598.7s)]
*  This is just a group of people and investors that have decided to do this. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9600.02s)]
*  And you've been able to do it here in America. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9605.900000000001s)]
*  But do you know what is going on in other countries? [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9608.140000000001s)]
*  Or is this a tightly guarded secret? [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9611.980000000001s)]
*  So, I mean, we know obviously you're you have to. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9615.34s)]
*  People I'm sorry to interrupt. [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9617.86s)]
*  No, no, no, no. In your company as well. [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9619.060000000001s)]
*  And I'm sure there's an understanding of what they're doing. [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9621.66s)]
*  Yeah. So it's good. It's you must be being studied. [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9625.86s)]
*  Yeah. Other countries. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9628.82s)]
*  Yeah, we definitely and we have investment by In-Q-Tel. [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9629.94s)]
*  Right. So I'm sure that makes us more of a target. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9633.980000000001s)]
*  Hmm. So, yeah. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9636.26s)]
*  So, I mean, we do work closely with the DOD and IC quickly. [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9638.34s)]
*  It's just when you think about it a hundred years from now, a thousand years from now, [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9642.54s)]
*  when you scale this out, there's no limit to what could be done with life. [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9645.9s)]
*  That's so strange. Yeah. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9650.82s)]
*  It's so strange to think that for four plus billion years, life has evolved in a very specific pattern. [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9652.38s)]
*  On the on rails. Yeah. [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9658.9s)]
*  Yeah. And then one day. [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9660.66s)]
*  Now we say we can take the railway. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9661.94s)]
*  We want who boy. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9663.22s)]
*  And, you know, that's the grandest of all conspiracy theories is that that's that's how humans were created. [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9665.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah. That we were in here. [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9671.779999999999s)]
*  Well, either pans around or that we were engineered in place. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9673.779999999999s)]
*  The great one is the Anunnaki. [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9676.419999999998s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9677.82s)]
*  Sumerian. I will. [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9679.019999999999s)]
*  Yeah. But I will say that if you look at, you know, not to get too weird, but if you do look at the it's like Kuku Khan and folks and and if you look at some of the carvings from all over the world resembling their sky gods, there's a lot of weird similar. [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9680.339999999998s)]
*  I mean, you can't you can't objectively is like the guy with the with the with the Sphinx. [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9693.9s)]
*  Right. Was that's like, yep, that's water. [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9699.5s)]
*  I'm an expert on erosion. [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9700.939999999999s)]
*  That is water. And then they're like head of the Sphinx. [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9702.42s)]
*  Like, that's not water. Right. [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9704.46s)]
*  It's the same thing as this. [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9706.46s)]
*  You cannot look at some of the stuff and say, that's not weird. [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9707.42s)]
*  Right. You got you can't look at, like, you know, the the the incredible pyramids we have all over the world that seem to now there's like more and more discoveries. [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9710.5s)]
*  And then they get silenced. [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9719.259999999998s)]
*  It's like you can't see all that stuff and not wonder more, especially the stuff around. [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9720.42s)]
*  If you look at Mayans and then you look at, you know, stuff in the Middle East and how it looks exactly the same. [[02:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9726.580000000002s)]
*  It's very weird. [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9732.86s)]
*  It looks exactly the same. [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9733.86s)]
*  Have you been to Peru? [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9735.460000000001s)]
*  No. So that I would put, you know, because I don't want to. [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9736.660000000002s)]
*  I do not want to take you away from going and visiting the boneyard. [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9740.02s)]
*  So you totally do that. [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9743.1s)]
*  But you should also go to Peru. [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9744.140000000001s)]
*  Peru. If you like you can see Peru and you can see it's like standing in the Grand Canyon versus seeing on Google Maps. [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9745.900000000001s)]
*  Right. If you go to like Al and Tom, Alia and Tombo or whatever it's called, [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9750.94s)]
*  and you see these blocks that you can't like put a piece of paper between, you know, you can't see it. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9754.580000000002s)]
*  And you see it and they're all put together in a perfect jigsaw. [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9761.460000000001s)]
*  Oh, and by the way, they came from a type of rock and a quarry that's 2000 miles from here or whatever, [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9764.42s)]
*  however many thousands of miles from here. [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9768.78s)]
*  You can't sit there and say, well, that's weird. [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9770.220000000001s)]
*  If you don't say that's weird, then it's like you're like one of those like, you know, people that are just like, huh, you're a denier. [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9773.060000000001s)]
*  You can't say it's not weird. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9779.86s)]
*  Yeah, to say it's not weird is actually denying science. [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9781.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's the weird. [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9784.82s)]
*  So you should put Peru on your... [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9786.18s)]
*  Because when you see it, there's nothing like it. [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9788.14s)]
*  I've been fortunate to be able to travel the world. [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9790.74s)]
*  You see it and you're just like, that just doesn't make sense. [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9793.5s)]
*  The coolest thing I've ever seen is Chichen Itza. [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9796.42s)]
*  Yeah, I've been to Chichen Itza. [[02:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9798.5s)]
*  And you go there and you're like, what did you do? [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9800.22s)]
*  What did you do? How did you do this? [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9802.98s)]
*  Yeah. How did you guys do this? [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9804.42s)]
*  You know what's crazy about Chichen Itza? [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9805.58s)]
*  They don't let you go there anymore. [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9806.78s)]
*  But I don't know where, but you know, you've got all those paths with all the vendors [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9808.02s)]
*  and you see Chichen Itza. [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9811.26s)]
*  Well, there's in the jungles there on the Yucatan Peninsula, [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9812.82s)]
*  there's actually other older pyramids. [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9817.460000000001s)]
*  But the carvings that they have on Chichen Itza and the carvings they have there, [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9819.74s)]
*  they're actually the older ones have more precise carvings. [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9823.14s)]
*  But now guess what? It's not open to the public. [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9826.86s)]
*  I've seen that. I've been there. [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9830.5s)]
*  It's so frustrating. [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9831.98s)]
*  But it is such a weird world, right? [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9833.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9836.34s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'm talking to you about like hardcore genetic science. [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9836.9s)]
*  But then when you start to look at all the craziness in the archaeology, [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9840.02s)]
*  it is we don't know a lot. [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9843.18s)]
*  A lot. Yeah. [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9846.58s)]
*  And there's no way you can know a lot. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9847.54s)]
*  And any time you suggest something new, you get shit for it. [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9849.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you get a rash of shit and people try to connect you with the worst people [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9852.220000000001s)]
*  in the world, hence Graham Hancock. [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9856.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah. But I think Graham Hancock in the end, [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9858.18s)]
*  I don't know if they're, you know, kind of this advanced civilization or whatnot. [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9861.98s)]
*  But I think really smart people said things like Plato and others that were probably real. [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9867.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think they were just like playing around and like, oh, [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9872.82s)]
*  we're going to write something that's going to be in history as a joke forever. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9875.14s)]
*  You've seen the Reichardt structure? [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9877.460000000001s)]
*  Uh-uh. You ever seen that? [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9878.98s)]
*  Uh-uh. [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9880.220000000001s)]
*  This is what there's a lot of people like Jimmy Corsetti, who's this famous YouTube. [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9880.9s)]
*  I guess you would call him. [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9885.94s)]
*  I guess he'd be like, can we pull up the structure? [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9888.34s)]
*  Sure. He'd be like an ancient history enthusiast. [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9890.66s)]
*  He's a guy who studies these things and does YouTube videos on them. [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9893.34s)]
*  But the Reichardt structure is essentially Atlantis. [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9896.580000000002s)]
*  Oh, this is in the desert. [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9898.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it looks like Atlantis. [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9900.18s)]
*  There's salt all around it. [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9901.7s)]
*  It has the rings that Plato described. [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9903.380000000001s)]
*  And at one point in time, it was connected to the ocean. [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9905.820000000002s)]
*  I mean, it literally looks like Atlantis and people disputed. [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9908.140000000001s)]
*  Have people gone and studied it there? [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9911.42s)]
*  Well, it's a very difficult place to get to, and it's also very dangerous. [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9913.42s)]
*  So people have studied it, but there hasn't been like large scale archaeological digs there. [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9917.26s)]
*  The whole Sub-Saharan Africa thing is so fascinating. [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9924.3s)]
*  They find whales there. [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9926.78s)]
*  I mean, they know that it was lush rainforest while human beings were alive. [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9928.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9934.06s)]
*  And there hasn't been like large scale exploration of what's in that ground. [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9934.460000000001s)]
*  And it's immense. [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9939.66s)]
*  I do think that the younger dry stuff is also a combination of, I think, generally [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9940.98s)]
*  speaking, if you break down the younger driest period into that rapid cooling, [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9947.06s)]
*  I think the vast majority of people say some of it, some of the destruction [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9952.58s)]
*  or some of the destruction around Megafauna was anthropologic, [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9957.3s)]
*  which I'll give it some percentage. [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9960.34s)]
*  Then I think a lot of people agree on this flood theory. [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9962.02s)]
*  Anthropologic meaning human beings killed them. [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9965.86s)]
*  Yes, humans had some impact on it. [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9968.22s)]
*  Right. [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9970.3s)]
*  I think that even more people agree that there was this massive flood that occurred [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9971.02s)]
*  and that could have been a global level flood with rushing waters and sea rising [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9977.94s)]
*  whatnot. And then you've got what caused that flood, most likely [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9985.54s)]
*  astrological or meteorological. [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9990.820000000002s)]
*  And then they combine that with core samples that show large levels of iridium. [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9992.54s)]
*  Yeah, which only exists when you have certain levels of heat at certain [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9995.74s)]
*  index. It's like that nuclear glass or whatever you find. [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=9999.26s)]
*  Iridium is actually different. [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10003.86s)]
*  Iridium is actually very common in space. [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10005.5s)]
*  And there's a layer. [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10008.54s)]
*  Yeah, there's a silta. [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10009.820000000002s)]
*  That's right. [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10010.78s)]
*  The micro diamonds. [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10011.220000000001s)]
*  But they have those too as well. [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10012.460000000001s)]
*  Trinitite. [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10014.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah, trinitite. [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10014.94s)]
*  That's what it is. [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10015.62s)]
*  Yeah, that's what it is. [[02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10016.34s)]
*  From the Trinity explosion, they discovered it there. [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10017.62s)]
*  They find these little micro... [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10020.26s)]
*  There's 100 percent there was impacts. [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10021.7s)]
*  That's a fact. [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10024.380000000001s)]
*  And they also know when the meteor shower, and this is a thing that they study, [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10025.5s)]
*  when we go through this comet shower and that that's... [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10029.740000000002s)]
*  But you remember probably 10, 20 years ago, if you brought up the idea of a worldwide [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10032.460000000001s)]
*  flood, they would just be like, oh, you're a fundamentalist Christian. [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10037.26s)]
*  Can't talk to you ever again. [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10040.02s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10040.86s)]
*  Oh, water canopy. [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10041.58s)]
*  You're weird. [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10042.58s)]
*  Don't talk to me again. [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10043.06s)]
*  I know. [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10043.98s)]
*  And now it's like, well, maybe there was a giant flood. [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10044.62s)]
*  Maybe it wasn't just a regional flood. [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10047.82s)]
*  Right. [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10049.54s)]
*  Maybe it was done by impacts of comets. [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10050.06s)]
*  That's what brings me to the weird ones. [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10052.94s)]
*  When you go back to the Vedic texts and you're like, what was the Vimanas? [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10054.82s)]
*  What were these flying vehicles that they had? [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10059.9s)]
*  What was Ezekiel talking about in the Bible? [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10063.22s)]
*  Have you seen that stuff when... [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10066.14s)]
*  Have you seen those videos in the last... [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10067.46s)]
*  that have come out in the last year when there was the most recent UAP craze, [[02:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10070.06s)]
*  and they'd show it and it looked like crazy ball lightning? [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10075.98s)]
*  It almost looked like those things that you'd put your hands on your head and stand up. [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10078.34s)]
*  Right. [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10081.699999999999s)]
*  And then they compare some of those to paintings from like 500, 700 years ago. [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10082.14s)]
*  Let me stop you there because a lot of those crazy balls of light... [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10089.46s)]
*  Were all fake? [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10092.58s)]
*  No, you can just zoom in on Venus. [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10093.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10096.74s)]
*  And that's what you get. [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10097.06s)]
*  Cool. [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10097.9s)]
*  You zoom in on stars and you get this sort of bizarre distorted image. [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10098.34s)]
*  Have you seen those? [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10103.46s)]
*  Uh-uh. [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10103.98s)]
*  Find zoomed in stars. [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10104.42s)]
*  I think they did it with the North Star. [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10109.74s)]
*  They've done it with several stars. [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10111.3s)]
*  But if you zoom in with the highest level of these telephoto lenses from Earth, [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10112.9s)]
*  you can get that sort of distorted, weird effect. [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10118.9s)]
*  Because you're looking through the atmosphere. [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10122.78s)]
*  I've always seen this stuff on the internet until I was in Wellington, New Zealand, [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10124.78s)]
*  when I was with Peter. [[02:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10128.78s)]
*  Peter, his house on Wellington is like on a body of water, once they were. [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10129.98s)]
*  And we were talking, of course, like the conversation went to ghosts and UFOs because like... [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10134.06s)]
*  Oh, you've seen them? [[02:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10139.34s)]
*  No, I haven't seen them in person. [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10140.300000000001s)]
*  I've seen them on his iPhone. [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10141.9s)]
*  This wasn't like a telescopic lens. [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10143.86s)]
*  This is an iPhone and it looks exactly like what you see, I guess, on the zoom ends. [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10146.460000000001s)]
*  But that's the thing about zooming in. [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10151.18s)]
*  See, the thing is, like these are planets that people have zoomed in on. [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10153.78s)]
*  But there's weirder ones where like there's video of it. [[02:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10158.74s)]
*  And so it looks like it's moving. [[02:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10162.5s)]
*  Yeah, here we go. [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10166.02s)]
*  Like, look at that. [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10167.380000000001s)]
*  I'll have to see. [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10168.94s)]
*  But you see what I'm saying? [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10169.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10170.66s)]
*  Like this is a perfect example. [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10171.02s)]
*  So this is a star in the night sky with a Nikon P900. [[02:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10172.7s)]
*  So is that 900X, Jamie? [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10177.18s)]
*  What is that? [[02:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10180.18s)]
*  Can you talk in the mic? [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10181.939999999999s)]
*  Just the model number. [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10183.019999999999s)]
*  I have no idea what that means. [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10183.859999999999s)]
*  So what would you think that the amount of... [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10184.9s)]
*  I don't know, 10X, 100X? [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10187.98s)]
*  I have no idea. [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10189.019999999999s)]
*  OK, so but do you see how they're having a hard time zooming in on it? [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10190.06s)]
*  Because it's a handheld, I think. [[02:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10194.34s)]
*  But look how weird it is. [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10196.619999999999s)]
*  It looks so weird. [[02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10197.58s)]
*  It's how it's moving around like you say, oh my God, you found a UFO. [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10198.18s)]
*  But it's not. It's just a star. [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10201.14s)]
*  Well, I do hate that every UFO video is blurry. [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10202.619999999999s)]
*  Well, you know, I mean, that could be. [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10206.42s)]
*  If you want to get into the whole how put off perspective, [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10209.26s)]
*  who's this brilliant physicist? [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10213.42s)]
*  Yeah, he's on a lot of papers. [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10215.02s)]
*  Yeah, he explained it to me. [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10216.1s)]
*  He thinks there's some sort of gravity distortion that's around it. [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10217.7s)]
*  So this isn't that this is that particular camera. [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10221.06s)]
*  So this is is this not a very... [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10224.1s)]
*  But is it that so that's a seven hundred seventy seven hundred [[02:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10227.58s)]
*  and forty nine dollar camera on Amazon. [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10230.54s)]
*  So I'll see if Peter will give me that. [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10233.380000000001s)]
*  I'm sure it would. And I'll send to you because it's just weird to see. [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10235.380000000001s)]
*  Oh, they're weird. [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10238.14s)]
*  No, I'm not saying this is like not zoomed in. [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10238.820000000002s)]
*  His wife's next to him. [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10242.26s)]
*  I am not denying I have never people are seeing things, [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10243.900000000001s)]
*  but I'm not saying that they're real. [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10247.140000000001s)]
*  What I'm saying is that kind of evidence of that that star, [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10249.02s)]
*  if you didn't know any better and send it to you, oh my God, you found a UFO. [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10253.220000000001s)]
*  You'd be like, holy fucking shit, it's real. [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10256.58s)]
*  Look at that. It's undeniable. [[02:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10258.820000000002s)]
*  Look at the energy around it. [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10260.060000000001s)]
*  With how put off believes is that there's some sort of distortion around these [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10261.26s)]
*  things that's allowing them to be transmedium to go through the ocean. [[02:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10266.060000000001s)]
*  That's all the yeah, that's that's all they're like zero point energy and right. [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10269.62s)]
*  And moving and in gravitational wave type stuff. [[02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10275.1s)]
*  Do you go deep on this? [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10278.380000000001s)]
*  I get I get a little bored. [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10279.460000000001s)]
*  It gets boring because there's no real resolution. [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10281.5s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10283.9s)]
*  You could lose your mind. [[02:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10284.62s)]
*  But I had dinner with Jacques Valle and how put off once and a couple of the [[02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10285.7s)]
*  gentlemen and they were explaining the state of the technology, like what they [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10289.9s)]
*  think is currently available and what they think these things are using. [[02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10293.94s)]
*  I did these guys. [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10297.82s)]
*  I did a call with I did a call with I got into that crowd for a while [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10298.74s)]
*  and before I started Colossal and I knew a bunch of those folks. [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10303.1s)]
*  So I talked to Lou, I talked to how I did a Zoom with how or what you imagine what [[02:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10308.94s)]
*  we are now, where we are, what you're describing in terms of technology that's [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10313.980000000001s)]
*  emerging right now and we have dire wolves today in twenty five. [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10318.5s)]
*  Yes. And now imagine this five thousand years advanced. [[02:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10321.580000000002s)]
*  And you're probably looking at that. [[02:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10325.300000000001s)]
*  If we are being visited, that's what you're probably looking at. [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10327.820000000002s)]
*  Yeah. It's not. [[02:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10330.580000000002s)]
*  And if you look at the exponential rate of our technology curve, it's it's not that far. [[02:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10330.94s)]
*  Now imagine the monkeying that you guys have done with dire wolves. [[02:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10335.54s)]
*  I wouldn't say it's monkeying. [[02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10339.34s)]
*  It's a little monkey. [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10340.34s)]
*  The selective precision genome engineering. [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10341.220000000001s)]
*  Amazing stuff you've done with dire wolves. [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10343.54s)]
*  I'm just being silly. [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10345.820000000002s)]
*  But imagine doing that to primitive hominids. [[02:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10346.980000000001s)]
*  Now, if you were an insanely advanced species from another dimension of the planet, [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10350.300000000001s)]

*  and you come down here and you see Australia Pythagoras, you know, [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10359.66s)]
*  trying to figure out how to make a spear. [[02:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10363.5s)]
*  Yeah. And you say, listen, let's put a little bit of this. [[02:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10365.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah. A little bit of that. [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10369.18s)]
*  I told you one edit makes five thousand, you know, confers five thousand [[02:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10370.380000000001s)]
*  resistance to neurotoxin. So it's like a couple of edits here. [[02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10376.460000000001s)]
*  It does a lot. And then there's the other theory that what we're looking at is human [[02:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10378.78s)]
*  beings from the future. And if you think about what's happening to human beings, [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10382.060000000001s)]
*  we're becoming less and less stout and muscular. [[02:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10385.66s)]
*  And we're becoming more and more less and less reliant on muscle. [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10388.02s)]
*  Yeah. And our heads are getting bigger. [[02:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10391.7s)]
*  That's them. Yeah. [[02:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10393.86s)]
*  I mean, I read that. I read that theory, too. [[02:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10395.34s)]
*  It's a bizarre archetype. [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10397.300000000001s)]
*  It's a very strange thing that people keep seeing over and over and over again. [[02:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10399.060000000001s)]
*  It's very weird that there's a bunch of different versions of life that they [[02:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10402.74s)]
*  allegedly see. [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10408.22s)]
*  I go down those rabbit holes because I mean, I just think once again, going back to [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10410.14s)]
*  like the stuff of like Kukukan and Anunnaki and all of this, all this stuff. [[02:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10413.539999999999s)]
*  It's just the Anunnaki stuff. [[02:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10419.18s)]
*  It's just so strange. [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10420.539999999999s)]
*  And how you have certain things that are aligned to celestial. [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10423.14s)]
*  You're like, yeah, but they could have picked a lot of constellations. [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10426.939999999999s)]
*  Why did they all pick the Pleiades or whatever it is? [[02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10430.22s)]
*  Right. Right. Why did they do that? [[02:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10432.58s)]
*  And also, how did the fucking ancient Sumerians have a detailed map of the [[02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10434.060000000001s)]
*  solar system? Insanely detailed. [[02:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10438.220000000001s)]
*  From six thousand years ago. [[02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10440.54s)]
*  How? Yeah. [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10442.9s)]
*  And also be able to predict well enough of where it was going, knowing that we [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10443.94s)]
*  were moving through space. [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10447.78s)]
*  Yeah. Also have these giant things with little monkey people on their laps. [[02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10448.94s)]
*  Yeah. Like, what are you saying? [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10453.1s)]
*  Yeah. There's weird. [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10454.82s)]
*  I think the cool thing about this, but think take a step back. [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10456.1s)]
*  Even though a lot of times people like Graham Hancock and others are ridiculed [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10459.82s)]
*  about it, like in we get ridiculed even for the actual science that we're doing [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10462.74s)]
*  improving every day. [[02:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10467.46s)]
*  At the end of the day, it is still cool and it's interesting. [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10468.5s)]
*  Like, I want I guess I don't want to live in a society or a universe where [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10471.98s)]
*  everything's figured out every day. [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10475.9s)]
*  Yes. It's amazing. [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10477.22s)]
*  And we're figuring out amazing things. [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10478.38s)]
*  Well, unlike you, I don't have the burden of being taken seriously. [[02:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10480.66s)]
*  And that's great for discussing. [[02:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10486.5s)]
*  Ridiculous. You can go. [[02:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10488.86s)]
*  That's awesome. It is great. [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10490.46s)]
*  It's super interesting. [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10492.42s)]
*  But I think that's why so many people subscribe to your podcast is because one [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10493.140000000001s)]
*  minute you'll talk to a comedian in a UFC fighter and the next time you're talking [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10497.380000000001s)]
*  to someone that knows more about like the ancient flood than anyone in the world. [[02:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10500.34s)]
*  And that's cool. It is cool. [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10504.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's very fascinating. [[02:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10506.18s)]
*  And we should have conversations. [[02:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10508.060000000001s)]
*  Yes. And the world is filled with so many fascinating things that are all happening [[02:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10509.34s)]
*  at the same time. Yeah. [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10513.26s)]
*  And it's almost I mean, and you can get lost. [[02:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10514.460000000001s)]
*  Like we're talking about with the C.S. Lewis quote. [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10517.140000000001s)]
*  Did you ever find that? [[02:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10519.300000000001s)]
*  I don't. I couldn't. [[02:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10520.380000000001s)]
*  You talked about getting the news. [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10521.740000000002s)]
*  What year was C.S. Lewis alive? [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10523.820000000002s)]
*  Oh, 1898. [[02:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10525.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10527.220000000001s)]
*  I started tracking down like there's a bunch of misquoted C.S. Lewis quotes. [[02:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10528.1s)]
*  It could be one of those. [[02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10532.5s)]
*  It could be one of those. [[02:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10533.980000000001s)]
*  But we're being inundated by the worst news of the day because that's the news [[02:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10535.86s)]
*  that's going to ensure that you watch it. [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10540.58s)]
*  And there's so many cool things that are happening at the same time. [[02:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10542.42s)]
*  And I think it gives people a distorted perception of the hope that we have for [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10545.900000000001s)]
*  mankind. You hear about wars like, oh, my God. [[02:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10549.06s)]
*  But most people aren't going to war. [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10551.9s)]
*  Most people are cool with each other. [[02:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10553.9s)]
*  Most interactions between human beings are positive and they're fascinating. [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10555.26s)]
*  And human beings are a fascinating creature. [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10559.5s)]
*  And we're so lucky to be alive at this time where the innovation is reaching this [[02:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10561.66s)]
*  bizarre tipping point where we're, you know. [[02:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10567.859999999999s)]
*  I mean, I love it. I'm having I'm working more hours than I've ever worked in my [[02:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRVEkc9lxH0&t=10571.3s)]
