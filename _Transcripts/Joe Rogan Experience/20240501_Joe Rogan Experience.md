# Joe Rogan Experience #2143 - Tulsi Gabbard
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQrNRtxvCJc)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.
*  Cheers. Here we go. My friend.
*  This is the second time we ever worked out together.
*  I know. I feel great.
*  It was awesome, right? It was great.
*  It's a great way to get the day started.
*  It was perfect, actually.
*  We do these, the comedian boot camps.
*  So we did it today. We did it with Asan and Derek and Shane, Shane Gillis.
*  And we have fun.
*  So you get the workout in and you talk a lot of shit and you get silly.
*  It's really fun. It's like real silly.
*  You know, we have a good time.
*  Yeah. Thanks for the invite.
*  Oh, my pleasure.
*  I've been on the road for, I don't know, for weeks.
*  And so, you know, if you're lucky, you get a decent hotel gym.
*  But you got to be really creative.
*  Yeah. Most of them, the best, they'll have our dumbbells and, you know, that's it.
*  I just realized you're the second celebrity to do that with us and the second Hawaiian.
*  Because the Rock did it.
*  So it's like there's something going on.
*  Samoan pride here.
*  Something going on with the Hawaiians coming here.
*  We'll have to figure out, you know, Max Holloway is Hawaiian and Samoan too.
*  He didn't work out, though.
*  Max, last time he was here, he was just off of his wind.
*  He gets a break after that, man.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, it takes some time.
*  Now that I was telling you, like the sauna, I am definitely like from the islands because I'm OK with heat.
*  So 20 minutes in the sauna was good. It was challenging, but it was good.
*  Yeah.
*  The cold, however.
*  That ice bath.
*  I've done that like a quick polar plunge briefly, jumping in, jumping out.
*  And that one was at the lowest setting in terms of the jets of water.
*  So what we have is called a blue cube.
*  And blue cube is the type of cold plunge that has an engine in it that you can turn on to higher levels of waves.
*  So if you turn it like to the highest level, it's just rushing at you like a river.
*  Is that better or worse?
*  Horrible.
*  OK.
*  You never develop a thermal barrier.
*  OK.
*  So if you can just like cold, all cold water immersion is very good for you.
*  It's good for cold shock proteins, norepinephrine mood stabilization makes you feel better.
*  All those things are good.
*  But the still cold is much more tolerable for whatever.
*  I don't know what's better for you.
*  See, that's the question.
*  Like, is it better?
*  Is it just as good and more tolerable?
*  Or is it better to be more to suffer for the full three minutes?
*  Because if you turn that more, is the benefit proportional to the suffering?
*  I'm not sure.
*  I'm not sure if you suffer more, if you get more benefit or if there's a point where you're actually hurting your body.
*  Right.
*  You know, like maybe maybe there's a point.
*  I mean, obviously, if you stay in the cold water too long, you'll die.
*  That's what hypothermia is.
*  Yeah.
*  So but there's a level where if you just get a few minutes in, it's really good for you.
*  So I don't know if it's better if you're miserable.
*  Yeah, right.
*  I don't know.
*  But if you want to test your mind, that blue cube is the one to do because that sucker gets fast.
*  That sucker gets like a river.
*  So you're just laying in there and it's like, shit.
*  An assault of cold water.
*  The moment it sucks, when you climb in, that moment never changes.
*  That's the difference.
*  Because in a regular cold plunge, after a while, you develop like this thermal barrier.
*  And even though it sucks, it only sucks like 80 percent of what it sucked when you first got in.
*  Yeah.
*  With the blue cube, it's 100 percent.
*  The whole ride sucks, sucks, sucks, sucks.
*  So it sounds like you got to try it at least once.
*  Yeah.
*  And figure it out.
*  Just doing it the way you did it for three minutes.
*  Like I said, the first time I did it, I did like a minute and 24 seconds.
*  I couldn't chicken out in front of all the guys.
*  You know what I mean?
*  It's like when Hassan says, well, I did it three minutes to show up for the rocks.
*  Okay, I'm not going to be the one who chickens out at a minute.
*  That's not an option.
*  Well, you did it.
*  You did it.
*  No, it was good.
*  It was good.
*  It was very challenging.
*  It was good.
*  We don't have a cold plunge.
*  It's like, okay, I'm not going to go and like find bags of ice every single day from 7-Eleven and dump in the bathtub.
*  So I just, when I can, I just like dump my face in ice cubes and water.
*  That's good too.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, that'll wake you up.
*  All that stuff's good.
*  There's some pretty reasonably priced options for coolers that you could actually do in a bathtub now.
*  There's a bunch of different ways to do it.
*  But if you've got the scratch, like one of these blue cubes or something similar, Morosco makes a really good one too.
*  They're really good.
*  Yeah.
*  I can see how that feel, the after feeling gets kind of addictive.
*  I'm sure someone will reach out to you and try to get you to use their shit.
*  It's very good though.
*  But it's also like the camaraderie, the fun.
*  For sure.
*  They have fun, listen to music.
*  For sure.
*  Laugh a lot.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  This is perfect.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a good way to get a podcast started.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, and by the way, congratulations to the marijuana enjoyers of the world because the DEA officially rescheduled marijuana to, they're going to reschedule it to schedule three.
*  Wow.
*  Which still, it shouldn't be illegal.
*  Yes.
*  We know that.
*  I agree.
*  The fact that it's making progress at all just shows that the collective will of the people is being heard, at least somewhat.
*  There was, I'm trying to remember who it was.
*  Somebody was telling me that like the decriminalization crew, they gave an American flag made out of hemp to a member of Congress to fly above the Capitol because it's a normal thing.
*  I would get people when I was in Congress calling and saying, hey, my friend is retiring from the military from 30 years.
*  Can you fly a flag in honor of him or her?
*  And so you get a little certificate with it.
*  And there are many flags that go up and down every day that are given as gifts to people.
*  So someone did it with a flag, American flag made out of hemp.
*  And apparently it caused major problems within the DEA and within the administration saying, how dare you?
*  How could anyone allow this to happen?
*  It made zero sense whatsoever.
*  But it just pointed to the backwards mindset and thinking and the sensitivity within the DEA and the government around cannabis, hemp, marijuana.
*  It just seems a massive lack of education, too.
*  It's not as simple as you're thinking of it in connection to marijuana.
*  It's hemp is a commodity that has existed forever.
*  In fact, canvas that writers paint on or that painters, artists paint on that the original word canvas came from cannabis.
*  It was made out of hemp.
*  They made hemp paper is a better paper.
*  They made hemp clothing.
*  It's far superior to cotton.
*  The only reason why they this is where it gets weird.
*  It there's there's a bunch of things that took place that took hemp away from being a common source of paper and clothing.
*  But one of them was making slavery illegal because before they came out with the de-cordicator,
*  what the primary way they used to process hemp fiber was really painstaking because it's a it's an incredible plant.
*  Yeah, it's a very light plant, but it's insanely durable.
*  Like hemp clothing is so much more durable.
*  I have a hemp jujitsu gi from that sura.
*  OK, and that sucker never rips my cotton geese.
*  They're good for like, you know, you wear them for like six months a year.
*  They're going to shit starts going even like really strong, stable cotton threads start going.
*  These hemp geese are like they're invincible.
*  It's crazy. And hemp paper is so difficult to tear.
*  It's like a completely different kind of paper.
*  It makes no sense. Yeah, it's an amazing rope.
*  It's like you could use it to make concrete.
*  They make hemp. Have you seen that?
*  Would they make houses with it? Yeah.
*  My my dad is a state senator in Hawaii.
*  He's the chair of the Agriculture Committee.
*  And for years, he's been the state's biggest advocate for hemp as an economic driver and to try to help revive agriculture in Hawaii.
*  And so he's talked endlessly about the houses and just everything, all of the different benefits of hemp.
*  He's got some hemp aloha shirts and and the whole deal.
*  The this this thing that you're talking about, though, the federal government and the classification is the biggest barrier to this actually becoming
*  a really viable and thriving industry in our country because people are growing crops of of hemp.
*  But they've got to go through all of this crazy THC testing.
*  And I've talked to people who are who are farmers and business people who are investing in this.
*  And they've had to throw like entire crops away because of I don't know the details about the testing.
*  But it just you know, one plus one doesn't equal to when you look at the reality of the benefits of hemp and the farming process and the concerns that they have within the DEA.
*  So is the concern that has any level of THC at all become illegal, even if you're just processing it as a commodity and you're not using it?
*  Right. Correct. They understand like it's very valuable as a commodity.
*  Yes, it's so stupid. This whole thing is stupid because we're always concerned about and rightly so about cutting down forests to make paper.
*  Right. Right. Well, guess what? Hemp paper.
*  You can grow an entire like, first of all, it's much more viable.
*  You have much more product. It's much more durable.
*  And you can regrow it quick. Exactly. It just grows right back again.
*  Whereas trees takes years and years to grow them back.
*  Hemp. You got another season. Okay, here's the hemp plant grows crazy fast, super light, super durable.
*  Yeah. Just got to think about it as a commodity and stop connecting it to marijuana.
*  And you're going, well, this is invaluable because this could solve a lot of our problems, especially with deforestation.
*  And then if you look at it for building materials like this might be the greatest building material we can use.
*  It's incredible insulation. It's very durable and strong.
*  And again, renewable, like instantaneously grows so quick.
*  Yeah. What's what's interesting. I mean, for us in Hawaii, I mean, tourism is the biggest economic driver we have.
*  And every time there's, you know, in the post 9 11, when people weren't traveling so much during covid, when everything shut down, businesses go out of business.
*  Small businesses are driven out because if they don't have that driver.
*  So the conversation always comes up about, OK, well, we've got to diversify our economy.
*  And this is one of those areas that has huge potential for a small island state like ours in Hawaii.
*  And what's interesting is Mitch McConnell.
*  I believe he's from Kentucky.
*  Their state is also a state that is promoting hemp as a major agriculture driver.
*  So there's opportunity there, but it requires a lot more education from those both in the administration and in Congress to actually take advantage of the state.
*  And it requires a lot more education from Congress to actually take down those barriers and allow it to actually truly be an industry in America.
*  When we first started selling hemp protein on it, we used to have to get it from Canada.
*  Hmm. You can sell in America. Can't grow it here.
*  It's like, what is this food? It's just hemp seeds. It's really good for you.
*  It's full of amino acids and rich in protein. And they're like, no, can't grow it. That's it's illegal.
*  And with the military, people who are on active duty in the military, they can't put hemp seeds in their smoothie.
*  They can't use any CBD bomb that you can buy at the freaking gas station or anything at all because of the bomb.
*  Yeah. CBD bomb. Anything that has your energy drink that has CBD.
*  Yeah.
*  Kill Cliff.
*  Cannot. Not allowed. You could seriously get punished.
*  So they catch you. Are they testing blood for CBD?
*  They they're not testing blood for CBD.
*  So it's just illegal. So if you get caught with the product.
*  If you get caught with the product, correct. And their fear is like you're going to piss hot because you know, you take the, you know, random urinalysis tests and everything else.
*  But so I laughed, you know, I mean, again, it's lack of education, it's fear.
*  And it's like, well, this is banned by the federal government. So the military must comply.
*  But at the same time, the guy within the army, the civilian who was putting out this policy, he also said you're not allowed to eat anything with poppies.
*  You can't eat a poppy seed muffin because you might piss hot.
*  Well, you will. Yeah, you will.
*  Like you can go to Dubai.
*  You go places where it's like seriously strict Saudi Arabia. They'll test you for heroin.
*  You'll test positive for heroin. Yeah.
*  Unruly seeds are rough. That's a scary one.
*  It's like, wait a minute. Bagel poppy seeds. Those things. You piss hot for heroin.
*  Lemon poppy seed muffin. What?
*  They tell you if you go in for a drug test, do not eat poppy seeds before you go.
*  It's crazy.
*  What? Bagels. How bad is your test?
*  That's the point.
*  How bad is your test?
*  Technology, biology, like all this stuff. You guys can't get a better test.
*  Your test doesn't know that I just ate a bagel. This is so stupid.
*  You're going to put somebody in a cage for eating a bagel?
*  Yeah, but like for a guy in the military, that could be the end of your freaking career.
*  It could. You'd be kicked out for it.
*  And you know, just being at a party and people are smoking and you know, you get secondhand smoke and you'll test positive.
*  Those tests are probably pretty rough because people definitely get high from secondhand smoke.
*  I've seen it happen before.
*  I've seen sober people go into a room that's filled with pot and everyone comes out like a little loopy.
*  Like you're breathing in the same air. You're breathing in pot air.
*  I used to have a dog that I got. She was a stray and she was a little prone to anxiety as it is.
*  And if she was in the room when people smoked pot, she would get high and she'd get paranoid.
*  She started hiding under tables. I was like, oh, Lucy, let's see what's that.
*  Not good. You can get the chill factor.
*  She'd be like, no, the world is dangerous. You know, she used to live on the street.
*  Man.
*  So it's just I guess it's a good thing that they've scheduled it, schedule three.
*  But for sure, forget about the drug part. They should be encouraging hemp production in this country.
*  It's it's an amazing food source.
*  Hemp has all of the essential amino acids.
*  It's very rich protein. It's easily digestible.
*  As far as like plant based protein for me is my favorite one and the easiest one to digest.
*  Like you just like easy goes down smooth. There's no problem at all.
*  And, you know, it's it's very good for you. Yeah.
*  And CBD is very good for you. But forget about all the just this for a commodity.
*  Exactly. Building construction and clothing.
*  You know, the first draft of the Declaration of Independence was written on hemp.
*  I've heard that. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Like it was it was used for everything. Yeah.
*  It was used for ropes for for sailboats. Yeah.
*  They made sails out of it. All that's the canvas.
*  Those are made out of cannabis. Initially, it was all hemp.
*  It's just it's it's just I mean, I introduced legislation in Congress to de-schedule it completely because it shouldn't be.
*  Well, the wildest thing is how it happened in the first place.
*  The wildest thing, how it happened in the first place is because it was all William Randolph Hearst and Harry Anslinger.
*  And so what happened was William Randolph Hearst, who owned Hearst Publications,
*  he also owned not just newspapers, but he owned paper mills and he owned forests.
*  So he had all these forests that they would cut down the wood and use it to make paper.
*  Well, he if if they were going to transfer over to hemp, this is going to be very costly.
*  And the cover of Popular Science magazine in I think it was 1930.
*  Find out what year that cover was.
*  It says hemp, the new billion dollar crop, because they came up with a new machine and it was called a de-cordicator.
*  And this new device was a device that allows you to effectively process the hemp fiber in a much quicker and easier way.
*  So it's this machine that grinds it up.
*  And so once they do this, they go, oh, boy, we figured out we've solved this problem of hemp, which really it's very durable.
*  But it's really difficult to break down to the actual fibers.
*  So 1938. Oh, wow.
*  So this comes out in 1938, hemp, the new billion dollar crop.
*  And so it's the cover of Popular Science magazine.
*  Do you see this? Do they have the cover so you can see what it says?
*  Just an article. Oh, just an article.
*  Today about this. Oh, wow.
*  Popular Mechanics magazine. I'm sorry.
*  So so the article is from 1938.
*  And so when they come out with this, they talk about this new invention.
*  See if you could find a photo of the de-cordicator, because it's like this grindy kind of thing.
*  Is that what it looks like? Hemp, the new billion dollar crop.
*  So once they had this ability to really quickly turn it into fibers, then big industry starts getting involved.
*  And what what they start doing is they start making these stories and putting them in the newspaper about Mexicans and black people smoking this new drug called marijuana and raping white women.
*  And marijuana was not pot.
*  Marijuana was a wild Mexican tobacco.
*  It was a slang for a wild Mexican tobacco. It had nothing to do with marijuana.
*  So they started attaching this name to something and calling it a drug because they knew that cannabis was so ubiquitous and hemp as a as a commodity was everybody knew what it was good for.
*  Right. So they had to come up with some sneaky way to get it through.
*  So they come up with the word marijuana.
*  So marijuana was not a term for pot.
*  It wasn't a term for cannabis.
*  It was a term for this wild Mexican tobacco.
*  And so when they started making marijuana illegal, Congress didn't even understand that it was the same thing as hemp.
*  And so they had to come up with some sort of a tax stamp that you can have in order to grow hemp while marijuana is illegal.
*  And then this is like right after Prohibition. Right. Right.
*  So Prohibition ends. You got all these cops that were used to busting people like sick them on the farmers now. Exactly.
*  And then they come up with these dopey movies that are amazing to watch today.
*  Have you ever seen Reef or Madness? It's crazy.
*  It's like people smoking pot just jumping out of windows and killing people.
*  It has this guy's talk about some propaganda.
*  Oh, it's the worst propaganda.
*  But it was really effective.
*  Like this is it.
*  I've got a few of these posters.
*  We're here.
*  But I have them.
*  I have them framed.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Because these movies were insane and they were just full on propaganda.
*  Lust, crime, sorrow, hate, shame, despair.
*  Find the movie.
*  Find a clip from the movie Reef or Madness.
*  We'll just watch it without playing it.
*  But it was so nutty and they scared everybody.
*  Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
*  So understand that media has sucked forever.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Just understand that.
*  So this is Reef or Madness.
*  So that dude on the piano, he's a reefer man.
*  Look at him.
*  Startling film, you will see Dobson's lure children to destruction.
*  We're going over to Joe's place.
*  Why don't you come along?
*  We have a date to play a set of doubles.
*  Oh, you can play anytime.
*  Come on, we'll have some laughs.
*  Can I go along with you?
*  Sure.
*  Hey, I'll see you dinner, sis.
*  If you want a good smoke, try one of these.
*  Who will meet Gil, who wants to pride in his strong will,
*  as he takes the first step toward enslavement.
*  Enslavement.
*  Smoking the soul destroying reefer, they find a moment's pleasure,
*  but at a terrible price.
*  Divorce.
*  Violence.
*  Murder.
*  Oh, wow.
*  But she's going to jump out the window.
*  Oh, my gosh.
*  She's apparently makes you act terrible, too.
*  Terrible.
*  Terrible.
*  Terrible.
*  Terrible.
*  Terrible.
*  Terrible.
*  Terrible.
*  Terrible.
*  Terrible.
*  Terrible.
*  Terrible.
*  Terrible.
*  Terrible.
*  Terrible.
*  Terrible at acting.
*  Look at this guy.
*  Play faster.
*  She's actually playing pretty good for someone who's stoned.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, imagine being hammered and trying to play that.
*  Oh, my gosh.
*  Yeah.
*  So this was the propaganda from, and what year was that, Jamie?
*  36.
*  36.
*  Wow.
*  So this is all, they're all like trying to stop hemp as a commodity.
*  Wow.
*  That's really what it's all about.
*  Yeah.
*  So, yeah.
*  So, yeah.
*  So, yeah.
*  So, yeah.
*  So, yeah.
*  So, yeah.
*  So, yeah.
*  So, yeah.
*  So, yeah.
*  So that's really what it's all about.
*  It's really not about the drug.
*  Isn't it fascinating just to see just the repetition of the propaganda information warfare to be
*  able to serve a special interest?
*  Yeah.
*  It's ridiculous.
*  And it's ridiculous that it's always existed.
*  Fomenting fear.
*  Yeah.
*  And that it was going on almost 100 years ago.
*  Yeah.
*  Incredible.
*  And what's also important about it is the problem with something like that is that now
*  you don't trust the media, right?
*  Yeah.
*  trust the media and then you go out and try it yourself.
*  You don't have real accurate information.
*  Because now there's like this, there's these narratives
*  that have been created that aren't based on truth.
*  And so you don't know where to go.
*  You don't know what's real and what's not.
*  And then you have people that tell you it's harmless.
*  And then you have people tell you,
*  well, there's people like me that go, meh.
*  Because I'm like, it's not harmless.
*  It's not, marijuana is not a harmless thing.
*  You definitely shouldn't take it when you're young.
*  And here's what's really important.
*  Some people can't handle it for whatever reason.
*  And it's most likely some biological thing.
*  Just like some people are allergic to aspirin or whatever.
*  There's some people, they don't mix well with that stuff.
*  And there's a real connection between schizophrenia
*  with some people that maybe are susceptible
*  to schizophrenia.
*  Alex Berenson wrote a great book about it
*  called Tell Your Children.
*  It's very interesting because there's real instances
*  of people taking high doses and getting schizophrenic.
*  But if we're being lied to about it,
*  no one knows what, who's gonna give me the information?
*  Where's the truth coming out?
*  Because if one group is saying that this is a schedule one
*  chemical and it's very dangerous,
*  and then all your friends are just smoking weed
*  and going to the movies.
*  You're like, well, clearly this is not that dangerous.
*  Like Jiu-Jitsu people and surfers,
*  they're all getting high.
*  What's real here?
*  And because we don't have the ability
*  to just honestly talk about things
*  without everything getting so weird.
*  Like the hemp thing, having a hemp flag.
*  This is a problem with the DEA.
*  Hey guys, don't you have fentanyl to worry about?
*  Why are you fucking with flags?
*  Seriously, it makes no sense.
*  There's only 10,000 DEA agents.
*  I think there's 10,100 some DEA agents.
*  You guys got time for flags?
*  How many pounds of fentanyl is coming through that border
*  while we're talking?
*  What you and I are talking,
*  how much fentanyl is making it across in people's shoes
*  and underwear and where the fuck they're hiding it?
*  No one's checking everybody.
*  Yeah, no, it's true.
*  And then of course all the medicinal qualities
*  of CBD as well and how many people and kids
*  and just people are benefiting from that.
*  Well Dave Foley told me that his arthritis was so bad
*  that his fingers were kind of like locked in this position.
*  He had a really hard time straightening them
*  till he started taking CBD.
*  And then it's like, it's so much better now.
*  My fingers have full range of motion now.
*  I know so many people that take it for aches and pains
*  and it actually helps some people with anxiety too,
*  which is interesting.
*  The conflict here is, as you know,
*  as majority of states in the country
*  have legalized it in some fashion,
*  whether it's medicinal or recreational or whatever,
*  all these different levels,
*  but because of the federal prohibition essentially,
*  you've got banking, it is a multi, I don't know,
*  multi hundred million dollar industry
*  at least at this point.
*  But in order to be able to conduct business with the bank,
*  the bank and the business owner faces
*  a potential federal charge of a crime.
*  And so it's, the second, third, fourth order of effects
*  of this scheduling of cannabis is very, very far reaching
*  and creating a worst problem, which is,
*  okay, so we do this on the black market,
*  does this just become a cash industry
*  or where does this go?
*  Yeah, and the problem also is by having some states
*  have it legal and some states have it illegal,
*  then you still open up a market for illegal sales
*  in the country and what happens is the cartel comes in
*  and they start growing it on public lands.
*  I had a guy on the podcast, his name is John Norris,
*  and he started off as a game warden.
*  So he started off as a guy who's gonna check
*  fishing licenses and stuff.
*  And one day they find that a stream has been diverted
*  and they're trying to figure out why,
*  why the stream has dried up.
*  So they make their way up the stream
*  and they find this irrigation system that's set up
*  for an illegal marijuana grow-up
*  in the middle of public land in California.
*  So then they develop a tactical team.
*  So it goes from him being a game warden,
*  now they have dogs and bulletproof vests,
*  they're getting in shootouts with the cartel.
*  So they're, because they're making millions of dollars,
*  but they're using really dangerous chemicals
*  and pesticides that are illegal to use on crops in America.
*  And they're just using that shit up there.
*  So who knows what the fuck you're getting
*  if you're living in one of these states
*  that has illegal pot.
*  Because when California changed the law
*  and made marijuana legal recreationally,
*  they made growing marijuana without a license,
*  it's just a misdemeanor.
*  So these guys that are just doing it now from the cartel,
*  they're like, you have nothing to risk.
*  It's a misdemeanor.
*  We can make millions and millions of dollars.
*  And so they have these guys up there,
*  they have rosaries and all those photos of Jesus and shit
*  they find in campgrounds,
*  and they pay these guys to go out there,
*  grow this stuff, and then bring it out.
*  Harvest it and bring it out.
*  And they're selling it.
*  He said that, I think, believe,
*  John said at the time of our podcast
*  that 90% of all the marijuana that's being sold
*  in the states where it's illegal
*  is all from these grow-ups,
*  a lot of them in California on public land by the cartels.
*  90%.
*  Yeah.
*  90.
*  That's huge.
*  Even good old-fashioned American pot-growing entrepreneurs,
*  the illegal ones, they can't keep up with the cartel.
*  And this is because it's illegal.
*  And this is the same reason why fentanyl's coming in.
*  The same reason, I mean, don't do heroin, kids, okay?
*  But if you keep everything illegal,
*  you're gonna just prop up the government
*  of these countries that is allowing this stuff to come in
*  and they're allowing people to grow it,
*  or they can't do anything about it
*  because the cartel has so much money and so much power
*  that the government is basically helpless
*  and is being propped up by Americans.
*  100%.
*  100%.
*  100%.
*  It's a rough thing to deal with
*  because we don't wanna say, let's make all drugs legal.
*  Because my God, the last thing you want
*  is your kid to die of a drug overdose.
*  So nobody wants kids to be doing drugs.
*  But also, if you don't do that,
*  you're just gonna empower our neighbors to the south
*  who happen to be drug dealers, some of them,
*  and they're making billions of dollars
*  selling drugs to America.
*  And you're killing kids at a rate higher than ever
*  in recorded history.
*  People are dying, there's 100,000 plus people every year
*  that are dying from opioid overdoses, which is nuts.
*  That's so much.
*  It's crazy that it's happening here
*  in the United States of America.
*  The thing is, this is where it's hard.
*  It's happening because it's illegal,
*  which sounds so counterintuitive.
*  The problem is if it was legal,
*  there would be a long period of time
*  where it would be really bad.
*  I think if it was legal, too many people would try it
*  that wouldn't try it.
*  Wouldn't have otherwise.
*  They're not gonna go to a drug dealer.
*  But if they can just go to CVS and buy heroin,
*  let's see what the fuss is all about.
*  That's spooky.
*  I think that this is the conversation
*  that needs to be had, though.
*  I mean, it's the same thing about people unwilling
*  to even discuss what is the right path?
*  How do we handle this crisis that is a national crisis
*  that's taking so many people's lives?
*  Tell people not to do it.
*  Yeah, right.
*  Okay.
*  Well, that works out.
*  That doesn't work.
*  It doesn't work.
*  We're in a weird spot.
*  I was in San Diego a few weeks ago.
*  We went out kind of to film a little mini documentary
*  about what's happening at the border in San Diego.
*  There's a lot of attention being put on Texas and Arizona,
*  but California's border is a whole different dynamic,
*  both because they've got a long stretch of border
*  where you're crossing in and you're going straight
*  to mountains, big open spaces,
*  but then you've got the very dense urban corridor,
*  I suppose, where people,
*  whether they're coming in through the water
*  or they're just coming across the border
*  where they can disappear into neighborhoods very quickly.
*  But there's a few things that were very eye-opening
*  and interesting.
*  One is we know that the borders are open
*  because we know how many people are coming through.
*  The numbers that are being reported,
*  I think it's close to 9 million now
*  just over the course of the Biden administration.
*  What I saw there were people coming in
*  and we were just driving around
*  and we saw groups of people gathering
*  in different locations from all over the world,
*  illegal immigrants and seemingly happy
*  and going to the place where they were told to go
*  where they knew that border patrol was gonna pick them up
*  and knowing that they will get processed, claim asylum,
*  and most of them will be out with a plane ticket anywhere
*  in the country within 24 hours.
*  And so it's crazy.
*  And I've talked to some of the border patrol agents
*  and they're not allowed to say anything on the record,
*  but just the frustration that's being felt
*  where they can't even do their job.
*  What is the justification for the plane ticket?
*  They don't have the ability to house people where they are.
*  So just like-
*  Where do you wanna go?
*  Utah? Okay, here you go.
*  Where do you wanna go?
*  New York City?
*  And I went and I talked to a lot of them.
*  I sat down and talked with people from Brazil,
*  from Egypt, from Colombia, from Venezuela,
*  from different parts of Eastern Europe,
*  people from all over the world coming here
*  with the known plan in this well-oiled machine.
*  And I'm talking about this
*  because it is very directed to the cartel,
*  directly connected to the cartels
*  who are being enabled in their multi-billion dollar
*  human trafficking operation across the border
*  by our policies, by the Biden administration's policies
*  at the border, which is connected to their ability
*  to move fentanyl and other drugs across the border.
*  And so we spent a couple of days at the border there
*  and then went into the city of San Diego
*  and went and started talking to some homeless people
*  and talking to people who were clearly, clearly
*  extremely high on multiple drugs.
*  And we're walking around with one of the community relations
*  police officers there who's just playing close.
*  He's walking around and keeping an eye
*  on what's going on there.
*  But we talked to this one guy
*  who had a crack pipe in his hand.
*  He seemed barely conscious,
*  but he was engaging in a long conversation with us.
*  And I was asking him about fentanyl.
*  And he's like, oh yeah, I take fentanyl sometimes,
*  but I usually take it at night to help me go to sleep.
*  I asked like, aren't you afraid of not waking up?
*  He's like, yeah, I've had a lot of friends
*  who've died from fentanyl, but I know how much to take.
*  And I know how to manage it.
*  And have you, he's like, yeah, I almost died twice
*  and I was revived.
*  And then asking him, the police officer asked him,
*  what would it take to get you off the street?
*  What would it take to get you to a place
*  where you can get some help and to get off drugs?
*  And he said, he's a 27 year old guy, nothing, nothing.
*  He said, there's too many rules in the places
*  where I could go and stay.
*  And I wanna live my life this way.
*  It was so heartbreaking to see him.
*  His eyes were barely open
*  and clearly in an altered state of mind,
*  but even in that state in this conversation,
*  how do you help someone who doesn't wanna be helped?
*  You can't, it's the problem.
*  I mean, you could talk to them.
*  You could hope that they can get some information from you
*  that shifts the way they think about things,
*  but the addiction gets so deep.
*  And there's this thing that some addicts will say
*  is that I feel better when I'm high.
*  That it's the only time I feel good.
*  It's the only thing good that I have in my life
*  is when I get high.
*  And if you take that away, my life is terrible.
*  And if you've been an addict for a long time,
*  the longer you're an addict, in fact, the more that's true.
*  Because the more your life is a wreck
*  and then you're forced to deal with it when you come off
*  and you realize like, oh my God, I'm 45 years old
*  and I'm a heroin addict.
*  Like, what the fuck?
*  How is this?
*  And then now you're sober and your life is in shambles
*  and you try to figure out how did you go so wrong?
*  And then the only thing that made you feel good
*  was heroin, you wanna go back.
*  You wanna go back to that.
*  And it's also people get really scared of success.
*  Even success in staying sober,
*  they get scared of doing things well
*  and they seek comfort in failure
*  because they've become accustomed to failure.
*  So if they, the pressure of doing well
*  and of like staying sober and like keeping healthy,
*  like it's almost too much.
*  Just the maintaining, the psychological, the anxiety,
*  all the fear that comes with failing
*  that you just wanna fail
*  just so you could just feel comfortable again.
*  Because then you don't have to.
*  There's no pressure.
*  Yeah, you don't have to deal with the pressure.
*  It's scary.
*  The human mind is so susceptible
*  to so many different things,
*  whether it's cults or addictions or,
*  we're very weirdly vulnerable
*  to a lot of like very strange things.
*  And a lot of these things,
*  I think a lot of the mental issues
*  are accentuated by social media.
*  I think that they exacerbate them badly.
*  I think there's a lot of undiagnosed mentally ill people
*  that are just killing themselves
*  by being online all the time.
*  I believe it.
*  I really do.
*  I think it's terrible for you.
*  Yeah, I mean, it's so easy to get sucked into it.
*  It's so easy.
*  And people that are like arguing with people
*  constantly online.
*  My God, what a terrible waste of time.
*  Yeah, when that becomes your reality,
*  dealing with people and perceptions
*  and measuring yourself against whatever you're seeing
*  and all of it.
*  And you slip out of the real world
*  and building real relationships and friendships
*  and having real conversations.
*  Yeah, comparing too.
*  The comparing is something that you and I
*  didn't have to grow up with.
*  Exactly.
*  And we're very, very fortunate
*  because especially young girls today
*  and Jonathan Haight's work on this
*  has been really interesting.
*  His book, The Coddling of the American Mind is a great one.
*  And it's all about what you could see
*  like exactly when social media is invented,
*  all this self harm and all the suicidal thoughts,
*  suicidal ideation and suicide all goes up for girls.
*  And it's comparing themselves.
*  Doesn't surprise me.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  It's such a bizarre thing that a person
*  can get super duper famous just dancing
*  on an app that goes online
*  and then they make millions of dollars
*  and they're like your age.
*  And you're like, what's wrong with me?
*  I'm a loser.
*  You can't just live your life
*  and hang out with your friends.
*  Everyone is in constant comparison
*  with impossible people that shouldn't even exist.
*  And then you add the layer of AI onto that
*  where you have complete, you've got videos
*  and pictures of people who are a digital construct.
*  Not just that, people are paying to talk to them.
*  There's this guy, they were doing a study
*  on AI girlfriends where people have interactions with AI.
*  This guy was spending $10,000 a month
*  on this AI girlfriend.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  ISIS could get that guy.
*  They just gotta find him.
*  If they just find that guy,
*  they can talk that guy into anything.
*  If you're willing to get,
*  if you're willing to get an AI girlfriend
*  10,000 bucks a month, yeah, you'll join the Moonies.
*  You'll be in whatever comes along, grabs you, son.
*  You're vulnerable.
*  They'll get you.
*  But that's, you look at what's happening
*  on college campuses across the country right now.
*  It speaks exactly to that.
*  That vulnerability of being manipulated
*  or sold an ideology and then grabbing onto it
*  as though you now have a sense of purpose.
*  Yeah, that's the problem.
*  The sense of purpose is so attractive to people
*  that there's so many kids that wanna be so righteous
*  and they just wanna criticize and yell at other people
*  who don't feel the same way they do.
*  And so, you're seeing these Israel versus Palestine things
*  on school campuses.
*  I'm like, my God.
*  Which brings me to, this is an interesting thought.
*  Like, what's your opinion on this potential TikTok ban?
*  I oppose it.
*  I oppose it on the grounds of free speech
*  and civil liberties.
*  This is, speaking of fomenting fear,
*  this is one of those pieces of legislation that's,
*  if you just read the talking points
*  for those who support it,
*  and it's supported by many people in Congress
*  on both sides of the aisle,
*  you think like, oh my gosh,
*  we've got a national security risk
*  and you've got concern for our kids
*  and all of this other stuff.
*  But when you actually read the language
*  and understand the implications of what this legislation does,
*  it's not really about TikTok at all.
*  It's about government being able to choose
*  what platforms are acceptable and what are not,
*  and what we as Americans are able to either
*  get information from or put information out.
*  And then you look at, okay,
*  well, if they're giving themselves that authority,
*  how will it then be enforced?
*  Then you get into the civil liberties concern
*  of the Fourth Amendment of government overreach
*  and trying to figure out, okay,
*  well, now I'm gonna have to look into your phone
*  and figure out if you're the guy who's using the VPN
*  to illegally download this app.
*  Then you're looking at,
*  you know, the designation is that if you have
*  20% or more ownership stake or stake in a business
*  that has been designated by our government to be illegal
*  because of its association with a foreign adversary,
*  there are a few countries listed there,
*  but the president would have the power to designate
*  any other country a foreign adversary
*  without any kind of, you know,
*  Congress wouldn't have to take action.
*  It's a unilateral move.
*  You are also implicated if you are someone
*  who the government determines to be influenced by
*  or connected with one of these countries
*  that is a foreign adversary.
*  And so, you know, Elon Musk has talked about this.
*  It is not outside of the realm of the,
*  not only possible, but the probable
*  that if they wanted to say, okay, well, you know,
*  Elon Musk is doing business with this country
*  that we don't like, and oh,
*  he also owns this platform called X,
*  X should be shut down because of this association.
*  I think Ron Paul said it best when he said
*  that this legislation is the most,
*  and I'm paraphrasing, but he said it's the most egregious
*  violation of civil liberties since the Patriot Act
*  was passed in the wake of 9-11.
*  And when you look at the arguments that are being made
*  around both of those pushes,
*  they are very eerily similar
*  in invoking national security concerns.
*  And the language and the way that's written
*  is intentionally vague that puts far more power
*  into the hands of the executive branch,
*  just like the Patriot Act did,
*  to single-handedly say, well, this is a good guy
*  and this is a bad guy.
*  And that has a direct implication on Americans.
*  And wasn't there another recent thing that passed
*  that allows more observation of people through cell phones?
*  Yes, yes.
*  And both of these things were actually wrapped up
*  into that same bill that was just passed through.
*  They lumped together a whole bunch of different things.
*  They were separate previously,
*  but the thing that the TikTok ban was lumped together with
*  was the bill that would reinstate or extend
*  the FISA authorities,
*  the Foreign Intelligence Security Act authorities,
*  for another two years.
*  Section 702 of FISA gives our government the authority
*  to surveil foreign actors, essentially,
*  to try to identify terrorist threats.
*  But part of that is they have the ability
*  to capture all of the conversations.
*  If you talk to somebody in another country
*  that they're interested in, they can then go in
*  and capture all of your information as an American citizen.
*  And they can do this without a warrant.
*  This has been in place for quite some time,
*  but this legislation that was just passed recently
*  expanded those authorities so they can go
*  and actually look at your Wi-Fi history,
*  if you're connected to Wi-Fi,
*  they can look at everything that you did
*  connected to that Wi-Fi signal and in some other ways.
*  It took an already bad problem
*  and made it many, many times worse.
*  And again, they're just saying,
*  well, it's for national security.
*  The problem here is-
*  That's the thing they always say.
*  That's the thing they always say.
*  And it's like, I think it was Benjamin Franklin
*  who said, if you are choosing security over liberty,
*  you will neither be secure nor will you have liberty.
*  That's not an actual quote,
*  but that's basically the point here.
*  And that's the false choice that so many of these politicians
*  are forcing on the American people is
*  you can either be less free and more safe,
*  or you can be more free and, oh, by the way,
*  you're gonna invite more terrorist attacks
*  or more national security incursions on our country.
*  And it's just BS.
*  It is BS.
*  It's also very un-American.
*  It is.
*  And here's the problem with government overreach.
*  The government is just people.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the problem.
*  If you thought of them as something
*  other than a three-letter name like DEA, CIA, NSA,
*  just a bunch of people,
*  you would go, well, why is this like the DEA?
*  Why is this 10,000 people
*  telling all these other people what to do?
*  That sounds crazy.
*  There's way more of them than there are of us.
*  If it was just in this room,
*  and Jamie turns out to be the cop,
*  and he says, hey, I'm gonna put you two in prison
*  because I heard you like hemp.
*  Yeah.
*  You're like, Jamie, fuck off.
*  That's crazy.
*  But if it's a government agency with a three-letter name,
*  you're like, oh, this is the government.
*  The government is just human beings.
*  And there's just a natural inclination
*  that people in power have is to try to gain more power.
*  Rich people wanna get richer,
*  hot people wanna get hotter.
*  Like, that's what it is.
*  Everybody wants to improve.
*  And the governments, they're in the business
*  of telling you what to do,
*  and they wanna be better at that business.
*  And the best way is to be able to constantly
*  be able to surveil everything you say and do.
*  Right.
*  And again, it goes-
*  We shouldn't let them.
*  No, and this is the problem.
*  This is the problem is that
*  every elected official swears an oath
*  to support and defend the Constitution.
*  Yet, as we saw with this most recent example,
*  they are so ready to undermine our Fourth Amendment rights
*  in the Constitution in the name of national security.
*  And I know some of them are doing it with good intention,
*  but without actually considering
*  that the challenge and responsibility
*  of those in government and those who have this power
*  is to strike that correct balance
*  between ensuring that our liberties
*  and our constitutional rights are protected.
*  You swear an oath to do this when you take this job
*  while also ensuring, okay, well, we can do both,
*  and we must do both.
*  We can be safe and secure and also be able to live free
*  without worrying about every time you pick up your phone
*  or you make a phone call
*  wondering if the government is surveilling us.
*  And then you add onto that what's happening now
*  where, you know, like January 6th, for example,
*  I was working out in the gym, Marine Corps gym in Hawaii
*  down the street from our house,
*  bumped into a guy who I met, it's a long story,
*  but I met him when the Rocks stunt double
*  was getting his traditional Samoan tattoo,
*  and it's a whole ceremony, it was a seven-day thing,
*  and so this other guy is Samoan, we met, became friends,
*  so I saw him in the gym,
*  and he's with his 14-year-old son.
*  How's it going, this and that.
*  He's like, oh, the FBI just came to my house out in Laie,
*  small rural community on the island of Oahu.
*  I was like, what's going on?
*  He's like, yeah, they came and knocked on my door
*  because, he said, I took my son
*  to go and witness democracy.
*  So they were part of those thousands of people
*  who were out there on the lawn of the Capitol,
*  and they didn't arrest him,
*  they didn't charge him with anything,
*  but how is it that, you know, years later, years later,
*  they go and find this guy and his family
*  in a rural Mormon community in Laie in Hawaii,
*  they're capturing all of the data
*  of people whose cell phones were pinging
*  within that vicinity during that period of time,
*  not only on January 6th,
*  and they are continuing to widen that net,
*  looking at flight records and who bought tickets
*  and who booked hotels and all of this stuff.
*  For what?
*  You're gonna go, the FBI's gonna go and investigate people
*  who showed up there on the lawn on the Capitol?
*  You look at what they're, and this is my thing.
*  It's a scare tactic.
*  It is absolutely a scare tactic.
*  So when we look at the power of the government
*  and how they're now turning on the American people
*  for political reasons,
*  we can see where even the best of intentions
*  with some of these pieces of legislation
*  can lead to the very worst places.
*  What to speak of the fact that
*  we have limited resource and limited people.
*  What are they not investigating?
*  You talked about the DEA, what about the FBI
*  and all these millions of people
*  who are coming across our border?
*  Are they tracking who they are?
*  No, they're not.
*  Are they tracking where they're going?
*  No, they're not.
*  We have no idea.
*  People coming from the Middle East and Asia
*  and Eastern Europe and Venezuela, gang members,
*  all of this stuff is happening right before our very eyes,
*  and they're going and knocking on my friend's door
*  because he brought his 14 year old son
*  to Washington DC that week.
*  And here's the question, was the FBI there?
*  How many people were there?
*  And how come they don't have to answer that?
*  Exactly.
*  They don't say.
*  Why not be transparent?
*  Also, they should be there.
*  Like the government should be there
*  in case some shit goes sideways.
*  Exactly.
*  Right?
*  So I'm sure they're there.
*  But are some of the agents not good?
*  Just like some dentists suck.
*  Are some of the agents not good?
*  And are some of the agents encouraging people to go in?
*  Because that could be true too.
*  Because if we look at what happened
*  with the governor of Michigan, right?
*  Was it Michigan?
*  Yes, Michigan.
*  Or Minnesota?
*  Michigan.
*  That story is bonkers.
*  It is.
*  When you find it, what was it like 11 of the people
*  involved in the kidnapping scheme were FBI informants?
*  Right.
*  What?
*  And these two dopes who just like, just dumbasses,
*  like ADIQ dumbasses,
*  they just get tricked into this fucking,
*  they're cosplaying.
*  They're like, we're gonna kidnap her.
*  Definitely, we're gonna fucking get liberty done.
*  They don't know what they're doing.
*  They're stupid.
*  And those poor fucks have to go to jail.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  And the whole thing was scheduled
*  and set up by FBI informants.
*  Like that seems crazy.
*  Aren't there real problems instead of like creating problems
*  and then arresting people for those problems?
*  Aren't there real problems going on?
*  And if there's not, like you guys good at your job,
*  we're trusting you.
*  And there are, you know.
*  For sure.
*  I know some great FBI agents
*  and there are people who are doing good work.
*  Absolutely, I've met great FBI agents.
*  Phenomenal.
*  Nice people, good people, patriots.
*  Absolutely.
*  But they're like dentists.
*  Some of them are great.
*  Some of them suck.
*  I mean, it's just, you know,
*  it's, yeah, I can say this,
*  the military's and law enforcement.
*  Like, yes, you are going to find those few, for sure.
*  They are there.
*  But with, so I've talked to different people than the FBI
*  and what they've shared is that there's kind of like
*  a bifurcation in the agency.
*  Where there are people who are really, really angry
*  and frustrated about the politicization of the FBI
*  that's occurring by the heads.
*  And then there are others who are just like,
*  full send, we're on board, let's go.
*  And it's creating a lot of friction
*  and a lot of fear within the agency.
*  I don't know if the agency, people get confused,
*  that's the CIA, probably some similar things going on there.
*  But within the FBI, a lot of fear that
*  you gotta watch what you say around even your own colleagues
*  and your own peers because there are people
*  who are on different sides, which is horrible.
*  Like you are on the side of America.
*  You are on the side of the American people
*  and upholding the rule of law and securing our country,
*  going after the bad guys.
*  Well when the bad guys now become your neighbor
*  down the street, we're in a very different realm,
*  a dangerous one.
*  It's just how it is with people.
*  Red Sox fans hate Yankee fans.
*  Just like they're in the same country.
*  You're gonna have conflict even inside the FBI.
*  You're gonna have conflict in every group.
*  You're gonna have power struggles.
*  You're either with Bob or you're not.
*  You wanna make it in this business,
*  you wanna get to the top of this agency,
*  you gotta stay with Bob.
*  And Bob's fuckin' callin' the shots.
*  I'm on team Bob.
*  Like fuck Mike.
*  And that's what happens with people.
*  It happens in everything.
*  And you have people that go in with good intentions
*  and they get corrupted by systems that are corrupt.
*  That's where for the, across, whether it's the FBI,
*  the Department of Justice, all of these,
*  it matters who's in charge.
*  These are all civilian-led organizations.
*  They are political appointees.
*  And in theory, they are the people
*  who should be held accountable.
*  But they are setting that tone.
*  Did you hear what AOC said?
*  She said the people that are coming in to this country,
*  most of them, it's because of climate change.
*  I didn't hear that one.
*  It's amazing.
*  It is straight outta South Park.
*  It's straight outta South Park.
*  Wow.
*  Like what?
*  I know.
*  I'm like waiting like, oh, like, is there more?
*  Has the climate changed more than I know?
*  You, do you know something I don't know?
*  Like what are you saying?
*  Yeah.
*  What's going on down there?
*  The best are those clips.
*  I just saw one on Instagram the other day from like 1985,
*  where a newscaster is,
*  I think it might've even been black and white,
*  and she's saying,
*  the climate change scientists tell us
*  that we may only have 10 years before the earth is destroyed.
*  1992 is gonna be the year.
*  And then whoever made this clip,
*  they juxtaposed her clip with one from Bernie Sanders
*  saying the exact same thing with a different date,
*  how many decades later.
*  The problem is when you fear monger,
*  you distract people from the real issue.
*  Yes.
*  Like what is really going on?
*  Like how bad are we fucking up the planet?
*  Here's one that doesn't get discussed enough.
*  We've killed everything in the ocean.
*  The ocean is depleted.
*  What was the number, Jamie?
*  Like 90% of the big fish are gone.
*  Yeah.
*  Some crazy number like that.
*  Because of just,
*  just imagine how psychotic it is to have a species
*  that goes into another dimension
*  that it's not a resident of and uses nets
*  and just takes everything it can get
*  and catches a bunch of dolphins and shit in there
*  that doesn't want anyway, and they all die.
*  Exactly.
*  A new global study concludes that 90% of all large fishes
*  have disappeared from the world's oceans
*  in the past half century, in 50 years.
*  So that's a cataclysm.
*  That's a disaster of epic proportion
*  when it comes to like ecology.
*  And when it comes to the environment of the world itself,
*  we're killing most, because we like sushi.
*  We're killing most of what's in the ocean.
*  It's bananas.
*  Yeah.
*  And so that is getting ignored
*  because everyone is talking about fossil fuels.
*  And I wonder how much of this is pushed
*  by foreign countries through social media.
*  Because there is a thing that you can do
*  and nudge conversations in a certain way with bots
*  and with fake statistics and with fear-mongering.
*  And meanwhile, China is opening
*  hundreds of new coal power plants.
*  They're doubling down on coal.
*  And I think through TikTok and through probably Facebook
*  and YouTube and all these different things
*  and Instagram, I'm sure, there's countless bots
*  that are putting out videos and pushing narratives
*  and find their way into your algorithm.
*  And they affect the way people think about things.
*  And guess what?
*  If you go to Chinese TikTok, it's all academic accomplishments,
*  martial arts demonstrations, science achievements,
*  and you can't go on after 10 p.m.
*  Right.
*  And neither America, it's dudes with fake eyelashes
*  reading stories to toddlers.
*  Exactly.
*  And it's everybody telling you the ocean's gonna boil.
*  It's weird.
*  It's Osama Bin Laden's letter to America.
*  The letter to America thing was wild too.
*  Everybody was like, wow, Osama Bin Laden had a point.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  That's, I had a dinner the other night with a family.
*  It was during the holiday of Passover.
*  And this question came up about what would happen
*  if another 9-11 style terrorist attack
*  or some major incident like that came up
*  in our country today.
*  Would it have that same kind of unifying effect
*  that occurred after that attack on 9-11?
*  And when you look at things like that,
*  like the Osama Bin Laden letter,
*  and you look at how there is,
*  I mean, there's an entire, not an entire generation,
*  but there's a lot of people now who,
*  I wouldn't be surprised if they said,
*  well, such an attack was justified.
*  And not have that same kind of sense of unity of like,
*  no matter our differences,
*  we got to stand together as Americans.
*  And that should be a serious concern.
*  It should be a serious concern also
*  when you really take into consideration
*  how many genuinely dumb people there are.
*  And when you have a situation like October 7th in Israel,
*  I saw within days before Israel did what they did in Palestine,
*  within days, I saw people justifying the attacks
*  on October 7th because of the treatment
*  that Israel has given to the Palestinians.
*  I'm like, hey, that's crazy.
*  That's crazy.
*  That's crazy to say that you think people
*  should be indiscriminately shot and killed
*  and just en masse at a fucking rave, like paratrooping.
*  And you think that's okay because of what Israel's done.
*  But guess what?
*  Those people didn't do that.
*  Those people at the rave,
*  and those people that are on the border,
*  those are apparently, according to Ari,
*  those are the hippies.
*  They're the ones who want to be,
*  they're the ones who don't believe
*  that we should be there.
*  They don't believe in borders.
*  Yeah, they don't believe in borders.
*  Exactly.
*  They want to be close to the Palestinians.
*  Right, exactly.
*  And that's where some of the things
*  that they're chanting at,
*  that these protesters are chanting at Columbia University
*  and some of the other ones.
*  We hope that October 7th happens 10,000 times over,
*  they say, celebrating Hamas,
*  this ismless terrorist organization.
*  It is.
*  I don't think we can just dismiss them
*  as just being stupid.
*  You know what I mean?
*  These kids are going to Ivy League schools.
*  They are being absolutely manipulated.
*  And there is a very intentional ideological war
*  that is being waged in this example
*  by these radical ismless groups like Hamas.
*  And they had planned this,
*  they've been doing this for hundreds of years,
*  and they're using technology
*  and they're using other means
*  to be able to achieve that end.
*  No doubt, as is Russia, as is China.
*  They've infiltrated universities.
*  The famous Yuri Besmanov speech from 1984,
*  which is crazy when you hear it today,
*  because he called it.
*  He knew it was gonna happen, and it's happening,
*  and it's happening from college campuses outward.
*  So the most radical of these ideologies
*  are being promoted on colleges,
*  because the kids are the youngest,
*  they don't have jobs and real world experience.
*  They don't have, they're young.
*  They have ideologies, they're a little bit unrealistic,
*  and they're all captured by this status game
*  that's going on on campus,
*  where you're trying to be the most radical,
*  like, oh, he's so radically pro-Palestine, he's so hot.
*  And then that really becomes a thing.
*  You become virtuous, and you become attractive.
*  You become interesting without actually being interesting,
*  just because you have this rabid adherence to an ideology
*  that's right now in vogue.
*  And that's really what it is.
*  And I think a lot of that is funded by foreign governments.
*  And there's a lot of evidence points to it,
*  and we should consider it as a possibility,
*  and don't dismiss it as a conspiracy theory.
*  Consider it as a possibility.
*  And so this is the question about things like TikTok,
*  like, and Twitter and all of them, all of them,
*  because I guarantee you it's not just foreign countries, kids.
*  I guarantee you there are people in this country
*  that are using it.
*  I know businesses do it.
*  I guarantee you people do it to try to influence
*  the way people think about things.
*  And when you see posts, I've seen posts multiple times
*  saying outrageous things.
*  And I'll just, okay, let me click on this guy.
*  And it's usually some letters and the numbers
*  and the name maybe and a bunch of numbers.
*  And then I click and I'm really like, oh, fake person.
*  Just go through all this stuff.
*  Zero posts.
*  Yeah, it's all just retweeting inflammatory stuff.
*  And it's nutty fucking crazy politic takes
*  and really aggressive takes on things.
*  And like, wow, how many of them are there?
*  Yeah, there's no question that this is happening.
*  And the social media algorithms are feeding it
*  and playing right into it in our attention
*  and our minds are the commodity.
*  100%.
*  And if they can just trick you into buying some stuff
*  along the way, that'd be great.
*  Exactly.
*  Exactly.
*  Who would have ever thought that your data
*  would be so valuable?
*  That's the thing about when you and I were younger,
*  it meant nothing.
*  Your data meant nothing.
*  Like nobody, what is it?
*  What are you talking about?
*  My data. Exactly.
*  These are my data.
*  Right.
*  What is that?
*  Why would anybody be interested in that?
*  My first inclination that data meant something was,
*  I bought Dianetics.
*  I bought that book in like 1994
*  when I first moved to Hollywood.
*  And Scientology never stopped sending me things.
*  They never stopped. Like we got one.
*  Yeah, I was like, oh, that's how they get you.
*  And then they get you to join.
*  I guess you have to give them a piece,
*  give them a taste of what you're doing.
*  Do you turn the group?
*  Yeah.
*  And so data now is responsible
*  for the largest corporations
*  in terms of like the amount of money.
*  Like think about Apple, how big Apple is
*  and how much data Apple has.
*  And Apple's better with data than Android systems are.
*  And Google's terrible with it.
*  Like it's just like, there's a siphoning of data.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's the fallacy
*  and that's kind of the falsehood of the argument
*  who are, for people who are pushing that TikTok ban bill
*  is if they're claiming they're concerned
*  about data security and privacy
*  and making sure that our data is protected,
*  you got to do it across the board.
*  Yes.
*  Because every single one of these social media
*  or big tech companies is collecting
*  as much as they possibly can.
*  And if you think they're not selling it
*  to the highest bidder,
*  whether they be an American company or a foreign company,
*  of course they are.
*  This is their business model.
*  Wasn't there some controversy
*  about one of the DNA companies,
*  whether it's Ancestry or one of the other ones?
*  There was.
*  Where they sold their data to China.
*  I think so.
*  I don't remember which one.
*  You sold everybody's genes?
*  Like I didn't know you could do that.
*  I wouldn't have signed up for that.
*  You could sell my genes to China.
*  Like if China was like offering free DNA tests.
*  Was it?
*  Who they sold it to?
*  Big Pharma.
*  Ew, that's even scarier.
*  Who do they sell it to?
*  They could sell it to anybody else too, right?
*  This is 23andMe sells anonymous DNA data
*  to a drug company for 20 million.
*  That's not even that much.
*  It's not that much.
*  It's anonymous, guys.
*  It's anonymous.
*  Yeah, of course.
*  Of course.
*  Wasn't there one with China though, with Ancestry?
*  This is 23andMe.
*  This is Ancestry also.
*  This is Ancestry as well?
*  Interesting.
*  20 million dollars.
*  I remember something about China.
*  I mean, I just typed in data sold
*  and that's what comes up.
*  I might be on the wrong forums though.
*  I might be on some conspiratorial forums.
*  I might have gone too deep on the JFK rabbit hole
*  the other night.
*  This is what you said.
*  Oh, okay, China.
*  There it goes.
*  Groundbreaking move that has sent shock waves
*  through the biotech industry.
*  23andMe, the leading personal geonomics
*  and biotechnology companies,
*  officially announced the sale of its entire DNA database
*  to the Chinese government
*  for an astonishing 10 billion dollars.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, so that's the one I was looking for.
*  I'll just add that that's only coming
*  from a Medium article,
*  not any other articles that are saying that.
*  Jamie, why you gotta fuck it up with facts?
*  I'm just trying to understand what's happening.
*  I don't know that it's not.
*  Jamie is on it.
*  Why you gotta fuck it up with facts?
*  Yeah, who knows?
*  But your data is extremely valuable, and that's weird.
*  And it's also valuable to humans.
*  It's humans selling other humans' data.
*  Whether you call them Facebook or Google or the DEA,
*  it's just a bunch of people.
*  And if they don't have to follow the same rules
*  that you follow, then we have real problems.
*  And when you have entire groups of people
*  that are dependent upon technology
*  that's controlled almost entirely by one ideology,
*  and then you let the government get involved,
*  like they did with Twitter,
*  and you see the Twitter files,
*  you're like, oh, Jesus, this is bad.
*  You let the government have a back door,
*  and they started sneaking around
*  and telling you what to do and what not to do,
*  and you were complying?
*  People were telling other people
*  that they couldn't have experts from Harvard and Stanford
*  talk about medical problems.
*  You stop this, stop those experts from talking,
*  remove those posts, ban those people.
*  The government is saying that!
*  Exactly, exactly.
*  And even if they're not saying, hey, do this or else,
*  even if they're not making an explicit threat.
*  Just the fact that you're getting requests
*  from the government to do something like that.
*  Exactly, what are you gonna do?
*  The FBI is calling and saying,
*  hey, we'd really like you to do X, Y, or Z.
*  In my mind, I'd be like, okay,
*  what am I gonna be investigated for outside of this
*  if I say no?
*  Also.
*  What are the consequences gonna be?
*  If you're a person working at Twitter,
*  this is not you.
*  They're not investigating you.
*  They're investigating someone else.
*  So if they're going in, they're talking about these posts,
*  like, hey, this expert is spreading misinformation.
*  And they're causing vaccine hesitancy
*  or whatever they're causing.
*  We need to stop this, put a stop to this.
*  Why is the government being involved in a dispute
*  between doctors and the pharmaceutical drug companies?
*  What are you doing?
*  And how do you know?
*  Did you guys adjudiate this?
*  Did you guys get in front of a court?
*  Did you guys get in front of experts?
*  Did people testify?
*  Did you have someone who's pro and con this?
*  Someone who lays out this argument?
*  Did you examine this?
*  No, no, no, you didn't.
*  They just contacted Twitter and Twitter said okay.
*  Because what are they gonna do?
*  They're fucking executives.
*  If you're working at Twitter,
*  and this old Twitter and you're like super woke,
*  and you know you've just been drinking lattes
*  and going into the meditation room,
*  then all of a sudden you get an email from the FBI,
*  like I don't wanna fuck up this job.
*  I got a cushy job.
*  And you're like okay, what do I have to do?
*  I'll do that.
*  And so you do that.
*  And that's not good.
*  It's not good to have that kind of power
*  being wielded by other people.
*  They're just people.
*  You could call them the FBI, you can call them the DNA.
*  They're human beings.
*  And human beings that have that kind of power
*  over other human beings in a country
*  that's supposed to value freedom.
*  That in and of itself is un-American.
*  And that's where this isn't just like
*  some rogue FBI agent doing this
*  or some rogue bureaucrat in an agency
*  who's going and doing this.
*  This is an expressed policy
*  coming from the Biden administration in this example
*  to go and use big tech to silence certain people's voices
*  and to decide who does the government want to be heard
*  and who needs to be silenced.
*  And obviously we could talk all day
*  about the cozy relationship
*  that many politicians have with big pharma.
*  And it's not a surprise that they're going to act
*  in favor of big pharma rather than in favor of the truth
*  or free speech or people's health and wellbeing.
*  But the fact that this was and is
*  the Biden administration's policy
*  to decide that they are the arbiter
*  of what is misinformation, disinformation,
*  what is information, what is true and what is not.
*  And that they will use the tools available to them
*  both within the government
*  as well as outside of the government
*  in the case of big tech and social media
*  to be able to enforce that.
*  And that's really the,
*  for people who aren't paying attention to this stuff at home
*  and are just trying to live their lives
*  and go to work and take care of their kids
*  and just live their life.
*  It's easy to fall victim to like,
*  well, the government wants what's best for us
*  and they don't want us to be manipulated
*  by misinformation or disinformation.
*  And so this is the line that they use,
*  like we're doing this for you,
*  we're trying to protect you.
*  So once again, we're going to take away some of your freedom
*  and some of your privacy and tell you
*  who you should be listening to
*  and what information you should be getting.
*  The king knows.
*  Yes.
*  The king will tell the people how to live.
*  Yes.
*  This is how you wash.
*  This is coming from the same people
*  who are telling us that boys can become girls
*  on any day of the week because they feel like it.
*  Yeah, Rachel Levine is the first female emerald.
*  Exactly.
*  Yay, women win.
*  Which is, and then they stand there and say,
*  well, we are the champions for women.
*  If they cannot even accept objective truth.
*  We're living in the strangest of strange times.
*  It really is.
*  And I also think that a lot of that stuff
*  is being accentuated by social media,
*  manipulated intentionally,
*  because I think if you can just get those narratives
*  out there enough that affects the gullible people,
*  that affects sensitive people,
*  that affects people on the spectrum,
*  it affects a lot of people,
*  and then they start getting rewarded
*  for leaning into one type of ideology.
*  And then it's affecting people.
*  We are affected by our environment,
*  and to pretend otherwise is just silly,
*  especially when you're talking about young people.
*  Young people are particularly susceptible to propaganda,
*  which is why they have young people wear suicide vests.
*  That's why.
*  You can't get a 50-year-old agnostic dude
*  to wear a fucking suicide vest.
*  He's gonna go, what am I gonna get when I blow up?
*  I'm gonna go to heaven?
*  Can you show me?
*  You got a video?
*  Is there a YouTube video I can watch?
*  What are you saying?
*  But you could talk a five-year-old into it,
*  and that's what they do, and that's sick.
*  And it's just as sick to try to indoctrinate them
*  into these crazy ideologies,
*  because it's just people want other people
*  to join their fucking team.
*  It's a common thing that people do.
*  That's what's so concerning about,
*  we are seeing the fruits of the shift
*  in our education system away from actually teaching
*  about the Constitution and the founding documents
*  and the Federalist Papers and the thought process behind
*  that went into forming the Constitution
*  and the Bill of Rights in our schools.
*  Basic government, basic 101 on what is this country
*  really about?
*  What is the foundation that we were built upon?
*  And what does it mean to you in your everyday life
*  in talking about the Bill of Rights
*  and the First Amendment and going down the list,
*  because that has been absent largely
*  from our education system for so long,
*  it creates again this vulnerability
*  of young people being susceptible.
*  They're not rooted in ideology of freedom
*  and what that means in our lives and why it's important,
*  why we will fight to defend and protect it.
*  And so then they're like, well, I don't know.
*  Maybe what Hamas is offering is a superior ideology
*  or a superior value system than what we have here
*  in America, which a lot of these kids are saying,
*  whether they realize fully what it is or not,
*  they are falling victim to that ideology,
*  that radicalismist ideology,
*  which would be completely oppressive in the lives
*  that they are trying to live here.
*  Yeah, the whole proposal behind it is best highlighted
*  by the meme Queers for Palestine
*  and then Palestine for Queers.
*  The difference between, that idea is so crazy.
*  What you're saying is so nuts.
*  And it's just this, fuck the system,
*  fuck the government, fuck the patriarchy.
*  It's this ideology that gets promoted
*  that's frivolously wanting to destroy
*  the foundation of this country.
*  And they'll say it openly, we wanna just stop colonialism.
*  Okay, and then what?
*  Then what happens?
*  What do you have?
*  What do you have?
*  You have warlords?
*  What do you have?
*  What's gonna run the country?
*  How are you gonna run it?
*  We can do it with all the guns.
*  Well, that's where, again, Hamas had this whole thing planned,
*  like gaining the compassion and the sympathy of the world.
*  How did they plan that?
*  How did they think that they were gonna do that?
*  That they knew how Israel would react
*  and they were ready with social media
*  and then all of the means of communication
*  to play on the sympathies of people,
*  the compassion and kind-hearted people around the world
*  and turn people's attention away from the 1,200 people
*  that were murdered and killed
*  and the people that were raped on that attack on October 7th.
*  Their goal being, ultimately,
*  to influence populations around the world
*  towards this Islamist ideology
*  that they want to govern the world under Islamic rule,
*  under Sharia law.
*  And we've seen already how it's been successful
*  in some parts of the world, even in Europe, in France.
*  Somebody was saying that, I think it's 25% of France
*  is already living under Sharia law.
*  And so this ideological war that's being waged is not,
*  it's being waged by one side
*  and there's not a counter narrative.
*  There's not a counter war being waged on the other side
*  to defeat it with a superior ideology of freedom
*  and what we value as a society.
*  And that puts this mission and this effort,
*  and it's not just Hamas, obviously Al-Qaeda and ISIS
*  and other terrorist organizations around the world.
*  They all have that same objective,
*  which poses this great, the greatest short
*  and long-term threat to people who value freedom
*  and to civilization.
*  And we're also so uniquely vulnerable
*  in that we do have this sort of democracy.
*  It's obviously heavily influenced by money,
*  and then with the open borders,
*  so you have all these people funneling into the country.
*  And so you have an erosion of confidence
*  in our entire system,
*  because people are very aware of that
*  and the more people are let out of jail
*  after they commit violent crimes,
*  the more people are aware of that.
*  If you looked at the whole picture,
*  all the things that are in play right now,
*  particularly with the open borders
*  and giving people plane tickets
*  and flying them to all these different cities,
*  if I was gonna try to destroy the country,
*  that's how I would do it.
*  If I was gonna try to destroy the country,
*  I would radicalize the kids,
*  I would give them the stupidest ideas
*  and run them in their head.
*  Boys can be girls, girls can be boys,
*  boys can compete against girls in sports
*  if they think they're a girl,
*  queers for Palestine, the death to the Jews,
*  yell it out unironically on campuses.
*  And to have the presidents of those colleges
*  and universities defend it, which was wild.
*  With cameras on them!
*  Not even buying closed doors!
*  It shows how afraid they are
*  of actually calling out what is right and what is wrong.
*  I think it also shows how they live in a bubble
*  and I don't think they interact with the real world.
*  And I think when they did, the shock was probably,
*  it was probably horrifying to just realize
*  how most people feel about what they said.
*  Like, it's not harassment unless it's actionable.
*  Like what the fuck are you saying?
*  You're saying death to the Jews,
*  so you have to kill Jews, and then it's harassment.
*  Isn't that a little late?
*  I was shocked like everyone else
*  at not only their statements,
*  but how every one of them sitting at that table on that day
*  said almost the exact same thing
*  and knowing how much preparation.
*  Because when people come, I don't care who you are,
*  but when you come and testify before Congress,
*  you go through preparation.
*  If you're the president of an Ivy League university,
*  you're gonna have a whole team of people
*  sitting there telling you, okay, well, here are the questions
*  you should probably be prepared to answer.
*  The question that Elise Stefanik asked
*  was not outside of the realm of like,
*  here's what the frequently asked questions would be.
*  And the fact that their answers were all the same
*  and how they were smirking as they were giving that answer
*  I was very surprised by.
*  Maybe I shouldn't have been as surprised
*  given what they're doing.
*  I think we're sending our kids to cult camps.
*  That's what I think.
*  I think they get indoctrinated into this.
*  They don't all, some of them skate through,
*  some of them are wise, some of them realize this is crazy.
*  Can't wait to get the fuck out of here and get my degree
*  and then go to work.
*  But some of them just get locked in
*  and then it becomes their identity.
*  And it's dangerous.
*  It's dangerous also because, look,
*  kids don't wanna listen, okay?
*  And if you have kids, they don't wanna listen to you.
*  They wanna rebel.
*  And when they finally get to go away somewhere
*  and be on their own and your dad's a banker,
*  you're like, fuck that asshole, capitalism is bullshit.
*  And you're wearing a Che Guevara t-shirt,
*  you don't know what the fuck you're doing.
*  You need some chat GBT to answer your homework.
*  The whole thing is nuts.
*  And then you're allowing those young people
*  just trying out being an adult with a voice and an opinion
*  and trying to be profound.
*  Yeah, and there's no consequences to actions.
*  No, it's weird, it's weird, it's weird.
*  It's weird that people can't see it
*  and I'm glad that some people are pulling funding.
*  Like there's a lot of people that are donors
*  like, hey, fuck you, this is crazy.
*  And so that's fortunate that there's some sort
*  of a blowback, but even that woman from Harvard,
*  even though she was plagiarized many times,
*  like if you were a grad student, you got plagiarized,
*  that would be a wrap for you.
*  But meanwhile, she keeps making the same amount of money,
*  they just gave her a different job.
*  They didn't even fire her.
*  The whole thing's crazy.
*  The whole thing's crazy, it's like,
*  that's supposed to be Harvard.
*  It's supposed to be the smartest people amongst us.
*  And when you heard that lady talk, you're like,
*  hey, how did she get to the top?
*  That seems bananas.
*  It seems like you probably had some better choices.
*  Was there any other considerations
*  into how she got that gig?
*  Exactly.
*  But the plagiarism doesn't freak you guys out?
*  Isn't that like opposed to everything that you stand for?
*  Yes.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah, it was very telling.
*  So what are you doing?
*  You're not the best and the brightest anymore.
*  You guys are doing nonsense.
*  This is a cult camp.
*  You got a cult camp, you're indoctrinating people,
*  and where are you getting your money?
*  And how much of that money's coming from China?
*  And how much of the influence is coming from Russia?
*  How much of the influence in the past
*  has shaped these people?
*  So you have this system where academics go to school,
*  they learn, they get indoctrinated,
*  and they start teaching,
*  and they never enter into the real world.
*  And they make this cycle,
*  and those are the people
*  that keep indoctrinating more people,
*  and now they're infesting these social media apps,
*  and they're infesting all of these tech companies.
*  And everybody else is like, what are you doing?
*  Exactly.
*  This is crazy.
*  But it's all coming from universities.
*  It's coming from the kids
*  that get indoctrinated in these ideologies.
*  And I remember when I first started talking about this
*  in like 2015 or 16,
*  whenever the Jordan Peterson thing was happening,
*  it was at first it was Bret Weinstein
*  and Evergreen College.
*  And people were like, why do you care
*  what's happening in these obscure colleges?
*  I go, hey, they're gonna graduate.
*  When I see fire and it's five miles away,
*  I don't go, oh, it's five miles away.
*  I go, hey, we gotta get the fuck out of here now.
*  Get out of here now, fire's coming.
*  Get out.
*  Like you don't see that these kids are gonna leave school.
*  They're so crazy.
*  They believe that you should have a day
*  where you tell white people they have to stay home.
*  When it used to be that it was an appreciation
*  of people of color so they could take the day off
*  and they would get paid.
*  And you go, oh, I really miss Mike.
*  I really miss Tanya.
*  It'd be great if she was here.
*  And boy, it's hard not working with her
*  and doing her job and my job at the same time.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay, that makes sense.
*  But telling white people they have to stay home
*  and then threatening them with baseball bats
*  if they don't have people roaming the parking lot with bats.
*  When I saw that, I was like, this is crazy.
*  And so many people were saying, why do you care?
*  Well, they're gonna go out in the world.
*  And if this is happening there,
*  it's not an isolated situation.
*  It's happening to other people.
*  And then the Jordan Peterson thing in Toronto.
*  And like, okay, guys.
*  And now everyone is sort of realizing,
*  oh, this is a real problem.
*  This is infesting the world.
*  This ideology is pervasive.
*  And it's not well thought out.
*  No.
*  This is not just like fact-based objective assessment,
*  being kind and understanding
*  and taking into account all the variables.
*  No, it's like a cult.
*  Yeah, the problem is not everyone
*  is seeing what's really happening.
*  You still have the AOCs of the world
*  and many people within the leadership
*  of the Democratic Party who,
*  this is the direction we are headed.
*  And that's a very dangerous thing for so many reasons,
*  but obviously because they're in a position of power
*  and how they're using that power
*  and how they're undermining the rule of law
*  and choosing, again, who gets to speak freely
*  and who gets to go and do whatever they want,
*  break the law,
*  disturb the peace, acts of violence.
*  No, because what?
*  What you think that their cause is justified.
*  But meanwhile, others who would do the very same thing
*  be charged with a crime.
*  Imagine if AOC got to write history books
*  and they said, why do people sneak into America in 2024?
*  Oh, climate change.
*  20 years from now, climate change was so bad
*  that people were walking from Guatemala
*  to get plane tickets to fly to Michigan.
*  Like for real, are you sure?
*  Oh my gosh. Are you sure that happened?
*  Maybe there's other variables.
*  What do you think?
*  Maybe he's encouraged. Perhaps.
*  Maybe there's a whole Red Cross map that they could follow.
*  Hey guys.
*  Maybe some of the stops along the way,
*  they only speak Chinese and they have Chinese signs
*  and it seems like there's a concerted effort
*  to get people in from China.
*  Hey, something going on?
*  No, just climate change.
*  Oh, so simple.
*  So nice to be able to just write something off.
*  That's just as bad as the people who break into stores
*  in New York City.
*  They're just hungry and trying to steal bread
*  for their starving kids.
*  Yeah, that was a good one too.
*  Yeah. Yeah, that lady.
*  Forget the guys who go in and steal 50 Apple iPhones
*  from the store and run out and jump in their car
*  or all of these other things.
*  It's hard to believe that a person
*  who's a member of Congress
*  can say that with a straight face.
*  Well, the best one was,
*  do you ever see the conversation that she had
*  with the news reporter where the reporter was asking her
*  to clarify her thoughts on Israel and Palestine?
*  Yes, I did.
*  That one's wonderful.
*  She had nothing to say.
*  It seemed like she didn't even know where they were.
*  If you gave her a map and this had no names on it,
*  which one of these is Israel?
*  Yeah.
*  What do you know about the history?
*  What do you know about, what happened in 1947?
*  Anything?
*  What was going on before that?
*  Who lived there first?
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  What's Judea?
*  What's that place about?
*  Yeah.
*  Exactly.
*  What's the biblical significance of these locations?
*  Any?
*  How long has this dispute been going on?
*  Yeah.
*  What's happening?
*  How much are we funding this?
*  There are these girls who, again,
*  I don't know where this video is.
*  I'm sure it's everywhere now,
*  but they were left Columbia to go
*  and stand with the students protesting at NYU.
*  And somebody said, well, why are you here?
*  They're like, oh, we're here to stand in solidarity
*  with the protesters.
*  What is NYU doing that you're protesting?
*  Oh, I don't really know.
*  And then she turned to her friend,
*  she's like, why are we here?
*  What are they doing that's wrong?
*  And the friend said, I wish I was more educated
*  because I don't really know either.
*  Well, you know.
*  They're just out there being virtuous.
*  Somebody asked us to come,
*  so we're just coming to stand in solidarity.
*  Well, there's this thing that you can do now
*  where if you just yell out the thing that's popular,
*  now you become cooler than you really are.
*  It's a new thing you can do.
*  And if you're really rabid about it,
*  and then you can demand other people
*  to do it on their social media,
*  how come you're not putting a black square up on Tuesday?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, all of these things,
*  these were major drivers for me
*  in leaving the insanity of what has become
*  the today's Democratic Party.
*  And where I have seen and heard directly
*  from so many people who are or have already woken up
*  to that fact of literally just being common sense minded
*  Americans who are just, there's no explanation.
*  There's no logic.
*  There's no rationale that you can give
*  for these kinds of things happening
*  and not just by some rogue member of Congress.
*  I mean, it's happening from the very top.
*  Yeah.
*  It's the consequence of money being involved in politics.
*  And that seems like that web is so deep
*  and those roots run so deep
*  that to try to stop that now is almost impossible.
*  It's almost like the only way to solve this
*  is to give corporations conscience.
*  It's like the only way to solve this is
*  you've got to figure out who is funding what and why.
*  Why is so much money being spent on this versus that?
*  And one of the things about AI is that
*  if AI is asked at a certain point in time
*  when it becomes like sentient or really super powerful,
*  like what is the solution between the conflict
*  between Ukraine and Russia?
*  And what's the cause of it?
*  And AI gives like a real comprehensive analysis
*  of the US government funded coup from 2014
*  and how NATO has been moving arms closer to Russia
*  and like lays it all out.
*  And like, this is the definitive objective.
*  No ideology, no bullshit reason why this is happening.
*  And these are the companies that are pushing the conflict
*  and this is the amount of money they're making from it.
*  And here's the amount of money that's missing
*  because there's corruption involved in Ukraine.
*  As much as people don't want to admit,
*  one of the wildest ones was Candace Owens on Twitter
*  where the New York Times, they tweeted her like,
*  what evidence do you have of corruption in Ukraine?
*  And she's like, from your own fucking newspaper?
*  She's posting links.
*  It's like, do you guys not even check
*  before you tweet out publicly?
*  Do you not do journalism?
*  Well, they were also the ones that said,
*  the New York Times said that that bomb landed
*  in the hospital and killed 500 people.
*  And it apparently landed in the parking lot
*  and killed a small number of people.
*  And it probably was not from Israel,
*  but was actually some, one of the Islamic terrorists
*  had launched a bomb and it accidentally landed
*  in the parking lot.
*  And no effort to actually, truly,
*  not in the fine print on the back page of the paper,
*  but actually make sure that they got the facts right.
*  Well, and certainly no equivalent coverage
*  of the actual true story versus the original story,
*  which you should do.
*  It's like, yeah, maybe you got bad information.
*  Explain how you got bad information.
*  Same people read the newspaper, read this, now they know.
*  Let them know, don't just fucking hide it.
*  Don't pretend you didn't fuck up.
*  I mean, it's the same reason why with Julian Assange,
*  back when his criminal charges were first coming up,
*  they were saying, hey, this is a threat to journalism,
*  that you can't suppress the free press.
*  It is a violation of the First Amendment.
*  And if you go after Julian Assange today,
*  they could go after a New York Times journalist tomorrow.
*  I think we were seeing it from the Washington Post
*  and some of the other mainstream traditional news sources,
*  but the script was totally flipped
*  and they shut up real quick
*  and turned their sights against Julian Assange
*  after he released Hillary Clinton's emails.
*  Why?
*  They have become, unfortunately,
*  a political arm of the Democrat elite.
*  And it's the same reason why they stopped reporting
*  on actual corruption in Ukraine,
*  because they get, okay, what's the narrative
*  that we've gotta push?
*  And they're not gonna go against it.
*  Not allow facts and journalism to get in the way of that.
*  It's spooky.
*  It's spooky for people that count on them for the news.
*  Because it's like, okay, now who do I have to trust?
*  Who can I listen to?
*  And it turns out it's like a lot of independent people
*  and those are the only ones that are, they're free.
*  They're free to actually report for now.
*  These laws are passed.
*  Did that TikTok thing pass?
*  It did pass.
*  So that's it.
*  It's done.
*  That's it?
*  Yeah.
*  Do you know Adam Curry?
*  It will be challenged.
*  I'm sure it'll be challenged in court.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know by who or what the next steps will be,
*  but I'm sure it will be challenged.
*  I believe that President Biden signed it into law.
*  Actually, I know he did, but the timeline of execution,
*  I think they gave something like 180 days for TikTok
*  to be sold to an American company.
*  Oh, great.
*  Give it to Bill Gates.
*  But even if that's a pretty tight turnaround
*  when you look at that,
*  but that doesn't negate all of the other provisions
*  within that law that further violate our civil liberties.
*  Do you know Adam Curry?
*  I don't.
*  Adam Curry used to be an MTV VJ.
*  He's the original podcaster.
*  He's the pod father, the real number one, brilliant guy.
*  But I had him on the podcast quite a while ago
*  and he said that all this uproar over TikTok
*  is total bullshit.
*  He said, what it is is the Chinese are eating our lunch.
*  They've developed an app that is more addictive
*  and collects data just like our apps do,
*  but we don't like it.
*  We don't like it because their one is way better.
*  And so they're trying to do something to shut it down
*  because they're using it to influence us.
*  And like, hey, we're the only ones allowed to do that.
*  And that's what he thinks.
*  And when he said that, I was like,
*  I never really considered that.
*  Because I always was like, oh, this TikTok is really bad.
*  You've got to read the fine print.
*  And it is bad.
*  I mean, if you look at the terms of service,
*  when you're greening, the conditions that you agree to,
*  they get to monitor your keystrokes.
*  So that means they can probably monitor your passwords.
*  They can probably check out all your emails.
*  They get to monitor other computers
*  that are connected to the network,
*  even if they don't have TikTok on them.
*  It's bananas.
*  But who else is doing that?
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  That's the point.
*  When you and I are having a conversation,
*  and then all of a sudden we talk about Toyota trucks,
*  and there's an app for a Toyota truck,
*  like, hey, did you guys know that we were talking about,
*  are you listening, Google?
*  Exactly.
*  What are you doing?
*  Google, Meta, Facebook, Instagram, all of it.
*  How the fuck do you know what I'm interested in?
*  Right, exactly.
*  Because they're trying to sell you things.
*  They're all trying to sell you things.
*  Of course, of course.
*  Yeah, and the best way to sell people things
*  is find out what the fuck they're talking about.
*  What do you want?
*  Yeah, I mean, it makes total sense, of course.
*  Elon and X, well, Elon specifically,
*  was the only one who stood up
*  amongst our American big tech companies to say,
*  no, this is a very bad bill.
*  The others, to my knowledge, were very, very silent,
*  or they were actually coming out in support of it.
*  Competition, makes sense.
*  The other piece of that is, other than X and TikTok,
*  the Biden administration has been very successful
*  at working with Google and Meta, Facebook, Instagram,
*  in being able to control
*  quote unquote disinformation and information.
*  So when you look at it from a government standpoint,
*  well, if you're concerned about data security and privacy,
*  why aren't you doing it across the board
*  and treating every social media company
*  that Americans use with that same standard?
*  Well, maybe they're just going after the ones
*  that they can't actually control and intimidate
*  into doing their work for them, which is why it makes sense,
*  why Elon Musk and others would say, well, of course,
*  if today it's TikTok, then why wouldn't it be X tomorrow?
*  It's interesting to me that people don't seem to understand
*  the value and importance of a guy like Elon,
*  who's this wild billionaire character
*  who likes to dunk on people.
*  That guy being like, did you see that thing
*  that he posted the other day?
*  Because one of the guys who was from Facebook, I believe,
*  said that what Elon is doing is corruption
*  on an Enron level, I think he compared it to.
*  So Elon posted a photo of a dog
*  laying its balls on another dog's head.
*  I did not see this.
*  And was dunking on this dude.
*  I'm like, how wild is this guy?
*  And then someone said,
*  did you really spend $44 billion on Twitter
*  so you can dunk on people?
*  And he writes 100%.
*  He's like.
*  I don't know how he has time for this.
*  I don't get it, I don't understand it.
*  It doesn't make any sense to me.
*  But he does.
*  And do everything else that he's doing.
*  He's a fascinating guy.
*  I mean, his brain is a fucking tornado of information
*  just flying around all the time.
*  And I think it helps him to be able to just fuck around
*  and be silly.
*  But he was the only one that recognized
*  that there's a real problem
*  if you have the entire narrative being controlled
*  by one ideology through all the social media apps
*  and that's what's going on.
*  Exactly.
*  They're all tech companies.
*  Tech companies have hired people
*  that are coming from universities
*  and they're all infected by this ideology.
*  And it's nuts that that's the case.
*  And then they've done a really good job.
*  If you go to like Gab or any other, especially initially,
*  like it was so nuts.
*  You're like, oh my God, I gotta get out of here.
*  It was like going to a Nazi party.
*  Like, oh, like even if you're not a Nazi,
*  like they're Sieg Heil in the corner,
*  like shit, I gotta get out of here.
*  I don't know how it is now.
*  I never went in those rooms.
*  I don't know how it is now.
*  But I guarantee some of that was fake too.
*  I guarantee when they came up
*  with these alternative platforms
*  that people wanted to squash the idea
*  of having people that were free outside of Twitter
*  and Facebook that were reasonable people
*  that just wanted objective conversation,
*  which I guarantee most of them were.
*  Most of them were tired of being censored on Twitter
*  and shadow ban and all that shit.
*  So they try these other, whether it's Gab
*  or Truth Social or any of them.
*  I guarantee you, look, if I was a intelligence agent
*  and I was inclined to do,
*  I would get in there and start Sieg Heilin.
*  I'd go crazy.
*  I'd post the most racist memes and have everybody salute.
*  I'd go nutty.
*  I'd have fake accounts liking those things
*  and getting excited about it and reposting it
*  because that's how you make a place toxic.
*  And that's how you kill the competition.
*  I would do that.
*  I would do that if I was running Twitter.
*  If you were just a kid, I obviously wouldn't do it.
*  Me as a person.
*  But if I was an evil fuck, I would go,
*  this is the way to do it.
*  It makes sense.
*  It makes sense.
*  How do you make it a place where people don't wanna be?
*  How hard is that to do?
*  You hire a bunch of people to do it.
*  You get algorithms.
*  You develop them.
*  You start posting memes and shit.
*  Easy.
*  Now you make it toxic.
*  Now I look and they're like, ugh,
*  we gotta get outta here.
*  Exactly.
*  Makes sense.
*  And so then you don't have an alternative
*  and you go back to Twitter
*  and you just deal with the fact that you're being censored
*  and you deal with the fact that if you're a left-wing person,
*  you could say the most outrageous shit,
*  even call for violence against people.
*  Twitter caught selling data to government spies
*  while complaining about surveillance.
*  In for a penny.
*  In for a data mine.
*  Is this recently?
*  What is this saying now?
*  They have a deal with a company called Data Miner.
*  And what does Data Miner do?
*  Uses AI technology to constantly monitor public activity
*  on social media and other parts of the web.
*  In doing so, its clients,
*  often law enforcement can receive customized real-time alerts
*  on what's brewing online,
*  which helps them to respond to natural disasters
*  or more ominously, spy on protests.
*  Notes the intercept.
*  Okay.
*  But also does allow them real-time alerts
*  of what's brewing online.
*  So you're not saying they're censoring people.
*  You're saying that they're allowing them to look at data.
*  So that data could be like how many people are posting
*  about some sort of a protest
*  where they wanna burn down a church
*  or whatever the fuck it is.
*  You're talking about a different thing
*  than banning people from posting things,
*  especially these people that are experts
*  from Harvard and MIT.
*  And this is a different thing.
*  I've seen, I mean, there's a Data Miner app.
*  I've seen how the information flows through.
*  I don't know what the,
*  it says the story revealed the surveillance firm
*  pays for special access to a fire hose of data from Twitter.
*  I'd be curious about what that fire hose of data is.
*  It says Data Miner has a unique contractual relationship
*  with Twitter, whereby they have real-time access
*  to the full stream of all publicly available tweets.
*  So, but it's just publicly available tweets
*  that are already available.
*  So it's like a very high-level search function.
*  A company representative said an email
*  to the government agency per the report.
*  So is that like a search function?
*  Like, cause it's all public tweets.
*  So they have access to the stream
*  of all publicly available tweets.
*  But doesn't everybody have access
*  to the publicly available tweets?
*  Not with AI software monitoring it.
*  Right, but if you did have an AI,
*  say if you had an AI, whether it's Google's AI or any AI,
*  and you said, hey, go look at Twitter.
*  Tell me who's talking about Nazis.
*  Right, curating the tweets that are coming into your feed.
*  That's part of what he's been complaining about online
*  is how many people, and they've blocked access
*  to many programs that did have access to the API
*  because it costs money for them
*  every time someone's taking that.
*  So they just kind of cut it all off.
*  Like I used to use TweetDeck to look at Twitter
*  all the time.
*  That doesn't work anymore?
*  You have to pay for it.
*  Oh, interesting.
*  Interesting, how come?
*  Because I honestly don't know.
*  Arguably it would just be like, it was a good feature,
*  so you might as well make people pay for it
*  cause they need to make money.
*  How much TweetDeck cost?
*  It's part of the pro, so you have to pay for pro.
*  Okay.
*  It's like 20 bucks a month or some shit.
*  And then there's the other thing
*  where like Apple takes a slice of that
*  if you're getting it off of your iPhone, right?
*  If you get it from the app store.
*  That's where if you pay for it on like Twitter,
*  on the website, no.
*  But if you use the phone app on your phone.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  Apple's got the wildest thing going.
*  They get 30% of everything.
*  They have so much money.
*  They have more money than countries.
*  There's a lot of countries
*  that don't have as much money as Apple.
*  Yeah, I believe it.
*  It's pretty nutty.
*  That's being challenged I feel like in a lawsuit too.
*  Yes, well there's certain things that Apple does
*  that are thought to be anti-competitive
*  in a kind of a creepy way.
*  And one of them that they just recently got rid of
*  is the lightning connection, right?
*  So up until iPhone 15 or 16, 16?
*  What are we on now?
*  16?
*  We're on 15 now?
*  So up until 15, you used to have to use
*  a lightning connector,
*  which only works on Apple devices.
*  Now you can use USB-C, which is way better.
*  It's better for data connect.
*  It's better for connectivity.
*  It's better for charging, get faster charging.
*  Like the Android phones,
*  like particularly like Samsung Galaxy,
*  to go to full charge is like an hour less time.
*  Because it takes faster watt charging
*  than the iPhone does.
*  And for the longest time,
*  we have much better transfer of data because of USB-C.
*  It's just a better, more efficient system.
*  But Apple's like, yeah, you gotta use that.
*  So the European Union, I think that was the problem.
*  They couldn't sell them over there anymore.
*  They made it illegal.
*  So then they had to switch it over to USB-C.
*  So now everybody at least has a universal thing.
*  And then there's the problem with text messaging.
*  So if you have an Android and you send me a text message,
*  it comes out green.
*  And then I send you one, it comes green.
*  Because it's text, it's SMS.
*  And so now they're going to adopt RCS.
*  So the idea is since you can't have iMessage on everything,
*  at least you'll have encryption
*  and you'll be able to send large file sizes.
*  And that's what RCS is.
*  Higher level of text messaging
*  that's been enjoyed by people who use Androids,
*  but not when they communicate with iPhones.
*  iPhones were forcing people to use SMS.
*  But it's shitty, it's inferior.
*  You get like blurry images and videos,
*  not the same resolution.
*  It cuts it all down.
*  Compresses them.
*  Because it has to fit in the SMS format.
*  So now you'll be able to share photos
*  just like you will with an iPhone,
*  with an iPhone to iPhone.
*  Interesting.
*  So no more green text messages?
*  No, the text messages will still be green.
*  Oh, interesting.
*  But now they want you to feel like shit.
*  They want you to feel like shit
*  for having a different device.
*  I think I, yeah, exactly.
*  It works, kids.
*  It does work.
*  The thing with kids, I think with teenagers,
*  see if this is true.
*  I believe I read that it was something like 86%
*  of all teenagers, it was some high number,
*  of all teenagers use iPhones.
*  That like you're shunned if you use an Android.
*  Which is crazy.
*  It is crazy.
*  It's weird.
*  But that's how tribal people are.
*  We're tribal about our cell phones.
*  It's nuts.
*  We're tribal about the kind of computers we use,
*  kind of sneakers.
*  I'm gonna D this guy, fuck Nike.
*  You know, like people are crazy.
*  87% of teens in the USA have an iPhone.
*  While 88% expect an iPhone to be their next phone,
*  according to a survey from investment firm,
*  Piper Sandler.
*  That is a monopoly.
*  It's a huge monopoly.
*  That is wild.
*  Yeah.
*  That's wild.
*  And how they control their apps
*  and how much money they make off of the apps.
*  Well, also their whole ecosystem is amazing.
*  It's really good.
*  Like they figured out a lot of really good things.
*  Yeah.
*  Like it's so convenient that I can write on my computer
*  and then I can transfer it to my notes
*  and it's automatically on my phone.
*  Exactly.
*  I don't have to do anything else.
*  I use it all the time.
*  It's so good.
*  Yep.
*  That's so good.
*  You can do that with Samsung.
*  You can do that with Android.
*  You can do that.
*  It's just, you know, you'd have to switch systems
*  and like relearn how the, it's not hard to do.
*  They're pretty intuitive.
*  You know, I have a Samsung phone.
*  I have an older one.
*  I have a Galaxy, one of the ultras that I used to think
*  took a clear photo of the moon, but it's actually bullshit.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you know that story?
*  No.
*  You don't know that?
*  No.
*  They got me.
*  They got me.
*  There was a feature that's still a feature.
*  It's kind of amazing.
*  It's called moon shot.
*  And so you could be looking at the moon.
*  If you look at the moon with your iPhone
*  and try to take a photo of it,
*  it looks like dog shit.
*  It looks terrible because it's just like this blurry thing.
*  Yeah.
*  And if you zoom in, it looks terrible.
*  But with Samsung's, when you zoom in,
*  it holds a square over the moon and it enhances it.
*  And it gives you like a hundred X zoom.
*  So you get this crazy digital zoom.
*  You zoom in on the moon and it looks really clear.
*  And you took a photo, but it turned out it was AI.
*  Because.
*  No.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  Because some clever internet people,
*  because you can't fool the internet,
*  what they did is they took a blurry image of the moon
*  and they put it on a desktop computer
*  and then took a photo with the camera of the blurry image
*  on the desktop computer and it filled it in
*  and made it pretty.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, you fucking frauds.
*  That's a smart hack to figure it out.
*  I've seen people try to argue away and say,
*  well, it's actually no different
*  than how AI enhances normal.
*  Yeah.
*  No.
*  No, you take a picture.
*  No, you're talking about the moon.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a lot of detail there.
*  Yeah, what if there's a UFO I missed?
*  Right.
*  There's a UFO.
*  Exactly.
*  You're trying to tell me the mothership
*  is circling around the moon and you're lying to me.
*  You guys are liars.
*  But other than that,
*  the technology is actually superior on those phones.
*  The Samsung's?
*  Oh yeah, it's quite a bit better.
*  The screens are quite a bit better.
*  The screens have an anti-reflective coding
*  on the new S24 Ultra.
*  So even in bright sunlight when you're outside,
*  you could read your screen perfect.
*  It doesn't, you don't have the glare
*  that you do when you're trying to look at your phone
*  like this.
*  You don't have to do that with Samsung.
*  Interesting.
*  You also have superior battery life.
*  You only have like a tiny little circle
*  that's missing from the screen for the camera.
*  You don't have that big ass stupid bar
*  that's in the front for face ID.
*  There's a lot of things that are there.
*  It has a pen, you could write on it.
*  Like it has AI features.
*  It lets you translate in real time.
*  You and I can be having a conversation.
*  You could be speaking Spanish
*  and it would show me in English in real time.
*  And then I could speak to you in English
*  and it would show you in Spanish.
*  So the phone gets split down the middle.
*  So this side faces you and that side faces me.
*  And we would have a conversation
*  and I could read what you're saying.
*  And then you could wear these earbuds
*  and it will translate it in real time.
*  Oh wow.
*  Which is crazy.
*  That's incredible.
*  It's crazy.
*  I tried using the Google Translate app
*  when I was down at the border
*  and talking to different people
*  from different parts of the world.
*  And it sucked.
*  The intent I think was for that to happen
*  is like you just turn on the microphone
*  and then I could speak and they could see in the screen
*  like it's translating into their language
*  and then they could respond in their language
*  and you're just seeing it play out real time.
*  But it didn't work.
*  It didn't work.
*  It just didn't work.
*  The thing froze or it didn't translate
*  and then you gotta push all these buttons
*  and then even then.
*  Well the same song one is using AI
*  and I think it's the most advanced version.
*  It also has a thing where it lets you
*  organize your notes in AI.
*  And also it'll change the tone of your text messages.
*  Like it'll suggest things that are more polite
*  or more friendly.
*  Yeah there's like modes that you can do.
*  So you can do AI for that.
*  You could also.
*  That might piss me off sometime
*  if I don't really wanna write a polite text message.
*  Right.
*  Well then you don't have to.
*  You can write it in your own language.
*  You can write it however you want.
*  In your own voice.
*  But then you can also ask it to make this more polite.
*  Oh wow okay.
*  That's what it is.
*  So it's not as if you say hey Tulsi,
*  how about you be a little nicer.
*  Right exactly.
*  It doesn't do that.
*  Okay so it's not policing me.
*  It also will summarize webpages.
*  So if you go to a webpage and go
*  I don't wanna read all this shit.
*  Yeah.
*  Give me a summary.
*  And it'll instantly.
*  It'll say this is what's going on.
*  This is the problem.
*  Here's what's the dilemma.
*  Yeah.
*  And you're like oh.
*  It'll break things down to you.
*  So it's using AI on the phone.
*  In constructive ways.
*  But 86% of kids don't have it.
*  Yeah.
*  Weird.
*  Have you heard of this unplugged phone
*  that Eric Prince is doing?
*  Yes.
*  Yeah I have heard of it.
*  It's interesting.
*  I just got one.
*  I haven't set it up yet.
*  But it is what they're saying is the most secure means
*  of communication.
*  Obviously technology is never 100% secure.
*  But the fact that it does not have the same ad ID numbers
*  that every one of our other phones has.
*  Apple, Samsung, whatever makes it so that
*  we are able to protect more of our information
*  than we would otherwise.
*  Right.
*  But do you get to use apps with that?
*  Yeah.
*  Can you use Instagram?
*  They have their own operating system and their own apps.
*  But you can also download whatever apps
*  you want to download.
*  But if you download Instagram.
*  The settings you are able to actually make it
*  so that Instagram is not able to collect the kind of data
*  that they would otherwise.
*  Really?
*  Yes.
*  So what is it operating on?
*  Is it like Graphene?
*  What is the operating system?
*  I haven't set it up yet.
*  It is an operating system.
*  They got the guy who as their CTO
*  who created the Pegasus system.
*  Oh great, you can trust him.
*  That was my question.
*  If you're gonna make, first of all,
*  if you're gonna make a honey pot phone.
*  Yeah, there's two sides of that.
*  Is if you created it, then ideally you would know
*  how to protect against it, right?
*  Yes, for sure.
*  Or you would say, look, the kind of people
*  that want a phone like this, these rah rah,
*  fuck the government people,
*  like these type of people that might get visited by the FBI.
*  Give them a phone, call them like the Patriot phone
*  or whatever the fuck you wanna call it.
*  So they get a nice little honey pot.
*  I'm not saying that it is.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  Well, so I asked them, it sounds like
*  this is the perfect kind of phone for people in the military
*  or people who are conducting different kinds of operations
*  because of all of these protections
*  and so on and so forth.
*  And they said they're intentionally not selling
*  to the US government
*  because they don't want that doubt to be in people's minds
*  that this is some kind of op that's happening
*  that will allow some kind of surveillance to take place.
*  Anyway, it's interesting.
*  That is interesting.
*  There are other phones that do that.
*  There's phones that operate on,
*  they operate on an operating system called Graphene OS.
*  So you take a phone, like a Google phone,
*  and they de-Google it.
*  So they remove all the Google stuff
*  and then there's a bunch of detailed instructions
*  of how to do it.
*  And then they put this new operating system on.
*  When the new operating system works,
*  all your shit doesn't work.
*  Like all the normal Google services and all that stuff.
*  It's a completely different operating system.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  There's, they have figured out how to do both.
*  You can toggle on and off what mode you want to be in
*  and it's got the VPNs and everything else.
*  And that's the suspicious hippo face.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, skeptical hippo.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, if someone did figure something like out,
*  that'd be great.
*  I've asked Elon about that once
*  because I'd read this story about a Tesla phone.
*  He's like, oh God, I hope we don't have to make phones.
*  But it's the way he said it.
*  I hope we don't have to make phones.
*  Interesting.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Because when you look at the interconnectedness
*  between Tesla and you look at obviously the power element
*  and then the car element
*  and then you look at the content platform
*  that they are building X into,
*  like the vision that they have for it to be the one stop shop,
*  not only for all different kinds of media,
*  but for payment and interaction and business and commerce
*  and everything else.
*  It's interesting when you look at that direction of connectivity.
*  It is also interesting that if you have a Tesla
*  and I have one, I love it.
*  You can't get Apple CarPlay.
*  Doesn't come with it. No Apple CarPlay.
*  Fuck off.
*  Interesting.
*  Fuck off, stupid.
*  Use our shit.
*  So what can you use then?
*  Just their organic...
*  Well, you can Bluetooth your phone.
*  You can play music.
*  If you have Spotify hooked up to your phone on Bluetooth,
*  you play a song on Spotify to play on that.
*  And you also have, there's a lot of options.
*  Spotify is built into the system.
*  So you could just tell it.
*  You could press it, play Notorious B.I.G.
*  and it'll just start playing random songs.
*  You can tell it what song to play.
*  Interesting.
*  And then you can just press the button.
*  You say, hey, navigate to Eddie V's steakhouse.
*  Bam, it'll take you there.
*  OK.
*  So it's got this big ass huge screen.
*  You have this giant, I don't know how long it is.
*  How long is the screen on our cars?
*  It's like 18 inches.
*  Looks like that's about 18 inches, right?
*  And it's just massive map.
*  So for navigation and everything, it's great.
*  Yeah.
*  But if I was going to make a phone,
*  I wouldn't allow Android or Apple to have carplay.
*  Fuck off.
*  Right.
*  Fuck off.
*  Use my shit.
*  And then once you develop an X phone,
*  I wouldn't be surprised.
*  I could see it.
*  I'm sure he's thought of it.
*  I'm sure he's thought of it other than me saying that to him.
*  I'm sure that's not the first time he thought of it.
*  Yeah.
*  Because if anybody could pull it off, it's probably Elon.
*  It's probably Twitter and X whatever.
*  If they came up with a SpaceX phone, all the nerds would be like,
*  Come on.
*  Especially if it was good.
*  Yeah.
*  Especially if people move to more secure messaging systems
*  that are end-to-end encrypted like Signal,
*  which also I get skeptical about.
*  I read something on one of them forums
*  where they were saying that Signal was funded by CIA money.
*  Is that true?
*  Which is not, that's not good.
*  And then there's WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook.
*  Yeah.
*  WhatsApp is not a secure form of communication.
*  It's not?
*  No.
*  Is it sus?
*  No.
*  It's more than sus.
*  Super sus?
*  Yes.
*  I just want to hear you say super sus.
*  It's confirmed sus.
*  How about that?
*  Freedom of the Press Foundation acted as Signal's fiscal sponsor between 2013 and 2016.
*  The project received grants from the Knight Foundation,
*  the Shuttleworth Foundation, and almost 3 million from the US government,
*  a sponsored open technology fund.
*  Yeah.
*  What does that say down there on Reddit?
*  Article claims Signal's origins as a US government asset are public record
*  and a lack of funding is because of the CIA?
*  I found this article that makes it claim that Signal's origins as a US government asset
*  are a matter of extensive public record even if the scope and scale of the funding provided
*  has until now.
*  Does anyone here know what public records they're referring to here?
*  It says if so, does anyone have links to these public records?
*  This means Signal is a honeypot.
*  Hmm.
*  They also say that Signal handed people over to the CIA.
*  I'd like to know what actually evidence of that exists.
*  If it's true, that kind of sucks.
*  That's what it says there.
*  Yeah.
*  Tucker said that he was communicating through Signal and that the government contacted him
*  and said, we know that you're setting up a meeting with Putin because we read your Signal.
*  He was like, I didn't know you could even do that.
*  Well, this connects directly back to the FISA Section 702 law because if they are surveilling
*  certain foreign entities in Russia, then an American citizen like Tucker Carlson communicating
*  with them, the government is then able to just immediately go in again without a warrant
*  and saying, okay, we got to go before a judge.
*  And even if they do go before a judge, it is a secret court.
*  There is only one side that's presented, which is the government saying, we need to go and
*  capture all of Tucker's data.
*  For example, I have no idea if this actually happened, but let's say that's the scenario.
*  That court, and this is public information, that court approves 99.999999% of all requests
*  that the government makes to go in and surveil American citizens.
*  It's essentially a rubber stamp, which is exactly the problem.
*  But that's where I could foresee, okay, well, Tucker's communicating on Signal.
*  This surveillance law that just was strengthened recently when Congress passed it and Biden
*  signed it into law allows that to happen.
*  So it's all bullshit then.
*  So Signal, unplug phone, all that stuff.
*  If that's the case, if they have the ability to read Signal, don't you think they have
*  the ability to read every single piece of information that gets sent from your phone,
*  they can intercept it and read it?
*  It just makes sense.
*  I believe it.
*  I don't know how you're going to protect that.
*  Maybe I'm ignorant, but I don't understand how you could protect that with a different
*  operating system as long as it's using the same cell phone signals.
*  I understand that you're saying it's encrypted, but is that encryption impossible to crack?
*  Is there a source of that encryption?
*  Couldn't someone just get the phone and figure it out and back engineer it?
*  Seems like they could.
*  An interesting thing about, I asked the same question about this unplugged phone.
*  And if you're using, which I hadn't heard before about any other app, but if you're
*  using their version of Signal, their texting app that you can do calls in FaceTime and
*  whatever through with another app on another unplugged phone, every time you connect a
*  call or you send a text message, it generates a new encryption key versus Signal, which
*  is when you download it and you set up your account or whatever, that is your key.
*  So would you have to have an unplugged phone for me to talk to you in that encrypted app?
*  That's what I, yes, I believe so.
*  So you'd have to have it and I would have to have it.
*  I believe so because I don't know that their app is available on Apple, for example.
*  Right.
*  See, that would be interesting if someone develops something that did that, that developed
*  a new certificate.
*  The generation of a new encrypted key every time you're using it and starting a conversation,
*  that's...
*  It all seems like a futile race.
*  It just seems like the boundaries between people and privacy, Signal facing collapse
*  after CIA cuts funding.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  So this is an investigative journalist on a website.
*  I then looked up his account.
*  His account is suspended on Twitter or X.
*  I don't know why, but this is an article that says some interesting things.
*  I don't know how much of this is fact.
*  That's almost why I hesitated to bring it up.
*  But does say...
*  A friend of mine, so hold on a second, never acknowledged in a serious way by the mainstream
*  media, signals origins as US government asset or a matter of extensive public record, even
*  if the scope and the scale of the funding provided has until now been secret.
*  The app brainchild of shadowy tech guru Moxie Marlin Spike, by the way.
*  That's quite...
*  He came on the podcast.
*  He's not shadowy.
*  Did he really?
*  Not shadowy at all.
*  Interesting.
*  No, like regular guy.
*  Yeah.
*  Some of this is probably horseshit.
*  Real name Matthew Rosenfeld.
*  How dare you, Moxie?
*  You have a fake name?
*  Was launched in 2013 by his now defunct Open Whisper Systems.
*  The company never published financial statements or disclosed the identities of its funders
*  at any point during its operation.
*  Some's involved in developing, launching and running a message app used by countless people.
*  The company's global will nonetheless surely significant.
*  The newly published financial records indicate signals operating costs for 2023 alone are
*  40 million and projected to rise to 50 million by 2025.
*  Rosenfeld boasted in 2018 that OWS never took VC venture capital funding or sought investment
*  at any point, though mysteriously failed to mention millions were provided by the Open
*  Technology Fund.
*  That might have been three million that we found earlier.
*  Yeah, that's the money.
*  Oh, here we go.
*  Open Technology Fund was launched in 2012 as a pilot program of Radio Free Asia, an
*  asset of the US Agency for Global Media, which is funded by US Congress to the tune of over
*  one billion annually.
*  In 2018, the then CEO openly acknowledged the agency's global priorities reflect US
*  national security and public diplomacy interests.
*  That sounds sus.
*  Is that super sus?
*  That is super sus.
*  I just like you saying super sus.
*  Yeah, that's a little iffy.
*  It's very, if it's true, if it's not true, it's a disinformation campaign designed to
*  cripple signal and to lose people's trusted signal.
*  Yeah, perhaps.
*  That last thing there, though, is a separate issue of concern of the United States government
*  funding US propaganda, essentially, in different parts of the world.
*  I would like to talk to real nerds about this phone, this unplugged phone.
*  The real nerds.
*  I would like to have the real nerds look at this and go, yes or no?
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  I'm curious as well.
*  Yeah.
*  Is there reviews of the unplugged phone by any of them super smart people?
*  It still says it's on pre-order.
*  Oh, but they have them.
*  Brian Callan has one.
*  Tulsi, you have one.
*  Yeah.
*  It says buy now, but I don't.
*  Let's see what happens if I say buy now.
*  They can buy it.
*  Oh, so it's not pre-order.
*  It used to be pre-order, like till recently?
*  I'll just show you what I saw.
*  Right.
*  It says the positive 499.
*  Just go to the actual.
*  I did.
*  And that's where I started to look at stuff.
*  Oh, so maybe it used to be.
*  Maybe that was the link at one point in time.
*  It said pre-order.
*  Okay.
*  It would be interesting if people use this.
*  But it's like, I mean, I need someone to tell.
*  Is it $1,900?
*  That's because I have two in the cart.
*  What are you buying phones, you psycho?
*  I was trying to see what I was going to ship.
*  If it says shipping in three months, that means it's not available.
*  What if it says shipping in three months?
*  I don't know.
*  It is very interesting because there are other phones that I've seen in the past who have
*  tried this and not succeeded.
*  And I don't know whether it was a virtue of the time in our country where people maybe
*  just weren't that interested in having a secure means of communication or a secure phone.
*  People don't want the inconvenience.
*  Most people don't have to think about this.
*  So they're not thinking about the government looking at everything they do.
*  What are they doing?
*  Just trying to get laid and trying to have fun.
*  They're just trying to do normal stuff.
*  They don't care.
*  But if 86% or whatever the number was of kids use iPhones, they are locked into that ecosystem.
*  You're locked in with your photographs.
*  You're locked in with everything.
*  Yeah, you've got Apple Pay and you've got the whole thing.
*  All you need is your phone.
*  I use my phone as a remote control to control Apple TV.
*  It's crazy.
*  It's actually better than the real remote control because you can type on the keyboard.
*  Instead of doing that stupid thing where you have to go...
*  Oh, gosh.
*  Yeah.
*  Letter by letter scrolling.
*  It's so dumb.
*  You try to find a movie.
*  It takes five minutes to type it out.
*  You just type it on your phone.
*  Interesting.
*  Yeah.
*  The Apple remote control thing is fucking great.
*  It's better.
*  The problem is when you have these walled gardens like Apple's ecosystem, it's very
*  difficult when you have everything over there.
*  All your stuff.
*  Your email, your this or that.
*  Exactly.
*  To jump off of that.
*  It's hard.
*  Most people don't ever do it.
*  They just go, too much work.
*  Whatever you're on, whether you're on Android or you're on Apple.
*  But they try to make it easy.
*  They try to lure you over.
*  They try to get you to switch.
*  Nobody wants to do it.
*  I think that's where it is interesting to me that more and more people are paying attention
*  to government surveillance, their ability to reach into our private information, and
*  who is allowing that to happen.
*  I think they count on the majority of us not being aware.
*  I think that is the case today.
*  The majority of people are not aware and they don't think of it as a primary concern.
*  The majority of people are way more concerned about climate change.
*  Do you think it's a majority of people?
*  I think it's a lot of people.
*  They'll say it at least.
*  How much they know about it is weird.
*  I've had conversations with people where they talk about, hey, they all agree, we've got
*  to act now about the climate.
*  And I go, what did you hear?
*  Tell me what you hear.
*  Let them just spill it all out.
*  Don't even challenge them.
*  Just let them spill it all out.
*  And it's like AOC talking about Palestine and Israel.
*  I'm not really...
*  Like a centimeter deep.
*  Not exactly.
*  I'm not sure something bad is happening.
*  They don't know what they're talking about.
*  If you say, have you ever looked at a video of the difference in the shoreline from like
*  1987 to today?
*  Have you ever done that?
*  Have I done it?
*  Yeah.
*  I've seen for Hawaii.
*  Yeah.
*  What's the difference?
*  It's bigger.
*  It is.
*  Hawaii keeps getting bigger.
*  Because Hawaii grows because it's a volcano.
*  When you look at the shoreline in a lot of places, it kind of seems the same.
*  And also these fucking psycho rich people are buying houses on the beach.
*  Do they know something we don't know?
*  Don't you think if they really thought that the oceans were going to rise 100 feet in
*  the next week, that the fucking insurance companies would go, hey, you can't buy that.
*  Or even the next five years.
*  I mean, you know.
*  Well, people are having a hard time getting homeowners insurance in California because
*  of the wildfires.
*  Yeah, that's true.
*  That's a real one.
*  That's a very big issue.
*  That's a real one.
*  Yeah, that's a real one.
*  And, you know, but they're not having a hard time with the right next to the water.
*  Yeah.
*  Like no one's getting it.
*  It's not like tsunami insurance.
*  Yeah, it's you know, I mean, like they even have that tsunami insurance.
*  I don't know.
*  I want to say yes.
*  I bet that's like carved out.
*  I want to say yes.
*  I want to say no.
*  I think if you're a dumbass that buys a 50 million dollar house in Malibu, like right
*  on the I want to be on the water.
*  Hey, bitch.
*  How much water is out there?
*  Well, we had, you know, the active volcano that we've had on the Big Island for so long.
*  But the actual flow that happened through neighborhoods when the floor of the volcanic
*  shelf within the crater fell through, the lava went down and started flowing through
*  all these lava tubes that were running beneath full, fully occupied neighborhoods.
*  People had bought land and built houses in those neighborhoods, knowing it was a I think
*  it was a lava three zone, which is like you're building on top of an active volcanoes, lava
*  tubes.
*  You have to know that you're assuming that risk.
*  Well that when that happened, there were, you know, lava spouts and little mini craters
*  that were formed within so many of these different communities.
*  We were going around there.
*  I was with the head of the roads division for Hawaii County and we would go and look
*  and like as soon as there was a crack in the in the pavement, be like, OK, we got to mark
*  that one down on the map because that is, you know, the next day you see the steam coming
*  up as though it's a lava vent.
*  And then within the next day or two, you would have an active like 20, 30, 40 feet near lava
*  spilling up right in the middle of like a normal kind of suburbia ish neighborhood.
*  And this happened in 20, 30 feet and happened in over 20 different locations within this
*  particular area.
*  And it was mind blowing to go there one day after the other after the other and see how
*  quickly a beautiful little neighborhood turned into a complete bed of lava.
*  So this then begs the question like, oh, is your home insured?
*  There was one insurance company in the in the entire world that would insure homes that
*  were built in a lava three zone.
*  Did they go under?
*  Well, I don't think they went under because it's so freaking expensive.
*  Most people just didn't have it.
*  Most people couldn't afford it.
*  It's a gamble, right?
*  It is a gamble.
*  And it was amazing to see how so many residents there recognized like, OK, yeah, we knew we
*  were getting this land.
*  It was pretty cheap.
*  And they built a beautiful house knowing that this possibility could occur and frankly,
*  just it was amazing to see their respect for Mother Nature and knowing like we chose to
*  live here.
*  We're all the madam Pele is doing her thing and we're going to have to figure out something
*  else.
*  So what is going on right now in Maui?
*  Can I take a quick, quick bathroom break?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Important one.
*  We're back.
*  So we were just about to talk about Maui.
*  So what what is going on right now post fires?
*  No one is rebuilding homes yet.
*  Their remediation effort is still underway.
*  And the biggest challenge for the families who are directly impacted by that, who were
*  left homeless, is the fact that they they still don't have anywhere to go.
*  They've been put up in Airbnbs or in hotel rooms for a period of time.
*  On Maui, the hotels are like, hey, we we need to be able to start welcoming in tourists
*  back into to the island.
*  And so the governor is trying to work out a plan to be able to provide some form of semi
*  permanent housing for people if they were to try to go out and rent a house on the market.
*  It is it is purely unaffordable.
*  And there are a number of families who are now faced with the tough decision of do we
*  just pick up and go and move our life out of Hawaii and to the mainland, which is heartbreaking,
*  given how many of those families.
*  I mean, they've been in that community in West Maui or in Lahaina for generations.
*  What is happening with the people that had mortgages?
*  So if they had a mortgage and their home was burnt down and they haven't gotten money from
*  the insurance company and they haven't been able to rebuild, do they still have to pay
*  that mortgage while this is all going on?
*  You know, I haven't heard that raised as an issue.
*  I would hope that the mortgage company would recognize what's going on.
*  But that's that's something that's a good question.
*  I haven't heard it raised as an issue from either residents or as part of the conversation
*  around housing for them.
*  Why has no one been able to rebuild?
*  There has to be there.
*  There are so many layers of toxins in the ground that have to be cleaned up and removed.
*  Before people can go in and actually start start to rebuild.
*  But to speak of just the inspection and the permitting process and so forth.
*  So the layers of toxins just from the fire from the fire.
*  And, you know, you had like a gas station with underground fuel tanks that burned like
*  completely to ash on the ground, the toxins that came from all, you know, different
*  construction and and everything else that exists in the environment.
*  So all that stuff burns.
*  It gets in the soil.
*  It gets rained on.
*  So the ground is contaminated.
*  Right.
*  And this is the reason why they can't rebuild.
*  Yeah. And they knew from the outset, it was it was a known fact that it would take.
*  I mean, if it only takes a year.
*  That that is an expedited timeline is what I've been told.
*  How long has it been now?
*  August will be one year, August 8th.
*  The most insulting thing was the seven hundred dollar one time payment from the government.
*  Yeah. That is who said yes to that.
*  Who allowed that?
*  And at the same time, releasing this number where they accidentally had sent Ukraine six
*  billion dollars. Remember that?
*  Yeah. They said, oh, well, we we lost track of this six billion dollars.
*  And so now that we've found it because of some accounting error, now we can go and send
*  it to Ukraine. And they were automatically assuming they were going to send it to Ukraine.
*  And they were going to send that anyway.
*  Of course. Of course.
*  But no consideration at all.
*  No, you know, I remember specifically when the fires had just happened, the White House
*  brought in the director of FEMA to talk to the White House press corps and someone asked
*  the question, what are you, FEMA, what are you actually doing for the people who've been
*  impacted by this tragedy?
*  And the director stood there with a straight face and proudly said, well, we have provided
*  a one time payment of seven hundred dollars to to everyone who has been impacted by this
*  fire or displaced by this fire.
*  And that was her big announcement that she was there to make one single one time payment
*  of seven hundred dollars.
*  So that means you have seven hundred servings of ramen.
*  Basically, basically.
*  I mean, you you can't you can't even rent a bedroom in someone's house for seven hundred
*  dollars. It's just it's.
*  It's certainly you can't for eight months.
*  No, that's what's crazy.
*  No, seven hundred dollars is so crazy.
*  It's just such an insulting and ridiculous number.
*  And the fact that they haven't given more.
*  It's like, but yet they're flying people around on airplanes that come in illegally
*  through the border. Yeah.
*  Just like how much that cost.
*  Yeah, exactly. What does that program cost?
*  Exactly. What does that cost?
*  Multi billions of dollars if I had to if I had to guess.
*  It's.
*  You know, FEMA has other services, it's a lot of bureaucracy, it's a lot of paperwork
*  and residents on Maui, they were being told like, OK, well, hey, if you accept this kind
*  of aid from FEMA, you are ceding some sense of your sovereignty or decision making ability
*  with regard to your land or your property and all of these all of the red tape essentially
*  that that caused a people, a community who were rightfully skeptical about government
*  coming in and saying, OK, well, we're going to help you when that same government said,
*  oh, yeah, hey, we may at that time.
*  And the governor, the governor said this and then he corrected himself later on.
*  But he's like, oh, yeah, we're thinking about and talking about how we can turn this entire
*  place, have the government take ownership of it and turn it into some kind of memorial
*  or some kind of workforce housing, which obviously made people really freaking mad to say, like,
*  well, who the hell are you to come in here and say, you're just you're just going to
*  take our land. You're going to take it and do what you want with it.
*  So they're obviously very skeptical and rightfully so about, you know, the fine print.
*  What does it mean if I accept a few bucks here or there from the federal government?
*  What what power am I ceding to you to determine my future, the future of my family in our
*  home? And unfortunately, the rest of the country
*  has forgotten about it by and large.
*  Yeah. Yeah. There's always a new thing in the news.
*  There's always a new thing to pay attention to.
*  So it's a new fear.
*  One of the things that that has just recently come out, first of all, the Maui Police
*  Department, they did an audit of what went wrong.
*  What did we do wrong? What should we have done better?
*  And kudos to them for actually doing this.
*  And I think they came up with like 92 recommendations on things that needed to be
*  fixed. They shared that with municipalities all across the country as like, hey, here
*  are the hard lessons that we learned. You guys should take note and try to protect
*  yourselves from having to go through what we went through.
*  Other agencies at the county level and at the state level have not been so honest or
*  transparent about their shortcomings.
*  And the most egregious one recently.
*  That our local news in Hawaii exposed was the head of Maui's Emergency Response
*  Division. He was off island that day.
*  He was at a of all places, a FEMA conference on Oahu when the fires happened.
*  And instead of doing what any.
*  Compassionate and responsible person and leader would do, you'd immediately get on
*  the first plane out. You get a notification there.
*  This, you know, this fire is happening on Maui.
*  I got to be there with my people and I got to lead my teams to respond to this emergency.
*  He it took him a few days to go back to Maui, first of all.
*  But the thing that was and I don't know if you can find this, Jamie, but they released
*  his text exchanges that he had with his assistant who was telling him he's like, what's
*  going on with the fire?
*  L.O.L. and the assistant responding saying, ha ha ha, this place is like a circus.
*  Their their exchange was so so.
*  Disturbing doesn't even put it lightly when you know there are people who are being
*  burned to ash, burned alive in their community and their text exchanges like, oh,
*  ha ha ha. Is the fire still going?
*  L.O.L. Yup. Now it's going in another place.
*  I couldn't I couldn't believe it when I read it.
*  And this was the same guy. Herman Andaya is his name.
*  He he didn't show up and show his face publicly until like seven days after the fire.
*  And then he went and he did one press conference and then he quit and resigned.
*  But there has not yet and I hope investigations are ongoing.
*  There has not been any kind of accountability at the various failure points that that
*  existed in this response.
*  If the government wanted to take over that land, the best way to do it is to drag this
*  out and make it so that people exactly have no other choice.
*  Nothing to do. They can't do anything.
*  And they just tell stories about it.
*  You know, I used to we used to own that land.
*  Right. There's a native Hawaiian leader, famous surfer navigator for the Hokulea and
*  traditional Hawaiian navigation Archie Coleppa.
*  He has been one of the most stalwart leaders for the community during this whole period
*  in time, organizing emergency response and food and shelter and, you know, community
*  gatherings. People come and play music at the end of the day throughout this whole
*  crisis period and has been leading the charge.
*  He's very well respected in the community in holding that line and saying we are not
*  giving up our land.
*  But as you said, it becomes a much more difficult argument to make when people you got to
*  live. You got to be able to make sure your kids have what they need to go back to school
*  and all of it.
*  And how can you do that when you're in a constant state of of transition with no real
*  timeline where they're they're not coming and saying, OK, hey, you can go and start
*  rebuilding on this date.
*  Right. So they're going to have to do so.
*  The cost. I mean, like building a house from scratch.
*  Right. Crazy. Most people don't have that money.
*  And then also like how long is this cleanup going to take?
*  And like, when does it start?
*  And what do they have to do?
*  It is ongoing. It is ongoing, but it is massive excavation.
*  And so it's ongoing.
*  It is ongoing. They have an anticipated timeline.
*  I heard from one guy they were looking at, well, hopefully maybe it might be September,
*  it might be October.
*  But, you know, it's one of those things that one of the guys who's out there actually doing
*  this is just saying, well, you don't know what you're going to deal with until you're
*  actually dealing with it.
*  And it might take longer.
*  It might not take as long.
*  But it's one of those things that they're they're not figuring out as they go, but they
*  are being confronted with things as they go.
*  Is this one of those issues where you wish that maybe you still were in Congress?
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Because at least you could be talking about it.
*  That was that was my hope.
*  And I talked with leaders in Congress and people who I still know there and just calling
*  for oversight and accountability from the federal government, because we saw many points
*  of failure, everything from the immediate response to the whole water issue and the
*  fact that there wasn't any water coming through people's hoses during that time.
*  Well, now, why was that?
*  The history of water on Maui is complicated and it's largely attributed to that, of the
*  fact that the water is a privately owned utility and how that water is controlled.
*  There is limited use of water at different times, how it's controlled and where it goes.
*  And there was a state water management official, apparently, who had some say in this of
*  saying, well, you know, I don't think that we should turn the water on for this period of
*  time because we don't know exactly what's going to happen.
*  But my point is all of these things need to be very clearly investigated because people's
*  lives and property were absolutely destroyed because of this.
*  So was it because that water is a valuable commodity?
*  They didn't allow it to be used by the people that were experiencing the fire?
*  There was some implication of.
*  I don't know. It was like, well, we want to make sure that the water is being distributed
*  equitably. And so we don't want to give it to one group of people over another group of
*  people. It really didn't make any sense what the argument was.
*  But it was like, hey, you missed that critical juncture in that window because you were
*  trying to ruminate. It was something to do with equity and and some theoretical argument
*  rather than this is a community in crisis.
*  There are fires burning in various different places.
*  We need to get water to people who need it.
*  There's also the thing about having above ground wires.
*  Yes. Right. Which is crazy.
*  It is. A place that experiences storms.
*  In a place that experiences storms, but also on West Maui is traditionally a drier part of
*  the island that also experiences wildfires, even small ones on a regular basis that if
*  they're not immediately controlled, you end up with what happened.
*  This is so disheartening that it's not receiving more attention.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  This is this is, you know, you look at the things that we've talked about.
*  What what what are they actually focusing on?
*  Yeah. And that's that that's where the opportunity and it is such a dire picture.
*  You know, it's it's a time where we are surrounded by literally insane people who are
*  making decisions that that further their own interests and their desire to either hold
*  on to power or grow their power at the cost of the well-being of the people and at the
*  cost of our fundamental freedoms.
*  And that's where, you know, this election, our using our voice, our defending our freedom
*  of speech by by speaking the truth and speaking freely, all of these things and our
*  engagement with them as Americans, as citizens.
*  It matters more than anything else, because if we if we continue to to go down this track, we will
*  continue to see our freedoms undermined until we wake up one day.
*  And this will no longer be the America that we know and that we love.
*  That's a scary thought.
*  And it is until the last few years.
*  I never would have thought that was the case.
*  Same.
*  I would be like, now we're going to be OK.
*  Yeah.
*  Now I'm not so sure.
*  Yeah, because I mean, we've gone through, you know, the political power switch from one side to
*  the other and back again.
*  And and, you know, you figure like, OK, well, I disagree with this person or this issue or
*  whatever. But being grounded in and having the confidence in the Constitution and these
*  fundamental rights and freedoms is kind of like, OK, well, you know, we'll figure out the rest.
*  But but all of that for everything that we've talked about, censorship and control and big
*  government overreach and and all of the government surveillance, all of these different things
*  point to the very real risk and domestic threat that we face.
*  Yeah, there's just so many factors that are simultaneously taking place.
*  There's there's surveillance.
*  There's the invasion, which is kind of an invasion.
*  I mean, you'd call the open borders, you can call whatever you want.
*  It's people come in here that aren't supposed to be here.
*  And I'm for immigration just for them figuring out who's criminal.
*  Well, legal. And this is the thing.
*  I've got a friend of mine who's about to retire.
*  Special Forces Green Berets served over 30 years in uniform.
*  Great, great American who's dedicated his life to service.
*  He's about to retire.
*  His wife is from a European country and they want to invite her sister and her sister's
*  family to come to the retirement ceremony.
*  They're residents of Italy.
*  They have been denied a tourist visa to come to America for two weeks to attend the
*  Special Forces warrant officers retirement.
*  How is that? And this is these are like, hey, they got a family, they got young kids, they
*  got school, they got jobs and they were denied saying, well, we don't we don't think that
*  you have we don't have confidence that you will come back to your life in Italy.
*  Hilarious. And yet again, people are coming through the border every day, being picked
*  up. Border Patrol has become like this Uber drivers for people who are breaking our laws
*  from the moment they step across the border into our country illegally.
*  And. OK, so then they go out in the country, nobody knows where they are, who they are.
*  Are they really going to show up for a court date in two years or three years?
*  And nothing is really truly done about this.
*  Yeah, seven years, seven years between that court date.
*  OK, it's a year.
*  Yeah, exactly. Exactly.
*  It almost seems like it's all designed to erode our faith and to make this whole thing
*  something that's way easier to control because the way our system is set up right now with
*  if you can express the freedom of speech, if you actually can do that, it makes it very
*  difficult to really to control a narrative.
*  That's it right there. That's it right there.
*  Control and power.
*  And they're terrified of a truly free society where we can have a truly free open
*  marketplace of ideas.
*  They're terrified of people being able to, you know, and I saw this when I ran for
*  president in 2020. We're seeing it again in different ways in 2024, where they want to
*  control what information you get about certain candidates, what information you're not
*  allowed to see, who is being pushed forward and who is not and undermining our our basic
*  responsibility as citizens, which is to cast an informed vote and engage in our democracy
*  and actually have a government of by and for the people.
*  They're terrified of us doing that and making what they believe is the wrong choice.
*  So they're trying to take away our right to do it so they can remain in power.
*  And in their minds, I fully I know many of these people and they feel justified in what
*  they're doing, that they are the righteous ones, that they are standing up for America
*  and standing up for democracy, so much so that they are willing to destroy our democracy
*  to save it in their minds, which is a dangerous, dangerous mindset that we could see in
*  foreign dictators in different parts of the world and throughout history.
*  It really is. And it's astonishing how few people are willing to accept that it still
*  takes place today. Right.
*  They almost have this thought that those things have been sorted out and that, you know,
*  that was the case in the past.
*  But even though history is filled with it and there's actually no instances of it not
*  taking place. But now, don't be silly.
*  Right. Now we've got it.
*  I've got to leave hands.
*  I had Jan Werner on here from Rolling Stone.
*  Jan Werner. Yeah. He was trying to tell me that the government should regulate the
*  Internet. My government.
*  The same people that lied about weapons of mass destruction.
*  Those people. No, no, not those ones.
*  Everybody wants daddy.
*  They want daddy to come along.
*  No one is going to save you.
*  No, exactly.
*  Save you. People in Maui know that.
*  They know that now. Yes.
*  No one's going to save you.
*  Yes. And we have to be aware of how fucking crooked this system is.
*  Yes. And I don't know how we're going to get out of it.
*  I don't. I don't. But I'm very happy that people like you are at least you have the
*  courage to talk about it.
*  And so few people do.
*  And it's it's a strange, strange time to be alive.
*  It's wonderful in a lot of ways.
*  It's amazing in a lot of ways, but it's also it's like treacherous.
*  There's a lot going on right now.
*  That's like it really makes you wonder.
*  There's so much fucking subterfuge and shenanigans and so much money being funneled around and moved around.
*  It's just like, whoo.
*  I think that's where there is, you know, there is a silver lining in what we have been through with through covid and through everything that's happened since is I think more and more people are waking up.
*  And at a minimum, just questioning what they're being told.
*  Is this actually true?
*  Looking for information and news from other sources than maybe they had been before.
*  Yeah. And and just what you said, no, no one's coming to save us.
*  I think that that is the message I'm carrying.
*  I'm on the road constantly and I'm talking to people, whoever will listen at events and on different media platforms.
*  It's what I focused on in my book for love of country.
*  The truth about what is happening in our country, the experiences that I had in the Democratic Party that caused me to leave the party and understanding that in this situation, and there's a lot to be fixed across both parties and the government.
*  But in my experience and in the situation we are in right now with the Biden Harris administration, they cannot be allowed to remain in power.
*  We can agree or disagree on different issues and it's good and we should and we should have those conversations.
*  But when you look at the unprecedented abuse of power that they are engaging in, undermining the rule of law, politicizing our government entities, targeting Americans, targeting Americans who happen to be their political opposition, whether it's Donald Trump or the mom who's protesting at a board of education meeting to have a say in what kind of education her child is getting.
*  This is happening across the country.
*  And if we, the American people, don't do something about this and stop them and hold them accountable, what happens in these elections, if they're allowed to remain in power, they will tell us, hey, you gave us a mandate.
*  You said, hey, good job.
*  Thumbs up. Keep at it.
*  And we'll see everything that's happened just continue to escalate to a point where I have I have no doubt that our freedoms will be eroded to a point where it will be virtually impossible to get them back.
*  And where do we go from there?
*  America no longer becomes the land of the free and the home of the brave.
*  It becomes the land of people who are controlled by the government and forced to comply or else.
*  And if you dare to have the courage to speak up and speak the truth or say, hey, look, guys, the emperor has no clothes on.
*  Boys are boys and girls are girls.
*  And that's just how it is.
*  Then you will experience the retaliation or the consequences of that action.
*  Well said.
*  Thank you, Tulsi.
*  Show your book for love of country.
*  Country out now.
*  Did you do the audio?
*  It is. I did.
*  I recorded the audio.
*  Excellent.
*  There's a little there's a little line on the top of the cover there.
*  You might recognize.
*  Oh, it's me.
*  I appreciate your words, your friendship, your support and your being such an incredible stalwart voice of truth and and providing a platform for real discussion.
*  Where people can come and listen to those who have different viewpoints, different backgrounds, different experiences, and maybe they walk away agreeing or disagreeing.
*  It doesn't really even matter.
*  But having this kind of platform is such a powerful thing for everyone to do.
*  Crazy things that happen by accident.
*  So I went and I was invited to speak at this Passover event a couple of days ago.
*  But the guy who picked me up at the airport, his name is Avi, works in New York.
*  Their family hosted me.
*  And he's like, Oh, where are you going next?
*  I said, Oh, I'm going to go.
*  I'm going to go to Austin.
*  I'm going to see Joe Rogan.
*  He's like, I am like, he's like, I'm kind of pissed off about how popular he's gotten because I was one of the OGs from the very beginning.
*  He's like, I know that I know the roots of the Joe Rogan experience.
*  Anyway, it was just it was you got a lot of fans, but he was particularly owning the fact that he knew he knew Joe Rogan before Joe Rogan was, you know, the Joe Rogan experience.
*  Isn't it funny that people get upset when things get popular and other people find out?
*  Exactly.
*  But people do that with bands all the time.
*  Yeah, because it's like your thing.
*  Yeah, they went mainstream.
*  Now everybody likes them.
*  It's like everybody likes the thing I like.
*  Sucks.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the beauty, though, of what you've done is like you've been you the whole time and there's there's no like, oh, Joe Rogan's gone mainstream and he's different or whatever.
*  It's like you're you're you.
*  And I think that's what people are attracted to is just, you know, you are who you are.
*  I think that's what people are attracted to with you as well.
*  And I'm very happy you're out there and I'm very happy that you created this book.
*  I'm really happy that you did the audio of it.
*  Yeah, because I don't really.
*  It was, you know, I before I recorded it, I do a lot.
*  I do more audio books as well than I do every now and then.
*  But most of the time I'm actually like if I'm on a plane, sometimes I read.
*  But yeah, most of the time I'm sitting there listening to stuff in the sauna or listening to something when I'm driving.
*  For me, it's a use of time.
*  Exactly.
*  It's much more efficient.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  It was.
*  You know, I poured my heart into writing this book and I care very much about the issues that we're talking about.
*  And I care very much about our country.
*  And and so in some parts of the audio book, you know, it was it was emotional talking about some of the experiences that I've had.
*  And while I was deployed and and really, truly conveying what's at stake and and the responsibility.
*  And so I go through a lot of the problems.
*  It's important, obviously, to talk about the solutions and the call to action for every one of us as Americans.
*  I don't care what your party affiliation is.
*  That's not the point here.
*  I'm urging people to leave this Democrat Party behind because they are abusing their power and undermining our Constitution.
*  Just as our founding fathers did when they created these founding documents, they disagreed heavily on a lot of different things.
*  They had fierce arguments and debates, but they came together around the most fundamental principles of our country that are centered around freedom.
*  Our ability to live in peace and pursue prosperity, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
*  Now is the time that we have to come together as Americans around those foundational principles.
*  And get our country back on track.
*  That is that is the most important task before us as Americans.
*  Otherwise, it'll be too late.
*  Hear hear. Thank you, Tulsi.
*  Thank you, Joe. I appreciate you.
*  Great to see you.
*  All right.
*  Goodbye, everybody.
