# Joe Rogan Experience #2048 - Reggie Watts
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=0.0s)]
*  Train by day, Joe Rogan Podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3.0s)]
*  I'll take that. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7.0s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9.0s)]
*  I only drink a half one though. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=10.0s)]
*  You drink the whole one? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=11.0s)]
*  I drink the whole one, but I'm going to try half this time just to see. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=12.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=16.0s)]
*  Because you know it's weird, I have friends that are like, they will not, they're just [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=17.0s)]
*  like, I don't know what it is. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=21.0s)]
*  Well, they can't take it because most people do get nauseous on it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=23.0s)]
*  But I haven't, I've never, never had that experience. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=26.0s)]
*  It's really weird. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=29.0s)]
*  Like all throughout my life, like I've taken all kinds of things that people are like, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=30.0s)]
*  I throw up or like Robitussin or something like drinking a whole thing of Robitussin. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=34.0s)]
*  I throw up, I'm like, I don't know why, but I just, I don't have that reaction. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=37.0s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=40.0s)]
*  So I feel either lucky or I'm dumb. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=41.0s)]
*  Do you ever get seasick? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=43.0s)]
*  No. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=44.0s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=45.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=46.0s)]
*  Do you throw up when you get sick? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=47.0s)]
*  Do you ever throw up? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=48.0s)]
*  I try to avoid it at all times, but I don't get sick that often. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=49.0s)]
*  I don't get sick that often. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=52.0s)]
*  I try to avoid it at all times, but I don't get sick that often. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=53.0s)]
*  I get sick maybe once every four years or something. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=56.0s)]
*  Do you ever drink too much and then you throw up? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=58.0s)]
*  You're just down the whole thing, don't you? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=61.0s)]
*  No, I did like three quarters. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=63.0s)]
*  No, I did have. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=65.0s)]
*  I don't know why this is two portions. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=66.0s)]
*  I, I, I. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=68.0s)]
*  That's silly. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=70.0s)]
*  Cause how do you, you can't even see through the glass. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=71.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=73.0s)]
*  How do I know where the half is? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=74.0s)]
*  I always have my flashlight. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=75.0s)]
*  I'm just like, oh, let me check. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=76.0s)]
*  Yeah, that seems kind of silly. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=77.0s)]
*  I just, yeah, I'm trying half. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=78.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh man, cause I gotta do that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=80.0s)]
*  Cause I'm just like, so like, just do it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=82.0s)]
*  Just fucking do it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=84.0s)]
*  And every time I do it, I'm like, ah man, it feels really good. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=85.0s)]
*  But like, I keep, I feel like I missed my opportunity to try half. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=89.0s)]
*  So this is my opportunity. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=92.0s)]
*  Kratom is a weird one. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=93.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=94.0s)]
*  Cause it's kind of an opiate, right? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=95.0s)]
*  It uses the, as far as I understand, it uses the opioid receptor, but it's not technically an opiate. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=97.0s)]
*  There was a friend of mine was telling me that he takes Kratom before he works out. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=104.0s)]
*  I go, how many do you take? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=109.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=110.0s)]
*  He goes, I take 10. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=111.0s)]
*  I go, really? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=112.0s)]
*  10 what? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=113.0s)]
*  10 pills. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=114.0s)]
*  Oh, of just pure Kratom. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=115.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=116.0s)]
*  And I don't know what the milligrams is. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=117.0s)]
*  I go, 10. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=118.0s)]
*  I was taking two. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=119.0s)]
*  So I tried 10 and I go, dude, you're getting high as fuck. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=120.0s)]
*  I was, I was so high on 10. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=125.0s)]
*  I was like, oh my God, this is a drug, but it's a weird drug where it doesn't affect your motor skills. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=128.0s)]
*  No, not really. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=133.0s)]
*  I was high, but my coordination, I was like, nothing feels off. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=135.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=140.0s)]
*  You know, like when you're drunk, it's like, I can do this, but everything's in slow motion. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=141.0s)]
*  No you can't. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=145.0s)]
*  No you can't. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=146.0s)]
*  But Kratom was like high in some weird way, but it was definitely intoxicated. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=147.0s)]
*  It's an interesting one, especially when you feel free, you've got Kava and Kratom, which does that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=154.0s)]
*  Like here's a mellowing anti-anxiety vibe and then here's like a euphoric energy thing in the center of it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=159.0s)]
*  And so it gives you that like, that's why people feel so groovy on it because it's got those two. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=165.0s)]
*  However, I do understand if people get sick on it, like they, they, I think some people just, it's too much for their brain or they just need to do like a third of a bottle or something. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=171.0s)]
*  We can't even keep them at the club because Duncan just chugs them. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=179.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=182.0s)]
*  Oh my God, he's an animal. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=183.0s)]
*  The trusty? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=184.0s)]
*  Oh, he doesn't, he doesn't play with those Kratoms. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=185.0s)]
*  I can only. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=187.0s)]
*  I can only do, I reserve one, but one four times a week, like at night. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=188.0s)]
*  I use it at night because especially if I have a social engagement, if I have a lot of people to deal with, I take one of those. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=196.0s)]
*  I'm just like, oh really? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=201.0s)]
*  Oh, where did you grow up? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=202.0s)]
*  You grew up in France, that's interesting. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=203.0s)]
*  That pen, what does it mean? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=205.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, like I'm so hyper engaged. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=206.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=209.0s)]
*  Isn't that interesting that there's actual things that can make you a better conversationalist? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=210.0s)]
*  There's things that you can take where you'll be, you know, you'll be better talking to people. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=215.0s)]
*  You'll say different things than you would without those things. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=221.0s)]
*  I know, I know. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=224.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=225.0s)]
*  I think it has something to do with the, I think like certain things that remove the editing aspect and you're just more fluid. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=226.0s)]
*  Like I remember a friend of mine, she had like this, I don't know if you know people like this, but they analyze everything that they're thinking. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=232.0s)]
*  Like it's like a compulsion. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=239.0s)]
*  So like my friend, she's an amazing musician, but every time she would speak, she'd be like, well, I'd like to, I'm not sure if I should, but I would like to. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=241.0s)]
*  But a lot of this like looped kind of thing and self-analyze, but like the analysis loop is so small that I'm like, you know, I wish I could help. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=249.0s)]
*  But then one night I can, she was nervous about taking ketamine and I gave her just a little bit of ketamine. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=260.0s)]
*  And finally she was like, okay, I'll try it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=265.0s)]
*  I'll try it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=267.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=268.0s)]
*  Should I? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=269.0s)]
*  Maybe is it too much? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=270.0s)]
*  And then I was like, trust me, just do this amount. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=271.0s)]
*  I'm really good at dosing. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=272.0s)]
*  And she took it and I progressively saw her go from, I don't know what's going on. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=273.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=278.0s)]
*  So yeah. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=279.0s)]
*  And you know, I was just kind of wondering, my career is interesting, but I have a lot of fear based around it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=280.0s)]
*  She was just calm, relaxed and completely fluid. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=284.0s)]
*  And I let her go for a while. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=287.0s)]
*  And then I said, did you notice that you haven't stopped yourself once? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=288.0s)]
*  Like in the last two minutes, she was like, oh my God, you're right. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=293.0s)]
*  And I was like, yeah. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=296.0s)]
*  Like if you notice that when you're on it, it's possible you can carry that over into your functioning everyday life. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=297.0s)]
*  But it was a cool, it's cool to see that transformation. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=302.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=305.0s)]
*  I wonder if that's possible without the ketamine. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=306.0s)]
*  I think of course it is. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=308.0s)]
*  But the ketamine just puts you immediately in a spot where you're no longer emotionally connected to your observational self. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=310.0s)]
*  You're just in an observational state. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=318.0s)]
*  So it's, for me, I noticed that I'm very clear, even though I think of myself as a pretty good communicator. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=319.0s)]
*  Sometimes when I'm on ketamine, the thoughts are just flowing in a way that I'm actually watching them. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=325.0s)]
*  It's the same feeling when I'm improvising and it's going really well, like I'm with a bunch of cats and we're like jamming or whatever. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=330.0s)]
*  There'll be this weird thing where I'm suddenly I'm like, I'm just, it's almost like I'm standing next to myself going like, hey, that's pretty good. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=336.0s)]
*  Oh, wait. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=342.0s)]
*  And then I'm playing again. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=343.0s)]
*  And it kind of puts me in that kind of a state. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=345.0s)]
*  And I don't know, there's something about it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=347.0s)]
*  I'm really interested in ketamine, like doing more research with it too. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=349.0s)]
*  Like fMRI is like, you know, real time fMRI and mapping regions of the brain when you're improvising and things like that. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=353.0s)]
*  There's been a little bit of that, but I want to do it myself just to see. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=358.0s)]
*  Wasn't it originally devised as an animal tranquilizer? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=361.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was an anesthetic as far as I know. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=364.0s)]
*  I think cats or something. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=366.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was like, well, horses, like large, large mammals that can do a lot of damage. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=368.0s)]
*  I think it was used for them to just come as an anti-anxiety. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=373.0s)]
*  And then it's an anesthetic. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=377.0s)]
*  So I know a friend of mine, he was a friend of a friend. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=379.0s)]
*  He was skateboarding shoulder went out of place, went to a hospital, the shot him with ketamine and then put his shoulder back in. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=381.0s)]
*  I think they use that in medic kits overseas. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=388.0s)]
*  Oh, that's probably right. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=392.0s)]
*  I think they do if they have to do like in the field surgery, something happens on the battlefield. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=394.0s)]
*  Well, I know in Vietnam, all the burn victims from like Nepal and stuff like that, they use a mixture of opiates and ketamine. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=400.0s)]
*  Because the dissociative takes you out of your body. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=408.0s)]
*  So you're not related to the pain in your body. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=410.0s)]
*  The opiates obviously suppress pain at the same time. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=413.0s)]
*  Pharmacology, Reggie Watts and Joe Rogan. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=417.0s)]
*  Everyone's like, we're not giving advice. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=421.0s)]
*  There's all these doctors going like, that's not true. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=423.0s)]
*  It was actually like everything you're saying is dangerous. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=425.0s)]
*  I'm trying. I'm trying. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=428.0s)]
*  Everything you're saying is misinformation. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=430.0s)]
*  It's all this information. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=433.0s)]
*  I mean, it's like it's like sometimes it's just what you understand at the time. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=434.0s)]
*  Oh, there it is. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=437.0s)]
*  Yeah, it goes. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=438.0s)]
*  Ketamine was found of many of the same anesthetic and analgesic properties as PCP. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=439.0s)]
*  I think it's very close to PCP, like molecularly, but consistently produced fewer adverse side effects. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=443.0s)]
*  Following this initial research, ketamine was characterized as a dissociative anesthetic. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=451.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=456.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=457.0s)]
*  And when I was growing up, we would drink Robitussin, which had dextromethorphan in it, which is also dissociative. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=458.0s)]
*  And so it's it's a kind of a weirder version of it. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=464.0s)]
*  But when I first took ketamine, I was like, why does this feel familiar? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=468.0s)]
*  It's Robitussin. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=472.0s)]
*  Oh, dextromethorphan. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=473.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=474.0s)]
*  Although dextromethorphan feels like a like a like a like an Instagram filter over the dissociative experience, whereas ketamine feels clean, a little bit cleaner. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=475.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=485.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=486.0s)]
*  I remember when Nyquil had codeine in it. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=487.0s)]
*  And one time I was sick. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=490.0s)]
*  This is back in the old days. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=491.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=492.0s)]
*  I took Nyquil and I was just I remember lying in bed feeling so wonderful. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=493.0s)]
*  You know, sick. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=497.0s)]
*  I was like, this is amazing. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=499.0s)]
*  I don't think I'd ever taken it before. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=501.0s)]
*  And I don't think this formula is the same. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=503.0s)]
*  I think I'm talking like the 90s. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=506.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=509.0s)]
*  Now, I remember being in a convertible in the 80s and a friend of mine sitting like, you know, on the deck where the you know, the top is down or whatever, sitting on the deck. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=510.0s)]
*  And he just had a bottle of codeine. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=519.0s)]
*  He was just like take sips of it. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=520.0s)]
*  And I was like, I wanted to try it. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=522.0s)]
*  But I was like, I don't know. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=524.0s)]
*  I just didn't. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=526.0s)]
*  But it was funny. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=527.0s)]
*  Was the car in motion? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=528.0s)]
*  It was motion. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=529.0s)]
*  We were cruising. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=530.0s)]
*  That's not a smart move. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=531.0s)]
*  No, I know it's not. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=532.0s)]
*  But it's the 80s. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=533.0s)]
*  It's a codeine move too. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=534.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=535.0s)]
*  It's totally codeine. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=536.0s)]
*  The 80s. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=537.0s)]
*  It's like 80s. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=538.0s)]
*  Everything. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=539.0s)]
*  I remember in the 80s being in a scout like going all taken all the back roads from Great Falls to Lake Five in Glacier Park on the way there with like a half rack of beer. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=540.0s)]
*  And just like, you know, drinking beers and cruising down the road and with like three friends and a bunch of bikes in the back. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=549.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=556.0s)]
*  The shit that we did back then was you just can't do it anymore. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=557.0s)]
*  I mean, you definitely can't if people are filming you with their phones. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=560.0s)]
*  No, that's true. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=563.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=564.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=565.0s)]
*  That was the missing link. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=566.0s)]
*  That's a big part of the world now. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=567.0s)]
*  So many things are being filmed. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=568.0s)]
*  There's good and bad of it, right? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=570.0s)]
*  The good thing is like citizen journalism. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=572.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=574.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=575.0s)]
*  You know, like we know more about the horrors of war, like the wars that are happening right now. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=576.0s)]
*  Do you remember like during it was I think it was Desert Storm or it was the next it was after whatever 2020 2001 after the 9-11 attacks, they weren't allowed to show bodies of troops coming home. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=581.0s)]
*  They weren't allowed to show coffins. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=599.0s)]
*  Remember, photographers were not allowed something like that. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=602.0s)]
*  Yeah, which is insane. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=605.0s)]
*  And then now here we are 22 years later and you just get graphic cell phone footage from Ukraine. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=606.0s)]
*  Now you're getting it from Palestine and Gaza. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=615.0s)]
*  It's just horrific graphic footage from phones. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=619.0s)]
*  I mean, even back in the days, like remember when ISIS was on the rampage, you would still you could still see videos on YouTube, like before they took them down. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=623.0s)]
*  Like people were exposed to some pretty yeah, like I saw one of those and I was like, I should have never seen that. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=633.0s)]
*  I should have never seen that. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=639.0s)]
*  I can't I can't get out of my head. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=640.0s)]
*  No, I've seen quite a few of them. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=642.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, it's just like, you know, I mean, it's like, I mean, on one hand, it's like the barbarism is is is a good thing to see where you're like that. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=643.0s)]
*  I never want to put myself in this situation or I want to do everything I can to try to make our society not do that kind of shit. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=652.0s)]
*  But at the same time, it can desensitize and some people can kind of fetishize on it as well. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=659.0s)]
*  So it's I don't know. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=665.0s)]
*  It's a it's a twofer. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=666.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=667.0s)]
*  That is a thing with people. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=668.0s)]
*  They do fantasize about things that they see and they wanted. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=669.0s)]
*  I mean, you've heard that about serial killers. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=673.0s)]
*  They study serial killer documentaries and shit before they actually go out and do it. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=675.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=679.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=680.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=681.0s)]
*  But, you know, humanity. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=682.0s)]
*  We're so weird. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=683.0s)]
*  I know we're weird. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=684.0s)]
*  We're so weird. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=685.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=686.0s)]
*  You know, this idea of eradicating all war. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=687.0s)]
*  I mean, I remember when I was a little boy, I was living in San Francisco during the height of the Vietnam War and the Vietnam War ended. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=689.0s)]
*  And I remember as a boy thinking, oh, this is great. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=697.0s)]
*  Now there's not going to be any more wars. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=701.0s)]
*  They figured it out. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=703.0s)]
*  The war is bad. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=704.0s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=705.0s)]
*  Yeah, they didn't. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=706.0s)]
*  They did. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=708.0s)]
*  They didn't because wars will end. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=709.0s)]
*  That's the one thing about war. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=711.0s)]
*  A war will end. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=713.0s)]
*  But does another one? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=714.0s)]
*  What's the next war that starts? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=716.0s)]
*  They're always sparking up. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=718.0s)]
*  They're always sparking up somewhere. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=719.0s)]
*  I have this weird theory. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=721.0s)]
*  Well, it's not a weird theory, but like and it's a gross generalization. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=723.0s)]
*  But I think like pretty much every conflict is a result of capitalism. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=728.0s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=736.0s)]
*  In the sense that raw capitalism, like in its nascent form is like it's just a system of trade and so forth. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=737.0s)]
*  But the way it's been wired, because it doesn't have human well-being involved in the equation, it's just about can we make this graph go up like we need more of these numbers? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=744.0s)]
*  And it's just chasing infinite wealth, right? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=757.0s)]
*  It's like wealth amassing. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=760.0s)]
*  But but so it has a value system, but human well-being is not in it. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=762.0s)]
*  So eventually over time, it's like, of course, people are going to game it. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=766.0s)]
*  And very few people are going to game it. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=769.0s)]
*  And they're going to acquire all this stuff. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=771.0s)]
*  And they're just going to be like desensitized to the rest of the inequities and so forth. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=773.0s)]
*  And then you're going to cause all this animosity. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=778.0s)]
*  And then there's going to be a lot of people going like, well, I need to get my stuff back. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=780.0s)]
*  And then you get all these opportunists that are using the disgruntledism and like using that arm. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=783.0s)]
*  It's like that's my over gross oversimplification. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=788.0s)]
*  I'm sure I'll be corrected millions of times over. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=792.0s)]
*  But whenever I see any of these conflicts or even a conflict in my own neighborhood or my neighbors arguing over it's about a property line or it's about you didn't do this or you didn't do that. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=795.0s)]
*  It's this weird thought process that goes into I don't have enough or I have all the stuff and I want to keep the stuff or I want more stuff. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=806.0s)]
*  And then someone else kind of responding to that in some way and that phrasing it as eloquently as I usually do on ketamine. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=815.0s)]
*  But that's kind of my whenever I see all of these things, I'm just like, I have a feeling that it's probably maybe that I don't know. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=822.0s)]
*  The problem is the alternative is even more horrific. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=832.0s)]
*  What's the alternative socialism? Socialism. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=836.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know enough because the only way that's enforced is by dictators. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=839.0s)]
*  And then the dictators wind up doing what every human being in power does, which is control all the resources, control all the wealth, live in extravagant houses. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=843.0s)]
*  Why everybody starves every single communist dictatorship is all run the same way. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=851.0s)]
*  It's the only way to run them because the only way to enforce socialism is through violence. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=856.0s)]
*  The only way to take people's resources and evenly distributed going with guns. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=861.0s)]
*  But what about like countries like Sweden and things like that? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=865.0s)]
*  They have social. Well, we have social. We have social. We should have social systems. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=868.0s)]
*  Yes, social social systems. But you're talking about like full on full on socialism. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=872.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'm not you know, that's right. Here's something that's interesting. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=876.0s)]
*  I really think within our lifetimes, if it hasn't happened already, governments are going to start using AI to do low level legislation. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=880.0s)]
*  And now I'm just like I'm summarizing in a very optimistic way. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=889.0s)]
*  We've been talking about this a lot. Oh, OK. OK. Good. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=896.0s)]
*  So I got a friend of mine, Dr. Alan D. Thompson. If you don't know about him, check him out. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=898.0s)]
*  He's a he's an AI expert researcher. He's an explainer. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=903.0s)]
*  He has a thing called the memo that comes out, I think, like every two weeks, something like that. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=906.0s)]
*  But it gives you this really holistic state of the union of AI. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=910.0s)]
*  And he's hyper optimistic and calls it human evolution, which I believe in that as well. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=915.0s)]
*  If it's used well, you get rid of the emotional factor and you just have something that's looking to solve problems. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=920.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know. And so I think like it can at least give you five solutions that are not emotionally based, that are just addressed. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=928.0s)]
*  They're supposed to kind of maximize the positive probable outcome. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=935.0s)]
*  And I think we may see a human AI synergistic government low, at least low level government implementation. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=941.0s)]
*  Probably some country that's like can do that and not feel like they're better than the farm on it. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=949.0s)]
*  And if they if it goes well, then other people implement. Exactly. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=956.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. We were talking about a AI president that you need a president that is immune to bias, corruption, influence and someone who just looks at things rationally and in an intelligent way that spans all the disciplines. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=959.0s)]
*  Right. Like how could any president really be an expert in foreign policy, the environment, economics, social justice, infrastructure, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=977.0s)]
*  immigration? It's not possible. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=988.0s)]
*  How could one person really know the correct solutions to all those issues? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=992.0s)]
*  Even if you're briefed. Look, I can't imagine. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=997.0s)]
*  I all I do is run a podcast and do comedy and occasionally commentate on fights and all those three things take up so much of my fucking time. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1001.0s)]
*  My whole day today has been having conversations with people about replacement opponents because there's a UFC coming out in two weeks. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1012.0s)]
*  So I've been having all these conversations with experts and people that I know and commentators of who can fit this spot and who's ready and who's in shape and who's turned the fight down. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1020.0s)]
*  How could anybody? That's so minor. My role is so small. I have so little to do and yet it takes up so much of my time. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1030.0s)]
*  How could anyone manage all of those things? They can't. But AI could. Yeah. And AI doesn't have a son that gets money from Burisma. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1042.0s)]
*  I know. I know. It's like the thing about that. I know. Well, it's like I mean, if you look at like this, it's really hard. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1051.0s)]
*  I had I had a term on if it exists, but I call it corporate corporates. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1057.0s)]
*  And most people in government essentially are corporates in the sense that the things that when I see people like vetoing things are not getting on board with certain things. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1061.0s)]
*  And you're like, well, that seems like that would be helpful. But you're choosing not to do that. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1070.0s)]
*  It's like the influence of corporations on even well-intentioned, you know, people that go into government, they're like, I want to make a difference. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1074.0s)]
*  It just gets in there. It's so baked. It's baked in there. And so I don't know how you're going to you're going to overcome that. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1082.0s)]
*  The only thing I can think of is like because my thing is like, I'm not really political in the sense that I don't have a party. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1090.0s)]
*  I'm pretty independent. I'm just like, I want to choose people that are that are humble enough, that have enough humility to work with anybody that's that wants to solve a problem that they're that they're wanting to solve and to solve and to create solutions for the most amount of people possible. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1096.0s)]
*  That's kind of that's all I'm looking for, because there is no excuse for any of us being all the inequity we see in all of the all of the stuff is totally solvable if we were much more efficient with how how well how resources are utilized, how they're distributed and so forth. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1116.0s)]
*  And what I mean by that is like some of my friends are like, well, if you do like universal basic income, which which I think is something I'm kind of interested in, I think that that is interesting if you can account for where that comes from in a way that doesn't upset people that have a lot of power and a lot of money feel like that's threatening my whatever it is that I remember Bernie Sanders, his idea. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1134.0s)]
*  Oh, no. What was that? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1156.0s)]
*  That was an idea that I thought was really fascinating when I talked to him. He said he's going to take a small fraction less than one cent for every speculation buy on the stock market. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1157.0s)]
*  And that would account for insane amount of money. And you could essentially through that money, just through that money, provide free health care, free education, just just through that. If we could, there's two things that we could do that could stop people from living a shit life. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1169.0s)]
*  One of them is keep them from being saddled down by student debt, student debt, student loan debt is fucking insane because you're taking these vulnerable young people, 17 years old, right out of high school, about to go to college, and they sign on for these fucking deals where they they're going to owe an insane amount of money over the next five, six years. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1187.0s)]
*  And they can never get out of that debt. That is crazy. It's crazy what we do to people. So then you force them into jobs that perhaps they don't want to do. And maybe there's things that they would have thought of pursuing that they can't pursue because they have a nut that they have to pay every month because they have student loan debts. And it's a big nut. If you're in medical school, it's enormous. It's an enormous nut. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1208.0s)]
*  It's it's so insane because the way I look at it is like, anytime someone's in survival mode, they're in a crisis state. They're not they're less likely to be in a solution based mind state. They're they're generally in a crisis state. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1232.0s)]
*  So if you're in survival mode, you're spending all of this brain trust energy that could be contributing to amazing solutions for all kinds of things. And you're just wasting it. And that's why when I when I drive through LA and I see how many people are on the street, like, I'm like, there's probably a genius in there. There's probably someone who could invent a new water filtration system or there's probably whatever it is. We're, it's a waste of human potential. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1245.0s)]
*  And I'm like, if you don't invest in your population, if you don't believe in your population and you don't invest in them. And I just like the some of the arguments are like, well, you know, you're just giving away stuff and people are just going to freeload. It's like, there's going to be there might be some of that. But most of the time, people want to get involved in something and they want to make the people at least close around them. They want to make their lives a little bit better. That's if you're not a drug addict. Well, the problem with the homeless community is the vast majority are mentally ill and are not able to afford to live. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1273.0s)]
*  And it's not just about the homeless people. It's about the people that are not able to afford to live. It's about the people that are not able to afford to live. And that's the problem with the homeless community. And I think that's the problem with the homeless community. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1303.0s)]
*  There's no excuse for radically impoverished gang ridden crime ridden neighborhoods. There's no excuse for that. We should be engineering that out. We should figure out a way to if you want to make a better country, you want to make America great again, make less losers. What's the best way to make less losers give people opportunities from the jump. You know, much potential we're missing out so much so much potential missing out because people who might have brilliant minds might be incredibly creative, but they're born in [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1316.0s)]
*  horrible hostile environments, and they get caught up in it. And it's it could happen to you could happen to me could happen to anybody. We're all totally anybody who's listening to this that hasn't committed, you know, murder or robbed people. A lot of it is luck. It's your decisions for sure. And you choose it's how you're raised. But you don't get to choose that either. You don't get to choose who your family is, you don't get to choose your neighborhood, you don't get to choose how they what trauma they faced in their life. You don't get to choose what happened to your mother while [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1346.0s)]
*  she was when you were in her womb that that contributes to the way you think and behave. Because when a woman is involved in like heavy violence and trauma and when they're around that all the time in the babies in the womb, that baby comes out triggered, like ready to go. It's a fact. Michael was explaining this to get the genetics and the experiential development. Yes, station. So if we could do that, I've said this many times, but I'll say it again. Think about these no bid [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1376.0s)]
*  contracts they give Hal Burton to go in and fix Iraq after we blew the shit out of it. Why can't they give no bid contracts to these motherfuckers to go fix up cities? Why isn't it profitable? Imagine if it was profitable to do that if we can spend 100 fucking billion dollars in Ukraine, whether you agree with that or not, we had that money somehow or another we were able to do that. We have a crisis in America, massive crisis. The loss of life in America is comparable to [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1406.0s)]
*  all kinds of wars. If you just look at the amount of people that die in the South Side of Chicago every weekend, it was higher at many points than what was going on with the conflict in Afghanistan. Yeah, I mean, it's it's it's crazy to me when I when I see this, like the United States, I mean, the United States that I grew up in the 80s, there was like, yeah, we were kind of blinded by a lot of like, you know, kind of glamorizing and just like everything's groovy, you know, like all the movies and TV shows and stuff like that. But at least when I grew up, I didn't have that stress. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1436.0s)]
*  I didn't have that stress of the micromanaging of constant reminders that the inequities are insane and that the middle class is just getting squeezed. And everybody I know and I'm talking about like I tried to get it. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1466.0s)]
*  I was like, oh, yeah, and they're like, yeah, we want you to have a house. I want you to have this. I was like, this is great. House went for one point seven million dollars. And of course, that was like an understatement. I was like, oh, yeah, I'm going to get a house. I'm going to get a house. I'm going to get a house. I'm going to get a house. I'm going to get a house. I'm going to get a house. I'm going to get a house. I'm going to get a house. I'm going to get a house. I'm going to get a house. I'm going to get a house. I'm going to get a house. I'm going to get a house. I'm going to get a house. I'm going to get a house. I'm going to get a house. I'm going to get a house. I'm going to get a house. I'm going to get a house. I'm [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1480.0s)]
*  under bit. You know, however, they do that, that bullshit psychological, whatever, low, low price. So I was like, okay, right. I'm going to give you a healthy offer. I gave him a healthy offer, you know, talk to my real estate agent, everything. Itakenm I was like, okay, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1510.0s)]
*  it sounds like this is going to go through. And then they're like oh, sorry, they went with this. This other person, oh, really? what did they offer? They offered one point 2 million. Oh, on top of the adjusted asking price with know waving, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1523.3s)]
*  all the inspections, contingents, and it was cash. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1539.36s)]
*  That happened to me three times. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1542.9599999999998s)]
*  And it felt like the city or life was like, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1545.76s)]
*  oh, you want a house? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1550.56s)]
*  I'll give you a little bit of hope, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1551.3799999999999s)]
*  and then there's gonna be a team that just goes out [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1552.2199999999998s)]
*  and says, we're gonna outbid you, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1555.4799999999998s)]
*  and we're gonna just waive all the, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1557.5s)]
*  there's no way you're gonna compete with it. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1558.9199999999998s)]
*  And I thought about that, and I have friends [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1560.1599999999999s)]
*  that are trying to find apartments right now. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1561.9599999999998s)]
*  And even in Great Falls, Montana, where I'm from, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1564.9199999999998s)]
*  I think some property value went up, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1569.6s)]
*  I don't know, a huge percentage. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1572.32s)]
*  California's moving in. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1573.52s)]
*  Well, Yellowstone, man, Yellowstone. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1575.04s)]
*  They tricked everybody. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1578.1999999999998s)]

*  When I heard about that, no, not even that, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1581.56s)]
*  it was just like, everyone thought, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1583.6s)]
*  I thought, oh yeah, a TV production promoting that area, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1585.28s)]
*  whatever, that should bring in money, right? [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1589.3999999999999s)]
*  It did, but now every Montana, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1591.1999999999998s)]
*  because Montanans are already, it's like, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1593.32s)]
*  I have the same, I feel the same way. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1594.8s)]

*  and you're always welcome back. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1609.32s)]
*  And that's always been the vibe. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1610.6799999999998s)]
*  And now it's almost militant now. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1612.04s)]
*  People are really like, do not come in here, don't, don't. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1614.6s)]
*  Please, please don't. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1618.72s)]
*  You can't stop people from coming. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1620.1599999999999s)]
*  I know you can't. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1621.0s)]
*  I know you can't. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1621.84s)]
*  That's a ridiculous perspective. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1622.6799999999998s)]
*  But I'm just saying that it got harsher [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1624.1599999999999s)]
*  because of this show and how it changed the economy [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1627.6799999999998s)]
*  in Bozeman, I mean, they call Bozeman Boz Angeles. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1631.3999999999999s)]
*  And now no one can buy a house there. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1633.8s)]
*  I have a couple friends who are like, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1637.7199999999998s)]
*  we couldn't buy in Bozeman. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1639.12s)]
*  We had to move somewhere else. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1640.4799999999998s)]
*  And prices are going up everywhere. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1642.12s)]
*  Wait till they get that 30 below winter [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1644.1999999999998s)]
*  for like five weeks in a row. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1646.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1648.1999999999998s)]
*  What in the fuck did I sign up for? [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1649.04s)]
*  I think a lot of people don't understand [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1650.8799999999999s)]
*  what they're getting into when they move to Montana. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1652.52s)]

*  That's up there. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1656.04s)]

*  I feel safe about Great Falls. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1658.6399999999999s)]
*  Great Falls isn't necessarily a destination. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1660.04s)]
*  So I mean, there's not to, I mean, there are great things. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1662.04s)]
*  There's like- Maybe you should stop talking about it. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1665.08s)]
*  Lewis and Clark, oh, I know, yeah. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1666.7199999999998s)]

*  It's like forest fires. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1671.84s)]
*  There's like deer that are really aggressive. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1673.12s)]
*  Aggressive deer. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1675.52s)]
*  Aggressive deer. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1676.36s)]
*  But you know what I mean? [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1677.52s)]
*  I just like the times are kind of, I'm like, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1678.36s)]
*  if an AI could just do a theoretical, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1681.84s)]
*  it doesn't have to be implemented, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1684.8799999999999s)]
*  but theoretically like ingested all of the government, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1685.9199999999998s)]
*  all the legislation, all the laws that exist. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1689.3999999999999s)]
*  And you say, give it a simple thing, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1692.8s)]
*  like how can we balance all of the spending [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1695.12s)]
*  and how can we contribute to things [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1699.08s)]
*  that will solve problems to make our lives feel more like, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1700.8s)]
*  hey, you can go out in the street and go, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1704.04s)]
*  how you doing, man? [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1705.6399999999999s)]
*  I'm not too bad. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1707.04s)]
*  And they're like, oh, okay, great. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1708.32s)]
*  If that was the criteria, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1709.9199999999998s)]
*  I would be interesting to see what it came up with. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1711.12s)]
*  Yeah, but you're never gonna stop supply and demand. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1712.8s)]
*  You're never gonna stop a place that's awesome [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1715.36s)]
*  from getting people to find out that it's awesome [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1717.8799999999999s)]
*  and wanting to live there. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1719.76s)]
*  And then you never gonna stop people [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1720.76s)]
*  from raising the price of their real estate [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1722.1599999999999s)]
*  because the demand is there and then they sell it [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1725.1599999999999s)]
*  and then it raises property values. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1728.08s)]
*  No, I mean, of course, I understand that. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1729.52s)]
*  It's called progress, Reggie. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1731.28s)]
*  Okay, I understand that. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1732.6799999999998s)]
*  However. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1734.1999999999998s)]
*  You live in Los Angeles. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1735.04s)]
*  I live in Los Angeles. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1736.52s)]
*  That's literally the product of that. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1737.36s)]
*  I know, I know. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1738.6s)]

*  Believe me, I feel it. Perfect weather. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1740.68s)]
*  Everybody moved there. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1742.04s)]
*  You ever see Los Angeles? [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1743.0800000000002s)]
*  Remember when Jerry's Famous Deli was open back in the day? [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1744.4s)]
*  You'd be able to see these photographs of the valley [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1747.6000000000001s)]
*  from like the 1800s. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1752.0800000000002s)]
*  They had these old black and white photos [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1753.92s)]
*  where it was all dirt roads, orchards. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1756.28s)]
*  There was nobody there. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1759.3600000000001s)]
*  Yes, I know. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1760.48s)]
*  That was 100 years ago, man. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1761.8s)]
*  I know. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1763.0800000000002s)]
*  200 years ago. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1763.92s)]
*  Now it's fucking psychotic. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1764.74s)]
*  Now it's bumper to bumper traffic [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1766.4s)]
*  and spray paint and cement everywhere. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1768.28s)]
*  I know, I know. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1770.76s)]
*  I have a friend from Wyoming. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1771.68s)]
*  I think I talked about her on the show. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1773.36s)]
*  And Kirsten Joy Wise, yeah, I talked about her. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1775.84s)]
*  Sharpshooter. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1780.2s)]
*  We have the most amazing conversations [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1781.04s)]
*  because she's like, she's not, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1783.0s)]
*  I wouldn't say she's conservative, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1784.92s)]
*  but she's a constitutionalist [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1786.08s)]
*  and has her beliefs and she's Christian. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1788.04s)]
*  She even talked to me on the phone. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1792.88s)]
*  She's like, listen, I'm a white Christian woman [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1794.08s)]
*  living in Wyoming, in Cody, Wyoming, and I love guns. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1798.52s)]
*  And I was like, and we have the most amazing conversation. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1802.96s)]
*  It's great. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1806.32s)]
*  And we usually unify on science fiction. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1807.1599999999999s)]
*  But she's terrified or she said, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1808.6399999999999s)]
*  sorry, Kirsten, but at one point she was like, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1812.6s)]
*  I'm apprehensive about going to California [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1815.76s)]
*  because what I see is like destruction, gangs and violence [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1818.46s)]
*  and all this stuff. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1824.36s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't know, man. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1825.1799999999998s)]
*  I don't, I don't. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1827.0s)]
*  And I know that it happens. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1829.28s)]
*  I've had friends' cars broken into, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1830.6799999999998s)]
*  those types of things. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1832.52s)]
*  But in general, I don't experience that. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1833.36s)]
*  And then that also comes down to me just going like, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1836.36s)]
*  why don't you just come to LA and I'll show you. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1838.52s)]
*  Nowhere is gonna be perfect wherever you're gonna live. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1841.36s)]
*  There's gonna be some kind of a limitation. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1844.4199999999998s)]
*  You're either not gonna have the culture [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1845.8799999999999s)]
*  that you're looking for. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1849.6s)]
*  You're not gonna have access to the foods that you want, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1850.84s)]
*  but you're gonna get this. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1853.36s)]
*  But you're gonna get this, but you might not get this. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1854.1999999999998s)]
*  And I think for me, it's like, I wanna live in places [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1856.08s)]
*  but not have any fear based off of the projection [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1860.04s)]
*  from fear-based projections. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1863.28s)]
*  And so, I don't know. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1866.24s)]
*  A little bit of tension. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1867.84s)]
*  Right, but there's a reality of the elevation of violence [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1868.6799999999998s)]
*  in Los Angeles that's legitimate [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1870.56s)]
*  and also the diminishing of police. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1872.24s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1876.3999999999999s)]
*  That's all real. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1877.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it is. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1878.52s)]
*  Although I will say, this is weird, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1880.0s)]
*  but I will say that there's a certain amount of that, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1882.48s)]
*  this is weird to say, but sometimes when things get hostile [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1887.76s)]
*  or let's say more chaotic, I kind of go, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1892.4s)]
*  oh, here's an opportunity. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1897.16s)]
*  I think it's an opportunity in the sense that [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1898.8400000000001s)]
*  it makes people reformat their association to things. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1903.0s)]
*  Like police, there's more violence. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1905.8400000000001s)]
*  And now we have less police. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1907.96s)]
*  It's like, was the answer less police? [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1909.16s)]
*  It's like, I don't think the answer was less police. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1910.88s)]
*  I think it was about better trained police. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1912.92s)]
*  I think they went too far. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1915.3200000000002s)]
*  And it's like, when you have these opportunities in life [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1917.72s)]
*  where you're like, this moment where people are like, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1919.88s)]
*  maybe we should question the way we do things, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1922.2s)]
*  but then the response is to overshoot and overcompensate [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1924.4s)]
*  and now you've got like this, you know, so I don't know. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1929.4s)]
*  I hope that- [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1931.44s)]
*  Well, it's also a problem that people have an opinion [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1932.2800000000002s)]
*  based on an ideology that they subscribe to. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1934.3600000000001s)]
*  And say, if you have a leftist ideology [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1937.0400000000002s)]
*  and you subscribe to that, then you have some very specific, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1939.52s)]
*  I bet I know where you stand on climate change. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1941.84s)]
*  I bet I know where you stand on many issues. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1945.48s)]
*  And the problem with that is if your tribe [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1949.68s)]
*  all agrees to something, you signal to your tribe [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1953.3600000000001s)]
*  by also agreeing to it, and it's much easier [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1955.8s)]
*  than having a real objective conversation [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1958.04s)]
*  about the realities of that thing [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1961.4s)]
*  and not being attached to these ideas, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1962.76s)]
*  but just saying, well, what are the realities [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1964.64s)]
*  of these things? [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1966.64s)]
*  Yes, I always call it the 10% rule. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1968.16s)]
*  Like I may believe in something and think about it [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1970.72s)]
*  and go, yeah, that makes sense for me, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1974.28s)]
*  but I always leave 10% margin of me being completely wrong [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1976.24s)]
*  or me misunderstanding the whole situation [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1980.6000000000001s)]
*  because I can't hold on to something so fervently [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1983.5600000000002s)]
*  because I have like, I have all kinds of friends. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1986.76s)]
*  I have conservative friends, I have anarchist friends, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1988.44s)]
*  I have agnostic friends, whatever. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1992.48s)]
*  I have religious friends, I have leftist friends. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1994.0400000000002s)]
*  But the thing that brings us together [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1996.76s)]
*  is that we can have conversations about issues, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=1999.1200000000001s)]
*  and if I bring up something that is a counter [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2001.32s)]
*  to what they believe, they're at least listening, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2004.96s)]
*  and they're like, that's interesting. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2007.16s)]
*  Well, yeah, if we incorporate a little bit [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2008.92s)]
*  of what you're talking about into what we're doing [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2011.3600000000001s)]
*  and we kinda deescalate on here, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2013.32s)]
*  we can arrive at something that's a little bit more rational [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2015.16s)]
*  and works for more people. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2017.1200000000001s)]
*  What's stunning how emotionally attached people [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2018.28s)]
*  are oftentimes to subjects that they're not even informed on. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2020.56s)]
*  Oh, yes, of course. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2024.92s)]
*  When you really have a conversation with them [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2025.92s)]
*  about the actual data, they fall apart [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2027.4s)]
*  because they're ideologically driven. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2029.96s)]
*  Their camp, whether they're a right-wing conservative [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2032.64s)]
*  or a left-wing progressive, [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2035.44s)]
*  their camp believes a certain thing, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2037.2s)]
*  and so they're locked in on this certain thing [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2039.12s)]
*  as being correct, and then emotionally they respond [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2040.96s)]
*  to a differing opinion, and that is just rough, man. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2044.44s)]
*  Those are rough conversations. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2048.16s)]
*  I don't enjoy them. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2049.4s)]
*  I really enjoy having conversations with people [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2050.24s)]
*  that I disagree with that are polite and kind [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2052.52s)]
*  and objective and fair. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2055.96s)]
*  Those are great conversations, because they're stimulating. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2057.36s)]
*  I get to see how you think about things [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2059.7200000000003s)]
*  and why you think about these things, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2062.04s)]
*  and those conversations are so important, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2063.92s)]
*  and for whatever reason, nowadays people [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2065.84s)]
*  don't wanna have them anymore. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2068.6800000000003s)]
*  They wanna like, I think it's a social media artifact. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2070.08s)]
*  100%, 100%. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2072.92s)]
*  It's social media and that you can interact [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2074.88s)]
*  and you can say something. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2077.7200000000003s)]
*  The thing is, if something affects you emotionally, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2079.96s)]
*  you can immediately state how you're feeling, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2083.04s)]
*  and the context is so limited on that statement. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2086.12s)]
*  I've gotten into, I go on Twitter, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2089.88s)]
*  I'm not gonna call it X, but I go on Twitter, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2092.4s)]
*  and I have these discussions with some people [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2096.4s)]
*  that are like, oh, there is no way whatever I say, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2098.32s)]
*  and I'm always practicing different hacks. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2101.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm like, okay, well, maybe I'll just go in with, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2103.84s)]
*  you're obviously, there's some insecurity [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2106.8s)]
*  that you're feeling, and you're feeling frustration, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2109.16s)]
*  so you're expounding these things [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2111.16s)]
*  because it gives you an energy in the moment [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2114.56s)]
*  that makes you feel as though. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2117.12s)]
*  You're doing something. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2118.72s)]
*  You're doing something, and often their reply [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2119.56s)]
*  is generally more of the same, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2122.3199999999997s)]
*  but slightly different information, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2126.08s)]
*  and I'm like, okay, I see, you're not in the mode [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2129.24s)]
*  where you want to have a conversation. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2131.84s)]
*  We're not having a face-to-face conversation. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2133.3199999999997s)]
*  You're trying to win, you're playing a game. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2135.08s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm not into winning. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2136.36s)]
*  It's like, I want to come to an understanding [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2138.64s)]
*  because there's nothing better. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2141.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean, one of my favorite highs in the world, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2143.56s)]
*  and I love drugs, but my favorite high in the world [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2145.8399999999997s)]
*  is when I had a conversation, this is just an example. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2148.56s)]
*  I was in Montana, back steps of my friend Wally's house. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2152.08s)]
*  His next door neighbor was an armorer in the Iraq War, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2155.7599999999998s)]
*  was responsible for, I don't know, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2160.3199999999997s)]
*  I think it was a battalion's worth of weapons, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2162.08s)]
*  and it was only he and another guy [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2164.92s)]
*  that were monitoring these things. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2166.16s)]
*  He has all these stories, and his viewpoint [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2168.8s)]
*  on all kinds of things, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2171.7200000000003s)]
*  he's definitely more conservatively. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2173.56s)]
*  I had this conversation about the perspective [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2175.44s)]
*  from people who are, it was a police issue, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2177.32s)]
*  and I was saying, police need to be better trained. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2180.0800000000004s)]
*  It's not necessarily about getting rid of them, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2182.28s)]
*  but I believe that they need better training [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2184.3s)]
*  in other countries. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2185.88s)]
*  Police go to school for two and a half years [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2186.7000000000003s)]
*  before they even get out. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2188.52s)]
*  So there's a difference in quality. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2189.84s)]
*  And we kind of went back and forth, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2192.2000000000003s)]
*  and I saw his eyes narrowing, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2193.96s)]
*  and it was just kind of steaming up a little bit. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2195.7999999999997s)]
*  But then the more we talked about it, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2198.3199999999997s)]
*  and the more I said, I understand where you're coming from. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2199.7599999999998s)]
*  I get where you're coming from, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2202.14s)]
*  and I'm not saying the opposite [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2203.7999999999997s)]
*  of what you're talking about. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2208.9599999999996s)]
*  What I'm looking for is a solution of perspective. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2210.3599999999997s)]
*  And I saw him cool off, it was crazy, it cooled off. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2213.6s)]
*  And we left, he's still gonna believe what he's believing, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2218.04s)]
*  but it did not escalate, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2221.8599999999997s)]
*  and it was feeling kind of a little dangerous, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2223.88s)]
*  and then it was fine. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2226.52s)]
*  And I'm like, the more that we can have these conversations, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2228.1600000000003s)]
*  people aren't what they are for their entire lives. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2231.08s)]
*  And they aren't even what they are [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2233.4s)]
*  necessarily in any given moment, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2236.56s)]
*  because when we get information that we can tap into, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2238.44s)]
*  and feel, and get it from somebody, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2241.6800000000003s)]
*  instead of these tiny little bite-sized nuggets [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2243.9s)]
*  that are like decontextualized, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2246.92s)]
*  then it's brilliant, and I get off on that. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2249.1800000000003s)]
*  That's my biggest high in the world. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2251.96s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't know, I'm just like, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2254.6000000000004s)]
*  my friend's going like, this about this, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2255.44s)]
*  and I'm like, okay, okay, I hear you, but what about this? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2256.44s)]
*  And they're just like, oh, no, no, but check this out. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2259.44s)]
*  And they're like, oh, well, I don't know what it is. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2261.48s)]
*  I get off on that. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2264.2400000000002s)]
*  But that's the wonderful thing about some drugs. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2265.0800000000004s)]
*  Yes, that's true. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2266.92s)]
*  Because some drugs, like for me, it's marijuana. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2267.7400000000002s)]
*  Marijuana makes me so much more considerate [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2270.48s)]
*  of other people's perspectives and feelings. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2274.6200000000003s)]
*  Because I'm much more sensitive when I'm on it. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2277.6000000000004s)]
*  So when I'm talking to someone, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2280.94s)]
*  I'm so much less likely to engage in a real disagreement. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2282.1s)]
*  It'll be much more passive, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2287.86s)]
*  much more like, okay, I see what you're saying. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2289.82s)]
*  So you feel that, like, reaffirm, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2293.58s)]
*  and then have you considered. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2297.18s)]
*  And this is a thing, and I also, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2299.86s)]
*  I say this all the time, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2302.46s)]
*  because it's a very important thing to say, [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2303.5s)]
*  I try very hard to not be connected to my ideas. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2305.2200000000003s)]
*  That these are just ideas. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2310.62s)]
*  And I, as an individual, as a separate being, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2312.3799999999997s)]
*  a conscious being, am engaging with these ideas. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2317.06s)]
*  But I don't claim them as my own [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2319.98s)]
*  to the point where I'm married to them [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2321.7s)]
*  and I fight for them and these are my ideas [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2323.1s)]
*  and I stand by them. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2327.74s)]
*  There's only a few. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2328.58s)]
*  Sure. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2330.22s)]
*  Like, you know. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2331.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2331.8999999999996s)]
*  There's a few. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2332.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2333.56s)]
*  Right? [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2334.3999999999996s)]
*  But most things, I'm like, I wanna know [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2335.22s)]
*  why you think the way you think. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2336.7s)]
*  And that's one of the beautiful things [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2338.42s)]
*  about having a podcast, is I have so many conversations [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2340.34s)]
*  with so many people that have [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2343.58s)]
*  completely different perspectives. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2345.5s)]
*  Man, I will. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2347.54s)]
*  And you get this chance to explore them. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2348.38s)]
*  Totally. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2350.62s)]
*  And it's funny, it's like, I have this concept [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2351.44s)]
*  where I talk about, I don't, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2353.42s)]
*  I kinda believe that we all play characters of ourselves. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2355.4s)]
*  Like, we kinda have a character version of ourselves. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2358.78s)]
*  But then there's the actor, right? [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2360.9s)]
*  Or, if you wanna, using car terms, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2363.06s)]
*  there's a pilot or there's a driver, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2364.94s)]
*  and then there's a machine. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2367.18s)]
*  And how I like to think of it is, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2368.66s)]
*  I like to address the actor or the piece of consciousness [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2371.94s)]
*  that's inside of the character, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2376.14s)]
*  that's like playing the character. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2377.66s)]
*  And generally, generally that works really well. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2379.1s)]
*  Because if I'm making an effort to speak to that part [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2382.58s)]
*  and then to kind of like try to see myself [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2387.54s)]
*  from their perspective, people sense that. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2389.98s)]
*  They sense that you're making an effort [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2392.3799999999997s)]
*  and they appreciate it. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2394.2599999999998s)]
*  Because you're recognizing the sovereign being [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2395.36s)]
*  that they are. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2399.96s)]
*  Not necessarily all the stuff around them. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2400.8s)]
*  I've talked to people that are like [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2402.52s)]
*  super into conspiracy theories, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2404.36s)]
*  and they're really down into this crazy zone [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2406.32s)]
*  where it's like, if you're talking about encryption, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2409.42s)]
*  it's asymmetrical. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2411.88s)]
*  There's no way you're hacking that. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2412.7200000000003s)]
*  But you just skip to the quantum level [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2414.2400000000002s)]
*  and just talk to the consciousness. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2416.04s)]
*  And I know it sounds kinda esoteric, [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2418.36s)]
*  but it's like, it works. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2420.2400000000002s)]
*  It's, because I wanna respect, [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2422.8s)]
*  I wanna give everyone the respect of them [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2424.44s)]
*  and acknowledge that they are a being on the planet. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2426.76s)]
*  They're a human being. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2429.84s)]
*  And they exist. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2431.0s)]
*  But it's also you as a human. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2432.76s)]
*  You're a really nice guy. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2434.78s)]
*  And every conversation I've had with you [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2436.8s)]
*  has been kind of consistent like that. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2439.2400000000002s)]
*  You're just a nice person. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2440.96s)]
*  You genuinely want to get along with people. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2442.84s)]
*  And you genuinely want like a real discourse, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2447.36s)]
*  a real conversation. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2450.68s)]
*  True. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2451.92s)]
*  Some people aren't into that game. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2453.12s)]
*  I know. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2455.2s)]
*  And when you encounter those people, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2456.04s)]
*  like if someone says, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2457.92s)]
*  no, I wanna fuckin' play tennis. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2458.7599999999998s)]
*  And you're like, but we're playing ping pong, man. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2459.88s)]
*  No, no, no, fucking tennis. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2462.12s)]
*  You gotta go, okay, I wanna play ping pong. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2463.4s)]
*  You wanna play tennis. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2465.48s)]
*  I'm just, have a nice day. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2466.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm not gonna play tennis. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2468.08s)]
*  What if we play penis? [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2469.0s)]
*  Yeah, what if we play, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2470.3599999999997s)]
*  what is the one, pickleball? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2472.0s)]
*  Pickleball, oh my God. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2474.0s)]
*  I think pickleball's really fun. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2475.8399999999997s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2477.2799999999997s)]
*  I, oh God. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2478.52s)]
*  Yeah, I hear that too. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2479.8399999999997s)]
*  But I won't, just because of the name, I can't. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2480.72s)]
*  But no, it's true. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2483.34s)]
*  It's like, I just, I don't know. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2484.42s)]
*  I think that we're here [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2485.98s)]
*  and we might as well have a good time. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2486.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2488.42s)]
*  So like, let's just. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2489.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, be as nice as you can. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2490.1s)]
*  Like kindness, that's all I'm looking for. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2490.94s)]
*  Kindness. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2492.8199999999997s)]
*  Kindness is like, if I feel like someone's being kind, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2493.66s)]
*  it's great. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2495.9s)]
*  I've run into tons of assholes [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2496.74s)]
*  that I've seen like treat people like shit. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2497.58s)]
*  But most of the time, I can get in there. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2499.94s)]
*  If I can get in there, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2502.86s)]
*  and they'll go like, oh, that's cool, I respect you, man. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2503.94s)]
*  I'm like, okay, great, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2506.2999999999997s)]
*  cause I respect you too. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2507.5s)]
*  But also, don't do that shit. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2508.54s)]
*  Like you could do stuff different. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2511.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2513.38s)]
*  And they'll come back at you [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2514.2200000000003s)]
*  and you'll get an energy that you actually want. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2516.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2518.94s)]
*  Well, that's the thing too. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2519.78s)]
*  Like some people will say, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2520.7400000000002s)]
*  like I met that guy, I knew he was an asshole. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2522.34s)]
*  Okay, well how were you? [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2524.46s)]
*  Cause when I met him, he's really nice. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2526.26s)]

*  And that's, those types of things, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2614.58s)]
*  those are the moments where you realize like, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2616.38s)]

*  There's more power in being collaborative. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2628.18s)]
*  And you can, and it doesn't mean you have to give up [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2631.2599999999998s)]
*  everything, I think people, they're too binary. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2633.4199999999996s)]
*  They're like, if I give up here, now I've lost everything. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2635.3599999999997s)]
*  It's not true. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2639.18s)]
*  It's like you become stronger [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2640.02s)]
*  when you become better collaborating. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2641.58s)]

*  Yeah, and it's cool. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2644.8199999999997s)]
*  And you can have rivalry. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2646.22s)]
*  I mean, rivalries I think are fun if they're not violent. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2647.22s)]
*  It's like, I think that rivalries are like, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2651.4199999999996s)]

*  I mean, look at the way you just helped that guy. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2668.1s)]
*  Or whatever. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2670.52s)]
*  And I love it because it's like, well, [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2671.36s)]
*  you can kind of exercise a little bit of the real thing, [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2673.28s)]
*  but it's not real, you know? [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2675.78s)]
*  So it lets off steam. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2677.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2678.36s)]

*  It's such a bummer when you try that on regular people. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2686.2400000000002s)]
*  Oh no, they do not get it. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2688.08s)]
*  You're like, right? [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2690.44s)]
*  And they're like, and you're like, okay. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2691.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, especially through text messages. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2694.76s)]
*  Like some of my comedian friends, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2697.4s)]
*  I love the ridiculous text messages. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2699.36s)]
*  We'll text message each other the most horrific shit, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2702.3s)]
*  the most ridiculous shit, back and forth to each other. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2704.52s)]
*  Just so cutting to each other and just laughing. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2707.16s)]
*  Everyone's laughing and it's fun. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2710.04s)]
*  I know. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2711.64s)]
*  It's fun, you're sparring. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2712.48s)]
*  I know you're sparring and that's what the thing, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2713.48s)]
*  I mean it's like, you know. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2715.0s)]
*  And it's in love, it's a fun. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2715.84s)]
*  Totally. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2717.24s)]
*  Yeah, like the reason why they can say those things to you [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2718.08s)]
*  is because you know they love you and you love them. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2720.2s)]
*  100%. And it's fun. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2722.08s)]
*  And it's funny. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2723.16s)]
*  And it's funny and it's the best. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2724.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2726.12s)]
*  That's my thing. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2728.24s)]
*  Also, you know, I'm an artist. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2729.08s)]
*  So for me, when I see art, it's like, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2730.24s)]
*  we're all intersected by art. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2732.84s)]
*  Art is a great unifier because it just goes straight [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2734.56s)]
*  to the initial core of what being a human being is about, [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2737.52s)]
*  which is a curious, creative, problem solving adventurer. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2740.6s)]
*  Like that's generally what human beings are. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2746.16s)]
*  They're like, what's over there? [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2749.44s)]
*  How does that work? [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2751.04s)]
*  Ooh, I bet you I could make this. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2752.36s)]
*  Hey, what are you working on? [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2754.04s)]
*  Can I help you? [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2754.92s)]
*  Whatever, can you help me? [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2755.7599999999998s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2756.88s)]
*  I think it's that. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2757.72s)]
*  But then again, when people are in survival mode, [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2758.56s)]
*  all the bad shit happens. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2760.68s)]
*  And then you get people taking advantage of people [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2761.92s)]
*  in those bad situations. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2763.72s)]
*  And then they're harnessing, [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2765.04s)]
*  they're extending their disappointment [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2766.2s)]
*  with life and themselves onto those people. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2768.36s)]
*  And then they start motivating. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2770.6800000000003s)]
*  And you're just, guys, guys, guys, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2772.1200000000003s)]
*  chill the fuck out. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2773.28s)]
*  Well, I think human beings have a certain amount [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2774.2000000000003s)]
*  of conflict and problem solving [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2777.2000000000003s)]
*  that they have to address on a daily basis [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2779.1200000000003s)]
*  in order to be balanced. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2781.32s)]
*  Certainly. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2783.0s)]
*  And I think the more you can do that with yourself, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2783.84s)]
*  the better off you are with other people. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2787.52s)]
*  By controlled adversity, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2790.08s)]
*  doing things that are difficult is the most important. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2792.1600000000003s)]
*  For me, if I don't work out a couple of days in a row, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2795.08s)]
*  I'm a different person. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2798.64s)]
*  And I know that seems like, well, you got a problem. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2800.08s)]
*  Yeah, I do have a problem. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2802.96s)]
*  Most of it's genetic, I'm pretty sure. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2804.36s)]
*  But my problem has a very simple solution [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2806.88s)]
*  that I've been practicing for decades. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2810.24s)]
*  And I understand it. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2812.04s)]
*  And I know how to mitigate that problem. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2813.36s)]
*  And when I do, I am a much better person. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2815.6s)]
*  And so I do that. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2818.44s)]
*  But when I don't do that for a few days, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2820.0s)]
*  I feel like a lot of people feel all the time. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2822.0s)]
*  And just a touch of it, just a touch of it. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2824.48s)]
*  I don't have decades of it compiled with alcoholism [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2826.96s)]
*  and fucking drug abuse and problems and stress [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2830.88s)]
*  and lack of sleep and poor diet [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2834.96s)]
*  and all these other contributing factors [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2836.68s)]
*  that make you a fucking maniac and environment. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2838.4s)]
*  So I just have a touch of it after a couple of days. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2842.12s)]
*  I'm like, ooh, I feel fucking irritable. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2844.96s)]
*  This is not a good way. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2848.16s)]
*  This is the opposite of ketamine. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2849.68s)]
*  This is not a good way to interface with people. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2851.48s)]
*  If I'm tense and worked up and I run into someone [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2853.56s)]
*  and they're taking too long to talk, [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2856.72s)]
*  they're just blobbing and blobbing. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2858.7999999999997s)]
*  Okay, get to the fucking point. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2860.0s)]
*  Come on, man. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2861.36s)]
*  But I'll say it that way. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2862.48s)]
*  Come on, man, get to the point. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2863.6s)]
*  And then that person's like, hey, you're fucking rude. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2864.48s)]
*  That guy's rude. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2867.6s)]
*  Oh, you're giving me a fucking ear beating. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2868.84s)]
*  Oh my God, he's hostile. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2870.4s)]
*  I'm sorry, I'm tense. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2871.88s)]
*  But if I was high and worked out, [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2872.96s)]
*  I'd be like, I see where you're coming from. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2875.7999999999997s)]
*  I'd maybe joke around a little bit. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2877.36s)]
*  Does this story have an end? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2879.6s)]
*  With a smile? [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2882.64s)]
*  Just make fun of the situation? [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2884.04s)]
*  I see what you're saying, but run out of time here. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2886.2799999999997s)]
*  I gotta get outta here. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2889.08s)]
*  I do the thing where I rapidly basically describe [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2890.12s)]
*  getting to the point at which someone's describing [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2895.3999999999996s)]
*  very rapidly and then going, is that what you mean? [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2898.3599999999997s)]
*  And they'll be like, oh yeah, okay, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2901.72s)]
*  now let's move to the next thing. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2903.16s)]
*  But then they wanna keep going and expand on it [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2904.0s)]
*  so it's their own. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2905.72s)]
*  That's true. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2906.96s)]
*  There's also a problem that some people [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2907.7999999999997s)]
*  just suck at talking. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2909.04s)]
*  Of course. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2910.3999999999996s)]
*  People are just not very good at it [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2911.7999999999997s)]
*  and they're practicing on you. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2913.12s)]
*  They're practicing. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2915.04s)]
*  That's true. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2915.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's very frustrating. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2916.72s)]
*  People talking at you. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2917.8399999999997s)]
*  Man, I'm telling you, man. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2919.8799999999997s)]
*  It's interesting when I have friends [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2921.2799999999997s)]
*  that are high visibility friends [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2924.6s)]
*  or people that are in the spotlight [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2927.6s)]
*  and I see how they interact with people. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2929.2s)]
*  And they might not even be friends. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2931.52s)]
*  Maybe I'm at a gathering or something [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2933.2s)]
*  like the Ame's party or something like that. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2934.4799999999996s)]
*  And I love watching all the social interactions [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2936.08s)]
*  and seeing how they do it. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2939.2s)]
*  The other night I was at Sarah Silverman's rooftop party [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2940.72s)]
*  and it was like all these amazing people were up there. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2945.64s)]
*  It was really cool to see everybody. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2948.0s)]
*  We hadn't seen each other in a long time. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2949.04s)]
*  All the people I grew up with doing comedy in 2003 [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2950.6s)]
*  in a little tiny club in New York, whatever. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2953.2s)]
*  It's like, look at us now. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2955.48s)]
*  This is cool. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2956.8799999999997s)]
*  We did good. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2957.72s)]
*  Or good-ish. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2958.72s)]
*  And anyways, Owen Wilson was up there. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2959.56s)]
*  And I noticed a strategy that he used [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2962.3999999999996s)]
*  which I thought was kinda interesting. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2965.3199999999997s)]
*  Which was, he was leaving [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2967.52s)]
*  and he had kinda met me before [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2969.64s)]
*  but I don't think he recognized who I was. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2971.2799999999997s)]
*  I didn't think he knew who I was. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2972.72s)]
*  But he had this way of, I'm accepting positive energy. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2974.68s)]
*  I'm reflecting it immediately. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2979.0s)]
*  But I also have the momentum of, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2980.92s)]
*  I'm getting the fuck outta here. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2983.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2984.92s)]
*  And I loved seeing that. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2985.7599999999998s)]
*  I was like, I've done that. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2986.96s)]
*  I know what it is. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2988.04s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2989.16s)]
*  It's like you deal with a lot of people. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2992.0s)]
*  You kinda have to, either you're just like, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2993.3599999999997s)]
*  I'm terrible with people. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2996.08s)]
*  I'm not going to these things or I'm out. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=2997.16s)]
*  At this point, the way anybody behaves towards me, [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3000.12s)]
*  I'm not really shocked. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3003.2799999999997s)]
*  I've seen almost everything. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3004.24s)]
*  I've seen shortness. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3005.48s)]
*  I've seen people that other people think are rude [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3007.2s)]
*  but they might be on the spectrum [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3010.04s)]
*  and they don't know how to, [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3011.72s)]
*  they just jump into something [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3013.52s)]
*  as though you've been talking for hours [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3015.3599999999997s)]
*  and assume that you know what they're talking about. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3017.56s)]
*  In those cases, I've developed a lot of patience for that. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3019.3999999999996s)]
*  So I try, and when I'm with my friends, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3022.08s)]
*  I'm like, they're like, [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3024.96s)]
*  whoa, you were really patient with that person. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3026.52s)]
*  I was like, it's the only way I can do it. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3028.04s)]
*  It's because I have to give people a little bit of time. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3030.48s)]
*  I don't want them to take advantage of me [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3033.32s)]
*  but I gotta give them at least a little bit of time [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3034.8s)]
*  to hear what they're talking about [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3037.72s)]
*  because fuck man, my worst nightmare [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3038.92s)]
*  is like the more successful I get, [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3041.84s)]
*  the more detached I become from the general human populace. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3044.16s)]
*  I can't do it. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3048.04s)]
*  Most of the places I hang out with, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3049.8s)]
*  I had a friend who gave me a compliment once. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3051.4s)]
*  They were like, you're like a famous person [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3052.88s)]
*  that doesn't live their life like a famous person. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3057.0s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, I'm not gonna fucking do that shit. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3059.6s)]
*  I'm going to the DIY spaces. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3061.96s)]
*  I'm helping someone with their flat tire, whatever. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3063.92s)]
*  Nothing changed. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3066.44s)]
*  I just have some more resources [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3067.68s)]
*  so I can do some different things [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3069.4s)]
*  or I have access to a great podcast like this [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3071.16s)]
*  or get to hang out with really cool people. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3074.4s)]
*  But in general, I just like being a person [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3076.44s)]
*  and hopefully by me being patient, [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3079.08s)]
*  people observing that they're like, [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3082.08s)]
*  oh, maybe I can incorporate a little bit of that. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3083.08s)]
*  The problem is you do open up the door for grifters. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3086.12s)]
*  There's a lot of people that have gotten my phone number, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3089.08s)]
*  I should have gotten my phone number. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3090.72s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3091.7599999999998s)]
*  Then I get text messages. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3092.6s)]
*  You mean like, oh. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3093.42s)]
*  Trying to get things from me [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3094.2599999999998s)]
*  and trying to get me to do things for them. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3095.08s)]
*  Of course, of course. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3096.44s)]
*  Get people to do this and that [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3098.12s)]
*  and can you connect me with this person. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3100.0s)]
*  You block them, whatever. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3101.7999999999997s)]
*  You don't respond. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3102.92s)]
*  Nah, don't block them. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3103.7599999999998s)]
*  You don't block them? [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3104.58s)]
*  No. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3105.42s)]

*  Oh okay, good, good to know. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3109.58s)]
*  Here's the interesting thing. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3110.42s)]
*  I have not changed my number since 1998 [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3111.42s)]
*  when I first got singular. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3114.12s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3116.2799999999997s)]
*  I signed up on singular. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3117.12s)]
*  But I will say this. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3117.94s)]
*  I think some of my friends who have to change their numbers, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3118.8399999999997s)]
*  I mean you're dealing with stuff like, [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3121.9s)]
*  the crowds that you're dealing with, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3123.38s)]
*  you're dealing with like fighting, [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3124.2799999999997s)]
*  you're interviewing a lot of people [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3125.68s)]
*  that have all kinds of crazy different perspectives. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3128.56s)]
*  So the interest is high [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3131.88s)]
*  and so people wanna have access to that. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3134.4s)]
*  For me, it's like I'm a silly guy. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3136.88s)]
*  You're just a cool guy. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3139.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm just a silly guy doing things. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3140.12s)]
*  You can't give them anything. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3140.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's like I don't really, [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3142.3599999999997s)]
*  they're gonna ask me like hey, can you do my show? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3143.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3146.1600000000003s)]
*  Well that's, it gets to the point where [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3147.0s)]
*  like if you're a hot woman and a guy's being nice to you, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3149.0s)]
*  you don't think oh this guy's just being nice to me. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3152.1600000000003s)]
*  You're like this guy wants to have sex with me. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3154.84s)]
*  So that's always on the table. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3156.44s)]
*  And so when someone's being nice to me, [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3158.04s)]
*  I have to always go are you trying to get something [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3160.7200000000003s)]
*  or are you just nice? [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3163.6000000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3164.44s)]
*  And then it's always like, [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3165.44s)]
*  hey I have this business that I'd really like [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3166.76s)]
*  to talk to you about like fuck. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3168.56s)]
*  There it goes. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3171.1600000000003s)]
*  I know, I know, I know. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3172.72s)]
*  I mean it's that way for me [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3173.96s)]
*  but it's mostly about like a show. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3175.56s)]
*  Like it's always like can you do my show? [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3177.44s)]
*  Or can you do a voice on my animation thing? [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3179.68s)]
*  Some of that's cool. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3182.52s)]
*  No, that's fun. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3183.52s)]
*  It's super cool but like I'm prepared for it [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3184.48s)]
*  but it's less stakes than what you're kinda talking about. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3186.88s)]
*  So I can like chill. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3189.6s)]
*  At a certain level it gets super weird. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3190.44s)]
*  Like I have friends that are really, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3192.52s)]
*  like Post Malone is really famous. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3194.24s)]
*  He changes his number all the time. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3196.08s)]
*  Really? [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3197.6s)]
*  He just has to. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3198.44s)]
*  He just has to fucking vanish. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3199.28s)]
*  I get it, I get it. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3201.56s)]
*  Everybody's trying to do something with that guy. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3203.0s)]
*  It's just like everyone's pulling at you. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3204.88s)]
*  Everybody wants something. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3207.0s)]
*  And they look at you as not just a human being [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3208.8s)]
*  but as a potential for them to step higher. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3212.52s)]
*  Dollar signs. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3214.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3215.84s)]
*  Yeah, dollar signs. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3216.68s)]
*  Success and also social success. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3217.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3219.48s)]
*  You can be seen with that person. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3220.32s)]
*  If you travel with that person, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3221.84s)]
*  you do things with that person, [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3223.52s)]
*  it elevates your social status. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3224.48s)]
*  Oh 100%. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3226.12s)]
*  You know if you're homies with Post Malone [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3227.08s)]
*  and you walk into a club like you're the fucking man. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3228.8s)]
*  You were with Post Malone. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3232.0s)]
*  I'm always like, when I'm with friends on that level, [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3233.56s)]
*  I'm so sensitive to that dynamic that I kind of go. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3236.92s)]
*  I make myself so small. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3242.3999999999996s)]
*  And it's like, there's a point of it [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3244.3199999999997s)]
*  where now my psychologist is like, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3246.72s)]
*  you got, or my psychiatrist, or psychologist, [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3248.3999999999996s)]
*  she's like, it's okay to be a little bit, [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3250.2799999999997s)]
*  you can own some of your achievements [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3252.96s)]
*  but you don't have to be, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3255.68s)]
*  because I'm like, well if I do that [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3256.92s)]
*  then I'll be an asshole. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3258.12s)]
*  It's like, no, that's not true. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3258.96s)]
*  You can still be who you are. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3262.0s)]
*  Some of your achievements are real. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3263.7999999999997s)]
*  It's like if someone wants to talk to you about music [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3265.56s)]
*  and they're saying a bunch of nonsense, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3267.84s)]
*  you're like, hey, I'm actually a musician. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3269.04s)]
*  I know, I know, I know. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3272.4s)]
*  I do love it. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3273.52s)]
*  I'm just like, cool, right. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3274.36s)]
*  No, I go, you know what? [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3276.44s)]
*  And then I kind of, what I do is I add information [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3277.64s)]
*  to kind of fill out their picture [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3280.72s)]
*  and then they'll sometimes be like, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3282.24s)]
*  oh, oh yeah, yeah, that. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3284.6s)]
*  And I'm like, well at least I'll teach you something [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3286.04s)]
*  without saying like, let me teach you something. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3287.92s)]
*  The only place I have no room for that [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3290.08s)]
*  is things that are just rock solid and concrete. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3292.12s)]
*  Like where there's no debate about these things. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3296.52s)]
*  You mean like the Earth is round? [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3298.4s)]
*  Those kind of things. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3299.72s)]
*  Those kind of things and in martial arts too. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3301.12s)]
*  So I get in martial arts conversations [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3305.44s)]
*  with people that have some ridiculous ideas [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3307.68s)]
*  and I have to say, stop, stop, stop. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3309.36s)]
*  This is, you're dealing with a very complex thing [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3312.48s)]
*  and you have very limited knowledge. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3315.56s)]
*  You're talking to an actual expert. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3317.04s)]
*  I don't like that. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3319.12s)]
*  I don't like these conversations. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3320.88s)]
*  I don't like, if you come into it with humility, [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3321.7200000000003s)]
*  but if you come in and tell me that you have [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3323.64s)]
*  this fucking thing that you figured out [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3326.04s)]
*  that no one else has figured out. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3327.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3328.88s)]
*  It's delusional vibes and that sucks. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3330.68s)]
*  Have you ever been asked to help with fight choreography [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3333.6s)]
*  and things like for films and things like that? [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3337.32s)]
*  No, no, I've been asked to do them. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3338.8s)]
*  Yeah, not interested. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3341.12s)]
*  But I don't like acting. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3341.96s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3343.32s)]
*  I don't enjoy it. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3344.16s)]
*  But even like coaching like a scene [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3345.0s)]
*  to make it look more realistic? [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3346.0s)]
*  No, no, there's guys that do that are excellent. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3347.36s)]
*  I'm not needed. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3350.6000000000004s)]
*  It's like someone who's not a comic [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3351.44s)]
*  teaching people comedy. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3353.0s)]
*  It's a very specific skill to make it look good on camera. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3354.0s)]
*  That's true. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3356.92s)]
*  It's different than actual fighting. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3357.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's angles and there's certain things like contact. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3358.6000000000004s)]
*  There's certain things you actually have to make contact [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3363.6400000000003s)]
*  with a person in order for it to be realistic. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3365.96s)]
*  So you have to be really good at that. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3368.32s)]
*  True. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3369.5200000000004s)]
*  And you have to be good at pulling shots. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3370.36s)]
*  Oh yeah, God, that's, I could imagine. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3372.0400000000004s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, you have to hit people and not hurt them. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3374.0400000000004s)]
*  And that's a real issue with like, [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3378.68s)]
*  there was always stories about certain action stars [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3381.12s)]
*  that would do fight scenes and hurt the stunt people [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3384.16s)]
*  on purpose and stunt guys would be fucking furious. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3386.6s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3389.68s)]
*  Because this guy would actually hit them on purpose [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3390.52s)]
*  and you knew he was doing it. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3392.08s)]
*  And it did make the scenes look realistic, [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3393.68s)]
*  but that was not what they had prepared. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3395.52s)]
*  Right, it's all about expectations. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3397.2799999999997s)]
*  Coopazigus is like, someone's getting free shots on you. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3398.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3401.96s)]

*  Oh, what's your book about? [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3405.0s)]
*  Sorry, I didn't jump into that. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3407.16s)]
*  I was like, I should slip that in a little bit. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3408.16s)]
*  It is about fight choreography and that's why I was, [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3409.8s)]
*  well, it took a long time, [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3411.76s)]
*  but I was steering us in that direction. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3412.72s)]

*  Oh, nice. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3419.24s)]
*  How long did it take to write that? [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3420.96s)]
*  Was that a pandemic project? [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3422.12s)]

*  That's true. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3451.24s)]
*  If someone's reading your life story [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3452.08s)]
*  with a different voice, that would suck. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3453.2s)]
*  I thought it would just be like weird, [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3455.16s)]

*  I wasn't interested in ever making a book, [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3475.7200000000003s)]
*  but then I was like, in autobiography, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3478.4s)]
*  that sounds a little bit easier [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3480.56s)]
*  because then I'm just telling stories. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3481.52s)]
*  And it's about my high school times, [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3483.36s)]
*  which as you know, the 80s were a crazy time [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3484.96s)]

*  this is how I am today. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3494.44s)]

*  I love a good autobiography. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3497.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I hope it's good. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3499.56s)]
*  A good, interesting, honest one. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3501.36s)]
*  It's fascinating to listen to how people grew up [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3503.32s)]
*  and what they think [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3505.96s)]
*  and how they developed their thought process. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3506.8s)]
*  Yeah, cause it's like, I don't know, for me, [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3510.36s)]
*  it's, I mean, if you think about like all the components, [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3512.2400000000002s)]
*  it's like, well, okay, I've got a white French mother [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3514.2400000000002s)]

*  from Cleveland, Ohio. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3519.6800000000003s)]
*  And you know, they meet in Europe. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3521.2000000000003s)]
*  We move around Europe and then I grow up [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3524.72s)]
*  in Great Falls, Montana as this biracial, [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3526.48s)]
*  weirdo kind of strange kid, you know, [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3529.52s)]
*  compared to the rest of the populace. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3533.04s)]
*  And then just navigating that, [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3534.32s)]
*  but then also getting the fortune of it being in the 80s. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3536.28s)]
*  It's, I don't know, it's like, [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3538.92s)]
*  I think like a lot of people, some people have read it, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3541.28s)]
*  some friends have read it and they're like, [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3543.48s)]
*  like Anson Mountain is reading it right now [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3546.64s)]
*  and like Anson seems like he's the captain of the enterprise. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3548.8s)]
*  He's, he's. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3552.56s)]
*  Which enterprise? [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3553.88s)]
*  The new one. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3555.36s)]
*  He's. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3556.2s)]
*  I don't even know that exists. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3557.04s)]
*  It's, sorry, Strange New Worlds, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3557.88s)]
*  Star Trek, Strange New Worlds. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3560.04s)]
*  Oh, you're a Trekkie. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3561.36s)]

*  But yes, I just, the new ones really got me [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3570.44s)]
*  because it does capture the spirit of the old, [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3573.88s)]
*  cause it's just before the original series. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3575.92s)]
*  Before? [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3580.48s)]
*  I've seen it before, so it's Captain Pike. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3581.32s)]
*  So that's Anson right there. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3582.7200000000003s)]
*  And this is on what? [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3584.4s)]

*  Paramount Plus? [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3587.36s)]
*  I think it's Paramount Plus. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3588.2000000000003s)]
*  It's good? [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3589.02s)]
*  To me, I was like worried about it [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3589.86s)]
*  cause Voyager's like. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3591.32s)]

*  Anson's like, he plays the part in this really great way. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3596.0s)]
*  Like he's like the guy that you would want to tell [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3601.28s)]
*  all your problems to, you know, on the show. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3603.1200000000003s)]
*  And he's a great actor and he's always been [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3605.44s)]
*  really cool with me, but he's done a lot of stuff. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3607.88s)]
*  But this is the one, finally this is a role that like. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3610.8s)]

*  Yeah, do they have internet? [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3620.1200000000003s)]
*  Like can they Google things? [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3621.48s)]
*  I think they, of course they have the ship's computer. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3622.5600000000004s)]
*  Right? [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3624.86s)]

*  But on this show, no, it's just like, you know. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3630.28s)]
*  Can they send emails? [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3633.1200000000003s)]
*  I think it's, I think it's, no, [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3633.96s)]
*  cause they're just like communicating. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3635.48s)]
*  Isn't it funny that they never even thought [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3636.96s)]
*  of a phone that would work from space? [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3638.4s)]
*  They thought of it as a walkie talkie. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3640.3s)]
*  Kirk out, remember that? [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3641.82s)]
*  I know, like. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3642.94s)]
*  Do do. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3643.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3644.62s)]
*  Like you had to talk and then you had to wait [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3645.44s)]
*  for the other person to talk. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3646.62s)]
*  I know. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3647.62s)]
*  Like a walkie talkie. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3648.46s)]
*  It's like hello, over. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3649.3s)]
*  Over. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3650.14s)]
*  Hello, over. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3650.96s)]
*  But I mean, it's like, what, it came up in the 60s [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3651.8s)]
*  or whatever, but the new one, actually there's a joke [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3653.26s)]
*  about it because a guy from the future comes into them [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3655.12s)]
*  and he's from the Federation, so he's got the thing [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3658.2000000000003s)]
*  that you just hit the badge. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3660.8s)]
*  And they're like, we've analyzed it. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3662.1800000000003s)]
*  And apparently it's a communicator. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3663.3s)]
*  And then Anson's character is just like, [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3664.6600000000003s)]
*  yeah, but flipping open the thing, [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3667.1s)]
*  that's the funnest part. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3669.02s)]
*  That's the best part. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3670.3s)]
*  That was like, that's true. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3671.34s)]
*  Imagine talking on a walkie talkie to your friend [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3674.74s)]
*  when she's not on ketamine. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3676.66s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3677.86s)]
*  With the rambling. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3679.18s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3680.18s)]
*  Well, you'd have to. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3681.1s)]
*  Over never comes. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3682.02s)]
*  There's just, over would never. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3683.0s)]
*  Are you kidding? [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3685.5s)]
*  You'd miss, like, I don't know how much you'd miss. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3686.9s)]
*  You'd miss a lot. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3689.38s)]
*  And if you had to tell her something like really important, [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3690.62s)]
*  there's a monster headed your way. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3692.54s)]
*  Like you wouldn't be able to get to it. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3693.68s)]
*  Could you be like, today was like, okay, I feel, [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3694.94s)]
*  I don't, maybe what's, I'm not sure if, [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3699.1s)]
*  there's a monster in your neighborhood. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3706.06s)]
*  It's like, no, there's a thing you've got to get out of there. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3710.02s)]
*  And they're just like, yeah, [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3711.78s)]
*  but all of reality is made of particles. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3712.82s)]
*  So those particles are the essence of perception. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3716.3s)]
*  I mean, God, I couldn't know. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3719.7s)]
*  I've done some functional things on K before, [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3721.58s)]
*  which were pretty surprising. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3723.9s)]
*  Functional things? [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3725.1s)]
*  Well, things that you're supposed to be functional for. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3725.94s)]
*  Like what? [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3727.62s)]
*  I think the first time I did a lozenge, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3728.46s)]
*  it was a 200 milligram lozenge, [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3730.06s)]
*  and I could have a prescription for it. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3731.58s)]
*  What is the prescription for? [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3733.82s)]
*  What does the doctor say when they write that prescription? [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3735.06s)]
*  He likes to get high. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3737.18s)]
*  It's like, he really is into, he's a psychonaut. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3738.18s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3741.3s)]
*  No, I mean, it was, it's kind of like, [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3742.14s)]
*  it's for therapeutic reasons, but you can like, [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3743.42s)]
*  it's a friend of a friend. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3746.26s)]
*  So I was like, well, let me experience this, [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3747.26s)]
*  because I want to know what this, what is this like? [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3749.7s)]
*  But I took it and I did a live stream [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3751.78s)]
*  and it was during the pandemic. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3753.62s)]
*  And I didn't know how high I was going to get, [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3754.9s)]
*  but I just set up the equipment. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3757.34s)]
*  I had to problem solve a bunch of stuff [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3759.6600000000003s)]
*  and I totally did it successfully. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3761.6600000000003s)]
*  No one knew that I was high. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3763.6600000000003s)]
*  And that's my secret, I will say. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3765.38s)]
*  It's the one strength I have on psychedelics. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3767.5s)]
*  I can always do an impression of a non-high me. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3769.26s)]
*  Unless I'd like, my eyes are crazy, [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3774.1800000000003s)]
*  but generally people are like, I didn't know you were high. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3775.82s)]
*  It's like, no, no, I was completely peaking on acid. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3777.7400000000002s)]
*  Whatever the fuck you do. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3780.1400000000003s)]
*  And they're like, that's impossible. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3781.42s)]
*  I'm like, no, it's like, [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3782.46s)]
*  it's something I actually like to practice, [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3783.7400000000002s)]
*  because it's fun. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3785.98s)]
*  Practice normalcy. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3787.54s)]
*  Yeah, like I'll do, like oftentimes my friends are like, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3788.66s)]
*  we're like all really high on K or something like that. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3791.58s)]
*  Guys, I'm gonna do an impression. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3794.06s)]
*  This is my favorite thing. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3795.54s)]
*  I'm gonna do an impression of a normal person. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3796.38s)]
*  And so I'll like get up and go like, [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3798.14s)]
*  oh man, I forgot to do this thing. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3800.3s)]
*  Oh shit, hey, when you get a chance, [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3801.5s)]
*  can you call so and so or whatever? [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3803.34s)]
*  And then like go over and like wash my hands and like, [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3804.66s)]
*  just do normal person stuff. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3807.78s)]
*  And there's something about like trying to find your center [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3809.62s)]
*  in the middle of a storm that I feel is kind of like, [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3812.7s)]
*  it's like strapping on weights on your ankle [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3816.82s)]
*  or wearing a weighted vest in training. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3818.1800000000003s)]
*  It's like, it's a way of like kind of challenging yourself [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3820.58s)]
*  to the point at which you hopefully make a goal [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3824.54s)]
*  by like achieving something. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3828.02s)]
*  But I don't know, that's a little too weird. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3830.94s)]
*  Well, it's also you're comfortable with that state. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3833.3s)]
*  You know, for someone who's never experienced [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3836.26s)]
*  that state before, it becomes overwhelming. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3837.86s)]
*  And then you kind of like give into the anxiety, [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3840.26s)]
*  the moment in your, [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3842.7400000000002s)]
*  you know, you're thinking about bad trips, right? [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3844.42s)]
*  A lot of it is people fighting it, [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3845.82s)]
*  struggling with the trip and not wanting to accept it, [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3848.0600000000004s)]
*  not wanting to let go and give in. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3851.2200000000003s)]
*  Totally. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3853.0600000000004s)]
*  It's a big factor. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3853.9s)]
*  Totally, I mean, I get it. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3854.94s)]
*  And that's why generally it's hard for me [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3856.1800000000003s)]
*  to find people that are just down. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3858.5400000000004s)]
*  You know, like if I'm like, hey, do you wanna do, [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3859.98s)]
*  whenever I see Ketamine, it feels like it's, [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3862.0600000000004s)]
*  I'm saying like the heaviest thing in the world [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3863.5400000000004s)]
*  because either people are like, [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3865.42s)]
*  it's horse tranquilizers, it's K-hole, [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3867.34s)]
*  which is thought of as negative, [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3871.0600000000004s)]
*  or they're thinking of like party vibes. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3873.34s)]
*  Like we're just like doing bumps and you're like, [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3875.26s)]
*  oh, I'm dancing, here's a bump and bump. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3876.78s)]
*  It's like generally when I do K, [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3878.34s)]
*  if I can do K, like I wanna be in there. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3879.98s)]
*  I wanna like get in there. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3883.7400000000002s)]
*  And so when people come around, [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3884.98s)]
*  they're like, that's all I know about it. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3886.5s)]
*  I'm like, you know what, come over to my house. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3888.1800000000003s)]
*  I don't know how many people have come, [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3889.82s)]
*  I should be a coach or something. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3890.6600000000003s)]
*  People come over to my house all the time [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3892.26s)]
*  and they're like, I don't know, man. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3893.58s)]
*  I don't know, I'm like, trust me, [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3895.3s)]
*  I'm really good at dosing, that's always my line. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3896.7400000000002s)]
*  But it's true, people will be like, [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3899.1400000000003s)]
*  oh, it was just like you said, that was great. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3900.26s)]
*  I was like, I guarantee you, [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3902.02s)]
*  you'll ask me for another bump. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3902.86s)]
*  And they'll be like, no, there's no way. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3904.5s)]
*  And then like, oh, can I have another bump? [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3905.9s)]
*  I was like, I told you, it's a great, [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3907.54s)]
*  it's all about set and setting and I like to have fun. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3909.38s)]
*  So, but anyways. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3912.2599999999998s)]
*  Someone went into a K-hole at my club the other night. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3914.14s)]
*  No. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3916.18s)]
*  Yeah, some lady was like. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3917.02s)]
*  No. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3918.86s)]
*  In the audience? [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3919.9s)]
*  Yeah, her boyfriend was like, [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3920.74s)]
*  oh, he's doing ketamine. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3921.58s)]
*  Yeah, they had to get her assistance. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3922.42s)]
*  The good thing is it's over in 20 minutes. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3924.62s)]
*  There's a lot of that out here. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3926.1s)]
*  A lot of people are doing the nasal spray. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3927.5s)]
*  That's what I heard, the nasal spray thing. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3929.46s)]
*  Yeah, I. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3931.14s)]
*  Recreationally. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3932.38s)]
*  And I heard it was like kind of, [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3933.38s)]
*  your engineer was saying that it was like [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3935.94s)]
*  kind of a tech bro thing, which I'm like, well. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3937.66s)]
*  I would call Jamie a producer, rather than an engineer. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3941.58s)]
*  Okay, I apologize. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3943.46s)]
*  I was trained an engineer, but I produce now. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3944.94s)]
*  Okay, okay, gotcha. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3947.42s)]
*  Got you, gotcha. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3949.18s)]
*  Yeah, it's a tricky one, K, [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3951.18s)]
*  because just the connotations, the negative connotations. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3953.14s)]
*  Yeah, and also where people do it. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3956.42s)]
*  It's like, don't do it at a comedy club. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3957.94s)]
*  It's like, why would you. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3959.9s)]
*  Don't do that much. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3961.06s)]
*  Or do, yeah. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3961.98s)]
*  The thing about those nasal sprays is [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3962.82s)]
*  no one can stop you from just fucking [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3964.2200000000003s)]
*  keep hammering that thing. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3966.7400000000002s)]
*  It's too convenient. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3968.38s)]
*  Next thing you know, your hand has a metallic claw [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3970.1s)]
*  and you're in another dimension, you keep plumping it. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3972.5s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3974.94s)]
*  Man, the safety, there's nothing that feels more unsafe [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3976.1800000000003s)]
*  than when you're like really high on K [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3979.7000000000003s)]
*  and you're in an extremely public place. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3981.98s)]
*  It is, it's quite the challenge. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3984.34s)]
*  Usually I just tell people, I just tell them, [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3987.54s)]
*  just so they know, they're like, hey man. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3990.54s)]
*  I'm like, I'm really high right now on K [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3992.2599999999998s)]
*  and usually people are like, oh, okay, all right. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3994.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I've never done it like that. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3997.8999999999996s)]
*  I've only tried it a little bit. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=3999.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4000.98s)]
*  I've tried the therapeutic dose. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4002.22s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4004.18s)]
*  I was like, oh, that's kind of interesting. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4005.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4005.8599999999997s)]
*  But too many people I know are too into it [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4006.7s)]
*  and I'm like, that just seems. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4008.18s)]
*  Fraud with peril. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4009.66s)]
*  Yeah, there's definitely addiction problems. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4010.9399999999996s)]
*  I tend to not have issues with that, I'm saying that. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4013.58s)]
*  I'm addicted to food, but I'm not. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4019.34s)]
*  If I go on a tour and I don't have access to anything [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4022.62s)]
*  that I normally have access, because I don't drink, [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4025.1s)]
*  I just basically do these feel-frees [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4026.98s)]
*  and weed is definitely my constant, especially edibles, [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4029.7s)]
*  and then K, that's kind of it at this point in my life. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4034.5s)]
*  But if I go on tour and I don't have access to any of that, [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4037.9s)]
*  I don't really notice. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4039.94s)]
*  Could be weeks and I'm like, I don't know. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4041.98s)]
*  That's fortunate. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4043.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I feel very fortunate. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4044.9s)]
*  That means you're not using it to cover something up. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4045.74s)]
*  Probably. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4049.1800000000003s)]
*  You're not using it to hide. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4050.02s)]
*  No. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4050.86s)]
*  You're using it to experience. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4051.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I wanna explore. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4052.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4054.26s)]
*  And there's nothing, I've had crazy shit happen [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4055.1s)]
*  where I was at a cool party and this person [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4057.82s)]
*  had converted a room to make it look like the rainforest, [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4062.06s)]
*  like a Brazilian rainforest, [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4065.2200000000003s)]
*  and it had Dolby 5.1 storm sounds and associated lighting. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4066.86s)]
*  The lighting would change and stuff like that. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4071.1400000000003s)]
*  And so in this dope room, [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4072.7400000000002s)]
*  and there's people on all kinds of things, [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4074.1s)]
*  but I was really high. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4076.86s)]
*  I had a couple bumps and then I had a 200 milligram lozenge [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4078.46s)]
*  and I was with a friend of mine, Mason. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4082.06s)]
*  And I sat cross-legged and I put my hands like this [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4083.7400000000002s)]
*  and I became a statue. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4087.6200000000003s)]
*  I just froze. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4089.7000000000003s)]
*  When you're saying bumps, are you saying you're sniffing it? [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4090.54s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, sniffing it, yeah. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4092.58s)]
*  So yeah, so just a couple, three bumps or whatever. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4094.06s)]
*  Whatever Coke, the Coke variant, if you know Coke, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4098.74s)]
*  what a bump is, it's about the same for Kenmean. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4101.66s)]
*  But I had one of those and we had the lozenge kicked in [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4104.3s)]
*  and we went deep into a K-hole. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4106.38s)]
*  Interesting thing was there was a guy, [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4109.9400000000005s)]
*  he's probably like 20 feet away. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4112.900000000001s)]
*  There's people talking all over the place, [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4115.06s)]
*  storm systems, all this stuff. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4116.7s)]
*  I hear this little voice through the storm [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4118.1s)]
*  in the distance going like, hey, if anybody's out there, [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4121.18s)]
*  I'm having a crazy trip right now. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4125.42s)]
*  And I responded, I'm pretty sure this is real. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4127.1s)]
*  I responded in the quietest voice. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4130.22s)]
*  I was like, no, I can totally hear you. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4131.9800000000005s)]
*  What's going on? [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4133.7s)]
*  We started having a conversation back and forth. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4134.62s)]
*  And Mason can attest to it, because he heard me talking. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4137.54s)]
*  He's like, who were you talking to? [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4139.74s)]
*  I was like, I was talking to that guy over there. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4141.3s)]
*  And it was a real conversation. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4143.58s)]
*  I was like, how is this possible? [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4145.5s)]
*  How can I be having this super quiet conversation, [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4146.94s)]
*  it's almost like quantum tunneling or something like that, [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4150.38s)]
*  with this person? [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4152.9s)]
*  And that's happened more than once. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4154.18s)]
*  And where it's almost, I don't wanna say telepathy. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4157.38s)]
*  That's not telepathy, but I think that it is possible. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4160.46s)]
*  They are producing sound, [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4164.18s)]
*  but maybe the brain is able to completely, [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4165.38s)]
*  like noise canceling, just take out all of the noise [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4169.3s)]
*  and focus on that voice. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4172.5s)]
*  I've had weird telepathic stuff on it. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4174.34s)]
*  That's why I'm interested in doing more research [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4176.3s)]
*  in different states and seeing what results [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4178.62s)]
*  computer produced. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4181.3s)]
*  You know when they first discovered Harmin, [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4182.14s)]
*  they tried to call it telepathyne? [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4183.94s)]
*  Really? [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4187.78s)]
*  What is that? [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4188.62s)]
*  Well, Harmin is a MOA inhibitor [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4189.5s)]
*  that's a part of ayahuasca and many other. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4192.38s)]
*  There was one that we talked about yesterday [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4196.82s)]
*  that Brian Murorescu brought up that was, [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4198.74s)]
*  it was Harmin, what was it with Jamie? [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4202.58s)]
*  It was a lotus flower, right? [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4205.66s)]
*  That's what it was, right? [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4208.02s)]
*  That the ancient Egyptians used. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4209.82s)]
*  It's an MAO inhibitor. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4212.22s)]
*  So it stops monoamine oxidase in the gut. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4213.38s)]
*  That's what makes dimethyltryptamine orally active. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4219.22s)]
*  Oh, right. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4222.74s)]
*  So Harmin, when they first experienced these altered states, [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4223.58s)]
*  they were trying to isolate the compounds [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4229.08s)]
*  that were responsible for it. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4231.28s)]
*  One of them they decided was causing [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4232.9800000000005s)]
*  these telepathic experiences. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4235.78s)]
*  So they tried to call it telepathyne. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4238.46s)]
*  But because of scientific nomenclature, [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4240.62s)]
*  that had already been discovered as Harmin. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4242.82s)]
*  So it had already been labeled as Harmin. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4245.74s)]
*  So they kept it as Harmin. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4247.22s)]
*  But for a while they were calling it telepathyne. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4248.780000000001s)]
*  Because the people that were experiencing that [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4251.860000000001s)]
*  were having these communications without words. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4254.06s)]
*  And they were experiencing things in unison together. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4257.62s)]
*  They were experiencing these visions [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4261.9400000000005s)]
*  that they felt like they were communicating with each other [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4265.1s)]
*  through this vision without talking. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4267.780000000001s)]
*  I mean, I completely believe it. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4270.820000000001s)]
*  I mean, I've had too many incredible experiences [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4272.6s)]
*  on those types of, especially dissociatives. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4276.4s)]
*  I mean, this is a different substance [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4279.679999999999s)]
*  that we're talking about. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4281.28s)]
*  But I've had experiences where you're, [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4282.099999999999s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4284.48s)]
*  I've done crazy stuff where I don't have the greatest knees. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4286.0599999999995s)]
*  And so I'm always careful of it. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4288.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm on ketamine and suddenly I'm on the ground [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4291.92s)]
*  doing that duck walk or whatever, no problem. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4294.5199999999995s)]
*  You don't have the greatest knees in what way? [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4297.5599999999995s)]
*  Just not hot. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4300.16s)]
*  No, they're like hot knees guys. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4301.16s)]
*  They're not sexy enough. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4304.16s)]
*  They're not sexy enough. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4305.0s)]
*  Maybe get them tattooed. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4306.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4306.84s)]
*  I'll just get a huge band around each one. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4307.68s)]
*  No, it's just like. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4310.12s)]
*  Sun on each one of them or something. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4310.96s)]
*  I have low cartilage on the back of each kneecap. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4312.24s)]
*  So there's rub. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4316.28s)]
*  I think it's just genetic. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4318.08s)]
*  Like just a genetic thing that happened. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4319.32s)]
*  I also am knock kneed. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4321.8s)]
*  So I was born with not the greatest knees and then feet. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4323.0s)]
*  How does that work? [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4328.400000000001s)]
*  So knock knee, it's like your kind of. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4329.4400000000005s)]
*  Your knees go in. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4331.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's like. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4332.28s)]
*  You know, there's a physical therapist [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4333.1s)]
*  that can correct that with exercises. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4334.72s)]
*  Yeah, well the shape of the. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4336.84s)]
*  I mean really the best thing for it if I was a kid [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4339.52s)]
*  and maybe now too is riding horses. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4342.84s)]
*  Riding horses, interesting. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4345.2s)]
*  Well you know how they always say cowboys are bow legged [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4346.56s)]
*  because they're always in the stirrups [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4349.8s)]
*  and they're around. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4351.360000000001s)]
*  And so it makes their legs go out. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4353.2s)]
*  So when I was a kid they were like if you ride horses [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4354.860000000001s)]
*  you can correct your knock kneedness. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4356.88s)]
*  Could you correct your knock kneedness with like a machine? [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4359.360000000001s)]
*  Like one of those abductor, adductor machines? [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4362.44s)]
*  I tried that for a while. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4365.12s)]
*  I don't think it's strong. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4366.44s)]
*  It's like no matter how strong your muscles get [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4367.36s)]
*  like that's such a structural thing to actually change. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4369.5599999999995s)]
*  You should talk to somebody that's an expert in that. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4373.24s)]
*  I would. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4374.96s)]
*  There's some people that have said that like [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4376.259999999999s)]
*  pigeon toed people that you can unlearn that. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4378.12s)]
*  For sure. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4380.96s)]
*  Pigeon toed is like that's a little bit more correctable [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4381.78s)]
*  for sure because that's orientation. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4384.839999999999s)]
*  That's like a conscious orientation [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4386.92s)]
*  strengthening the right muscles. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4388.48s)]
*  I think with the knee. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4389.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't know, the knees just feel more like [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4390.839999999999s)]
*  it's like a joint. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4393.16s)]
*  It's like if you had a joint and you bent it [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4394.0s)]
*  it's like the joints bent but now you gotta bend it back. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4395.24s)]
*  Right but what are you doing to fix that [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4398.36s)]
*  is what I'm asking. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4400.24s)]
*  I'm just complaining. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4401.08s)]
*  No I, not a lot other than trying to make sure [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4403.88s)]
*  that my feet are in line. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4409.92s)]
*  Oh I'm doing a lot of Asian squats. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4412.48s)]
*  So I'll sit or like a deep squat. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4416.3s)]
*  Like when you sit really deep in a squat. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4418.4s)]
*  So I'll do that for about two minutes [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4421.1s)]
*  and I do it randomly. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4422.64s)]
*  I'll be at a grocery store waiting in line [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4424.14s)]
*  and I'll just like get down and that helps my knees. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4425.740000000001s)]
*  It feels pretty good. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4428.9800000000005s)]
*  It feels like it's kind of aligning something [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4430.14s)]
*  the more I do that. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4432.02s)]
*  But. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4433.3s)]
*  You should probably do Hindu squats. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4434.14s)]
*  Do you know what Hindu squats are? [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4436.34s)]
*  It's a great way to develop your leg muscles [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4437.54s)]
*  and strengthen your knees. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4440.22s)]
*  It's a squat where when you go, [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4441.820000000001s)]
*  it's an air squat, you just do it with your body weight. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4443.9400000000005s)]
*  When you go down you put your hands behind you [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4446.14s)]
*  and you raise your heels up off the ground. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4449.7s)]
*  You touch your fingertips to the ground [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4452.42s)]
*  and then as you go up your feet go down [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4456.139999999999s)]
*  and you raise your arms in front of you. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4458.679999999999s)]
*  And so you breathe in like this. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4460.62s)]
*  Like that. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4463.94s)]
*  I do those. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4464.78s)]
*  See those? [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4465.62s)]
*  Oh that's sick. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4466.44s)]
*  Those are phenomenal. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4467.28s)]
*  Wow. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4468.099999999999s)]
*  I do 100 of those every day. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4468.94s)]
*  Wow. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4470.42s)]
*  Now that's something I'm gonna do [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4471.74s)]
*  because as I grow older, [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4472.7s)]
*  my whole thing is mobility and strength. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4476.72s)]
*  And so yeah. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4480.14s)]
*  I do those and I also like to do it on a slant board. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4482.1s)]
*  A slant board is nice too. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4485.58s)]
*  So which direction? [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4486.900000000001s)]
*  It forces your heels up at a 45 degree angle. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4488.5s)]
*  And then because of that, [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4493.740000000001s)]
*  it really strengthens the muscles [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4495.62s)]
*  that are supportive muscles of your knee. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4498.38s)]
*  And it's a really good exercise for knee strengthening. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4501.46s)]
*  I do a lot of knee strengthening stuff. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4505.18s)]
*  A lot of it. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4507.740000000001s)]
*  I do that every day because I've had three knee surgeries [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4508.9s)]
*  and I've done martial arts since I was a little kid. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4511.14s)]
*  So I have a bunch of knee issues. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4513.14s)]
*  I got you. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4515.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4516.1s)]
*  I will try any of that. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4516.94s)]
*  Yeah, you have to do something. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4518.94s)]
*  I can help you. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4520.14s)]
*  I would love that. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4520.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4521.8s)]
*  There's a great guy out there. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4522.64s)]
*  So he's got an Instagram page called Knees Over Toes Guy. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4523.46s)]
*  And he takes people from step one [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4526.34s)]
*  with very little knee stability and strength. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4530.26s)]
*  And he's got a multi-stage program [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4532.38s)]
*  where you slowly keep adding more exercises, [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4534.94s)]
*  adding more resistance, [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4539.179999999999s)]
*  and strengthen the structure around your knee. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4540.46s)]
*  Because a lot of the problems that people have [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4542.46s)]
*  is the knee is not supported well by the musculature, [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4544.78s)]
*  by your tendons and ligaments and muscles. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4548.58s)]
*  It's not supported well. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4550.7s)]
*  It's not strong enough. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4552.099999999999s)]
*  So it's unstable. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4553.219999999999s)]
*  And so it twists and moves. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4554.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4555.94s)]
*  And there's a lot of injuries that people have [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4556.9s)]
*  specifically because of that. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4558.98s)]
*  I've made my knees much stronger [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4560.74s)]
*  since I've started this program. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4563.04s)]
*  Man, I gotta do that. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4565.3s)]
*  That's probably the area that I think about the most. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4566.7s)]
*  I don't have a flexibility. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4569.74s)]
*  I have pretty good flexibility. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4570.9s)]
*  All this stuff is good in mobility. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4572.5s)]
*  I can still have a lot of mobility. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4575.66s)]
*  My knees have always been the thing. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4578.58s)]
*  But the last time, really why I stopped working out, [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4580.099999999999s)]
*  I was training all the time. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4582.42s)]
*  Yeah, you were getting jacked. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4584.26s)]
*  I was getting pretty jacked. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4585.14s)]
*  I need to get re-jacked. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4585.98s)]
*  But I was doing a leg press, [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4587.0199999999995s)]
*  and I think my feet were a little bit too low on the plate. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4591.72s)]
*  So I put too much pressure on my right knee. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4594.92s)]
*  It wasn't like a major or anything like that, [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4599.400000000001s)]
*  but it didn't quite feel right after a certain press. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4602.4800000000005s)]
*  I would not recommend leg presses. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4606.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, like what? [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4608.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, if you're a bodybuilder. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4609.68s)]
*  And leg extensions, those are bad too. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4611.08s)]
*  Well, they're not necessarily bad. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4612.92s)]
*  But there's ways to strengthen your knees [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4615.42s)]
*  that aren't so problematic. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4619.04s)]
*  I don't lift heavy weights. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4621.6s)]
*  Nothing I lift is heavy. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4623.4400000000005s)]
*  High reps? [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4624.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, the heaviest weight I lift is 70 pounds. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4625.1s)]
*  It's kettlebells. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4628.320000000001s)]
*  I just do a 70 pound kettlebell. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4629.160000000001s)]
*  It's the heaviest thing I pick up, [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4630.88s)]
*  other than my own body weight. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4632.0s)]
*  But the vast majority of the stuff that I do is body weight. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4633.6s)]
*  And you can do some pretty extensive. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4636.400000000001s)]
*  You can do a lot. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4638.52s)]
*  You can do a lot. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4639.360000000001s)]
*  And you can really strengthen your legs [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4640.200000000001s)]
*  with body weight exercises. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4641.92s)]
*  But I also do lunges with dumbbells and things like that. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4643.360000000001s)]
*  I do a lot of different things. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4646.0s)]
*  But leg presses, there's so many videos of people [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4647.2s)]
*  hyper-extending their leg the wrong way, [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4652.16s)]
*  where they're ego lifting. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4654.04s)]
*  And they have a giant stack. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4655.5599999999995s)]
*  And then they lock their legs out. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4657.2s)]
*  And it pops back that way. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4658.639999999999s)]
*  And they're screaming in agony. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4659.76s)]
*  That hurts. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4661.08s)]
*  And their knee is destroyed. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4661.4s)]
*  I've seen so many of those online. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4662.76s)]
*  Something about my Instagram search algorithm is horrific. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4667.04s)]
*  This keeps reminding you. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4670.0s)]
*  It's like, remember this. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4671.16s)]
*  I've seen so many of those gym fail things, [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4672.599999999999s)]
*  where people are squatting too much, [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4674.639999999999s)]
*  their legs explode. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4676.04s)]
*  I can't do that. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4678.12s)]
*  You're not trying to be a bodybuilder. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4679.12s)]
*  So get off those things. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4680.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4681.84s)]
*  For me, at this point, I wanted to get Jack specifically [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4682.5199999999995s)]
*  for a thing I was doing. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4685.44s)]
*  But now I'm more about, I just want [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4686.4s)]
*  to become mobile and strong. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4689.0s)]
*  And that's it. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4692.28s)]
*  And however that looks, that's how it looks. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4693.56s)]
*  That's all I do. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4696.56s)]
*  I don't do anything for aesthetics. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4697.96s)]
*  Not one single thing. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4700.04s)]
*  So it's all functional. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4701.16s)]
*  All of it's functional. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4702.16s)]
*  And all of it is, it's either bodyweight exercises, [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4703.6s)]
*  like chin-ups, dips, push-ups, bodyweight squats, pull-ups. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4707.120000000001s)]
*  It's either those things or it's kettlebells. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4712.280000000001s)]
*  So all those things, they make you use your body as one thing. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4715.360000000001s)]
*  Your body has to, it's not an isolation exercise, which is, [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4720.92s)]
*  yeah, I just don't think that's not, it's not for me. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4725.72s)]
*  I want something that helps my body do martial arts better, [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4729.64s)]
*  helps my body function better. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4732.28s)]
*  I don't fuck around with any, I mean, [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4734.759999999999s)]
*  I'm not shitting on them. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4737.639999999999s)]
*  If you want to get bigger and you [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4738.679999999999s)]
*  want to look like a bodybuilder, yeah, [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4739.84s)]
*  there's a real clear way to do it. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4741.48s)]
*  Those guys do it. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4743.04s)]
*  But that's not what I'm interested in. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4743.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no, I get that. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4745.32s)]
*  Well, yeah, it's my next phase. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4747.0s)]
*  I'm kind of moving into that. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4748.48s)]
*  Because last year, when my mother died and all [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4749.759999999999s)]
*  the post-pandemic, I just had a lot of stuff. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4753.0s)]
*  And it's like, and that injury happened. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4756.759999999999s)]
*  I was like, oh, man. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4758.44s)]
*  And so I got kind of just pudgy. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4759.72s)]
*  And now I feel like probably the weakest [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4762.400000000001s)]
*  I've felt in a long time. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4764.240000000001s)]
*  Get a trainer. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4765.56s)]
*  Did you have a trainer before? [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4766.280000000001s)]
*  I did, but it was so expensive. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4767.4400000000005s)]
*  And now that I'm done with the Late Late Show, [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4769.12s)]
*  I have to watch my money a little bit [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4771.12s)]
*  until the next thing comes along. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4772.76s)]
*  But I mean, I'm doing fine, but I do have to. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4774.240000000001s)]
*  But that's actually, I don't know, [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4777.4400000000005s)]
*  it'd almost be worth going bankrupt for that. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4779.200000000001s)]
*  Because it's like, I'd rather be, I want my health. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4782.68s)]
*  My health is the important thing for me in my life. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4785.4800000000005s)]
*  And I started working with these guys called BioCoach. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4788.04s)]
*  I don't know if you've heard of those guys, BioCoach. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4791.92s)]
*  So they deal with metabolic health. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4793.96s)]
*  And so I was working with them. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4795.76s)]
*  They've given me a couple free months about it. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4797.24s)]
*  But the biggest thing really is about, [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4799.44s)]
*  I get one of these CGMs, continuous glucose monitor, [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4801.44s)]
*  and keep my glucose levels in a certain level. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4805.16s)]
*  And that's helped my energy a lot. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4808.16s)]
*  So I'm not doing any sugar and bread and stuff like that. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4809.92s)]
*  Oh, there you go. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4812.88s)]
*  That's step one for everybody. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4814.0s)]
*  Huge. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4815.4s)]
*  And the inflammation in my knees have gone down. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4816.0s)]
*  Of course. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4817.96s)]
*  Those things cause inflammation. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4819.0s)]
*  I know. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4820.44s)]
*  It's crazy to me. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4820.92s)]
*  And I know that some people are like, I got to have my sugar. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4823.04s)]
*  But you don't. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4827.0s)]
*  You don't. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4827.96s)]
*  And you can once in a while. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4828.8s)]
*  It's fine. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4830.24s)]
*  But get the motor running. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4830.88s)]
*  I give myself a day, maybe once a week or every two weeks, [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4832.8s)]
*  where I just eat some bullshit. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4836.24s)]
*  And I always go, oh, that wasn't worth it. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4837.96s)]
*  That was not worth it. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4840.08s)]
*  But I give myself that day if I feel tired. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4841.52s)]
*  I like to do it late night if I come home from the club. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4844.32s)]
*  And it's like 1 o'clock in the morning, I'm hungry. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4847.48s)]
*  I'm like, fuck it. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4849.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4850.48s)]
*  Going to work out in the morning. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4850.879999999999s)]
*  Yep. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4851.799999999999s)]
*  Fuck around. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4852.28s)]
*  I'm always feeling, ugh, afterwards. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4852.919999999999s)]
*  But it never feels great. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4855.24s)]
*  I give myself a little mouth pleasure. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4857.04s)]
*  I mean, I give myself a little fun. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4858.599999999999s)]
*  You got to do what you got to do. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4860.639999999999s)]
*  A little cake, a little cookie. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4862.2s)]
*  A little something. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4863.639999999999s)]
*  A little cookie. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4864.5199999999995s)]
*  It's now when I see when you've been on that for a while, [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4865.599999999999s)]
*  when you haven't been basically keto. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4868.2s)]
*  But when you've been doing that a while, [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4870.719999999999s)]
*  now when I see a snack tray or I'm backstage [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4873.24s)]
*  and there's all these chips and stuff like that, [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4876.68s)]
*  I'm not even remotely interested in it. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4878.72s)]
*  That's great. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4881.04s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4881.8s)]
*  That's also your gut biome. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4882.400000000001s)]
*  Your gut biome. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4883.64s)]
*  If you eat a lot of sugar, you're eating a lot of carbs, [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4884.6s)]
*  your body wants that. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4888.400000000001s)]
*  Give me some of that stuff. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4889.8s)]
*  I know. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4890.92s)]
*  It becomes a parasite. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4892.240000000001s)]
*  It's a parasitic thinking. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4893.08s)]
*  And that's what I noticed for me when I'd be at home. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4894.400000000001s)]
*  Now what I need to do is I need to get out of my, [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4897.52s)]
*  I should work out. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4900.16s)]
*  And then I go on the phone. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4900.92s)]
*  And it's like, oh, it's too late to work out now [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4902.92s)]
*  because I got this thing. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4904.76s)]
*  So I guess I better just do the thing. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4905.68s)]
*  I'll work out later. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4906.88s)]
*  It never happens. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4907.72s)]
*  But the one thing I will say that's really helped me [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4908.96s)]
*  is dancing. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4910.96s)]
*  Well, that's working out. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4913.12s)]
*  That's my like, because I love to dance. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4914.8s)]
*  You know, Dance Dance Revolution made a lot of people [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4917.200000000001s)]
*  lose weight. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4919.280000000001s)]
*  That's right, right? [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4920.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4921.16s)]
*  A lot of people lost weight. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4921.68s)]
*  A lot of people lost weight because it's a game. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4923.0s)]
*  You're playing a fun game that you get addicted to that [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4925.320000000001s)]
*  actually makes you move your body and burn a lot of calories. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4927.8s)]
*  Man, I love it. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4930.84s)]
*  Because isolated workouts, it's cool. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4932.200000000001s)]
*  I can do treadmill. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4933.92s)]
*  I can walk for an hour and just like 10% incline, whatever, [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4935.599999999999s)]
*  three miles per hour. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4939.5599999999995s)]
*  I'll just like watch stuff on YouTube. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4940.92s)]
*  And I don't even notice. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4943.08s)]
*  And I feel great. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4944.44s)]
*  I feel so good. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4945.36s)]
*  And like walking a lot is great. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4946.48s)]
*  But my ultimate, if I'm going to do an isolated, is hiking. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4947.8s)]
*  Oh, hiking's great. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4952.36s)]
*  Steep grade hiking. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4953.16s)]
*  I don't know what happens to my brain. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4954.679999999999s)]
*  But I'm just like, hey. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4956.24s)]
*  I'm just like, I got to get up that hill. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4957.36s)]
*  It's natural. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4959.72s)]
*  Something. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4960.36s)]
*  Well, it's natural for human beings. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4961.599999999999s)]
*  It's a natural thing to do. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4963.44s)]
*  And also you're outside, hopefully of good scenery. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4965.32s)]
*  It's nice. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4969.2s)]
*  It fulfills you in all sorts of different ways. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4969.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4972.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4973.36s)]
*  Right now in my life, I'm like, OK, post-Late Late Show, [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4974.28s)]
*  what do I got going on? [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4977.4800000000005s)]
*  I got this book. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4978.8s)]
*  I got some other things in the works, [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4979.72s)]
*  some other things I'm pitching. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4982.92s)]
*  But mostly, I'm just about, I want [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4984.24s)]
*  to do the stuff that I want to do and feel good about it. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4986.52s)]
*  Enjoy your life. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4989.52s)]
*  I'm going to enjoy my life. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4990.28s)]
*  I'm going to Berlin for a couple months just to go there [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4991.36s)]
*  and produce music. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4994.28s)]
*  And Porsche always hooks me up with a car when I'm there [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4995.84s)]
*  and drive the Autobahn. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=4998.92s)]
*  I just did my first track day. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5000.88s)]
*  Did you? [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5002.36s)]

*  Oh my god. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5005.0s)]
*  It was amazing. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5005.5199999999995s)]
*  What were you in? [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5006.12s)]
*  I was in my cars. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5007.12s)]
*  So I was in, I took my Ford. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5008.36s)]
*  You just brought all of them? [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5009.88s)]
*  No, I brought two of them. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5010.96s)]
*  I brought my Ford GT. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5012.16s)]
*  And I brought my GT3 RS. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5013.88s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5015.88s)]
*  You have a GT3 RS? [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5016.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5018.08s)]
*  I have a 2007 manual Shark Works car. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5018.599999999999s)]
*  It's so fast and so light. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5023.12s)]
*  That one was hard to handle. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5024.72s)]
*  That one, like, boy, you really feel [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5026.12s)]
*  the difference between the. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5027.76s)]
*  Even with all that downforce? [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5028.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5029.88s)]
*  Well, the 2007s don't have the same kind [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5031.12s)]
*  of downforce as the 2023. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5033.5199999999995s)]
*  2023 has this massive wing, this insane downforce. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5035.12s)]
*  And it's an incredible car. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5038.4s)]
*  I did drive a modern 2023 GT3 around the track [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5039.76s)]
*  as well that they had there. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5044.32s)]
*  Oh, how was that? [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5045.4s)]
*  Much easier to handle than my car. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5046.08s)]
*  My car is a wild bitch. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5048.2s)]
*  It's so light. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5051.0s)]
*  It doesn't have any nanny stuff to it. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5052.28s)]
*  There's no traction control, no nothing. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5054.24s)]
*  It's a car. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5055.96s)]
*  It's a full-on track car that you could drive in the street. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5056.52s)]
*  It's really fun. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5059.02s)]
*  But god, the Ford GT was magic. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5059.68s)]
*  I have a 2005 Ford GT. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5061.96s)]
*  And that thing is incredible. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5064.44s)]
*  It just hugs the road. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5065.8s)]
*  It wants you to bend into the corners. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5068.08s)]
*  It's got massive tires and a giant engine right behind you [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5070.64s)]
*  that's supercharged. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5074.44s)]
*  It sounds incredible. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5076.12s)]
*  Low, wide. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5077.52s)]
*  Low and wide. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5078.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5079.76s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5080.44s)]
*  Man, I'm telling you. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5081.639999999999s)]
*  You know what the 2005s look like, right? [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5082.48s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5084.28s)]
*  When did the new GTs come out? [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5086.24s)]
*  What was the first model years, 2003 or something? [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5088.24s)]
*  Well, the first one was the GT40 that was a car that they used. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5090.24s)]
*  That's that movie, Ferrari versus Ford. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5093.839999999999s)]
*  Oh, wait. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5096.5599999999995s)]
*  But that was the one that had the bubble top, right, [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5097.04s)]
*  when it went in the race for that guy's head or whatever? [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5099.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5101.48s)]
*  Something bubble. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5101.98s)]
*  I'll send this to Jamie so you can see mine. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5102.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5105.04s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5105.639999999999s)]
*  I want to see yours. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5106.139999999999s)]
*  The one that I had, they came out with it again [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5108.32s)]
*  in the early 2000s, I think 2004 or 2005. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5110.76s)]
*  And then there was a new one that they just came out with. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5114.36s)]
*  That's just all paddle shifts. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5117.04s)]
*  Mine's a manual. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5118.4s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5119.5599999999995s)]
*  OK. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5120.24s)]
*  Mine is still a manual. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5121.08s)]
*  But going around a track with an instructor, [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5122.12s)]
*  you realize why a paddle shifter is the way to go. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5124.92s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5127.679999999999s)]
*  On the street, that's my car. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5128.48s)]
*  Oh, it's gorgeous, man. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5130.5599999999995s)]
*  Look at that fucking thing. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5131.92s)]
*  Spiders. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5133.16s)]
*  Nice. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5134.04s)]
*  That is a clean machine. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5134.76s)]
*  It's so low and so wide, and it handles so well. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5138.16s)]
*  When you're going around the corner, [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5142.56s)]
*  it feels like this is what I want to do. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5145.4400000000005s)]
*  It tells you, yes, this is what we like. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5147.68s)]
*  Plus, it's got that 60s vibe to it that's pretty sweet. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5150.12s)]
*  It's such a good looking car. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5153.68s)]
*  I am so stoked on it, because I have a Porsche Taycan Turbo S. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5156.04s)]
*  And I have a [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5161.6s)]
*  That thing's amazing. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5162.320000000001s)]
*  That thing is. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5163.360000000001s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5165.0s)]
*  I mean, there's faster cars. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5167.08s)]
*  You got the plaid. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5168.2s)]
*  You got the fucking [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5169.0s)]
*  Barely faster. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5169.92s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5171.2s)]
*  If you find out that it's faster, [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5171.76s)]
*  you're a fucking asshole. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5172.96s)]
*  I know. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5174.08s)]
*  You have to be so crazy to take that Taycan Turbo S [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5174.76s)]
*  and try to compare it. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5177.88s)]
*  I just remember going up the Angeles National [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5180.04s)]
*  Force, whatever that is, Angeles Crest. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5184.48s)]
*  So going up to the crest, because there's [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5186.2s)]
*  that Friday meetup that happens, was it [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5188.12s)]
*  Good Vibes Breakfast Club? [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5189.92s)]
*  Jay Ryan and his wife, they started it. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5192.04s)]
*  So we always meet up there every Friday morning. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5195.88s)]
*  And that drive up there, especially [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5198.24s)]
*  if there's no one ahead of you, and you get those nice, long [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5200.24s)]
*  stretches of curb, there was a motorcycle. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5202.72s)]
*  We went up the back way. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5205.08s)]
*  Motorcycle was behind me. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5206.88s)]
*  And he thought he was just going to decimate me or whatever. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5208.68s)]
*  And I was in front of him. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5212.16s)]
*  And then he was just gone. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5216.0s)]
*  And he was like, I can't believe you lost me. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5217.92s)]
*  I've never been able to lose somebody. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5220.04s)]
*  He was on some super bike, like crazy. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5221.56s)]
*  And he's a really experienced rider. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5223.400000000001s)]
*  He's like, you just disappeared. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5224.96s)]
*  He's like, and you were staying between the yellow. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5226.24s)]
*  You were staying in your lane the whole time. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5228.32s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, the Taycan, I like, [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5231.2s)]
*  because I have also a 911 Turbo S 2022. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5234.4800000000005s)]
*  So I have both those. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5238.4s)]
*  The Turbo S is a nasty monster. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5239.92s)]
*  But it's more analog. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5243.2s)]
*  It's got like a grips, feels like a mountain goat. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5244.32s)]
*  The Taycan is like, it's just like, it's a spaceship. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5247.0s)]
*  And it's all about weight management, [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5250.8s)]
*  because it's so heavy. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5253.0s)]
*  Well, also the weight is on the bottom. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5254.4s)]
*  It's where the batteries are. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5256.32s)]
*  So the weight distribution is amazing. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5257.5199999999995s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5259.88s)]
*  But it feels like a snowboard, I never snowboarded, [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5260.719999999999s)]
*  but it feels like snowboarding, really, [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5262.36s)]
*  because it's like, I'm taking this corner. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5264.719999999999s)]
*  So it feels more like this, this, [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5266.4s)]
*  as opposed to a 911 is more like, [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5269.32s)]
*  it's like magnetically held to the ground. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5271.76s)]
*  And it feels like it's crouching [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5275.44s)]
*  when it's going into a corner. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5277.12s)]
*  And so it's a different experience. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5278.5199999999995s)]
*  It's a little lighter. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5280.4s)]
*  Rear steer is amazing. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5281.599999999999s)]
*  But the Taycan is just, [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5283.04s)]
*  so I'm looking forward to a lighter, [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5285.12s)]
*  if they can make a Taycan that's a third less weight, [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5288.56s)]
*  I'd take 80 miles of range to have a lighter Taycan. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5291.68s)]
*  Well, if they had a two door. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5295.12s)]
*  If they come up with a two door Taycan [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5296.36s)]
*  and make it the size of a 911. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5297.88s)]
*  The Cayman's coming, the electric Cayman. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5299.56s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5301.76s)]
*  Oh my God, that's gonna be insane. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5303.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, or is that right? [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5304.24s)]
*  Yeah, the 718, that's a Cayman, right? [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5306.2s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5308.16s)]
*  So that's gonna come out either 2024 or 2025. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5309.04s)]
*  But I also heard that the new Macan electric, [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5314.04s)]
*  which won't be called the Macan electric [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5317.18s)]
*  because I think they're just calling it the Macan, [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5318.5199999999995s)]
*  that everyone's saying like, that's the joint. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5320.12s)]
*  I don't think it's gonna perform as well as a lower car. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5322.88s)]
*  But- Right. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5325.2s)]
*  Well, the X is a pretty fucking amazing car. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5326.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5328.44s)]
*  The Tesla X. Yeah. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5329.28s)]
*  Jamie had one of those for a while. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5330.1s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5331.28s)]
*  That's- Really? [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5332.12s)]
*  That egg wagon is like a- [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5332.96s)]
*  Dude, that thing doesn't tip over. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5334.12s)]
*  Okay. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5335.96s)]
*  That thing literally doesn't tip over. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5336.8s)]
*  You get nailed. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5337.76s)]
*  If somebody T-bones you, it doesn't tip over. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5339.240000000001s)]

*  And it's all 20, it's 20%. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5618.1s)]
*  I got 20 tents on everything. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5619.360000000001s)]
*  Anyways, point is I'm just excited. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5621.08s)]
*  I think Porsche, between their e-fuel [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5623.72s)]
*  that they're investing in, [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5626.5199999999995s)]
*  so you can like keep running their cars [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5628.0s)]
*  at an ecological balance, you know, [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5630.32s)]
*  because they're making this out of Chile. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5632.759999999999s)]
*  They, I don't know how much if they can scale it, [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5634.24s)]
*  but they are running e-fuel for the races. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5637.24s)]
*  So like sports, like the Porsche cups and stuff like that. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5639.839999999999s)]
*  What is e-fuel? [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5642.599999999999s)]
*  So e-fuel is, it uses, it's a process, [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5643.599999999999s)]
*  it uses captured carbon with some kind of a chemical process [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5646.32s)]
*  that produces a combustible, or yeah, [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5649.719999999999s)]
*  combustible fuel, combustion fuel, [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5652.44s)]
*  I guess that's how you say it. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5654.799999999999s)]
*  So you can just replace it. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5657.16s)]
*  It's a direct, any car can use it. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5658.12s)]
*  It's just fuel. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5659.799999999999s)]
*  But the way it's produced is zero, uses zero emissions. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5661.299999999999s)]
*  So it still combusts. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5664.719999999999s)]
*  And I think it combusts at a lower, [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5666.5599999999995s)]
*  there's less carbon that's created when it combusts [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5667.98s)]
*  and the process of making it is zero. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5671.08s)]
*  So it becomes a ecological fuel. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5673.259999999999s)]
*  So they call it e-fuel. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5677.679999999999s)]
*  And they, of course they invested in that [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5678.96s)]
*  because they wanna keep making combustion engines. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5680.62s)]
*  Well, there's something about the sound [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5683.32s)]
*  of a combustion engine. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5685.0s)]
*  It's impossible to replicate. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5686.68s)]
*  And when they try to do it, like fake it, it's so gross. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5688.28s)]
*  I don't like the fake shit. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5691.72s)]
*  I will say that the Taycan, [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5693.56s)]
*  their sport sound that comes on, [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5695.52s)]
*  it's like, yeah, it's like you can turn it on [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5698.24s)]
*  or when you go into sport mode, it turns on. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5700.04s)]
*  All it is is an amplified version. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5701.92s)]
*  There are microphones that are picking up [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5704.0s)]
*  the sound of the motors. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5705.8s)]
*  As far as I understand it, I could be wrong at that, [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5707.88s)]
*  but I think that's how it was explained to me. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5709.68s)]
*  And it just amplifies with some extra tonalities. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5711.28s)]
*  So it gives it a little bit of a, [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5714.76s)]
*  like it almost sounds like gear shifts, [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5716.64s)]
*  which is kind of weird. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5720.6s)]
*  But for me, yeah. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5722.04s)]
*  Let me hear what it sounds like. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5722.88s)]
*  Yeah, if you have a Taycan sound. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5723.72s)]
*  Let's see. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5727.360000000001s)]
*  Wow, that's gonna be, that's it. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5729.8s)]
*  That's the sound. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5732.0s)]
*  You hear that low end that kicks in? [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5732.84s)]
*  That sounds dope. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5735.360000000001s)]
*  They tried to patent it recently in Europe. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5737.6s)]
*  They wouldn't let them. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5739.2s)]
*  So those are all. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5741.28s)]
*  That sounds fucking sick. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5742.36s)]
*  It's sick, man. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5744.2s)]
*  That sounds sick. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5745.48s)]
*  I mean, that's amazing. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5747.5199999999995s)]
*  That's the sound that makes me wanna be in it right now. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5749.4s)]
*  But like. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5751.24s)]
*  That sounds fucking dope. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5753.92s)]
*  So it's just, it's an augmented sound [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5755.799999999999s)]
*  that the car actually makes. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5758.12s)]
*  The motors actually make that sound. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5759.48s)]
*  I hear his interior. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5760.879999999999s)]
*  Are they in Poland? [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5764.16s)]
*  Dude, that sounds dope. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5765.0s)]
*  And I like it because [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5767.719999999999s)]
*  and I like it because you feel that low end rumble [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5769.28s)]
*  as you're driving. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5772.52s)]
*  So it does give you, it gives you information. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5773.4s)]
*  Like when I'm driving, I feel the car. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5775.64s)]
*  Because otherwise if it's totally silent, it's weird. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5780.68s)]
*  It doesn't feel right. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5783.56s)]
*  Well, it does sound weird when I drive my car, my Tesla S. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5785.52s)]
*  Oh yeah, you got a plaid. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5788.56s)]
*  That's yours. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5789.88s)]
*  Or no, that wasn't yours. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5790.72s)]
*  That's Jamie's. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5791.56s)]
*  Yeah, Jamie's, okay, gotcha. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5792.4s)]
*  Yeah, I have one of those. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5793.22s)]
*  It's silent. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5794.06s)]
*  Yeah, which is like, it's all right. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5795.16s)]
*  But I don't mind it if the sound is just an augmentation [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5799.280000000001s)]
*  of what the motors sound like, then I'm into it. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5801.96s)]
*  Especially when you got a three motor going on. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5804.6s)]
*  Right, and that sounds like a cool spaceship [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5806.56s)]
*  type electric car. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5809.0s)]
*  And then I'm like, [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5810.200000000001s)]
*  because I feel like I could confidently, [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5811.04s)]
*  when I drive an electric car, I like both. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5813.280000000001s)]
*  I mean, the Turbo S is amazing to drive, [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5815.52s)]
*  even though I do feel a little bit bad. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5819.400000000001s)]
*  So just like, ah, this producing carbon. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5821.320000000001s)]
*  And I know that sports cars account for very, very little [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5823.400000000001s)]
*  because it's a very, very small market. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5825.700000000001s)]
*  But I still kind of feel a little bit, [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5827.2s)]
*  and then when I drive the Taycan, [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5829.72s)]
*  I'm just like, this thing is just, [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5831.0s)]
*  it's like, I feel fully free in a way. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5832.639999999999s)]
*  One of the things that Jeremy Clarkson pointed out [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5836.12s)]
*  when he did a review of the Turbo [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5838.8s)]
*  is that the way the Turbo filters the air, [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5840.84s)]
*  the air coming out of the exhaust is actually cleaner [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5843.84s)]
*  than the pollution air that's in the air. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5848.48s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5851.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5852.0199999999995s)]
*  See, we find that. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5852.84s)]
*  The particulate filters. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5853.679999999999s)]
*  When you're in a polluted city, [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5855.24s)]
*  like if you're in a place like Los Angeles, [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5857.6s)]
*  like downtown LA, the exhaust from a Turbo, [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5859.0s)]
*  from a Turbo Porsche is actually less pollution [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5863.64s)]
*  than the actual air. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5867.84s)]
*  Yeah, I can believe that [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5869.76s)]
*  because everyone's complaining about the sound of it. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5871.36s)]
*  You can't rev it because the particulate filters [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5873.28s)]
*  are so strong because of the e-regulation. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5875.32s)]
*  So people are like, ah, well, they have a rev limiter. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5877.4400000000005s)]
*  It doesn't sound that good or whatever. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5879.8s)]
*  But I don't really care about that. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5881.4s)]
*  It's like, once you start going. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5883.04s)]
*  The performance is preposterous. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5883.88s)]
*  It's electric car performance from a combustion engine. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5886.24s)]
*  Exactly, that's why I wanted the Turbo S [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5888.12s)]
*  because I had the Taycan. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5889.96s)]
*  I was like, I want to know what the Turbo. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5891.0s)]
*  So in the video about Jeremy Clarkson, [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5893.719999999999s)]
*  host of the Top Gear says that Porsche 911 Turbo [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5895.5599999999995s)]
*  cleans the air in polluted cities like LA. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5898.24s)]
*  While I have seen concept cars that clean the air, [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5901.32s)]
*  I seriously doubt that any existing car, [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5903.5599999999995s)]
*  especially the Porsche 911 Turbo, [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5905.639999999999s)]
*  emits exhaust that is cleaner than air, [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5908.44s)]
*  even air in the most polluted cities. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5910.5199999999995s)]
*  Here's exactly what Clarkson says. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5912.5199999999995s)]
*  When you drive this car through a really polluted city, [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5914.44s)]
*  Los Angeles, Calcutta, Harrogate, wherever that is, [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5916.599999999999s)]
*  something like that, the gas comes out of the exhaust pipe [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5919.639999999999s)]
*  is less toxic than the air going into the engine. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5922.28s)]
*  And I'm not joking, that's true. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5925.28s)]
*  This is like a small, efficient, easy to use vacuum cleaner. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5927.16s)]
*  This you could call the Porsche Dyson. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5930.28s)]
*  So here's the question for Sunday afternoon. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5932.2s)]
*  What do you think? [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5933.719999999999s)]
*  Is he wrong? [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5934.5599999999995s)]
*  Man, well, now you just made me feel a little bit better. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5935.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if that's true, though. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5938.16s)]
*  Jeremy Clarkson has said multiple things that aren't true. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5940.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5942.599999999999s)]
*  I mean, they famously rigged their Tesla episode. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5943.8s)]
*  I heard about that. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5946.320000000001s)]
*  To show that the Tesla died on the track, [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5947.320000000001s)]
*  and it didn't die on the track. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5950.240000000001s)]
*  I remember that. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5951.200000000001s)]
*  I was like, why are you doing that? [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5952.64s)]
*  Horrible. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5954.360000000001s)]
*  Just do the shit honestly, [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5955.200000000001s)]
*  you're gonna run in anomalies anyways. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5956.400000000001s)]
*  Like, why do you have to invent that shit? [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5957.96s)]
*  Well, because that's a reality show. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5959.280000000001s)]
*  It's gross. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5961.64s)]
*  They have to create drama. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5962.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, well. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5964.12s)]
*  Create problems. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5964.96s)]
*  But to do that, you're like tanking a business. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5965.780000000001s)]
*  Like, I mean, how many people saw that [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5968.400000000001s)]
*  and wouldn't buy one of those cars because of that? [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5970.52s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5972.88s)]
*  And I think Elon lost in court [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5973.88s)]
*  because I think part of the show is that it's entertainment. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5976.72s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5979.56s)]
*  So they're allowed to fake things. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5980.400000000001s)]
*  I see. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5982.56s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5983.56s)]
*  Which is kind of fucked. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5984.400000000001s)]
*  It's kind of fucked. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5985.6s)]
*  Well, you know what? [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5987.08s)]
*  It's like a freedom that should exist, [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5987.92s)]
*  however it's to use it in that way is really poor taste [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5989.64s)]
*  and like, I don't know, [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5995.28s)]
*  maybe there's some kind of a consequence to it. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5996.12s)]
*  I think there's a consequence certainly to that business. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=5997.68s)]
*  I mean, how many people saw that? [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6000.76s)]
*  I bet that was a big hit on the business. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6002.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I remember seeing that and I was like, [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6005.0s)]
*  oh, really? [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6007.759999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6008.599999999999s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6009.44s)]
*  I mean, it's an electric car. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6010.28s)]
*  They're kind of hard to fuck up. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6011.32s)]
*  Yeah, I remember thinking, [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6012.5199999999995s)]
*  oh, well, it must be new tech. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6013.5599999999995s)]
*  I'll wait a while. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6015.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6015.88s)]
*  And then wait a while to get it down [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6016.719999999999s)]
*  because right now it's fucking up. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6018.36s)]
*  But it wasn't fucking up. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6019.92s)]
*  No, it wasn't. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6020.96s)]
*  Yeah, I remember that was with the plaid, right? [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6021.78s)]
*  No. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6023.839999999999s)]
*  Oh, that was just the- [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6024.679999999999s)]
*  Early on. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6025.5199999999995s)]
*  The early, early Tesla. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6026.36s)]
*  The one that looked like a Lotus. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6027.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh, you're talking about the very first one. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6029.16s)]
*  Oh. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6030.96s)]
*  See if we can find it. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6031.84s)]
*  That was way back. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6032.68s)]
*  Yeah, the- [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6033.6s)]
*  Tesla Roadster. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6034.4400000000005s)]
*  Roadster. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6035.28s)]
*  Yeah, the original Roadster. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6036.1s)]
*  I did not know that. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6037.320000000001s)]
*  You know, the new Roadster's just like vaporware. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6038.16s)]
*  It's not gonna happen. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6040.400000000001s)]
*  Where is that fucking thing? [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6041.4800000000005s)]
*  Everybody's killing it. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6042.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean, the ass-spark owl is coming out [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6043.320000000001s)]
*  and that's gonna blow that away. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6045.56s)]
*  You don't think it's gonna happen? [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6046.400000000001s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6047.400000000001s)]
*  Well, maybe, but I just don't, I don't know. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6048.24s)]
*  I don't think the appetite's there. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6050.400000000001s)]
*  What? [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6052.12s)]
*  I think Lotus and- [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6052.96s)]
*  Oh, the appetite's there, dude, if it comes out. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6056.04s)]
*  If they make the Tesla Roadster [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6058.52s)]
*  the way that Elon showed it when they did that demo. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6060.28s)]
*  Right, of course. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6063.32s)]
*  1.7 seconds, 0 to 60, looks insane. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6064.16s)]
*  I know, yeah. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6066.8s)]
*  It looks fucking cool as shit. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6067.639999999999s)]
*  Two-seater. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6069.4s)]
*  Yeah, but it's gonna be the same price [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6070.44s)]
*  as a Porsche Cayman, electric Cayman. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6072.2s)]
*  So it's like, people are probably gonna choose the Porsche. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6075.5199999999995s)]
*  We'll see. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6078.12s)]
*  I'd choose the Porsche every day. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6078.96s)]
*  I mean, the problem with Teslas, my problem with them, [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6080.28s)]
*  is that they don't have buttons. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6083.5s)]
*  Everything is touch screen. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6084.88s)]
*  I do not like that. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6085.96s)]
*  I do not like that. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6087.24s)]
*  That is one thing you would appreciate about the Lucid, [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6088.08s)]
*  because the Lucid, the cockpit, it's a good looking car. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6090.9400000000005s)]
*  So you can still order that thing. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6092.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but I found it on their website somehow. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6093.700000000001s)]
*  Come on, that looks dope as fuck. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6096.3s)]
*  I mean, no, it looks sick. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6097.780000000001s)]
*  It looks like a Ferrari. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6099.26s)]
*  That looks dope. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6100.3s)]
*  It looks like an electric Ferrari, kind of, smoothed over. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6101.14s)]
*  Well, it looks like a Tesla sports car, [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6103.46s)]
*  is what it looks like. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6104.860000000001s)]
*  But there's no timeline for this thing. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6105.820000000001s)]
*  I mean, the whole, I think their roadmap [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6107.900000000001s)]
*  is get out the truck first. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6110.38s)]
*  So the Cybertruck has started to be delivered, [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6113.780000000001s)]
*  and people are driving, apparently, [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6116.740000000001s)]
*  a friend of mine saw one in LA. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6118.42s)]
*  I do not like that truck. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6120.5s)]
*  Dude, have you seen it in real life? [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6122.0599999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6123.38s)]
*  It's fucking sick. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6124.219999999999s)]
*  Really? [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6125.04s)]
*  I do not. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6125.88s)]
*  I do not. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6126.719999999999s)]
*  I like how I take a Rivian over that, any day. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6127.54s)]
*  No way. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6129.099999999999s)]
*  Rivian's good looking. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6129.94s)]
*  Ew. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6130.759999999999s)]
*  Sick. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6131.599999999999s)]
*  It's a cutie. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6132.44s)]
*  You like those glasses you're wearing. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6133.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6134.66s)]
*  Yeah, see what I'm saying? [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6135.5s)]

*  A lot, it's kind of like a median of performance vehicles. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6246.64s)]
*  That's about as much as you're gonna get right now [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6249.52s)]
*  with a battery tech that exists. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6251.26s)]

*  Yeah, it looks great. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6360.58s)]
*  I mean you get more range on that. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6361.42s)]
*  I mean it's like over time, [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6363.22s)]
*  there'll be new battery chemistry. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6364.46s)]
*  I mean look at how clean that is. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6365.74s)]
*  It looks like an old school, [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6367.1s)]
*  it's got that old school 80s. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6368.74s)]
*  Truck look. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6371.18s)]
*  80s, 90s, yeah, because I like trucks [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6372.0s)]
*  that look like trucks. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6373.7s)]
*  That's sick. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6374.900000000001s)]
*  Does look like the truck Michael J. Fox wanted. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6375.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6377.7s)]
*  Yeah, if they ever redid, [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6379.06s)]
*  because you're gonna need to redo like Back to the Future, [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6380.46s)]
*  that's the truck that's gonna show up. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6383.22s)]
*  Now show me the Cybertruck. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6384.82s)]
*  Casey Daylighters. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6386.06s)]
*  I still prefer the Cybertruck. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6388.46s)]
*  I'm gonna find this. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6389.9400000000005s)]
*  When I saw the Cybertruck in person, [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6390.78s)]
*  like that's the coolest thing I've ever seen. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6391.86s)]
*  It looks like something that's in the future. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6393.42s)]
*  I mean when it came out I was like, [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6394.26s)]
*  oh that's a cool, that's a bold design, [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6395.38s)]
*  but then like it didn't come out for a long, long, long, [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6396.7s)]
*  long, long time. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6398.5s)]
*  Well it took a long time to make it. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6399.34s)]
*  This looks like a 70s, it looks like a 70s sci-fi truck. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6400.34s)]
*  It's dope, I love it. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6403.3s)]
*  Small electric. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6405.46s)]
*  I saw it in real life and I was like, [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6407.1s)]
*  this is the coolest fucking thing I've ever seen. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6408.46s)]
*  I think it's pretty dope. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6411.82s)]
*  Fiskars coming out with good shit too, [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6413.34s)]
*  but I'm trying to, there was another, [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6415.06s)]
*  oh here it is, this guy. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6417.06s)]
*  Telo. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6419.46s)]
*  I don't think you're gonna like it, [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6420.86s)]
*  but it's definitely different looking, [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6421.9s)]
*  but it's a small truck, [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6424.42s)]
*  but it's got the same bed length as an average truck, [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6425.46s)]
*  but it's like tiny, it's like this little Telo thing. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6427.78s)]
*  Oh, yeah that's gross. T-E-L-O. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6430.18s)]
*  That looks disgusting. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6431.9s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6432.9s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6433.74s)]
*  Now that's what I would rock. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6435.46s)]
*  It is tiny, man. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6437.1s)]
*  And look at that approach angle. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6438.38s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6440.740000000001s)]
*  You'd have to see how it handles and all that stuff. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6443.660000000001s)]
*  I saw something yesterday that wasn't a truck, [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6446.700000000001s)]
*  but it was like a recreated 67 Mustang electric car. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6448.26s)]
*  Oh yeah, they're doing those now. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6451.34s)]
*  The Electro Resto thing, those are from scratch too, [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6453.06s)]
*  they're not using donor cars, that's from scratch. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6456.18s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6458.34s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's the one that you're talking about, [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6459.18s)]
*  the Mustang. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6461.1s)]
*  So they're recreating. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6461.9400000000005s)]
*  It looks like a Mustang, but it isn't a Mustang. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6462.780000000001s)]
*  I don't know if that's what you're talking about. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6465.78s)]
*  I didn't say Mustang, I just said 67. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6467.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6469.26s)]
*  Have you seen that company, was it called Everati? [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6470.099999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6472.3s)]
*  Yeah, they're doing that with like Porsche 964s. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6473.139999999999s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6475.86s)]
*  And they're making them electric. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6476.7s)]
*  They say that they're one for one, [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6477.78s)]
*  at least like steering handling and all that stuff [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6479.139999999999s)]
*  feels pretty one for one. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6481.179999999999s)]
*  Well, it must be amazing just because of the batteries, [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6483.139999999999s)]
*  the low center of gravity. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6485.66s)]
*  Check that out, looks like a Mach 1 kind of thing. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6487.139999999999s)]
*  Wow, technology company that creates [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6488.54s)]
*  brand new electric cars that look like Mustangs. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6490.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6493.78s)]
*  What do they call it? [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6494.62s)]
*  The cars, or the company, Charge, Charge. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6496.14s)]
*  But they don't call it a Mustang? [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6498.5s)]
*  No, I don't think they legally can. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6500.14s)]
*  Interesting, but it's clearly they ripped off the Mustang. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6501.5s)]
*  They completely did. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6504.099999999999s)]
*  But yeah, it's a from scratch bespoke. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6506.14s)]
*  But I mean, look at that shit. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6510.82s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6511.9s)]
*  I love that electrics are starting [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6512.74s)]
*  to look like engines now. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6513.78s)]
*  Yeah, but I have to be honest. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6514.94s)]
*  If I want a 67 Mustang, I want it to go boom. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6516.94s)]
*  Of course. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6519.98s)]
*  Of course. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6521.34s)]
*  Yeah, I don't want a silent 67 Mustang. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6522.26s)]
*  It just feels goofy. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6524.62s)]
*  How about that McMurtry Spearling? [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6526.26s)]
*  Remember that? [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6528.3s)]
*  They're making a road car. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6529.14s)]
*  Does it have sound? [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6529.96s)]
*  Can you hear what this thing sounds like? [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6530.9800000000005s)]
*  No, I just saw it on Instagram. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6531.820000000001s)]
*  It looks pretty dope. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6533.740000000001s)]
*  It looks pretty dope. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6534.9400000000005s)]
*  But a 67 Mustang looks dope. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6536.22s)]
*  Of course, I get you. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6538.3s)]
*  Yeah, well, you know, my thing is if you can figure out [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6539.820000000001s)]
*  a way to like, you just take the engine out, right, [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6541.860000000001s)]
*  transmission, all that stuff, and you just save it, right? [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6543.62s)]
*  So you can swap it in and out as you want. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6546.22s)]
*  Oh God, you can't. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6548.46s)]
*  I mean, you can't, but I'm just saying [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6549.900000000001s)]
*  if you figured out a way to do it, maybe, I don't know. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6551.7s)]
*  I don't know, I don't know. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6553.78s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6554.62s)]
*  But have you seen the McMurtry Spearling? [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6555.44s)]
*  That thing that got the Goodwood record? [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6557.5s)]
*  It's a vacuum car. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6559.42s)]
*  It's a fan car. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6560.58s)]
*  So it's, I was there at Goodwood [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6561.74s)]
*  when it did its legendary run. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6563.94s)]
*  I think it has, I think it's got the fastest record [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6565.32s)]
*  going up Goodwood. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6567.86s)]
*  It sucks itself to the ground. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6569.22s)]
*  It can make up, I think, 10 tons of downforce. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6571.0199999999995s)]
*  And it's tiny, it looks like a tiny Batmobile. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6574.18s)]
*  And it looks kind of funny because it's so, [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6578.26s)]
*  there it is, that's the Goodwood. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6580.139999999999s)]
*  I was right there. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6581.34s)]
*  I was right there in the, that right, that stand right there. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6582.18s)]
*  So what is a vacuum car? [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6583.9400000000005s)]
*  Like how exactly does that work? [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6585.900000000001s)]
*  So, whoa, look at that thing. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6587.1s)]
*  It's so fast. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6588.82s)]
*  It does zero to 16 in like 1.6 seconds [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6589.78s)]
*  or something like that. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6593.02s)]
*  And it's just that thing when it, look at this thing. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6594.26s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6602.52s)]
*  That looks fucking amazing. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6605.68s)]
*  It broke every record. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6607.9400000000005s)]
*  And you've got center driving position. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6609.1s)]
*  I mean, it destroyed that run. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6611.9s)]

*  It's a car, but it's like, it's a fucking human body. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6859.28s)]
*  Well, that GT40 is even smaller than my GT, my Ford GT, [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6861.12s)]
*  the original GT40. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6866.12s)]
*  Oh, right. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6867.48s)]
*  It's a very small car. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6868.32s)]
*  It's very small. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6869.16s)]
*  And now people are taking those [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6869.98s)]
*  and they're adding insane thousand horsepower engines [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6871.88s)]
*  to them and they're doing these retro, like resto mods [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6875.400000000001s)]
*  on the Ford GT40. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6879.64s)]
*  Some of them are incredible [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6881.2s)]
*  because it's such an analog car. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6883.4400000000005s)]
*  It's, you know, design, it's a real race car. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6885.8s)]
*  It's got a plexiglass side window. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6888.0s)]
*  It doesn't even roll down. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6889.56s)]
*  I love that shit. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6891.08s)]
*  I love that shit. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6892.400000000001s)]
*  I love it. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6893.360000000001s)]
*  I love life. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6894.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6895.04s)]
*  You know, it's cool. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6895.88s)]
*  I love engineering. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6896.7s)]
*  Engineering, that's totally my thing. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6897.6s)]
*  My thing is like design, engineering. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6899.16s)]
*  I go like, you know, I went to Berlin [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6901.32s)]
*  and the first thing I noticed was the lighting. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6904.28s)]
*  All the street lights are beautiful amber. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6906.84s)]
*  All the interior lighting in most places is like, [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6910.12s)]
*  there's no, you know how you walk into like a convenience [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6912.599999999999s)]
*  store here or whatever and it's just like fluorescent attack? [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6915.24s)]
*  It doesn't really exist. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6917.84s)]
*  I mean, there are places, but like in general, it doesn't. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6919.04s)]
*  I was like, whoa, they actually, they care about this shit. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6921.4s)]
*  Like people are like, we don't like the harsh lights [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6924.84s)]
*  are too bright and it's not good for, you know, [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6927.5199999999995s)]
*  concentration, whatever. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6930.12s)]
*  I love design. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6931.76s)]
*  I like anything that's designed. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6932.84s)]
*  I could like look at an ashtray. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6933.76s)]
*  I could look at a knife. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6935.08s)]
*  I love knives. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6936.04s)]
*  I like, you know, whatever. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6936.88s)]
*  I just, you know, whatever firearm. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6937.72s)]
*  I'm just like, I can, you know, [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6940.68s)]
*  it's like any engineering that people were passionate about [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6942.0s)]
*  and they're like, this is what we wanted to make [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6945.0s)]
*  and we made it. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6946.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm like, good for you. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6947.36s)]
*  Yeah, I'm into that too. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6949.04s)]
*  I just love design and innovation. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6950.4s)]
*  I just love seeing like the human mind come up [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6953.92s)]
*  with something like that spiraling. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6956.92s)]
*  I mean, come on. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6958.44s)]
*  I mean, imagine the amount of passion and drive [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6961.04s)]
*  and dedication you have to have to develop something like [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6964.16s)]
*  that and actually produce it and make it. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6966.76s)]
*  And then when you see the preposterous way this thing [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6968.5199999999995s)]
*  fucking maneuvers and handles. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6971.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6972.64s)]
*  It's so cool. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6973.48s)]
*  I know, I know. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6974.32s)]
*  And the Gordon Murray cars that just, [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6975.16s)]
*  What's that? [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6976.84s)]
*  Just came out, the Gordon Murray T50 and the T30. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6977.68s)]
*  What's that? [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6981.44s)]
*  He's the guy who designed the F1, McLaren, [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6982.6s)]
*  that the, you know, the $20 million now evaluated [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6985.76s)]
*  $20 million supercar. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6988.88s)]
*  Yeah, he designed that, a legendary designer [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6992.12s)]
*  and then he made two cars. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6995.52s)]
*  One is a fan car. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6997.0s)]
*  Well, no, it's not a fan car. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=6998.32s)]
*  It uses a fan to depressurize the zone behind the car. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7000.12s)]
*  Oh, there we go. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7004.76s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7005.6s)]
*  T50. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7006.4400000000005s)]
*  I think it's the T50. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7007.28s)]
*  What the fuck is that? [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7009.04s)]
*  Oh, that's sick. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7011.28s)]
*  Yeah, so center driving position [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7012.12s)]
*  and two passenger seats on either side. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7013.28s)]
*  Look how low it is. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7014.96s)]
*  Just like the F1. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7016.4800000000005s)]
*  Wow, it looks a lot like a McLaren. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7018.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that was his baby. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7020.12s)]
*  And how does that thing handle? [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7022.44s)]
*  I mean, there haven't been any reviews on it yet, [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7024.4s)]
*  but I mean, look at that stick shift. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7027.48s)]
*  And they designed the cockpit around you. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7028.76s)]
*  So you come in for a fitting essentially. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7031.12s)]
*  But you get to see all the mechanics of, [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7033.44s)]
*  the mechanics are exposed for the shifter [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7035.76s)]
*  on the interior of the car. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7038.2s)]
*  So shifter, like, does it have gears? [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7039.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, so it's a full gas car. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7041.56s)]
*  So it's a full gas car. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7043.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7045.0s)]
*  The other one that they came out with [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7045.84s)]
*  is more of a 1960s homage. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7047.4800000000005s)]
*  Is this a manual transmission? [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7050.24s)]
*  Does it have a clutch? [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7052.28s)]
*  Yeah, clutch, manual transmission. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7053.52s)]
*  Really? [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7055.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so the T33, that one, check that one out. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7056.2s)]
*  I love this car. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7060.92s)]
*  That's very interesting. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7063.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, this is more of like a kind of more manual. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7064.88s)]
*  But Gordon Murray, he's just a legend. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7067.16s)]
*  The guy is insanely talented. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7070.92s)]
*  But he just like made, these cars, [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7074.4s)]
*  the cars that he wanted to make, [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7075.799999999999s)]
*  and there was like nothing, every wire, every bolt, [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7077.48s)]
*  that guy is in, I've watched so many interviews, [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7082.4s)]
*  and everything is approved by him. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7085.32s)]
*  Oh, that's a gorgeous car. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7088.32s)]
*  They're really beautiful automobiles. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7089.639999999999s)]
*  And he doesn't release performance numbers [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7091.5599999999995s)]
*  because he doesn't believe in that. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7094.08s)]
*  He believes in the spirit of the car, [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7095.32s)]
*  like the way it feels. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7097.24s)]
*  And of course it's gonna be lightweight [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7098.92s)]
*  and all that stuff. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7100.639999999999s)]
*  Scroll back down, please. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7101.48s)]
*  He doesn't do traction control either, I don't think. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7103.24s)]
*  It says in every major engineering area, [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7104.88s)]
*  the T33 is mechanically superior to modern day supercars. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7106.679999999999s)]
*  Go to the interior. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7110.639999999999s)]
*  See what that looks like. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7113.139999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7114.32s)]
*  So is this like a bespoke thing? [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7116.38s)]
*  They only make a certain number per year? [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7118.12s)]
*  Yeah, all that stuff, yeah. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7119.84s)]
*  It's a bit expensive. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7121.4s)]
*  And you go into the design studio, [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7122.44s)]
*  like you can go in there, [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7124.04s)]
*  and you just basically go through all the swatches, [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7125.44s)]
*  and color, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7127.86s)]
*  Wow. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7130.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I mean, [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7130.84s)]
*  there's some beautiful automobiles out there, [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7131.92s)]
*  and I can't afford them, but you know, I. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7135.0s)]
*  Click on that video so I can see that video. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7137.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's pretty sick. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7139.56s)]
*  Does it show it driving? [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7140.64s)]
*  That's what it, I don't really see them like, [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7142.6s)]
*  yeah, there should be a sound, [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7144.56s)]
*  but that's the weirdest thing about his company. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7145.76s)]
*  Like they don't really show a lot of footage [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7148.16s)]
*  of the car in action, which is kind of curious. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7150.12s)]
*  Has this been actually released already? [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7154.52s)]
*  Can you buy one of these? [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7156.7s)]
*  You can order them. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7157.54s)]
*  T50s exist, I think, [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7158.76s)]
*  I think if that's the name of the T50, I figure. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7160.44s)]
*  Why is this video a map? [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7162.679999999999s)]
*  It's stupid. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7163.96s)]
*  That's why I wasn't gonna click on it, [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7164.799999999999s)]
*  because I knew it wasn't, it's just a sales pitch. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7165.639999999999s)]
*  It's a sales pitch. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7167.799999999999s)]
*  Okay, there's a track. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7168.639999999999s)]
*  Okay, now show the car, that's it? [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7169.92s)]
*  That's what I'm saying, it's like, [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7172.5199999999995s)]
*  that's the one thing I don't like about it, [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7173.719999999999s)]
*  is like you don't, well, that's the guy [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7175.24s)]
*  that drove the Spearling that was crying. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7177.0s)]
*  That dude, super tall guy, he's this tall, [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7181.0s)]
*  Gordon Murray's tall too. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7184.0s)]
*  It was kind of funny to see them talking together. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7185.44s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, they're, I mean, [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7187.759999999999s)]
*  so that fan in the back, [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7190.04s)]
*  so it depressurizes the zone behind the car, [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7192.160000000001s)]
*  so that you don't need a spoiler for downforce. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7194.64s)]
*  Huh. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7197.400000000001s)]
*  Well, there are two mini spoilers on either side, [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7198.240000000001s)]
*  but it basically, as soon as that pressure starts to build up. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7201.4800000000005s)]
*  So that's with the fan on, [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7216.4800000000005s)]
*  which makes it a lot louder. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7218.44s)]
*  You can disengage the fan when you're driving. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7220.96s)]
*  Why would you? [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7222.679999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean, you know, small towns and stuff like that. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7224.0s)]
*  Yeah, tell them to deal with it, you're in town. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7226.96s)]
*  Oh yeah, this is good. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7229.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, look at the back seat. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7230.759999999999s)]
*  Isn't that great? [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7232.04s)]
*  So that people sit behind you. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7232.88s)]
*  Yeah, just like the F1. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7233.7s)]
*  The F1 was center with two passengers on either side. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7235.44s)]
*  Which I kind of like that. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7239.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, it's like, you're gonna take two friends on a ride, [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7240.8s)]
*  you know, it's kind of fun. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7242.719999999999s)]
*  And then you get that center drive position, [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7244.96s)]
*  which I've never experienced before, [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7246.599999999999s)]
*  but I would love to get a center driving position. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7248.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, wow, that's crazy, that's a road car. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7250.84s)]
*  Man, isn't that great? [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7254.04s)]
*  I know, it's like, you know, there's still like, [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7255.68s)]
*  there's some cool stuff going on. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7257.36s)]
*  But you know, the good thing is like, [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7258.72s)]
*  there's cars at every price point, [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7259.84s)]
*  and they're all like, so many great ones, you know? [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7261.72s)]
*  I love them. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7263.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good time for automobiles. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7264.72s)]
*  But it's a weird thing [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7267.12s)]
*  because they keep making them faster every year. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7268.52s)]
*  I know. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7270.8s)]
*  It's like, where does this go? [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7271.64s)]
*  I know, that's what I'm saying. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7272.4800000000005s)]
*  There's a biological limit to speed and G-forces. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7273.3s)]
*  At a certain point, all electric cars [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7277.48s)]
*  are gonna basically be the same, zero to 60. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7279.04s)]
*  Handling will be different, but the zero to 60, [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7282.44s)]
*  and stopping is like, that's a pretty predictable science. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7285.16s)]
*  I don't know where we're gonna go. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7290.28s)]
*  We can't get faster than blacking out, [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7291.4s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7294.639999999999s)]
*  Right, G-force. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7295.48s)]
*  It's like, you don't wanna be like, eh! [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7296.32s)]
*  Right. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7298.08s)]
*  I wonder if that's possible. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7299.04s)]
*  I think so. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7301.0s)]
*  That someone could black out from a car. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7301.84s)]
*  I mean, you could black out, yeah, [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7303.5599999999995s)]
*  you could black out from a corner. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7306.36s)]
*  I mean, because blacking out [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7308.719999999999s)]
*  has just reduced blood to the brain. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7309.599999999999s)]
*  So, I don't know, I guess on a forward acceleration, [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7311.599999999999s)]
*  you should be able to black out. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7314.24s)]
*  I think you could black out. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7315.48s)]
*  Have you ever been in a fighter jet? [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7316.44s)]
*  No, never been in a, no. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7318.759999999999s)]
*  I flew with the Blue Angels once. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7320.36s)]
*  What? [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7321.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I blacked out. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7322.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, of course you did. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7323.42s)]
*  I went seven and a half Gs and didn't black out, [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7324.259999999999s)]
*  and then we did another corner, [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7326.32s)]
*  and I didn't do the hooking thing. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7328.16s)]
*  You go, hooch, hooch, hooch. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7330.04s)]
*  And I did one corner where I didn't do it right. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7332.48s)]
*  I just didn't anticipate it was gonna be as much. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7335.24s)]
*  Ah, ah. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7338.0s)]
*  And I threw up. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7339.5199999999995s)]
*  Whoa, no. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7340.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7342.28s)]
*  I mean, those. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7344.96s)]
*  It's exciting though. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7345.8s)]
*  I can't imagine. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7346.62s)]
*  Were you wearing the liquid-filled suits? [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7347.84s)]
*  Nope. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7349.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh, you didn't have them. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7350.4s)]
*  No, the Blue Angels don't wear suits. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7351.22s)]
*  They don't, no. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7352.16s)]
*  Oh, that's right, they're like old school. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7353.0s)]
*  Old school. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7354.36s)]
*  So, you have to be kind of jacked, [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7355.2s)]
*  and you can't be tall, [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7357.04s)]
*  because the tall guys, it's too much blood [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7358.48s)]
*  to the brain. Yes, too much volume. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7360.72s)]
*  Yeah, these guys are like stout, [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7363.0s)]
*  and they have to be stout in order to pilot that thing, [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7365.4800000000005s)]
*  because you have to have like muscles. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7367.24s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7368.76s)]
*  You have to be able to hooch, hooch, hooch, hooch. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7369.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7371.28s)]
*  Just like force the blood into your head. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7372.12s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7374.28s)]
*  You feel your, you actually see your consciousness [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7375.12s)]
*  closing in like an elevator door. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7377.08s)]
*  Right, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7378.32s)]
*  You see it. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7379.16s)]
*  Like they do in video games [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7380.0s)]
*  when you like to start to black out. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7381.28s)]
*  I mean. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7382.4400000000005s)]
*  This is crazy. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7383.28s)]
*  I mean, look at that. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7384.12s)]
*  When they get right next to each other and they fly, [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7384.96s)]
*  that's fucking bonkers. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7386.76s)]
*  I just. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7388.64s)]
*  Like guys, you're just feet away from each other. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7389.4800000000005s)]
*  This is so. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7391.24s)]
*  The Blue Angels are the best. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7392.08s)]
*  They used to come to my town for air shows, [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7393.0599999999995s)]
*  because I lived next to an Air Force base, [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7395.299999999999s)]
*  and it was, I couldn't tell you how excited it was [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7398.5s)]
*  when they would all stand outside of their planes, [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7401.5s)]
*  you know, just in front of each plane, [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7404.62s)]
*  and they all had their names on it. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7406.58s)]
*  I was like, but there is nothing like an air show crash [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7407.58s)]
*  to fucking terrify you. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7414.0599999999995s)]
*  Mike, are you kidding? [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7415.94s)]
*  There's a ton of those you could see too. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7417.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7418.94s)]
*  Have the Blue Angels, [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7419.78s)]
*  they have a pretty low-clock crash record. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7420.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7422.34s)]
*  I think they. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7423.26s)]
*  I don't know who crashes, [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7424.1s)]
*  but I've seen air show crashes where they fuck up, [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7424.9400000000005s)]
*  and those are horrific. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7428.3s)]
*  Oh man. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7430.58s)]
*  I mean, yeah. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7431.42s)]
*  I don't want to go to an air show. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7432.62s)]
*  No, I don't. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7433.46s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7434.3s)]
*  I don't need to go to an air show. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7435.14s)]
*  When I. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7435.9800000000005s)]
*  Have you seen the dirty roll? [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7436.82s)]
*  Have you ever seen that? [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7438.1s)]
*  What's that? [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7438.9400000000005s)]
*  The two planes come together with their landing gear out, [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7439.78s)]
*  facing each other. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7443.46s)]
*  Their landing gear almost like, kind of like offset, [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7444.9800000000005s)]
*  and then they do a full rotation. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7448.3s)]
*  Oh God. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7451.54s)]
*  It's the most insane. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7452.38s)]
*  I saw it like a few times. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7453.34s)]
*  They're like, and they're coming around here [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7454.62s)]
*  for a dirty roll. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7455.98s)]
*  Oh, fuck that. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7457.34s)]
*  So yeah, so check this. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7458.74s)]
*  Hopefully you'll get to see it. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7460.54s)]
*  So that's a dirty roll, single, [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7461.74s)]
*  but they did a double dirty roll. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7462.94s)]
*  Two planes facing each other, [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7464.86s)]
*  landing gear facing each other. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7466.62s)]
*  I would want to be far away with a spotting scope. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7467.98s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7471.46s)]
*  Oh no, I want to be close enough [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7472.3s)]
*  for one of those fucking things, [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7473.14s)]
*  touches the other one, [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7474.42s)]
*  flies into the crowd. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7475.98s)]
*  My God. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7477.1s)]
*  It's, it's. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7477.94s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7480.1s)]
*  He pulled out safely. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7481.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, there was like a complication with it. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7482.179999999999s)]
*  I mean, the new planes that are coming out, [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7483.94s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7485.46s)]
*  The fucking neck, was it the air dominance, [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7486.299999999999s)]
*  next air dominance vehicle or whatever. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7489.82s)]
*  What do you think about all this UAP UFO stuff? [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7491.58s)]
*  Oh shit. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7495.099999999999s)]
*  You know, I don't know. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7497.82s)]
*  It's something. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7499.259999999999s)]
*  It's something. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7500.179999999999s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7501.0199999999995s)]
*  Some of it is like, [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7502.099999999999s)]
*  some people theorize it's like plasma technologies, [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7503.5s)]
*  but they're like, they're getting physical signatures on it. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7506.0199999999995s)]
*  You know, you're getting like the, [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7508.379999999999s)]
*  all the radar return signatures [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7509.82s)]
*  and you're getting like infrared, you know. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7511.42s)]
*  I don't, I don't fucking know, man. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7513.66s)]
*  I mean, it's really blows me away. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7515.58s)]
*  I keep, cause I can't say, I can't say for sure. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7518.0199999999995s)]
*  Like I believe that, that other life forms exist. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7520.74s)]
*  I also believe, I just don't know if it's like, [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7524.62s)]
*  it doesn't make any sense why they're like, [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7528.34s)]
*  let's just hang out, never show ourselves [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7529.74s)]
*  and just do like really cool, tricky stuff [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7531.7s)]
*  and have people get a bunch of blurry images of it [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7533.54s)]
*  that we can never fucking see. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7535.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7536.94s)]
*  That's, that's the weird thing. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7537.78s)]
*  But I don't know what it is, man. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7538.98s)]
*  I mean, it's either natural phenomenon [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7541.139999999999s)]
*  or it's something that's been here a long time [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7543.66s)]
*  or they're probes from, that are triggered by a certain, [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7546.66s)]
*  I don't know, technological escalation in human society [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7550.74s)]
*  or they're somehow ours, [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7556.0s)]
*  but that doesn't make any sense either. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7559.28s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7561.7s)]
*  I mean, I've seen them. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7562.74s)]
*  I've seen, I've seen UFOs, but I've been talking. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7563.74s)]
*  You have? [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7565.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I might've mentioned on the show before, [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7566.219999999999s)]
*  but I've seen like the classic, [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7567.48s)]
*  like three glowing spheres in the distance [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7569.04s)]
*  kind of moving along and like a searchlight turning on [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7571.639999999999s)]
*  or a spotlight turning on and turning off [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7574.0199999999995s)]
*  and then like gliding with no noise in a canyon. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7575.4s)]
*  I've seen that, but, and that was awe-inspiring, [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7578.12s)]
*  but you know, some of the footage that you see, [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7581.719999999999s)]
*  you're like, that is, what is that? [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7583.839999999999s)]
*  It just went into the ocean. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7586.08s)]
*  It just went into the ocean at the same, [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7587.759999999999s)]
*  it's still traveling at the same rate [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7589.759999999999s)]
*  that it was traveling in the air and they're recording it. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7591.24s)]
*  So it's either like a huge hoax, [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7594.04s)]
*  which doesn't make any sense because people talk. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7596.8s)]
*  Or they're, I don't know, man. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7599.96s)]
*  Or it's like interdimensional shit. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7602.78s)]
*  It's, maybe if we are in a simulation, [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7605.6s)]
*  there'd like glitches in the simulation, [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7609.820000000001s)]
*  you know, like there's like other things bleeding through [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7611.400000000001s)]
*  and like we're seeing things that don't have any, [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7613.360000000001s)]
*  that don't adhere to the laws of physics [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7616.58s)]
*  because they aren't really in our physical realm in a way. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7619.76s)]
*  I don't really know. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7623.16s)]
*  Because I just, it really, it baffles me. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7624.68s)]
*  And then also when the government starts releasing stuff [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7628.280000000001s)]
*  and then you got a guy going around like, well, you know, [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7630.68s)]
*  I've been cleared by the, you know, whatever, [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7632.6s)]
*  the CIA or whatever to be able to talk about this [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7635.6s)]
*  and all this stuff. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7637.88s)]
*  Like you've been cleared to talk about stuff [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7638.72s)]
*  that you're supposed to not be talking about? [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7640.66s)]
*  Is a weird, that's weird. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7643.08s)]
*  And then I'm like, is it propaganda? [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7644.320000000001s)]
*  Is it like, I don't know, man. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7646.12s)]
*  It's a tough one because I grew up like, I love UFOs. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7647.96s)]
*  Like I grew up Project Blue Book, watched the series, [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7651.52s)]
*  loved aliens, used to sit in my backyard, [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7654.92s)]
*  looking up at the stars, [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7656.84s)]
*  hoping that I would see an alien one day. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7657.68s)]
*  And then I did see, not aliens, but I saw UAPs or UFOs. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7659.200000000001s)]
*  Where were you when you saw that? [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7663.4400000000005s)]
*  I was in Montana. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7664.52s)]
*  I was like probably 17. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7665.6s)]
*  And we were camping at night [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7667.360000000001s)]
*  and then we decided to climb a Butte [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7671.52s)]
*  in the middle of the night. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7673.4800000000005s)]
*  So we were crossing a big cattle field. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7674.3s)]
*  And then I was walking and two friends were ahead of me [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7676.4800000000005s)]
*  and I kind of just looked to my right, stopped, [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7679.6s)]
*  looked to my right and I just saw these in the distance. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7682.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't know how far it would be, but like, you know, [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7684.8s)]
*  they looked like about that big from my perspective. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7686.5s)]
*  So down a ways and there were three of them. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7690.280000000001s)]
*  It wasn't one object because they would change distance [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7693.240000000001s)]
*  from each other and change elevation a little bit, [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7696.02s)]
*  really low. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7698.02s)]
*  And then at some points, sometimes it would just stop [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7699.56s)]
*  and you'd see a little beam turn on, turn off, [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7702.52s)]
*  and then it would start to move again. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7706.280000000001s)]
*  It was really, really weird. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7707.84s)]
*  I had two friends I kept looking at. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7710.16s)]
*  I was like, come here, [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7711.719999999999s)]
*  because I didn't want to not look and then look back [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7712.5599999999995s)]
*  and then they weren't there type of movie shit. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7714.679999999999s)]
*  But my friends came back and they looked down [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7717.12s)]
*  and they described, I didn't even tell them [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7719.96s)]
*  what I was looking at. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7722.08s)]
*  I said, tell me what you see. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7722.92s)]
*  They described what I was seeing. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7723.799999999999s)]
*  I don't know what it was. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7725.44s)]
*  But I've heard other stories about three lights, [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7726.759999999999s)]
*  same kind of shit. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7730.679999999999s)]
*  When I'm watching like UFO, whatever documentary, [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7732.28s)]
*  so it gave me chills because I'm like, I've seen that. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7734.88s)]
*  Whatever that is, I've seen that. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7737.76s)]
*  So I don't know, I don't know, man. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7739.4800000000005s)]
*  It's like I go, my mind goes all over the place, [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7742.8s)]
*  but there's no definitive, no, because no one's, [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7745.24s)]
*  it's like unless they land and you're like, oh, [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7749.0s)]
*  there it is, or we see not the Mexico City alien, [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7751.56s)]
*  obviously a joke, not a joke, but whatever it was. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7756.88s)]
*  A hoax. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7761.2s)]
*  Unless we get something where it's like, oh shit, [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7762.4800000000005s)]
*  what is that? [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7764.88s)]
*  What is this metal? [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7765.72s)]
*  The scientists saying that they found a piece of an alien [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7766.54s)]
*  ship at the bottom of the ocean because it's material [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7769.34s)]
*  they can't identify. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7771.42s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7774.54s)]
*  It's weird. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7775.38s)]
*  I'm excited about it. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7776.22s)]
*  I think it's kind of interesting and I'm hopeful, [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7777.42s)]
*  but it's almost like the more information that gets released, [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7780.5s)]
*  the more I'm like, I don't know what to think. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7782.86s)]
*  I'm exactly where you are. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7785.94s)]
*  But I think more than likely that a lot of what we're seeing, [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7787.98s)]
*  a lot of these people are seeing is some sort of top secret [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7793.3s)]
*  probe with some sort of super sophisticated propulsion [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7797.3s)]
*  system that doesn't rely on a combustion engine. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7800.82s)]
*  Some completely new style of propulsion system [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7805.66s)]
*  that they've been working on. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7809.58s)]
*  They've been working on gravity propulsion system [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7810.7s)]
*  since the 1950s. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7812.9s)]
*  They've been at least theorizing these things. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7814.54s)]
*  And the possibility that someone has come up with something [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7816.74s)]
*  in a drone form that they can pilot like that [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7819.78s)]
*  makes the most sense to me because they keep spotting [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7822.9800000000005s)]
*  these things in areas where the military practices. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7826.860000000001s)]
*  They keep spotting these things off the coast of San Diego, [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7829.02s)]
*  off the East Coast where they have these restricted areas. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7831.54s)]
*  That's where they're seeing these things. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7835.54s)]
*  It just makes sense that that would be where [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7837.1s)]
*  they would practice these things. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7839.1s)]
*  But what's weird about it is that there was that famous [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7840.5s)]
*  UFO crossing incident over the northern, [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7843.740000000001s)]
*  all the states of going from I think Seattle or Washington [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7846.900000000001s)]
*  all the way to Idaho, Montana, North Dakota. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7851.02s)]
*  They were chasing the squadron of unidentified [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7852.9800000000005s)]
*  flying objects in the 50s. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7856.58s)]
*  The 50s. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7858.099999999999s)]
*  50s. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7858.94s)]
*  So that's the one thing that, [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7859.78s)]
*  because you do hear about sightings even in the 1800s, [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7860.94s)]
*  1700s, that's the weird thing. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7864.219999999999s)]
*  That's the thing where I'm like, well, if it's true. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7866.42s)]
*  But I mean, in the 50s, there's shots of it. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7869.54s)]
*  People took photographs of these squadron of glowing discs [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7871.78s)]
*  and they were going so fast that jets couldn't keep up [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7876.5s)]
*  with them so they had to scramble jets at the next base. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7879.78s)]
*  And our baseball team are called the Voyagers [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7883.5s)]
*  based off of that incident. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7887.46s)]
*  Really? [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7889.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7889.900000000001s)]
*  So I mean, in Great Falls. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7890.74s)]
*  But I don't know. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7891.7s)]
*  That's the weird thing about it. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7893.38s)]
*  I mean, I do, I agree with you. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7894.34s)]
*  I think there is some kind of propulsion system [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7895.66s)]
*  and that is able to change on a dime [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7898.18s)]
*  and doesn't necessarily get affected [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7900.860000000001s)]
*  in the way that normal. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7902.780000000001s)]
*  So there's probably multiple things going on simultaneously. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7904.46s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7906.7s)]
*  Yeah, I do not doubt that we've been visited. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7907.54s)]
*  If there is intelligent life that's capable [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7910.42s)]
*  of coming here for somewhere else, of course they would. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7913.42s)]
*  I mean, well. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7916.34s)]
*  That's the place you would go. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7917.3s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7918.54s)]
*  I mean, it seems like in a way, [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7919.38s)]
*  I just feel like the earth is kind of like a terrarium. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7920.86s)]
*  It's like, they're just like, [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7923.74s)]
*  let's do a pilot program here, throw some seeds down there, [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7925.86s)]
*  monitor it, see how it goes. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7930.14s)]
*  Certainly could be. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7932.14s)]
*  I mean, some people think the moon is a spaceship. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7933.02s)]
*  Well, those people might be dumb. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7935.86s)]
*  Well, but there is some, there's some, [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7937.3s)]
*  are you familiar with the Y files? [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7940.219999999999s)]
*  You know, those guys, that guy. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7941.86s)]
*  Y files. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7942.86s)]
*  The Y files. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7943.7s)]
*  So it's a YouTube channel. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7944.54s)]
*  This dude, he basically just recounts stories of paranormal, [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7945.66s)]
*  whether it's, you know, occult stuff, spiritual stuff, [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7952.74s)]
*  but not spiritual stuff, but it's like ghost stuff [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7956.86s)]
*  or aliens or interdimensional travel, that type of stuff. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7959.7s)]
*  And then he talks, he tells the story and kind of reenacts. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7964.259999999999s)]
*  And then at the end, he kind of debunks it [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7966.86s)]
*  or tries to debunk it, but he seems to be pretty impartial. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7968.78s)]
*  But he was talking about how like when they landed [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7972.0599999999995s)]
*  on the moon, they did, they basically did seismic tests [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7973.54s)]
*  and the reverberance, there was a reverberance [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7978.139999999999s)]
*  that would indicate that it's possibly hollow. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7981.099999999999s)]
*  And it does sound like a far-fetched thing, [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7983.82s)]
*  but there is a lot of, [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7986.0199999999995s)]
*  there's some kind of interesting things there. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7988.3s)]
*  Again, I'm not like a firm believer in it, [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7990.66s)]
*  but if you think of it in a fantastical way, [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7993.099999999999s)]
*  like what if that was a spaceship that just like, [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7995.62s)]
*  you know, they just stopped that spaceship, [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=7999.14s)]
*  did some experiments on earth or whatever [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8001.02s)]
*  and just left the spaceship there? [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8002.900000000001s)]
*  I don't know, I don't know. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8003.9400000000005s)]
*  I'm dumb. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8005.54s)]
*  Hi guys, how are you? [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8006.38s)]
*  That one seems so stupid. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8007.22s)]
*  I know, but it's fun to look into. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8009.38s)]
*  Obviously, it'll be cool to see what your crowd thinks. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8011.3s)]
*  What kind of an undertaking would be involved [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8013.54s)]
*  in creating a spaceship that's, what is it? [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8015.900000000001s)]
*  Huge. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8019.14s)]
*  A quarter of the size of the earth? [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8019.9800000000005s)]

*  as the landing site, at the landing site, [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8160.02s)]

*  known as the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Package. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8164.740000000001s)]
*  Once the astronauts were safely back in the command module, [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8168.38s)]
*  they crashed the lunar module into the earth's surface. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8171.62s)]
*  The impact was the equivalent of detonating a one-ton TNT [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8174.42s)]
*  and triggered what's known as a moonquake, [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8178.3s)]
*  the first human-made moonquake to take place. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8180.1s)]

*  which were much bigger and lasted much longer [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8187.7s)]
*  than the scientists had anticipated. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8189.94s)]

*  we're familiar with. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8194.42s)]
*  Why is the composition of the moon is different? [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8196.46s)]
*  Yeah, totally. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8198.86s)]
*  And then there's just all structures on the moon [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8200.54s)]
*  and then the Japanese, or not Chinese, [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8202.62s)]
*  that landed on the backside of the moon. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8205.18s)]
*  See, there it goes. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8207.220000000001s)]

*  That doesn't mean the moon is hollow, [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8210.86s)]

*  I mean, yes, of course. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8220.54s)]

*  Why is it annoying? [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8231.3s)]
*  Because it's too many people involved. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8232.14s)]

*  The people that were there during the launch, [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8236.14s)]
*  also the fact that we used the same way [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8238.7s)]
*  that we got to the moon with the things [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8240.94s)]
*  that we were landing on the moon now. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8242.62s)]

*  a human biological organism and having it go [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8245.98s)]

*  I mean, that's a motive. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8314.9s)]
*  That's a certainly. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8315.9s)]
*  The fact that we haven't been back since 1972 [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8316.86s)]

*  I'll entertain it a little bit, [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8358.58s)]
*  but it will be pretty, [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8360.58s)]
*  I just have a feeling that it probably will. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8362.9s)]

*  Interesting. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8373.1s)]
*  But that's healthy. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8374.26s)]
*  5%. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8375.58s)]

*  I know, well, we're supposed to, right? [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8384.9s)]
*  The next three years. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8386.54s)]
*  Four years. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8387.66s)]
*  They've always been supposed to. [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8388.5s)]
*  That's George H. Herbert Walker Bush [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8389.34s)]
*  said we were gonna go to the moon. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8391.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8393.1s)]

*  W. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8394.78s)]
*  I think Obama said we were gonna go to the moon. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8395.62s)]
*  Yeah, I guess every president has to. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8397.02s)]
*  But I mean, [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8398.58s)]
*  but my friend's friend who has an architecture company [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8399.42s)]
*  just won the bid for designing the lunar colony modules. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8406.42s)]
*  So they're starting to design on this. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8412.82s)]
*  Maybe in your lifetime, [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8416.22s)]
*  people live in the moon and then Mars. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8417.34s)]
*  Yeah, I don't care about Mars so much, [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8419.82s)]
*  but the moon makes sense. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8421.58s)]
*  But that's a lonely place. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8422.78s)]
*  Scroll back, we'll make that smaller [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8424.14s)]
*  so I can see the earth in the background. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8425.82s)]
*  That's what's wild. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8427.82s)]
*  Imagine being somewhere looking down on the earth. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8428.78s)]
*  I mean, if anybody doesn't go there and go like, [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8430.82s)]
*  wow, this planet's cool and we should save it, [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8433.9s)]

*  That's amazing. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8438.619999999999s)]
*  Right, that's the perspective, right? [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8440.18s)]
*  When you're outside of earth to look back. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8441.939999999999s)]
*  That's what all the astronauts talk about. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8443.859999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8445.3s)]
*  They go to the space station and then come back down. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8446.14s)]
*  It's like this insanely profound recognition [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8447.82s)]
*  that this is very delicate, fragile thing [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8451.3s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8456.699999999999s)]
*  And then when you're in it [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8457.539999999999s)]
*  and you're concentrating on boundaries and borders [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8458.38s)]
*  and disputes over resources and all that shit, [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8461.859999999999s)]
*  you lose perspective of the magic of what you are [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8465.66s)]
*  on this organic spaceship that's hurling through the cosmos. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8468.18s)]
*  It's so trippy to me. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8471.26s)]
*  I always trip out with my friends where I'm like, [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8473.34s)]
*  you know, we're talking about being, [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8475.46s)]

*  I love those weird contradictions, [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8486.26s)]

*  and if they enjoy it, keep selling it. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8569.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8571.7s)]
*  Fuck the health consequences. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8572.54s)]
*  I know, I know, I know. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8574.460000000001s)]
*  I'm always about, I don't want people to lose [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8576.380000000001s)]
*  all the stuff that they love just because it's healthy. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8579.86s)]
*  It's like, I just want them to realize [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8582.14s)]
*  they can have all the stuff that they love, [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8583.74s)]
*  but it can be a healthy version of it. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8585.58s)]
*  Well, sort of. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8587.5s)]
*  You're not gonna get a healthy version [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8588.539999999999s)]
*  of an ice cream sundae. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8589.779999999999s)]
*  I love an ice cream sundae. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8591.38s)]
*  I've gotten some monk fruit sweetened chocolate syrup. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8592.779999999999s)]
*  That tastes pretty good. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8595.86s)]
*  You sound like a fucking hippie. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8596.699999999999s)]
*  It's pretty good. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8597.539999999999s)]
*  Like a dirty hippie that's lying to me about. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8598.38s)]
*  Delicious with reishi and lion's mane. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8600.38s)]
*  It's like how vegan people talk about [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8602.22s)]
*  how good their fake chicken is. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8603.38s)]
*  No, that I don't agree with. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8604.66s)]
*  That I don't agree with. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8606.58s)]
*  Although I will say corn is very delicious. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8607.58s)]
*  That Q-U-O-R-N, it's made from mushrooms, [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8610.26s)]
*  like mycelium or whatever. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8612.660000000002s)]
*  That tastes good. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8614.02s)]
*  I've never heard of that. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8614.86s)]
*  Yeah, corn. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8615.68s)]
*  We were selling it, I worked in a health food store [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8616.52s)]
*  in the 90s and we would sell a ton of it [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8618.02s)]
*  and they make chicken cutlets and stuff like that [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8619.820000000002s)]
*  and you just put them in the oven. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8622.060000000001s)]
*  So it's a mushroom. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8623.18s)]
*  Yeah, it tastes really good. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8624.02s)]
*  So it's like portobello, which is delicious. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8624.86s)]
*  Kind of, yeah, but it's made from mushrooms. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8626.54s)]
*  So it's not like a mushroom, but it's like constituted. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8630.820000000002s)]
*  It's like mushroom protein or something. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8633.820000000002s)]
*  Portobello mushrooms are fucking delicious. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8635.380000000001s)]
*  I love those. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8636.7s)]
*  Portobello burger. They're so good. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8637.54s)]
*  So good. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8639.82s)]
*  Yeah, and you don't have to lie to yourself [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8640.66s)]
*  that you're eating some impossible bullshit. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8642.380000000001s)]
*  I know. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8644.02s)]
*  That's the one thing I'm not into. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8644.86s)]
*  I used to be into, I mean I still kind of am [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8646.1s)]
*  into simulation meats. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8647.82s)]
*  There's something kind of fun about it. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8649.66s)]
*  But in general, when you look at the ingredients, [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8651.78s)]
*  it's like 30 ingredients that make up this thing. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8653.58s)]
*  It's like just eat something natural. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8657.86s)]
*  Or synthesized meat, which I'm invited to a dinner [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8660.98s)]
*  for the first time. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8664.42s)]
*  They're using synthesized chicken. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8665.460000000001s)]
*  They're making a bunch of meals from, [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8667.86s)]
*  not synthesized, but bioreacted chicken, [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8669.3s)]
*  which I'm very excited about. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8672.02s)]
*  So that's chicken that was made in a laboratory. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8673.1s)]
*  Yeah, the bioreactor. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8675.9s)]
*  So it's actually chicken tissue that they've recreated. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8676.74s)]
*  Yeah, they take cell culture. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8679.3s)]
*  They only need one sample of it, [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8680.82s)]
*  and then they can just perpetuate it. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8682.14s)]
*  And then they grow it into substrates. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8684.14s)]
*  They grow it among substrates, [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8686.18s)]
*  and then create this chicken meat. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8687.42s)]
*  Right now Tyson's chicken is heavily invested [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8689.42s)]
*  in Upside Foods that makes this chicken. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8693.3s)]
*  They're the only, I think the only company [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8695.779999999999s)]
*  that's ready to go to market with it. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8698.42s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8699.26s)]
*  And they just got FDA approval. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8700.1s)]
*  I wonder how bad that stuff is for you. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8701.18s)]
*  I don't know, we're gonna have to find out. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8703.5s)]
*  But it's just chicken cells, so I don't know. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8704.78s)]
*  Yeah, I've seen when they do 3D printing steaks. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8708.220000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, I've heard of that. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8711.26s)]
*  3D printing with fat as well. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8712.1s)]
*  They put the fat in there and marble it, [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8713.740000000002s)]
*  and it kind of looks like a steak. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8715.5s)]
*  I would love to try that. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8717.62s)]
*  I'm into that. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8719.18s)]
*  That I'm into. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8720.5s)]
*  I asked Moby once, I was like, [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8721.460000000001s)]
*  if they made synthesized meat or bioreacted meat, [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8722.78s)]
*  would you eat it? [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8726.3s)]
*  And he was like, yes. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8727.14s)]
*  He was like immediately. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8728.42s)]
*  And I was like, I get it, [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8729.259999999998s)]
*  because it promotes another alternative [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8730.74s)]
*  to actually just raising a bunch of cattle [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8733.14s)]
*  and all the resources it takes. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8735.3s)]
*  And also ethical as well. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8738.06s)]
*  But I don't know. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8739.82s)]
*  I like that kind of stuff, [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8742.5s)]
*  because I like to pretend I'm an astronaut. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8743.46s)]
*  Eat paste. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8745.82s)]
*  Yeah, if I could get all my calories [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8746.9s)]
*  in a little paste thing, believe me, [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8749.859999999999s)]
*  I'd be the first one to do it. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8751.38s)]
*  And it was healthy and it actually worked. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8752.34s)]
*  I'm down. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8754.22s)]
*  Because you like food. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8755.22s)]
*  I do love food. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8756.9s)]
*  Don't you like sitting down for a meal? [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8757.74s)]
*  It's the smells and the way it looks. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8759.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8762.46s)]
*  And the chef prepared it. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8763.3s)]
*  Yeah, but sometimes my addiction to food, [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8764.18s)]
*  it actually does the opposite. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8767.26s)]
*  Yes, 100%. [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8768.9s)]
*  I love it, but sometimes. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8769.939999999999s)]
*  Explain your addiction to food. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8771.5s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8773.019999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean, I have, I don't know. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8774.1s)]
*  It's like I've been, [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8778.019999999999s)]
*  my weight fluctuates all throughout my life. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8779.619999999999s)]
*  I've been probably a chubbier guy most of my life, [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8781.5s)]
*  but I never liked it. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8785.779999999999s)]
*  But there would be moments where I'd go like, [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8787.259999999998s)]
*  fuck this, I'm changing my diet. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8789.419999999998s)]
*  I'm gonna exercise. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8791.699999999999s)]
*  Like once in high school, [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8792.539999999999s)]
*  I got really thin in high school. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8793.38s)]
*  I got really in shape in my later 20s. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8794.9s)]
*  And then I did it again when I first moved to LA. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8797.58s)]
*  But sometimes my food, [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8801.5s)]
*  like I just go on these binges. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8802.619999999999s)]
*  You know, like I'll be late at night, [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8804.5s)]
*  watching a movie and I'm like, [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8806.46s)]
*  you know what, I didn't eat dinner, [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8807.699999999999s)]
*  so fuck it. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8809.66s)]
*  Oh, there's that new burger place. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8810.78s)]
*  I'll just get Uber Eats. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8812.1s)]
*  Oh, they have two burgers that are really interesting. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8813.380000000001s)]
*  Or maybe I'll get both of them [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8815.26s)]
*  and I'll just save half or whatever. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8816.26s)]
*  And then I just eat all the burgers [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8817.62s)]
*  and I feel terrible. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8819.980000000001s)]
*  And that will happen a lot. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8821.820000000002s)]
*  Or I'll go, oh, this is a healthy cereal. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8824.060000000001s)]
*  So I'm gonna have this healthy cereal [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8826.62s)]
*  and I'm gonna use flax milk and all that. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8828.300000000001s)]
*  And then I eat the entire box of cereal. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8829.7s)]
*  I can't, I just, once I get going, [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8831.54s)]
*  it's hard for me to stop. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8835.26s)]
*  And then when I like, do you wanna go out to dinner? [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8836.66s)]
*  But I'm trying to watch my diet. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8839.34s)]
*  I don't know how to go out to dinner and not order. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8840.86s)]
*  I get this weird anxiety about it. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8843.3s)]
*  But now that I'm doing the keto thing, [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8845.54s)]
*  it's much easier, [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8846.74s)]
*  because I can go like, I can have cheese. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8847.58s)]
*  How long have you been doing the keto thing? [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8849.3s)]
*  For like three months or something like that. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8850.74s)]
*  Have you lost weight? [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8852.74s)]
*  I have lost a little weight, yeah. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8853.58s)]
*  I've lost a little weight [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8855.02s)]
*  and I haven't really been exercising that hard, [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8855.98s)]
*  just getting like 7,000 steps a day or whatever. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8858.26s)]
*  But a lot of it's diet and it's like, [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8861.18s)]
*  once you get that sugar out of it, [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8864.18s)]
*  and I've also been taking this stuff called, [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8865.3s)]
*  I think it's called Super Gut or something like that, [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8867.3s)]
*  it's like this powder that you add to a drink [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8869.380000000001s)]
*  and it aids your gut myome, whatever. [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8872.34s)]
*  I think the combination of the two things that I'm doing, [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8876.06s)]
*  I'm feeling like I'm a little bit more in control [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8878.460000000001s)]
*  of my appetite and that feels good. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8880.34s)]
*  Because then if I do go off one day a week, [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8883.380000000001s)]
*  I feel fine. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8887.86s)]
*  I was at Sarah's party and she had like some sick pizza [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8888.94s)]
*  and I was like, ah, screw it, I'm just gonna go for it. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8891.62s)]
*  But I also danced for two and a half hours as well, [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8893.9s)]
*  so I felt like it all balanced out. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8896.78s)]
*  Do you find that when you're on keto, [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8899.5s)]
*  your appetite is much more suppressed [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8901.220000000001s)]
*  because your body's able to burn fat? [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8903.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah, big difference. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8904.660000000002s)]
*  Also, you have to eat so much protein [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8906.740000000002s)]
*  to supplement the loss of other things. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8909.220000000001s)]
*  That is a high satiety. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8911.380000000001s)]
*  So in the morning I usually do, [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8915.060000000001s)]
*  I have a lot of really great whey proteins [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8916.42s)]
*  that I take with me or I even have a hit of it [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8918.900000000001s)]
*  that I carry with me so if I get hungry, [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8921.58s)]
*  instead of going, ah, I'm gonna get the thing, [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8923.740000000002s)]
*  I'll just pour some protein and that always, [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8925.820000000002s)]
*  usually makes me feel full. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8927.82s)]
*  That's cool. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8929.86s)]
*  And fiber powder, that kind of stuff. [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8930.699999999999s)]
*  I don't know, I have a problem. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8932.58s)]
*  It's the only thing in my life that I feel like, [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8934.18s)]
*  that and scrolling. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8935.779999999999s)]
*  I have an addiction to news. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8938.42s)]
*  I'll just be like news, news, news, news, news, news. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8939.82s)]
*  I'm trying to wean myself off of that addiction. [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8942.5s)]
*  That addiction's a real problem. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8945.02s)]
*  I need it gone, I really do, [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8946.3s)]
*  because if I checked in maybe once a week, I'd be fine. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8948.02s)]
*  My new phone doesn't have any apps on it. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8952.5s)]
*  Really? [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8954.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8955.3s)]
*  Oh, sick. [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8956.14s)]
*  My idea is keep my old number and use it for social media [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8957.02s)]
*  when I need to do stuff. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8959.46s)]
*  And then with the new one, nothing on it. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8960.939999999999s)]
*  That's a cool idea. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8963.74s)]
*  I know, it's tough. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8965.5s)]
*  I mean, I rely on social media for posting. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8966.66s)]
*  Right, but the problem is if it's on the phone [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8969.14s)]
*  that I use all the time, I'm just too tempted. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8971.5s)]
*  Yeah, I get it. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8974.06s)]
*  Yeah, it's, man, it's tough. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8976.14s)]
*  Those two things. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8979.26s)]
*  And then I'm addicted to driving, but that's an okay addiction. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8980.9s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good addiction. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8983.26s)]
*  That I love, that I'm like, oh. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8984.619999999999s)]
*  That's the thing, is finding something that's addictive [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8986.34s)]
*  that's actually beneficial in some way, [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8988.619999999999s)]
*  rewarding in some way, not a food. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8990.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8993.38s)]
*  The food thing. [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8994.22s)]
*  Well, food is, it's reward, this problem is, [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8995.06s)]
*  it's very pleasurable. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8996.82s)]
*  Yes, I know. [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=8998.5s)]
*  I mean, I don't mind for a holiday, [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9000.179999999998s)]
*  Thanksgiving, I'll get excited about, [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9001.539999999999s)]
*  oh, I'm just gonna have some turkey [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9003.619999999999s)]
*  and some fucking gravy and some cranberry sauce, whatever. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9005.06s)]
*  I can get excited about a holiday meal, [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9008.5s)]
*  but my everyday day-to-day meal stuff, [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9010.14s)]
*  that's the part where I'm like, [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9014.259999999998s)]
*  I need to get into a mindset [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9015.460000000001s)]
*  where I know this is gonna be great for me [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9016.98s)]
*  and I'm gonna feel good, and I made a good decision. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9019.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9022.14s)]
*  And that's all, that can be really hard [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9022.98s)]
*  when you get that sugar talking to you and all those carbs. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9025.460000000001s)]
*  I mean, last night I got a charcuterie board for, [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9027.98s)]
*  at night, because I didn't eat dinner. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9031.18s)]
*  I had the cheese and the meat, [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9034.18s)]
*  and there was this basket of bread, [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9035.9s)]
*  and I just smelled it and I just took one bite of it, [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9037.66s)]
*  and I was like, okay, that's it. [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9040.66s)]
*  But I felt okay about it. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9042.66s)]
*  That's good. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9043.7s)]
*  I didn't feel like I was being an asshole to myself. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9044.580000000002s)]
*  Yeah, or when I was playing games. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9046.140000000001s)]
*  But I was like, okay, yeah, okay, a little bit, great. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9047.460000000001s)]
*  Back to the other stuff, and I made it. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9050.900000000001s)]
*  Every time I do that, I'm like, oh, you made it. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9053.580000000002s)]
*  Good job, man. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9055.460000000001s)]
*  It's like a game that I have to play with myself. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9056.7s)]
*  Well, you literally are what you eat. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9058.62s)]
*  If you eat a lot of shit, your body turns into shit. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9060.580000000002s)]
*  Yeah, especially as you get older. [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9062.7s)]
*  Oh, yeah, baby. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9064.1s)]
*  I mean, you're in your 40s now. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9065.5s)]
*  I'm getting there. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9067.54s)]
*  I'm in my 50s. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9068.460000000001s)]
*  I'm in my 50s, I'm about 51. [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9069.7s)]
*  But yeah, and I just noticed that shit, [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9072.380000000001s)]
*  the inflammation thing's really the biggest thing for me. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9074.619999999999s)]
*  I'm like, that's the reward if there's anything, [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9077.019999999999s)]
*  because getting up in the morning and going, [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9079.34s)]
*  uh, you know, or sitting down and going, [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9081.18s)]
*  ah, you know, every time. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9083.019999999999s)]
*  So many people are inflamed. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9084.859999999999s)]
*  So many people are walking around, [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9086.859999999999s)]
*  and they just don't understand that that's, [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9088.22s)]
*  a lot of it is your food. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9089.859999999999s)]
*  I mean, the American diet is just so poor. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9091.42s)]
*  There's some insane number, like 40% of us are obese, [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9093.42s)]
*  maybe more. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9096.82s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9098.9s)]
*  The processed foods, the fucking sedentary lifestyle. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9099.859999999999s)]
*  I love when you see those old pictures from like 1970s. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9104.42s)]
*  I know. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9106.58s)]

*  be the ones who regulate them is infuriating to me. [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9486.74s)]
*  I agree with that. [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9489.58s)]
*  Because all the people that tell you that psychedelics [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9490.42s)]
*  should be illegal are not doing psychedelics. [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9492.26s)]

*  I mean, it's like psychedelics have been part [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9602.18s)]
*  of our culture since human consciousness existence forever. [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9603.78s)]
*  And there's a reason for it. [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9607.58s)]
*  And the reason for it is because it gets us, [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9609.060000000001s)]
*  to me it's about creating options. [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9611.7s)]
*  It's like when you end literally sometimes neural pathways, [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9613.54s)]
*  new neurons or at least new neural pathways are generated. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9616.42s)]
*  But it's about like knowing, [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9620.74s)]
*  cause when you're trapped in either a trauma or something, [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9621.82s)]
*  you're essentially in a really tight loop [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9625.300000000001s)]
*  that you can't see any other way of existing. [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9627.22s)]
*  And when you have a psychedelic, it's like you zoom out [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9630.66s)]
*  and you're like, oh shit, there's all this other terrain. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9633.539999999999s)]
*  And then you can start to heal. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9636.099999999999s)]
*  But I think like, when I went to the MAPS convention, [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9638.939999999999s)]
*  I mean, Eric Andre did a MAPS show with flaming lips. [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9642.019999999999s)]
*  But I also spoke on a panel about psychedelics in film. [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9648.179999999998s)]
*  And I'm just like, it's such a huge proponent of it. [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9652.179999999998s)]
*  And the fact that it's being taken seriously [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9655.460000000001s)]
*  and they're doing peer reviewed papers and research [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9657.58s)]
*  and there's more research being done on it. [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9659.62s)]
*  I love it. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9661.86s)]
*  I think it's one of the things [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9662.7s)]
*  that could possibly save humanity. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9663.52s)]
*  Yes, it sounds so crazy to say, but I think you're right. [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9665.26s)]
*  And I agree 100%. [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9668.38s)]
*  I think perspective enhancing things can save people's lives [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9670.66s)]
*  and they can save the way people view the world. [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9674.58s)]
*  They could change the way people view the world, [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9676.62s)]
*  which could help us all. [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9678.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah, please, come on guys. [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9679.66s)]
*  Let's beam ourselves up. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9683.26s)]
*  Again, not for everybody. [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9684.3s)]
*  Not for people with like severe mental issues, [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9685.82s)]
*  schizophrenia, people that have a hard time [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9689.5s)]
*  with regular reality. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9691.779999999999s)]
*  No, they shouldn't be on it. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9692.82s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9693.939999999999s)]
*  That's just like everything. [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9694.779999999999s)]
*  There's some people that shouldn't drink. [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9696.019999999999s)]
*  There's some people that shouldn't smoke weed. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9697.179999999998s)]
*  Smoking weed is the one thing that I talk about [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9700.019999999999s)]
*  all the time because there are people that have [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9701.98s)]
*  like real problems when they smoke too much weed [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9704.9s)]
*  and they go crazy. [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9707.5s)]
*  And I've seen it. [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9708.699999999999s)]
*  I know people. [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9710.099999999999s)]
*  I've seen it too and it's like I've had to learn [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9711.86s)]
*  how to be a lot more compassionate about it [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9714.34s)]
*  because sometimes I'm like, no, they're just faking it. [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9715.900000000001s)]
*  Or they're being, and I'm like, no, that's real [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9718.140000000001s)]
*  and you have to have much more sympathy for that. [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9720.5s)]
*  The biological variability amongst human beings [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9722.82s)]
*  is very wide and there's some people [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9725.74s)]
*  that just cannot handle a lot of different things [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9727.980000000001s)]
*  and it's not their fault. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9730.1s)]
*  It's literally who they are and we're all different. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9730.980000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9734.060000000001s)]
*  I just want us to get some perspective [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9735.02s)]
*  and kind of realize like, oh man, [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9737.78s)]
*  we could be doing some pretty amazing shit [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9739.78s)]
*  at all times if we want to. [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9741.5s)]
*  We don't have to always be like, oh, this sucks. [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9743.22s)]
*  The full, I'm pessimistic all the time. [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9746.5s)]
*  You're like, come on, man. [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9749.06s)]
*  It's like you got all this time. [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9750.34s)]
*  I swear to God, when you get older, [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9751.539999999999s)]
*  you're gonna think back about all that time [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9753.18s)]
*  that you were wasting. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9754.699999999999s)]
*  Yeah, just complaining, feeling like shit. [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9755.619999999999s)]
*  Yeah, complaining. [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9757.42s)]
*  It's like, man, get into the solution, man. [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9758.46s)]
*  Like the solutions are fun. [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9761.98s)]
*  Get into the solution. [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9763.86s)]
*  That's your next book. [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9765.3s)]
*  Yeah, that's Reggie Watts, Getting into the Solution. [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9766.18s)]
*  But I'll be in a black turtleneck. [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9768.54s)]
*  How long are you in town for? [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9770.86s)]
*  I'm here, I'm doing your club this weekend. [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9772.18s)]
*  So I'm doing five dates at your club. [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9773.900000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, when this comes out, maybe that doesn't. [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9776.26s)]
*  But yeah, so I'm doing five dates. [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9777.740000000002s)]
*  Have you been doing clubs a lot? [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9780.300000000001s)]
*  You mean like formal comedy clubs? [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9782.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9783.7s)]
*  Throughout my career, not as much. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9785.580000000002s)]
*  I'd say probably about like 5% of the places. [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9787.140000000001s)]
*  You're gonna love the mothership. [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9789.1s)]
*  Oh, I went that one day. [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9790.380000000001s)]
*  I know, but I mean to perform. [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9791.34s)]
*  Oh, perform, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9792.300000000001s)]
*  It's great. [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9793.140000000001s)]
*  I mean, I always tell people, I say like, [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9793.980000000001s)]
*  it's the comedy club because it is, [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9795.980000000001s)]
*  but it is a comedy club that if a comedian wanted to design [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9797.78s)]
*  the perfect comedy club, [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9802.220000000001s)]
*  that's the comedy club that you would make. [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9804.060000000001s)]
*  And that's exactly what it is. [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9805.78s)]
*  But it's just got the greatest vibe. [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9807.86s)]
*  I love that there's an independent viewing box [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9809.86s)]
*  for just the comedians, so they can watch the show. [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9812.74s)]
*  Because my thing is like, [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9815.74s)]
*  I hate fucking being backstage. [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9816.58s)]
*  Chatting's fine, getting to know people is great. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9818.42s)]
*  But I also like to watch the show. [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9820.54s)]
*  Well, the fact that it's attached to the green room [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9822.1s)]
*  was the ultimate. [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9823.94s)]
*  That's what I love. [[02:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9824.78s)]
*  I designed it and that was a projection room. [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9825.640000000001s)]
*  And I said, what if we had this as our green room [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9828.08s)]
*  instead of the green room being backstage? [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9831.6s)]
*  And then you just look down from these balconies. [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9833.36s)]
*  Love it. [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9836.28s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9837.12s)]
*  It's so good. [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9837.94s)]
*  And the projection room was the perfect size. [[02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9838.78s)]
*  It was perfect. [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9840.640000000001s)]
*  When we opened it up and we removed all the equipment, [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9841.6s)]
*  it was a beautiful labor of love. [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9845.800000000001s)]
*  It really was. [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9848.16s)]
*  And it's so fun to be there now and to have it work so, [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9849.0s)]
*  and have it be received so well by my peers, comedians. [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9852.64s)]
*  When they come there and go, [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9857.64s)]
*  oh my God, this is like, you built the place. [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9858.48s)]
*  You built the place for us. [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9860.76s)]
*  Okay, it's for you, it's for us. [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9862.279999999999s)]
*  It's for the art form. [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9863.56s)]
*  It really is for the, I designed it and built it, [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9864.64s)]
*  or I had someone help me design it or other, [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9867.56s)]
*  but built it exactly for comedy. [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9869.3s)]
*  I didn't build it as a money-making venture. [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9873.359999999999s)]
*  My goal was to break even. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9875.64s)]
*  It'd be great if I could break even in this place. [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9877.519999999999s)]
*  I just don't wanna lose money. [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9879.24s)]
*  I don't want it to be something [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9880.68s)]
*  that I'm pouring money into every year. [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9881.52s)]
*  And I'm like, oh my God, I gotta get rid of the club. [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9882.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah, da, da, da, da. [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9884.68s)]
*  I want it to be able to make money so it's not a strain, [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9885.52s)]
*  but also help the community. [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9888.48s)]
*  And the fact that we have this very strong program [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9890.2s)]
*  for up-and-coming comedians. [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9893.54s)]
*  We have two nights of open mic nights. [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9895.04s)]

*  for that job with their act. [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9901.68s)]
*  Ah. [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9903.48s)]
*  And they all get spots and they get showcase spots [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9904.32s)]
*  and they get a chance to perform. [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9906.84s)]
*  And then they get a chance to see some of the best comics [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9908.380000000001s)]
*  in the world come through. [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9910.92s)]
*  Man, it's dope. [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9912.08s)]
*  I tell people that all the time. [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9913.7s)]
*  I'm like, that's where you wanna go. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9914.88s)]
*  If you go to Austin and you get the chance and you can, [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9916.12s)]
*  you definitely gotta go there. [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9918.6s)]
*  Because I mean, I just saw some comedy [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9919.76s)]
*  and I was hanging out in the green room, [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9921.6s)]
*  but I was just like, this is dope, man. [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9922.92s)]
*  This is the type of vibe I would create for a club. [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9925.52s)]
*  And the sight lines are great. [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9929.08s)]
*  Everything about it is like, it's great for the audience [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9930.8s)]
*  and great for the performer. [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9933.24s)]
*  Yeah, we spent a lot of time. [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9934.16s)]
*  Spent a lot of time thinking about it. [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9935.64s)]
*  And then Louis C.K. came in and gave me a lot of great tips. [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9937.56s)]
*  Yeah, he told me to lower the ceiling in the small room, [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9940.76s)]
*  make the stage smaller in the small room, [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9943.76s)]
*  and then the big room, lower the ceiling even further. [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9946.4s)]
*  And you know, it used to be a movie theater, [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9949.32s)]
*  so it was like stadium seating. [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9950.84s)]
*  So we raised the floor. [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9952.44s)]
*  I see. [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9954.32s)]
*  And so now it's all one level. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9955.16s)]
*  So that's how we got it to the point [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9957.04s)]
*  where it's the way it is right now. [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9958.4s)]
*  And that gave you room for the thing downstairs. [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9959.640000000001s)]
*  Yes, it gave us the tunnel and it's fucking dope. [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9961.44s)]
*  That's cool. [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9964.800000000001s)]
*  Being able to come in through the alley is great. [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9965.640000000001s)]
*  Alley loaded, I mean, come on, man. [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9967.44s)]
*  And the place is filled with cops. [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9968.92s)]
*  It's like super secure. [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcxHM9gxQoA&t=9970.68s)]
